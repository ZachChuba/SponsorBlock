This episode of Minute Physics is
supported by audible.com, the leading provider of audio books
across all types of literature including fiction and non-fiction
and periodicals. To learn more about how to
foil evil plots, I highly recommend "The Fellowship Of The Ring"
by J.R.R. Tolkien. You can download this audio book,
or another of your choice, for free at audible.com/minutephysics.
Again, thanks to Audible for making it possible for me to
keep producing Minute Physics,
