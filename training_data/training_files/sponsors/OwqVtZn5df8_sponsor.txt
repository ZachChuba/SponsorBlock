I reached out to Skillshare
to sponsor this video. Because Skillshare is one of the sites that I've used over the years to learn and refine my visual storytelling skills. Skillshare is like this giant
repository of tutorials. It's like 10 bucks a
month, and you get access to like 25,000 tutorials. If you wanna learn animation
like I did in 2012, there are tons, tons of
tutorials on the site that will teach you all
different aspects of animation. There's one specifically
called animated infographics and data visualization
which was kind of the style that I was doing in that, in 2012. It's really good, like quality teaching. So, if you're kind of in a place right now where you want to learn something new, whether it's animation or
a million other skills, Skillshare has got like
tons of different topics. Then go click the link, and if you are one of the first 500, you will
get two months for free. Meaning, you don't have to pay. And then after that it's 10 bucks a month. Go start learning stuff.
