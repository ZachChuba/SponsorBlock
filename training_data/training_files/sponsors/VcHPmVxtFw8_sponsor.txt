I’d like to thank Curiositystream for sponsoring
this video. Basically, Curiositystream is a really cool streaming
site that’s full of thousands of documentaries and other nonfiction, including
some original content featuring people like Stephen Hawking and David Attenborough. It includes material on a ton of topics, like
science, art, and history. As I’m sure you guys can tell, I’m really
into learning and teaching about various social issues in ways that are fun and interesting,
so I’ve been really into the series Stories of Impact lately. It’s these seven documentaries that talk
about different people’s life experiences, from a group of young South African radio
reporters to a story about top universities trying to find intelligent young people around
the world who wouldn’t typically have access to education. There’s some really interesting stuff there,
and you can watch the whole series and thousands of other documentaries for just $2.99 a month. Not only that, but if you go to curiositystream
dot com slash sarahZ and use the code Sarah Z during signup, your first 31 days are completely
free! Curiositystream has also teamed up with the
streaming service Nebula. Basically, Nebula is a collaborative effort between me
and tons of other independent content creators who make educational videos, like CGP Grey and
Minute Physics. It also has a bunch of Nebula Originals, so
you can watch content by creators you love that you can’t get anywhere else. Supporting Nebula supports me and the educational
content creator community in general. Not only that, but if you get a year’s subscription
to Curiositystream, it now also comes with a subscription to Nebula! That’s basically twice the educational content
for one subscription, and it’s wonderful.
