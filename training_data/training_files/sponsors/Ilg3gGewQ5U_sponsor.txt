And this actually transitions really nicely to today's extremely relevant sponsor - CrowdFlower, which is a software platform where data scientists and machine learning teams can create training data. They allow you to upload text or audio or image data, and have it annotated by real people. You may have heard of the human-in-the-loop approach before, and this is essentially what we're talking about here: “leveraging human intelligence to train machine intelligence”. They employ a whole bunch of pretty smart quality control mechanisms to keep the data clean and accurate, and they've helped to train test and tune thousands of data and AI projects. And what's most fun, there's actually a free t-shirt in this for you guys. If you go to 3b1b.co/crowdflower, or follow the link on screen and in the description, you can create a free account and run a project, and they'll send you a free shirt once you've done the job. And the shirt it's actually pretty cool, I quite like it. So thanks to CrowdFlower for supporting this video,
