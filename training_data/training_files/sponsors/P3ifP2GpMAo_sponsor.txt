about ok one of my previous videos some of you guys asked me about the divisibility rule so I'm going to show you guys more about this right here on boolean to work first off I want to thank them for spotting this video and also wanted to show you guys about their new feature called daily challenges and they happen to have this question for today what's the remainder when you have 1 1 1 1 1 1 divided by 3 hmm I think the answer is 0 yeah I'm going to submit that and I got it correct of course because I know the secret and if you guys want to know more about a secret of course you have to go check out the students and maybe I'll do the video right here for you guys as well but the interesting thing is that I think many of you guys know about the defensibility rule for numbers three but how about the other ones if you would like to know more you guys can't go check it out this right here right for the creases so if you have about like five ten minutes per day you can just pull this out and then you can continue your learning right while you are just enjoying your coffee and all that and I think it's really really cool and maybe - another one for you guys to just show off this right here it's actually not divisible by three and I got the correct of course and they also offer a lot of interesting courses so if you want to sign up for your annual premium subscription if you guys use the link brilliant artwork slash black pin repent because this way you guys can get 20% off discount and
