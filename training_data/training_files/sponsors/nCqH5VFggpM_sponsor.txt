And speaking of dedicated creators, you can learn from tons of them via our sponsor for this episode, Skillshare, Where you can join classes and communities that are just right for you. For instance, a bunch of us at EC are writers, so I've been checking out Skillshare's creative writing courses, such as Writing for Self-Discovery by Yasmine Cheyenne that taught me some relaxing brain-dumping exercises, and, also, Writing Suspense by Ben Percy, where I learned all about story math and the turnstile of mysteries (woooh~). Not to mention, Skillshare is also super affordable when compared to in-person courses and an annual subscription begins at less than $10 a month, but if you sign up with the link in the description below, you'll get a two-month free trial that can help you create content that thrives.
