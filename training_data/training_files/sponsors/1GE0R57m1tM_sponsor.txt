good for broly but what is looking good is the deal from today's sponsor nordvpn this service is something i hugely rely on in regards to my privacy online especially since i'm now going traveling around the uk and america for the next couple of months also if you're going to anime expo this year in la i'm going to be there with the tfs crew i need to be protected and nords got my back thankfully by offering me thousands of servers in europe asia america and africa to shield my personal information these servers from over 60 countries keep me safe thanks to the inclusion of military-grade encryption technology and an easy to use interface that looks just about as good as the new broly movie did am i right nordvpn's crowning feature is that you don't need to be an expert in internet security to use it within a couple of seconds and a couple of taps you're good to go and if you go to nordvpn.com you're able to get a three-year plan that's right three years you heard me right for just 2.99 a month and on top of that if you then enter the code masterco as well at checkout you get a bonus month of use for free so give nor vpn a go by visiting nordvpn.com massacre and use the code masako for that free month and ready yourself for a summer of fun safe from snooping eyes but all lies
