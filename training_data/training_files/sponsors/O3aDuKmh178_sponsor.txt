so a lot of people were asking how I put together that kind of retro 80s 70s intro sequence on my dynamic range video and the answer is the same as the way I put together my video essays which is another question I often get asked and that is using After Effects now I learn After Effects over a number of years kind of scrabbling together bits of different YouTube videos and it was very very difficult because sometimes you open something and it stops talking about code and you don't understand what it's going on about you need to know something before well I wish I had at the time was something like you get on Skillshare which is the sponsor of this video and that is a series of professional lessons in a structured format it would have saved me so much time and a lot of searching for terms try not ask people like what certain things men and trying to find out work out for myself a skill share is an online learning resource with over 25,000 courses and it's set up for creators and there are lessons from graphic design to photography to business to cooking it's really great resource so the full subscription cost less than $10 a month but I'm going to put a link below this video and the first 500 people who click it will be able to get their first two months absolutely free so I already do encourage you to go and check it out just go and have a look at it and just see what they've got to offer because it is a really useful resource it's something I wish I'd have had earlier
