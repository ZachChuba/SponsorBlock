HD 6xx headphones are one of my favorites and they're one of math drops all-time bestsellers with over 60,000 units sold they haven't changed the drivers or the sound structure compared to the HD 650 so you get a nice balanced mid-range and natural sounding bass but they did make one meaningful change going from a ten-foot cable down to a detachable 6 foot cable based on community feedback it's got a 1/8 inch plug that's versatile for everyday use and it comes with a quarter inch adapter as well as Sennheiser's long-term support so don't miss out click the link
