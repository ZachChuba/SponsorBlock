for sponsoring this video and let me tell you my best skills share because it's something you may find beneficial because it's an online learning community specifically for creators they have over 25,000 classes ranging from photography to software tutorials to business and marketing and lots more some of the courses are straight up technical but some venture more into artistic craft like this course on street photography we're taken through the stages of making Street photos from conceptualizing and planning the shots right up to how the files relative what's also good with this course is that you're given project assignments to do but you're learning into practice now I'm a big advocate of that as there's no better way to learn than by actually doing something an annual subscription to Skillshare is less than ten dollars a month but I'll put a link below this video that will give anyone who clicks it the two months free trial so if you want to join the 7 million users already signed up and learn skills you're curious about or maybe learn things that will help further your career then hop over to skill share calm by clicking the link below this video and check it out I'll see you next time peace out Girl Scouts
