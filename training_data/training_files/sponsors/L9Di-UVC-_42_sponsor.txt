If you want people to know where you are,
and how they can hire you, the best way to do so is with a personal website through Wix. So, I just re-did the HAI website with Wix
and despite being only a few biological steps away from a monkey I managed to make this
which I think looks pretty good. Wix makes it super easy to build a website. You can have them make it for you with their
artificial design intelligence, build your own with one of their 500 designer-made templates,
or if you want to get really fancy you can even code in your own modifications. Summed up, Wix is crazy simple but crazy customizable
so you can build exactly what you want easily. Best of all, you can start building your website
today for free at wix.com/go/HAI.
