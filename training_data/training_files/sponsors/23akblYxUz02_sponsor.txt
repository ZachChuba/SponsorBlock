Hi, guys, this is Alani, and today I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places
to watch movies, MUBI. MUBI is a treasure trove
of films from around the globe. Every day, a new film is added
and an oldest is taken away, so in this world where it's very easy to spend hours debating
what you should watch, MUBI is like having a really cool friend
with amazing taste in movies, making it so much easier for you. They feature
hard to come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings, influential arthouse and foreign films, lesser known films
by your favorite famous directors, and more. Plus you can even download
the films to watch offline and there are no ads, ever. One movie you can check out
right now on MUBI is The Loneliest Planet, starring Gael Garc√≠a Bernal. It's the story of a young couple
on a backpacking trip who are forced to reevaluate
their relationship after an unexpected incident. We can't recommend MUBI highly enough. You can try it out for free
for a whole month, just click the link
in the description below.
