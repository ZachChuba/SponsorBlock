Assassins Creed Origins comes out the day
after this video goes out and it’s a pretty awesome game because they’ve completely
and accurately recreated the entirety of Ptolemaic Egypt so that you can kill pe… I mean learn things. I had a conversation with their dev team and
it’s clear to me how much pride they take in the historical accuracy. They’re even releasing a special game-mode
called “Discovery Tour” which essentially turns the game into an interactive museum
in ancient Egypt. So, if you like history and seeming smart
and video games and learning things and me, make sure to check out the game with the link
in the description.
