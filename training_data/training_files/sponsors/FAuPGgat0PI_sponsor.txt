Are you tired of flailing around like a lost child, not knowing which coffee to pick? Well Trade Coffee solves that problem by matching you with some of the nation's top roasters, by having you take this little quiz. You tell them how you like your coffee, whether you make a pour-over, expresso, power stone crushed, or some other way and a few other questions and then their magical algorithm picks the best coffee for you. Then they deliver it to your door, fresh from the roaster. Then you rate that coffee, and repeat to get even better coffee next time. Unless you've found the one true coffee to rule them all. In which case go ahead and order more of that, I don't think they're going to stop you. Click on the link below to get 30% off your first bag when you sign up, which includes free shipping.
