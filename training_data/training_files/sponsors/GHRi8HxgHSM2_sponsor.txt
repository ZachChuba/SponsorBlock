I just want to say thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video once again usually I show you guys screenshots of my actual website or like the front end of the website but this time since I'm gonna upload all of the drawings for my blog I thought I'd show you the process of doing that after I sort out what the images was really like a few click so if you want to try squarespace for two weeks for free and get a 10% discount with your first purchase go to squarespace.com slash
