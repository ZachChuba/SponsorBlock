As you know, I'm working with my dad on a project to publish his articles online. He writes these really interesting articles about science And the nature of knowledge and things like that. I really want people to be able to read them So we're putting them online and we're using Squarespace to do it I met with my dad last week and I showed him the interface. I showed him what the website is going to look like He's really happy with it because it looks great I mean you know the templates look really good and you can personalize them and stuff like that and He picked up the interface straight away because it's really easy to use Other things you should know about Squarespace there's never anything to upgrade or Patch or install or anything like that. It's just it's a complete system and it just works. It's an e-commerce platform You can sell stuff if that's what you're thinking of doing You can get your domain name through Squarespace as well and importantly if you do that you own the domain name So it's not like a lock in or anything like that so we'll be doing that when the time comes it's It's going to be a couple of weeks because we're going to sort of pump all the text into into the articles And the images as well. My dad wants to tweak the images a little bit and make them really nice Because at the moment their just Word documents that he knocked up and then we'll go live. It's exciting anyway You should go to squarespace.com today for your free trial and then when you're ready to launch your project go to Squarespace.com/stevemould
