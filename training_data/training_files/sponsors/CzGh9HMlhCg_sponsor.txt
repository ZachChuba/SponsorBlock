Welcome back guardians, before starting, this
video is sponsored by Shudder. Sponsorships really help me out, especially
when Destiny is a bit low, so please let me tell you about Shudder. Shudder is a streaming video service from
AMC networks, and was built for super fans of thrillers, suspense and horror. I am not a huge horror fan, but I can definitely
get behind a good thriller. And being Australian, I am keen to check out
the Shudder Original, the Dead Lands, which is about the Maori tribe of New Zealand. There are a bunch of categories you can choose
from if you join Shudder, which has the largest and fastest growing human curated selections
of thrilling entertainment. For 5.99 per month, or 56.99 per year, you
will have unlimited access to stream ad-free on your favorite devices, such as ios, android,
google chromcast. You can try Shudder for free for 30 days,
at shudder.com and use the code “myelin”
