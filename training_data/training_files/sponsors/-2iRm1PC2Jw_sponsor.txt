But first, I want to give a quick shout out to the sponsor of today's video, Skillshare. Skillshare is a website with over 25,000 different classes, on the subjects of business, design, illustration, animation and more. I've been using it to try to learn more about animation and After Effects. Because After Effects is a program, I have had a very tumultuous relationship with, ever since art school. And this class has just made it so much more accessible and just a lot easier to approach. If learning a new skill is part of your new year's resolutions, I highly recommend to trying it out. You can get 2 months for free, if you're one of the first 500 people to click the link in the description. And if you want to continue on after 2 months, you can get the Premium Membership for less than $10 a month, if you choose their annual plan. Thank you so much to Skillshare for the continued support.
