If you become the next Pope and decide to
extend the rail line to two or maybe even three stations there are a lot of things you’re
going to need to learn like which bank angle to use so that trains can go around curves
without derailing, how much to adjust timetables to account for slower running during repair
work, and how to open the Vatican’s secret underworld housing the real Slim Shady. Luckily, you can learn two of those three
things in brilliant.org's classical mechanics course. This course, like all Brilliant courses, makes
learning complex topics simple by first breaking concepts down into their intuitive principles
then combining those to build up to the answer. It’s seriously the best way to learn. If classical mechanics isn’t your thing,
they have loads of other courses on topics like probability, astronomy, machine learning,
and my favorite, logic. Best of all, you can try Brilliant for free
by going to brilliant.org/HAI and then the first 424 people to use that link will also
get 20% off their annual premium subscription.
