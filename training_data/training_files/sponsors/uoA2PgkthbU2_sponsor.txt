Squarespace for sponsoring this episode if you need a new website or a domain they really are a great option especially for photographers the biggest issue for me is that my images look great on site and no matter where people are viewing them from so I load up quite a good size file so that is some reviews that on a big screen they still look great but my worry was with that big far size if someone's just flicking through on a mobile phone will my website run really slowly but what Squarespace has done is when I initially load up that file it auto generates smaller versions of that file and then serves up the correct file size depending on the platform that people are viewing my website on so that my website runs fast and responsive and my images still look great start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to
