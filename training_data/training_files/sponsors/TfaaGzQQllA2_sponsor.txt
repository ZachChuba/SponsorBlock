So as you guys might
know, we are proudly producing "The Financial
Confessions" in partnership with Intuit. And if you haven't
heard of Intuit before, you've definitely heard
of the awesome products that they make-- from QuickBooks, to
TurboTax, to Mint-- basically everything
that you need to get your finances
under control, in order, and vastly improved. They use technology to put
a virtual CFO in your pocket and make every money decision
easier, smoother, and better-- from managing your
day-to-day budget, to getting paid on time,
to making tax season feel easy for once, and getting back
your biggest possible return. We'll be talking a little bit
more about some of the products Intuit offers later in the show. But for now, if you cannot
wait to get started on making your own finances better, check
