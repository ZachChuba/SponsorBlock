my day job, and the rest of my life, I really don't have time to sit down and read. So I don’t. Instead, I listen to Audible. Because with Audible, I can still enjoy fantastic
books by listening to them during my commute to work, while cleaning the house, or even
while editing YouTube videos. Recently, I’ve been listening to Karl Marlantes
Matterhorn. It's a gripping story that follows a company of marines during the Vietnam War. This book drops you right into the thick of
a terrifying jungle. And I’ve got to say, I found the experience
to be visceral. Marlantes does an incredible job detailing
the complex and grueling experience of the marines. The futility of their mission, the horrifying
sights, sounds and smells, and their frustration over a chain of command that has no clue about
what happening on the ground. I highly recommend checking this book out. Take advantage of Audible’s one free book,
and 30 day free trial.
