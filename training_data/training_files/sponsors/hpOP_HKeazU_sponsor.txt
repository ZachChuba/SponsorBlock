is still something I use almost every single day. I've gotten a lot comments before asking about
my research process. And, a lot of it is just reading all the time,
and a lot of my reading is actually listening to non-fiction books on Audible. I really like their non-fiction selection,
but they have an unmatched selection of all kinds of audiobooks, original audio shows,
news, comedy, and more. I recently listened to Dr. Jason Fung’s
audiobook “The Diabetes Code,” the content itself was very intriguing but what made it
special is that it is narrated by Dr. Fung himself. It was engaging enough that I ended finishing
it in a span of just two days. Dr. Fung thoroughly covers the history, epidemiology,
cause and treatment of diabetes, putting complicated concepts in plain English with a bit of subtle
humor here and there. He also dispels many myths surrounding diabetes
and corrects several lines of incorrect education we have received regarding nutrition. If you'd like to check it out, go to www.audible.com/whativelearned
