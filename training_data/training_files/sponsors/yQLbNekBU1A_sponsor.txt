But that still begs the question, who is? Now, I'll tell you who
would become president but first I wanna tell you
who should become president, that's Jose Andres. Jose Andres is basically the
patron saint of DC these days. The world-famous chef created something called the World Central Kitchen to feed those in need during
natural and manmade disasters. They were on the ground in
Puerto Rico for Hurricane Maria and they're out in the
streets helping people during this pandemic. They've already served
over 15 million meals. I just gave $500 and it
would mean the world to me that if you're in a position to give, if you could give a little bit as well. The link to the website
is in the description, every little bit helps,
and it would be great if we could come together and help people during
this coronavirus pandemic.
