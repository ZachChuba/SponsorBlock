Now while these characters don’t have arcs,
they ARE still constantly trying to learn new skills. And if you’re trying to up your skill level
at writing or in other creative fields, then I recommend doing so with Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community
with over 20,000 classes to choose from in design, photography, video editing, creative
writing and more. Try the course by Simon Van Booy on building
a writing habit if you’re having trouble committing to a story, and sign up for the
premiere membership to get access to all of Skillshare’s classes. I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring
this episode, and if you want to join the millions of students already on the platform,
you can get 2 months free by going to this link: https://skl.sh/justwrite4, in the description.
