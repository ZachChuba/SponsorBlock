Thanks for watching, and thanks to Skillshare
for sponsoring this video. Skillshare is an online learning community
with thousands of classes is design, business, technology, and much more. With a premium membership, you get unlimited
access to high quality classes on a variety of topics, so you can improve your skills,
unlock new opportunities, and do the work you love. Since there is a lot of misleading and unsophisticated
advice out there as we’ve discussed, it’s important to find good sources of practical
information and learning tools. Skillshare is one way you can do that, especially
with it’s large selection of productivity classes, like this one by Rich Armstrong,
encouraging people to take the challenge of being creative from 100 consecutive days. An annual subscription to Skillshare is less
than 10 dollars a month, so it’s pretty affordable. But if you’d like to try it out, they are
allowing me to hook up my viewers with 2 months of Skillshare for free. To sign up, just visit the link in the description
and get 2 months of unlimited access to thousands of classes for free. Join the millions of people already on Skillshare,
