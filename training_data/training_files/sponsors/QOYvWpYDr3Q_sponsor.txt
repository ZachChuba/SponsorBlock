Hey oodle lallies, Editor Becca here again. I hope you're all doing okay during this strange time, but I wanted to show you what
the Creator Ink team and I have been working on. I'm really excited about this. We have a new Witch of the Woods
themed collection out, available for pre-order. We're also bringing back
The Geek Is Strong with This One t-shirt, as well. All of these items will be available for two weeks
to pre-order, and if you really like all three of the Witch of the Woods items, you can get them
in a nifty little bundle and save some money. I'll leave a link to the shop in the description below.
