This video was sponsored by the University
of Minnesota, where students, faculty and staff across all fields of study are working
to solve the Grand Challenges facing society. These challenges include adapting to a changing
world and ensuring we have clean water and sustainable ecosystems, and part of the solution
is to reimagine some of the fundamental structures of modern life, like buildings. Professors Richard Graves at the Center for
Sustainable Building Research and Bonnie Keeler at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs are
researching how to move from “green design,” where we make buildings more efficient (or
less bad), towards “regenerative design,” where we make buildings that positively contribute
to the local communities and ecosystems of which they are a part. Thanks, University of Minnesota!
