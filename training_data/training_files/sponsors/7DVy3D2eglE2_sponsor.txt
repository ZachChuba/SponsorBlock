perhaps I should pick up my ukulele and change the tone of this video a little bit by saying that now it's time for [Music] so the sponsor is audible right and as if you might not know audible is a colossal website that stocks loads and loads of audio books there are audible originals which are exclusive to audible but they're also just lots and lots of well audiobooks mainstream book now if you are watching this video you probably interested in the Falklands and history and military history and so forth so how about you type in Falklands or something like that and you get a load of hits for instance you might get a Max Hastings book battles for the Falklands all sixteen hours something of it in audiobook form and now I will confess that I haven't actually heard this particular audiobook but Max Hastings is pretty reliable he's written a lot of very well researched military histories and lots of other subjects that principally 20th century and looking at their reviews which is something you can do on the site you can see that he's had lots of reviews and they are very consistently very high almost all of them five out of five stars so I'm pretty confident in recommending battle for the Falklands by Max Hastings which is one of count this title so though though don't say because that's just a lie you will find in the collection of all of your books that big frankly something you're interested in and one way to get your hands on one of these things is to go to www.h text linear age to 500 500 that's Linda beige to 500 500 and then you can take advantage of and offer now the usual offer is has in the past been you get a month free that's one free book and then after that you can take up a subscription but if you are amazingly quick get your skates on you can take advantage of an alternative offer this time oh yes you can get three months for only four dollars and ninety five and that's for three months it was actually a better offer but my good news you got to get this skates on because it ends at this state yes this day which is really soon if you're watching this video and it's just come out even if it's just come out and you're one of the first people watching this video you'll notice that that's really soon so you can have to get your skates on to take full advantage of that
