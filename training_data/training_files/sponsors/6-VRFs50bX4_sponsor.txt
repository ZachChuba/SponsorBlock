going to shop tagger has made my shopping life so much easier you guys i get notified immediately when an item i have been eyeing goes on still not the percentage i want this video is sponsored by shop tagger this is like a website app that lets you go to your favorite stores and pick an item that you've been wanting and you can get notified either by email or text when it goes on sale so if you've been eyeing those grapes or pumpkins i say go ahead and download shop taggers so you can add them to your wishlist because i know they will go quick like they always do every year you can pick whatever percentage of sale you want the item to be and get notified immediately it helps you to also stay organized and remember what it is you have been wanting to buy you can make multiple wishlists for different categories you're shopping for for example home decor fashion or beauty and i already have my black friday shopping list set up so i can go ahead and start adding what i want so i won't forget about it later when i signed up with them on my computer i also made a bookmark so that way when i'm shopping on a website all i do is click the shop tagger button and it saves in my wishlist instead of the stores cart i wish i would have known about them sooner because all my days of stocking websites for the items i wanted to be on sale were a waste i always save things in my carts to different stores you guys do that too so here i'm just showing you how you can create your specific wish list you can get started after downloading shop tagger to your cell phone or on the computer i will have their link in my description
