Brady: We'd like to thank Squarespace for
supporting this video if you want a simple powerful and beautiful website then check
them out. I use SquareSpace myself for my blog and I could tell you I'm a really happy
customer but if you're a bit more advanced than me and really want to fine tune all
aspects of your site then SquareSpace's developer tools really
let you get under the hood and tinker with everything so if you've got
a great idea for a website online store podcast or anything else
that needs a web presence check them out. You can even give it a trial
run, set up a site, see what you think, with no credit card required and then if you do sign on for a year
they'll throw in a free domain name use the offer code numberphile
and you get 10 percent off your first purchase. Go to
squarespace.com/numberphile remember that offer code (great stuff) and
thank you to Squarespace for supporting numberphile.
