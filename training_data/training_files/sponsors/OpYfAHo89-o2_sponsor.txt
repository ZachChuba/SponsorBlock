thanks again to Squarespace for sponsoring this video if you need a website or domain or an online store they really are a fantastic option I've used it myself for a good five six years now if you go and visit my website that's a Squarespace website having a clean attractive professional-looking website is really really important to me I don't want people visiting my website and thinking I'm an amateur because my website looks amateurish and Squarespace give you a lovely selection of templates designed by top designers that you can use and populate with your content and then be able to tweak really easily in the backend but not so far that you can mess it up I'm no techie web guy I don't know coding or anything like that but I made some big changes to my website this week I took down some pages added some new ones I added images took some images out I changed some text around and I did this all from someone else's computer just by logging in to the backend of Squarespace so I can do that anywhere in the world and it took me about 10 to 15 minutes to make those big changes it wouldn't let me mess anything up too much it still looks clean it still looks exactly like my website but I was able to do it from anywhere in the world and that kind of flexibility for me is invaluable start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to Squarespace com forward slash Sean Tucker to get 10% of your first
