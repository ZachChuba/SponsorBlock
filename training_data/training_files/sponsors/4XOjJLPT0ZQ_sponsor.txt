takes careful thinking. And If you want to hone your scientific thinking, Brilliant is offering a new course on Scientific
Thinking where you can get started. It uses puzzles to help you ground yourself

physics in your everyday life. If you want to keep going, Brilliant also
offers over 50 other courses in science, engineering, computer science, and math. All of them are available offline through
the Brilliant app, so you can learn on the go, wherever you are. If you’re one of the first 200 people to
