While I eat this candy, I want to talk about today's sponsor They've been a sponsor on this channel before. They love what we're doing over here And they wanted to support what we're doing, and I think they're a very good product And of course I only bring on very good products to be sponsors on my channel, and that is "Skillshare.com" I know most of you already know what "Skillshare.com" is, so, and you kind of know how things go in this channel with "Skillshare.com," they'd like to give y'all two months for free for the first 500 of y'all that signup The link right now is down on the top of the description So make sure you click on that, get those two months for free That's my gift to ya'll, Skillshare's gift to y'all really, so make sure you do that Be quick first 500, but for the few of you who don't know what "Skillshare.com" is That's okay, cause I'm gonna go over it right now. "Skillshare," to be honest with you, is one of the most affordable online learning communities where they have a lot of different genres of video courses on their site that you pay a monthly fee of 10 to 15 dollars per month on average, depending if you get the annual plan or the monthly plan respectively And the genres on their website include things like business, technology, design, So technology would include programming of course, and design would include user interface and user experience design Which, as you see in some of my Adobe XD videos, but they go in a lot more depth on Skillshare than I do on my youtube channel. 
And what I mainly use "Skillshare.com" for Is their business, their marketing, their videography, and their photography. I like to take a lot of those courses because that really helps me up my youtube game Right now my camera is kind of broken back there So I'm recording on my webcam But I am getting a new camera just for you guys to know that But they do help you out in many different ways on "Skillshare.com," and considering you can get two months free Can't really beat that. 
So for the folks over "Skillshare," this one's for you. Thank you
