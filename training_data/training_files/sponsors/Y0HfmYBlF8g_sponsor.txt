however the only issue is that that channel basically makes no money and unlike Nile red it also has no patreon support thankfully though I've been able to get some nice sponsors on this channel like Rey Khan who are making Niall blue possible Rey Khan makes wireless headphones and earbuds and they recently sent me a pair of their new 25s to test out they showed up in this nice little box and I was able to bluetooth pair them with my phone in less than 30 seconds without even reading any of the instructions I've tried them out for the last couple of weeks while working in the lab and so far I've really liked them they have good base six hours of battery life and they're comfortable to wear for a long time also this is kind of a niche thing but I like that I'm able to just use one of them and I can turn the other one off this is because while I'm in the lab for safety reasons I can't block both ears in terms of cost they're also surprisingly affordable and despite sounding just as good they start at half the price of other premium wireless earbuds but with all that being said I definitely recommend checking out Ray Khan you should also use my link buy rake on comm slash Nile red which will give you 15% off your order if you
