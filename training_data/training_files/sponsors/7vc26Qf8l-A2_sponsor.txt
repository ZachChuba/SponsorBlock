But in the meantime, if you
want more about web things, here is Squarespace. (laughs) I've undermined the entire
series tone I've had throughout the whole
video with that dumb joke. Squarespace is the best and
easiest way to build a website. I've used it for a bunch of stuff, for NerdSync and also for me personally. They've got these beautiful templates that are also highly customizable so your site doesn't have
to look like everyone else. It's a really great starting point. You can dive in there and
really make it your own for whatever projects you're working on. In fact, this year, they've
added eight brand new templates to really get those
creative juices flowing. Because they make it so simple, you can actually build your
entire website in a day, if you wanted to. I've done it before. In fact, just to make it even easier, Squarespace is gonna help you
wonderful nerds out even more. Go to Squarespace.com for your free trial. When you're ready to check out, when you're ready to launch
your next big project, go to Squarespace.com/NerdSync to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain. If you're ready to
start your new business, go out there and make it and get started with Squarespace.
