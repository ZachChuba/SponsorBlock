Now if you have the
time you can definitely sit down and read this
book in its paper form or pick it up on your Kindle. But you could also read this book with your ears. You guys know what I'm
talking about, audio books. Audio books are a great way to get through books while you're cooking or while you're in the
gym or going to work. The best place to find audio books and my personal source
for them is Audible. Audible has an unmatched
library of audio book titles in a ton of different genres. They also have a great app
for managing all those. One of my favorite features of the app is the ability to make notes at specific time stamps in the book. Say you're cooking up
a paella or something and something really insightful comes up in the book you're listening to, you can just pause it, add your note and go on with your day. If you would like to give Audible a try you can get a free 30 day trial over at audible.com/thomas. That trial also comes
with a free audiobook of your choosing, be it Power of Habit or really anything you want. The nice thing is you can
keep that book forever whether or not you decide to become an Audible subscriber,
which is pretty nice. Head on down to the link
in the description below if you want to give it a try and thanks so much to Audible
for sponsoring this video.
