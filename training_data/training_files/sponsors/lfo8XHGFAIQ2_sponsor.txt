You can become one of those people today by
taking this course on solar energy on Brilliant. In this course you will discover the principal
methods of harvesting energy from sunlight, from both concentrated solar power and photovoltaic
cells, starting from the fundamental physics principles. By the end of the course you will be able
to answer practical engineering questions and have a better understanding of the considerations
in servicing utility scale electric grids The best way to understand is by applying
concepts yourself, which is exactly what Brilliant allows you to achieve. These may initially sound complicated and
scary, but Brilliant guides you through problems that are broken into digestible sections that
bring you from knowing nothing to having a deep understanding of the physics and math
that underlie everything in our lives. Feeling inspired? Then go to brilliant.org/RealEngineering and
