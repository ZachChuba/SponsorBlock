Profits may be shaved, But you and I will
always be able to shave in comfort with Dollar Shave Club. They’re more than just razors: toothpaste,
body wash, wipes, hair styling, and more - everything you need to look and feel great. I can tell you it’s all very high-quality
stuff, and I especially like how simple it is: Everything is delivered right to your door,
without the hassle of going shopping. And it’s affordable- New members can sign
up for just $5. You get a trial of their executive razor,
body cleanser, wipes, and shave butter. At this kind of price, you can see what you
like nearly risk-free. Replacement cartridges are sent for only a
few bucks a month, and, if you’re picky like me, you can choose exactly what you want,
when you want it. You’re never locked in, and you only pay
for what you need, no membership fees or anything like that. Get started for only $5, and help support
