- Hey, hey, handy hand! Help me out here. (laughs) Today's episode was sponsored by Nubia and their Red Magic 3s phone. Now, Nubia sent us this
Red Magic 3s phone to test out and show you guys how it works. Now, this phone is like, super powered, it's like a computer in your pocket, if you have pockets. I don't. (laughs) Hey, it even has a headphone jack, nice. So the Red Magic 3s phone is designed specifically for gaming. It even has trigger buttons on the top. And this thing even has a
liquid cooling turbo fan inside. This thing's super powered, it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon
855 processor in it. I don't even know what that is. I'm pretty sure Terminator
brought that from the future. Okay, you can use it to
watch sweet YouTube videos, you know, you're favorite
channel. (laughs) But where this baby shines is for gaming, yeah, you know what it is. Now again, before we test this baby out, remember this is a sponsored video. That means they gave us
this phone to try out, and show you guys how it works. And if you're interested
in checking it out, there's some links in
the description below. All right, and what
better game to test out a gaming phone with than Fortnite? I'm looking forward to
using these trigger buttons at the top, maybe get an
extra advantage. (laughs) All right, okay, Mr. Handy
Hands, pick Fortnite. It's right there, pick it. Hey, thank you very much. Okay, now gimme the phone. What are you doing? Give me the phone! Hey, I'm the one playing,
you gotta give me the phone. Okay, thank you.
