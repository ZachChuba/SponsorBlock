So I just want to talk a little bit about designing my new website with Squarespace. They have this really intuitive easy-to-use platform that made it super easy even for somebody like me, who's never done web design, ever. They have templates, they do domains, they have really good customer service - this is really an all-in-one, one stop shop for building a really slick website and I was really happy with the way mine came out.
