From showering to brushing your teeth, and yes, shaving, we all have our everyday grooming routines. Like me, this is what I do. Ah, I nicked myself. No matter your routine, Dollar Shave Club has everything you need to help you look, feel, and smell your best. Shower products, oral care products, hair products, skin
products, even butt wipes. And of course, obviously shaving products. Basically, if you've got a
body, they've got you covered. Right now they're offering
their shave, shower, and oral care starter
sets for just $5 each. They sent me their shave starter set, which includes the Executive Razor, with a tube of their Dr.
Carver's shave butter, and their shower starter set, with three trial sized versions of their amber lavender body cleanser, citrus and Hawaiian ginger face cleanser, and sage and black pepper shampoo. If you want, they can also automatically keep you stocked up on your products, and you can choose your frequency so you get exactly what you want however often you need it. The best part is, the more
you buy, the more you save. They call that their Handsome Discount, which is exactly why
I'm promoting it, right? Join the club with one of
their starter sets for just $5. After that, the restock box ships regular sized products at regular price. Get this deal at
dollarshaveclub.com/wulff. That's W-U-L-F-F, and hey, it
helps support the channel too. Thank you very much, I'll
see you over there now.
