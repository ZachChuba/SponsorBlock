talk about today's sponsor as a video editor myself I get asked so often about a really good video editing software and that brings me to today's sponsor filmora gomorrah is a fantastic editing software for anyone looking to get into video creation the user interface is very clean and has all the essential tools needed to produce high quality content time and time again these features include cropping video effects transitions and honestly guys so much more there's really no editor that is as easy to learn while still being able to push out quality edits on your videos and the best part about this is that fillmore is free to try yourself and if you find that you enjoy it you can pay a one-time fee of $69.99 and you'll have access to the software forever no monthly fees once again I like to thank
