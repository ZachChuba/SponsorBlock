And one great place to
constantly push the boundaries of your knowledge and expose
yourself to new topics while also having fun and really enjoying what you're
watching is CuriosityStream. They have thousands of
high-quality documentaries that you can stream to
basically any device you want, be it your Roku device, your iPad, your iPhone, your Android, your TV, your computer, like right here, I could watch a documentary on
Stephen Hawking for example, and they have long been one of the best deals in
online streaming as well. Not only do they have a library of some of the best educational
content you're gonna find, it's also only 20 bucks a year. But now, CuriosityStream is actually a better deal than it's ever been before because when you sign up for a yearly subscription
at CuriosityStream by going to CuriosityStream.com/Thomas, you're also gonna get access to a new streaming platform
called Nebula for free. And I was actually involved
in the building of Nebula and you're gonna find all of
my content over there as well. And one of the biggest benefits of Nebula is that you get completely pre-roll advertising-free content, so no ads before you get to
watch the content whatsoever, and you're gonna find a ton of your favorite content creators there. From Wendover Productions,
to Real Engineering, to PolyMatter, CGP Grey, Lindsay Ellis, and of course, me, and also my
friend Devin from LegalEagle. I do wanna give him a shout-out as well. But the really big thing about Nebula is we are doing exclusive series there that probably aren't going
to work as well on YouTube, and that's kind of the point of Nebula. It's a place for educational creators to really push the boundaries of the content they're creating and to make things that might not work given YouTube's algorithm. So huge thanks to CuriosityStream for not only sponsoring this episode but also helping to make
Nebula a possibility. So if you really wanna
support this channel and you wanna support
educational content creation, you wanna support them, definitely give CuriosityStream a try.
