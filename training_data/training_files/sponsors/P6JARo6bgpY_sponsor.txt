But before we can get to the Stars, we first have to understand them. So join us next time, as we cover the strides forward in our understanding during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. The Lotus: Tenno.
Matt: Whaa!?
Zoey: Meow! Lotus: I've detected intruders in your orbiter. I've instructed Ordis to open the airlock. Matt: Airlock!? What wait no, no, no, no, no, NO! Lotus, Lotus! It's me. Lotus: You are not the operator. Identify yourself. Matt: It's me, Matt from Extra Credits! Lotus: Ah, yes, Zoey's pet. Matt: Well, that's not exactly how I would describe it, but- Lotus: How did you get aboard this orbiter? Matt: You know, it's a funny story. Zoey and I had just come back from lunch and we found this great tex-mex joint Matt: I got a burrito and Zoey got this tomato and cheese gazpacho. You like cheese, don't you? Lotus: Enough. We do not have time for this. Aa corpus warship is on the move. Lotus: You must find a squad and engage them in ship-to-ship combat. Matt: Ooooh! Dang! You're talking about Empyrean aren't you? Matt: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. YES! I've been SO hyped for this since its announcement. I mean, come on! Four player co-op on my Railjack? Dog fighting against super tough enemies? Working together to stop boarding parties, and even strapping on the ol' Archwing to fly through fricking space to board other enemy ships? I mean who in their right mind wouldn't be hype for that? Matt: Oh, by the way, I call dibs on the Archwing part. Lotus: With whom are you calling dibs? We are the only ones here. Matt: You know: the.. audience. Lotus: Then gather this audience and prepare for the fight of your life. Matt: You got it, Lotus! Zoey, quick! Get my Oberon Prime cosplay. Lotus: *scoffs*
