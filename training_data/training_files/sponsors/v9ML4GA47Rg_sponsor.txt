This MinutePhysics video was made possible
by Ford - I was able to talk to an awesome crash test safety engineer there who told
me all about the complex physics and engineering that goes into vehicle development and improving
how cars perform in a crash. Ford gave me this opportunity because they
want you to know how important and carefully designed all the parts involved are, and in
particular that the only parts developed and tested to work with their vehicles are original
Ford parts. If you want to learn more about why the right
parts matter, you can head to takeagoodlook.com. And I personally want to say that making this
video has just reinforced to me that regardless of what kind of car you have, big dents and
deformations in the body aren’t just aesthetic problems – they can be safety hazards, too.
