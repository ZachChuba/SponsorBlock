sure the information in this video could have been conveyed in a few short equations but I find it far easier to understand when it's conveyed in an entertaining and interactive form and this is exactly how brilliant aims to educate you the interactive courses are excellent for understanding a wide range of topics from classical mechanics to artificial neural networks and because education isn't just about retaining information they test your knowledge with the quiz as you work through each course and if you get something incorrect there's no need to worry as they provide you with an explanation of any mistakes in order to get your understanding back on track so if you're looking to expand your knowledge and want to think like an engineer then head over to brilliant dot-org forward slash Tom Stanton to sign up for free and also the first 200 people that sign up with a link in the description down below will get 20% off a premium annual subscription thanks to brilliant for sponsoring this video and
