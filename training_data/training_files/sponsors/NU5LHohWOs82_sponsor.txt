So, this video was possible by Hover. I said last time that I recently purchased two new domains through them--one for my upcoming podcast series at whataworld.fm, and the other for my personal website at reallifelore.net What was great about getting them through hover was how incredibly easy and fast the process was. I simply looked up the domain name that I wanted, clicked to add it to my cart, and checked out all within one minute. They show you a list of prices and don't hassle you with needless add-ons; the price they show you is the price that you pay. If you're working to build your presence on the internet, then having your own site is incredibly important, and the ending extension can truly set you apart. There are over 400 different (of these) extensions to choose from on hover, like .fm, .net, or even .ninja or .lol. You can also set up your own private e-mail account through that domain once you buy it, which further increases your professional presence online. So whatever you'd like to get through Hover, you can get ten percent off your first order, and help out Real Life Lore by going to hover.com/reallifelore , and using the code "reallifelore" at checkout. Get your unique domain and e-mail at Hover.
