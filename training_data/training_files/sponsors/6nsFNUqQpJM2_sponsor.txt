very much to Squarespace for sponsoring this video I'm very happy to take sponsorship from Squarespace and very happy to endorse them because it's a product I use and I really like I have three Squarespace sites already I've been using them for years so I know how good they are if you're a photographer which you probably are if you follow me or another type of creative or you can make anything on a certain thing you really should have a website and Squarespace are a brilliant option for this they have a beautiful range of templates to choose from which they update all the time you don't need to worry about sort of adapting it for mobiles and tablets in everything because all this is done for you it's a very easy to use very intuitive platform and there's nothing to install you do it all through your browser's no patches no upgrades nothing like that you literally just need a computer that can go on the internet and you can edit your site or set up your site or whatever one thing I really like about them is I find their instructions very easy to follow I don't find this with other sites for someone who doesn't know what they're talking about it talks you through it in such clear detail and if you get stuck they've got award-winning 24/7 customer support to help you as well it's very easy to set up a site they've got a load of customizable templates and they're updating these templates all the time they've just released a load more you can kind of take these as is or you can tweak them and there's even a bit where you can add your own CSS code if you know a bit more to tweak them a bit further but the raw untouched templates have a really nice clean look to them so we're faced have recently introduced a feature where you can actually transfer your domain to Squarespace you don't have multiple vendors that you're paying out to at different times just simplifies everything makes it a lot easier if you want to test Squarespace see if you like it or not you can just head to the site and you can start the free trial you don't put any credit card details or anything like that just start building your site and if you like it you can go to Squarespace com4 slash Jamie Windsor to get 10% off your first
