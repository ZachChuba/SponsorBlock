I want to take a moment to thank this episode’s 
sponsor, Mubi. Mubi is a curated streaming service   tailor-made for cinephiles like you. Mubi features 
a line-up of great films handpicked by experts,   not an algorithm, that take you on a guided 
journey through the best that cinema has to offer,   with a new film added every single day. 
What’s really cool is how Mubi curates   their releases into retrospectives, 
specials, and specific subgenres.   It’s like having your own personal film 
festival that you can stream anytime, anywhere.  Check out Alejandro Jodorowsky’s bizarre 
cult classic, El Topo, following an outlaw who   challenges the invincible four masters of the 
desert for the love of a woman. Perhaps the most   important acid-western, El Topo can often be seen 
featured at indie treaters’ midnight movie events.   Or check out the classic cyberpunk anime, 
Ghost in the Shell, following a cyborg officer   investigating a master hacker called “the Puppet 
Master.” Ghost in the Shell would be a major   influence on other science-fiction masterpieces 
like The Matrix. All of this and much,   much more are available right now on Mubi. Try 
Mubi free for thirty days at Mubi.com/CinemaTyler.   That’s M-U-B-I dot com slash CinemaTyler
