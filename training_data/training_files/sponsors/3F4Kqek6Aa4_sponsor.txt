Before we get to the differences between the two cities on my end this video is sponsored by Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that I recently discovered that is a great timesaver. Most people are busy. Very busy. And they don't have time to read books. Let's be honest here, I don't. And this is kind of embarrassing, but I teach my students every year about Thomas Paine's Common Sense, but I've never actually read the whole thing. But at least I've checked out Common Sense on Blinkist. You can read the big ideas about it in 7 minutes. Or even listen to it on there. It's amazing. Another great book I've checked out is called the Evolution of Money. It's like you're reading books in 15 minutes or less. It's amazing. So the first 100 people to go to the link on the screen right now get unlimited access for one week to try it out. You'll also get 25% off if you want a full membership. The seven-day trial period is completely free and you can cancel any time during that period. Thanks again to Blinkist for sponsoring this video, and now here's the rest.
