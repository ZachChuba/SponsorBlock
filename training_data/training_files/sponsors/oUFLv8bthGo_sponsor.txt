But from that, I wanna share some stuff. I love today and today (mumbles) awesome. Brought to you by phil.ting.com. And for those that don't
know the awesomeness of Ting, they do mobile phone service differently. They're helping people save a ton of money on their monthly cellphone bills. You got no contracts, no overage fees, or any other carrier tricks. You just pay a fair price for the talk, text, and data that
you end up using each month. And with Ting, if you
use less, you pay less. And, of course, one of
the most important thing, they have nation-wide LTE coverage, which means you have great
network coverage coast to coast. Also, almost any phone works with Ting, whether it be an ancient
phone or, you know, the latest Galaxy S10 Plus or iPhone XS. And Ting customers, on average, just pay $23 a month for their one device. If you wanna check out
your phones' compatibility, check out their cost calculator, whatever, just got to phil.ting.com. Best of all, if you sign
up using phil.ting.com, you'll get $25 off your bill.
