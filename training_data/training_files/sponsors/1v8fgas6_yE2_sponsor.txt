Obviously they’re out of jobs now, and 1/3rd’s
dead, but if they do need new careers they can lay claim to the best band name ever—Space
Pirates! For this, they obviously need a website since
this is the 21st century and they obviously should build that website with Squarespace—not
because it’s called Squarespace but because it’s the best place to build any website. They have a fully customizable website builder,
beautiful designer templates, 24/7 super helpful customer support, and built in search engine
optimization which will help people find you. If you have a business or want to, you should
definitely have a website because the phone book has sort-of fallen out of fashion but
best of all, you can try Squarespace for free at squarespace.com/HAI and then, when you’re
ready to launch, use the offer code “HAI” for 10% off.
