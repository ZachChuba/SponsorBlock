And if you wanna get better at doing this, I have a book recommendation for you. "Essentialism: The
Disciplined Pursuit of Less" by Greg McKeown is one of my absolute favorite
self improvement books, it's one of the most useful that I have found in
my personal experience. And if you want to actually
listen to that book for free, you can do so by going
over to audible.com/thomas or by texting Thomas to
500-500 on your phone. Doing that will get
you a free 30 day trial of Audible service which comes with a free Audiobook download, which can be anything you want. But of course, I'm going to
recommend "Essentialism." But it also comes with
two Audible originals you cannot get anywhere
else along with tonnes of audio workout, fitness,
yoga and meditation programs. And of course, Audible is the
best place on the internet to get your hands on audiobooks. They have an unmatched library
with all the best sellers, lots of obscure stuff and things from basically any genre
that you could want. And they also have an
excellently designed app with a lot of great features,
including Sleep Timer for you using it at night, the ability to add notes at specific timestamps within your book and easy controls for jumping
forwards or backwards, just in case you wanna fast forward or if you didn't catch
something, you can easily go back and listen to it again. So once again, if you
wanna get a free trial of Audible service for 30 days that comes with a free Audiobook download, two Audible original that
you cannot get anywhere else, and all those audio workout
meditation programs, go over to audible.com/thomas and sign up, or text Thomas to 500-500 on your phone. Big thanks as always goes out Audible for sponsoring this video and being a big supporter of my channel.
