in short Nord VPN is a really useful service which helps anonymize your activity on the Internet it works by first encrypting the online data on your phone or computer and then sending it to a private server this server then decrypt the data and sends it directly to its destination which could be anything from your bank to just a website that you're shopping on the main benefit of this is that it makes it extremely difficult for anyone to steal your info or spy on what you're doing even if they were able to intercept your data as it was sent from your phone or computer it's all encrypted and they wouldn't really be able to do much with it this means that your private information and search habits are kept private even from your internet service provider on top of this they offer a whole bunch of other benefits and my favorite which I've mentioned many times before is the built-in add and malware blocker they also have an easy-to-use app for most devices and browsers so it's compatible with almost everything and with that being said right now they're offering a great deal which is 75% off their three-year plan along with an extra month thrown in on top so if you want to increase your online security and support my channel at the same time you should definitely check out Nord VPN you can do this by going to Nord VPN comso shneail red by clicking the link in the description or by just using the code Nile rat now before I go I just want to mention a couple things about that whole move I was talking about this is currently the major project that I'm working on and when it's all done I am gonna post a video about it the last time that I moved I did also make a video about it but this one is gonna be different the other one mostly focused on the evolution of my channel and I glossed over a lot of the technical details so for this one I'm gonna focus a lot more on the building and logistical side of things I think going over step-by-step exactly how I put it all together and why I did it the way I did could be pretty interesting I honestly have no idea how long this will actually take but I think that by mid-february I should have the video out as usual a big things goes out to all my supporters on patreon everyone who supports me can see my videos at least 24 hours before I post them to YouTube also everyone on patreon can directly message me and if you support me with $5 or more you'll get your name at the end like you see here [Music]
