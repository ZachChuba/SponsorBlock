  I know a lot of you are interested in writing fiction but there's probably also a bunch of you that want to write creative non-fiction, as well. How do you tell a true story in a compelling way? That's what The Genius has managed to do with reality TV. But if you want to do the same thing in the written word then check out Susan Orlean's class on Skillshare The class is called Creative Non-fiction: Write Truth with Style and takes you through the process of finding a story, researching it and writing it. And she knows what she's talking about since she's been a staff writer for The New Yorker for more than 25 years. Her class is one of over 25,000 classes you'll find on Skillshare about writing, film-making and more! I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this weird episode, and if you want to give Skillshare a try then click on the link in the description of this video to get 2 months free including access to all their classes.
