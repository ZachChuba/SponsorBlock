To get more experience with time dilation
and length contraction yourself, I highly recommend Brilliant.org's course on special
relativity. There, you can do problems that build off
what you learned in this video and explore real world scenarios where it's important
to take time dilation and length contraction into account, like the famous Michelson Morley
experiment. The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you go deeper on the topics I'm including in this series,
and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that's Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
