now next up here we have a really interesting plug-in it actually turns everything into gems gem sky gem people gem pizza ah wait no i've just been playing gemstone legends so thank you so much to gemstone legends for sponsoring today's video gemstone legends is a hybrid between a puzzle game and an adventure rpg it's a very interesting combo but it's actually pretty fun it actually has a very unique battle system that requires you to complete puzzles to do damage in attack so you'll drag gems around your board complete rows get big combos you can even drag the gems diagonally so as you complete battles you're gonna level up your heroes and unlock new areas so as you progress in the game you're gonna move around the map with hex tiles which is pretty reminiscent of old school rpgs but it also allows a lot of freedom in progression there are a ton of different heroes to choose from and they're all hand drawn as well so there's quite a lot of detail here and you look very good so if you want to find me in game i'll be under the nickname flipping osrs and if you want to give gemstone legends a try today you can use the link in my description the pin comment or even this convenient qr code to install the game and if you install it with my link you're going to get a huge new player bonus worth 50 to claim it you just have to put in the code hashtag flipping in the global chat and thanks once again to gemstone legends for supporting the channel and sponsoring today's video
