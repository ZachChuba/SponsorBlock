was it and this is multiply the great courses Plus now if you're unfamiliar with a great course at last let me tell you it's a huge reserve of human knowledge expert human knowledge as well and professors and so forth from distinguished universities and and they have people from the National Geographic in the Smithsonian and you know August bodies such as those and they're our last time I looked over eleven thousand lectures available and so yeah with that number you really can't come up with excuses there's nothing I'm interested in there'll be something and you get if you go to www.thebraintrust.net to a free trial one month of unlimited access to as much of it as you like and if you like it then you can pay a subscription then you will have and continuing unlimited access and all that noise and then there are no exams that's one of the great think there'll be no exams you might think more school huh but their exams at the end of it so it's just knowledge and knowledge is good so you can go to the the URL but there's can you always match easy if you just click the link in the description or is easy to do that it's at the top of the description should find it quite easily new stuff is being added monthly oh and news for people in the UK and Australia it is now optimized that's in the past some people had reported that they were having a bit of trouble paying but now it should be smooth and easy optimized in fact and optimized sounds terribly good it means a bit like the word optimal now I of course wanted something to do with artillery because bombardment or whatever and I typed those words in and oh you know what it's like you go into the rabbit hole and anyway I ended up on a course about do-it-yourself engineering in which I saw a very enthusiastic professor who was clearly very pleased with these very nice models that he'd made of an Annika and a ballista and a trebuchet the arms the trebuchet were about that long and being a professor that there are two lectures on on the making of these being a professor of course he equations and graphs and so forth of for optimizing your bits of artillery and the like so if you are interested in Italy it's not modern natural it's ancient art okay but its artillery and you're watching a video about artillery so you might be interested in ancient artillery and it's making stuff which I happen to quite like so that's a do-it-yourself engineering which is one of the many many lectures that you can gain access
