Deep dives into video games are something I look
forward to doing for a long time. And the reason why I’m able to continue
doing this, especially given how YouTube is constantly changing and new policies are affecting
creators, is through the support of generous sponsors. So today we’re taking off from our ground-based
horses to the air with the brand new MMORPG: Heroes and Titans 2: Era of Legends. Heroes and Titans 2: Era of Legends is a free-to-play
fantasy MMORPG for PC that features a vast world full of magical beasts that players
can capture and then use to fight and buff their allies in battle. There’s massive PVP arenas, epic raids,
and intricate storyline quests. Players are also capable of finding a variety
of mounts - from flying around on dragons to even giant robots. Pick from 8 different robust classes depending
on your play style - and utilize your skills against difficult foes in Player vs Monster
battles within dungeons or 30-player Raids. Or, take your talent to the Player vs Player
arena for 5 vs 5 or 3 vs 3 brawls, and play a game of capture the flag while you’re
there. So, if you’re looking to embark on a brand
new adventure, head over to the link in the description below and use my special code
“swankybox” to get a lot of awesome starter goodies. From a High Tech Rocket mount, to free dungeon
scrolls and various other items used to upgrade and tame magical beasts. And I want to thank Heroes and Titans 2: Era
of Legends for sponsoring this video and supporting me as a creator.
