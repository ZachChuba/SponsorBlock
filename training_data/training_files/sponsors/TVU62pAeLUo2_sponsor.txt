It takes a lot of different kinds of science
working together to understand how elephants communicate: biology, atmospheric science, the physics
of sound. If you’re interested in learning more about
any or all of these kinds of science, you might
be interested in the courses on Brilliant.org. Brilliant has more than 60 courses about science, engineering, computer science, and math. You can use those courses to brush up on fundamentals or do a deep dive on a topic—whatever feels
right to you. The courses are hands-on, with guided problems and explanations, along with interactive quizzes. They’re put together by math and science
educators from places like MIT, Caltech, Duke, the University
of Chicago, so you’re learning from the best. You can also get Brilliant courses on your
phone through the iOS or Android app, so you can keep learning wherever you go. If you’re interested, you can get 20% off
