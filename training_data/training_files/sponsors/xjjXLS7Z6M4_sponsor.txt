but nobody showed up harder or louder than our new best friends
over at DogHouse Systems. These guys were so excited
about what we were doing down here, they drove four hours down from Dallas to see it in person, and then they went totally insane. They were so excited about
what we're doing here, what you guys are making possible, that they completely outfitted all of it. Everything here is powered
by DogHouse Systems on loan from the guys themselves. These are top of the line
systems for editing bays, for live switching, even my
office is powered by DogHouse. They are doing all of this
because they believe in you guys. Sooner or later, you're going
to need to buy a computer, and when you do, you're
going to want to know that you're getting top
of the line components and best of breed customer support. Congratulations, DogHouse
Systems has all of that, whether you're a high end
gamer or value conscious or running a cult compound trying to learn how to become a Modern Rogue, I'm telling you they're
going to treat you right. Head on over to
doghousesystems.themodernrogue.com, use promo code ROGUE at checkout, get a free 250 gigabyte S-S-D drive and thank you so much to
our friends at DogHouse,
