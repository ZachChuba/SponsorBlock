first i want to thank displays for sponsoring this video if you guys are shopping for your loved ones now that the holidays are on the corner this is such a great gift idea displates are metal art posters that you can hang anywhere they come with a magnet on the back you just peel it off and attach it to the wall just hold it for 20 seconds and you don't even need a hammer or needle so it's really convenient to have and you don't have to put holes in the wall they have a huge variety of over 190 000 designs there are tons of different categories from space animals abstract art maps music sports and the list goes on display promotes artists from all over the world to show unique and beautiful pieces the best part in my opinion about this company is that for every metal poster they sell they will plant 10 trees they have planted over seven million trees and that's just so amazing when i was unboxing these i was instantly impressed i kept saying they're so pretty they're really high quality images they look just like what you see on their website my husband's birthday is coming up and these are going to be part of his gifts i'm really excited for him to see these because astronomy is one of his passions in life and our daughter's name is in one of these posters that just makes it even more special i'll leave a coupon code for you guys in the description box along with our website link so you can check them out thank you so much display for sponsoring
