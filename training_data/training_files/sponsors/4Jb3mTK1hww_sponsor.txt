But, before we get too far into things, I
want to give a big thank you to our sponsor for today’s video, Manscaped. Now, on Manscaped’s website they have an
article on 10 Superheroes That Probably Manscape, and uh… Yeah, Deadpool’s on there, which makes a
lot of sense given his character. I’m a big fan of these products, like the
Lawnmower 2.0 trimmer, the Plow 2.0 safety razor, they have some awesome shears that
goes in their package, and also various sprays, like the Crop Preserver ball-deodorant, which
I’m a massive fan of with how sweaty it is in Texas. I know that watching sponsored stuff like
this really isn’t all that fun, but it’s companies like Manscaped that allow me to
continue making videos like this and not only am I a fan of the product, but also the staff
working behind the scenes have been very awesome, which I can’t say that about every single
brand that I’ve worked with on Comic Drake. So, if you want to support the channel, make
sure you go to Manscaped.com and use the code “COMICD20” at checkout for 20% off AND
free shipping. Thank you guys very much, and now back to
the video.
