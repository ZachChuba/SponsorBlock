Most of the hackers who get busted every year
by the military should have probably taken better steps to protect themselves, and even
though you may not be a nefarious hacker, today’s dangerous cyber environment means
that you should take steps to protect yourself too. With Dashlane you can enjoy the security of
their ultra-light VPN with just the click of a button, encrypting all of your online
activity versus any would-be snoopers. Plus their dark web scan will search dark
web marketplaces for your personal information, so you can take steps immediately to protect
yourself! On top of that, Dashlane offers a first-class
password manager tool that helps you create unique strong passwords for every website,
and Dashlane will notify you when any website you have an account on is hacked or suffers
a data breach! Head on over to www.dashlane.com/infographics
