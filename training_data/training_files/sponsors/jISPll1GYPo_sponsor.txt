You can do that last all on your own, but
there are tools that help, and one of those is Dashlane. It’s a password manager and one that can
not only save all your passwords but can rapidly generate long secure passwords for you too,
and even be set to automatically change them periodically. You have a master password that’s never
transmitted over the internet, not even to Dashlane, but it can still transmit all those
passwords encrypted to your other devices you’ve installed it on, so you have access
there, so long as you don’t lose your master password, as again they don’t keep a copy,
but since it’s only on those devices you installed it on, nobody can hack it from afar
and you can keep it simpler if you like. That means if Dashlane gets hacked, all they
would get is bundles of encrypted data that wouldn't mean anything without the unique
master password… for each and every individual Dashlane user - by the way, that’s over
13 million users, meaning 13 million unique master passwords -- this is not worth a hacker’s
time. Though Dashlane does have the option for Two-Factor
Authentication, if you want some extra security on your mobile devices. Dashlane also provides easy to use and secure
autofill options so you can keep all your addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers
and personal data there to autofill on forms and has a built in VPN, Virtual Private Network,
so you can surf the net securely even on public wifi systems. They also provide Dark Web Monitoring, to
warn you if any of the places you have accounts have been hacked and the data sold on the
Dark Web. That’s Password manager, VPN, and Dark Web
monitoring, and they do all that for less than what just one of those services usually
costs. If you’d like to give Dashlane a try, use
