Marvel Comics but before I continue now like Peter Parker I've often found myself overseas in countries with limited access to the information I need or want because sometimes other governments put weird restrictions on your internet access which is why I use Express VPN thanks to express VPN for sponsoring this episode by the way Express VPN is a virtual private network that encrypts your data to keep it from being stolen by people like hackers are tracked by any third parties and can grant you access to otherwise stupidly blocked content like many web sites and services are blocked in different parts of the world some countries censor websites and don't laser freely some things are even more expensive online depending on where you live I'm looking at you airline tickets expressvpn is your solution to this cuts through it all it allows you to reroute your connection to a server in a country of your choice making all those geo restrictions the thing in a past expressvpn is also helpful for preventing your online data from being stolen or monitored without your knowledge I like using it whenever I'm on public Wi-Fi like at an airport or a coffee shop to prevent those nosy hackers from stealing my information my collection of the Animorphs fan art is not for sharing thank you very much Express VPN servers operate at the fastest speeds they have 24/7 customer support and it's super easy to use just fire up the app and connect with just one click it is the top-rated VPN provider rated number one by tech radars cement and many more find out how you can get three months free by clicking on the link in the description box below expressvpn comm slash new rock stars again
