and so what you're saying is is that the commander should take an already good card and make it better rather than a card that is dead without the commander that will then be able to do something right so there's a really good example i play uh zedrew the great hardin commander she's the donating goat lady right i really enjoy it and what i get a bunch of people who will suggest cards that i should put in it that all have some big drawback and the idea is that you'll give it away to somebody right uh one of the ones that comes up a lot is aggressive mining which is a card where you can't play lands and you can sack lands to draw cards is the basics of what it does which sounds great because you can make it so someone never plays a land again cool stuff right except if say i go to cast aggressive mining and they kill my zedroo i'm now locked out of ever creating enough lands to pay the commander tax to cast my zedrew
