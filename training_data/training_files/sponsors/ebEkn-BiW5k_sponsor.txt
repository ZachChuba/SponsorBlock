Given the mathiness of my videos, it may not
surprise you to hear that I get a lot of practice with math & physics problems while working
on them, and this video’s sponsor, Brilliant.org, wants to help you stay sharp on your problem
solving, too! (since, unfortunately, watching videos doesn’t require as much problem solving). Practice is pretty much the best way to really
get to know a subject, and Brilliant.org is ready to give you plenty with premium courses
in probability, logic, and math for quantitative finance. Plus addictive puzzles: for example, “if
half of the earth is blown away by the impact of a comet, what happens to the orbit of the
moon?” It almost sounds like a MinutePhysics video…
but you’re going to have to go to Brilliant.org to solve it (or one of their many others)
– and when you do, use the URL brilliant.org/minutephysics to let Brilliant know you came from here.
