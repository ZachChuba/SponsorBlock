If you want to learn more about them. I highly recommend watching this documentary
titled “Going Nuts” on curiositystream. It’s a beautifully shot documentary that
I really enjoyed. For a slightly more on-brand recommendation,
they also have an exclusive, original documentary series premiering on the 13th of June about
the new race to the moon called ‘Return to the Moon’. You can watch it for free, by signing up to
curiositystream using the code realengineering, or using the link the description. This will give you a month of completely free
access to over 2,400 documentaries and nonfiction titles from some of the world’s best filmmakers. After that first free month you can continue
your access for just two dollars ninety nine
