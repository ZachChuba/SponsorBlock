And before we sign off, a big thanks to our sponsor for this
video, Squarespace. So if you want to build
a slick looking website, quickly and easily, then
Squarespace is for you. It's an all in one
platform and you don't need to know any code or have
any web design experience. You can just use one
of their many templates as a starting point and expand on it with their easy to use interface. And if you get stuck, they've got great 24 seven customer support. I've personally been using

my website for inspiration. And if you want to build
