Sponsorships help out a ton, so I want to
thank Displate for sponsoring this video. Displate produces some really slick, high
quality metal posters in collaboration with artists from around the world. They have amazing
metal prints featuring plenty of your favorite video games, movies, and tv shows - along
side other eye-catching artistic pieces. I received a Displate about a year ago as a
gift from my brother and I absolutely loved the idea of it - so working together with
them is really awesome. Every time you buy a Displate, they plant ten trees as well - which
I think is a great concept. So, if you want to support some talented artists and receive
some one-of-a-kind, truly unique metal posters to spruce up your place - check out the link
in the description below to see the great sales they have going on right now. And, I
want to thank Displate for supporting me as a creator.
