I'll tell you all about it after this message from our sponsor expressvpn If you don't already know a virtual private network is a tool you can use to hide your IP Address and Internet activity from those who would like to steal your sensitive data such as your credit card information But with the use of expressvpn your online identity and internet traffic are encrypted and totally anonymous Here's three reasons why I personally like using expressvpn Number one every single server has peer-to-peer network compatibility number two as a Canadian I can't access some of the premier content offered on streaming services such as Netflix which are available only to American users But with expressvpn, I just need to connect to an American server and these services then recognize me as an American lastly and most importantly Expressvpn is flippin quick boy other VPNs I've used are so slow that I would only use them when I really needed to but with expressvpn the speed difference is so negligible that I just leave it on all the time Express VPN is less than $7 a month with a 30-day money-back guarantee take back your internet privacy today and find out how you can get an extra three months for free by clicking the link in the description box expressvpn Dot-com film Harold take back your privacy with expressvpn
