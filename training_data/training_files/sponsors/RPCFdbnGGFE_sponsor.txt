new website we made on Wix. Wix is a free
platform that allows you to build highly customizable and professional websites
without needing to be an expert web developer, with hundreds of free
templates we had the creative freedom to make something truly unique to our brand
our website needed a complete overhaul to make it more friendly accessible and
awesome and one of our big focuses in making a new site was a way to give you
guys more information about our projects with more details and resources on them
in case you want to try making them yourself for example here's our blaster
project page as you can see we have more details on how it was built a gallery of
photos links to parts we use and even the 3D CAD files for you to download
pretty sweet huh? now we haven't uploaded all of our
projects yet but check out our site for now and don't forget to sign up for an
email newsletter to stay up to date and if you guys want to make an awesome
website for your business portfolio or hobby too click my link in the
