You don't have to commit to a degree to do this, however. In fact, you can learn by solving problems in quantum theory along with loads of other topics on brilliant.org. I'm so happy that Brilliant have sponsored
a bunch of my science videos, because their philosophy of
learning through solving problems, and in particular making sure you know
it's okay to make mistakes, because that's how you learn, is exactly how I think people should learn. Brilliant is freemium, meaning that parts of the website are free, so you absolutely should check those out, and parts like their curated courses are accessible with a premium subscription. If you like the sound of one of those, then go to brilliant.org/SimonClark and the first 200 people to do so
will get 20% off their subscription.
