let’s stick to talking shop.
In May 1925 Victor and Dapper Dan moved to Paris, possibly to escape increased attention
from American law enforcement. In the Paris capital they read an article about the status
of disrepair of the Eiffel tower and how maintenance expenses would be too costly for local government.
That sparked the idea for Victor’s craziest scam: he would sell the Eiffel Tower.
The idea actually was not that crazy. The Tower had been erected in 1889 as a temporary
structure, to be taken down no later than 1909, and yet it was still standing. It was
effectively expensive to maintain, and the public opinion was split about it, many considering
it an eye sore. So how about the French Government decided
to sell it as scrap metal?
