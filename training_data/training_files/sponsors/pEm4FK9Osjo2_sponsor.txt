um now um i think it's probably time that i talked to you about my sponsor because i've been wobbling on for goodness knows how long and that is the great courses plus what is the great courses plus people who are unfamiliar with my channel may be asking well the great courses plus is an enormous website which has on it lots of videos and the videos are of academic lectures on all sorts of topics including military history but all sorts of other stuff as well how to do stuff how um accountancy and photography and oh just all sorts of other things go to the site and you'll see um and you can get if you type in www.thegreatcoursesplus.comstrokelindypage or much easier you just click the uh the link that's in the description beneath uh you can go and get a free trial period uh in the site you can go there and you and look at the lectures for free for a bit and if you just uh decided that it's great you can subscribe and then you'll have time to watch all sorts of lectures on all sorts of topics now when i started um getting sponsorship from the great courses plus i was saying they have 6 000 lectures well it's now 10 000 lectures so it's extremely likely that there'll be a lecture on some topic that will be of of interest to you and as i say there's no harm in looking at the free trial now some people have uh found it a little bit difficult to pay using certain payment methods depending particularly on where they are i'm happy to be able to say that it is now optimized for australia and the uk so if you're from the australia the uk or america uh that is the usa uh you should find it very easy to uh pay uh although admittedly um some of our friends in europe may still have a little bit of difficulty but you still get the free trial period so hey you know you can you can still take advantage of that now at this point i normally draw your attention to a particular course that has caught my attention but this time instead rather than looking at a course i'm going to point out that you can do a search there's a search engine within the site and you can type in some topic and it will return to you individual lectures that perhaps touch on that topic so you could you could type in naval warfare for example and even if you didn't want to watch the whole of a course on just naval warfare or even if they didn't have a course on naval warfare you can find naval battles talked about in other courses so for instance the battle of midway is talked about in a general history of the world of world war ii and the battle of midway comes up again in another course which is on decisive battles of history um and so you can get two perspectives on the battle of midway should you so wish um and in the in the course of military blunders i see there's one of the um the blunders made by the royal navy during world war ii all right they couldn't get everything right all the time um and um uh there's another one uh the 1905 battle for instance of uh tsushima uh which is perhaps a battle you don't even know about it so there you go there's a lecture on that so you can you can pick and mix from different courses and a great thing about it is there are no exams because you remember you can remember what it was like at school you know so much of the fun gets sucked out of learning if you know you're going to be examined on something but with the great courses plus you can watch to your heart's content find it tremendously interesting and at the end forget the whole lot and it doesn't matter no one's going to think any less of you for it so uh click on the link in the in the description go to the great courses plus i fear i have i know not fear i feel that i have now said enough on that so
