Thanks to Raycon for supporting PBS Digital
Studios. Raycon makes wireless earphones that come
with Bluetooth pairing, a portable charging capsule, and 6 hours of playtime. Instead of traditional single-channel distribution,
Raycon uses True Wireless Audio which uses independent frequencies for the left and right
channels. Raycon's latest E25 model comes in six different
color options and with a noise-isolating fit and no wires or stems. The earphones are sweat-resistant too if working
out is your thing. For more information go to buyraycon.com/eons. OK now hold up I'm going to give you a tip. Sound Field is a new music education show
from PBS Digital Studios that explores the music theory, production, history and culture
behind our favorite songs and musical styles. Pop, classical, rap, jazz, electronic, folk,
country and more — Sound Field covers it all. Hosted by two supremely talented musicians
who have kicked my butt in trivia battles, Arthur “LA” Buckner and Nahre Sol, every
episode is one part video essay and one part musical performance. So go subscribe to Sound Field! Link in the description below.
