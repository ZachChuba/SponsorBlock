Alright everybody, it’s officially here:
snomangaming.com! Thanks to your input about what you’d like
to see, I was able to put together something through Squarespace that I’m really proud
of! The site building tools were extremely easy
to use and practically did all the hard work for me. I was able to create beautiful layouts super
quick and intuitively, and my favorite part was that it just worked from the get go - no
updates, installers or add-ons needed. The options are super versatile making it
great for any type of website - musicians, artists, selling a product, you name it! So if you’re in the market for a great site-building
tool, I can’t recommend Squarespace enough, and if you go to squarespace.com/snoman and
use the code SNOMAN, you’ll get 10% off your starting month!
