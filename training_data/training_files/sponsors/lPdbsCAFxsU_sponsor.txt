put down their damn phones.” Hey guys, this is Grace,
and today I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places
to watch movies. Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove
of films from around the globe. Every day a new film is added
and the oldest is taken away. So in this world where it’s very easy
to spend hours debating what you want to watch,
Mubi is like having a really cool friend with amazing taste in movies
making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to come by
masterpieces, indie festival darlings,
influential arthouse and foreign films, lesser known films
by your favorite famous directors, and more. Plus, you can even download the films
to watch offline, and there are no ads, ever. Right now on Mubi
you can check out Warwitch, part of their collaboration with
the Human Rights Film Festival. This academy award nominated film
tells the story of a child soldier who discovers a magical ability
to see ghosts. We can’t recommend Mubi highly enough. You can try it out now for free for a whole month.
