which is pretty cool yeah technically there's a private Internet access spot in here get private Internet access I don't have a lot of time you would show is gonna be we've got a better link than that what is it LM g ja GG / dia when yeah LM GG g / p IA when we gotta get those things updated yeah oh you know what else I really really have to update you guys on okay so we've got a couple of updates we actually forgot last week to look at the blog oh so there's a couple updates posted by Stephanie Potter ways to get to LTX 2019 Xtreme hack lots of options if you're flying into Vancouver the closest airport is Vancouver International Airport YVR it's in Richmond don't worry it doesn't matter if you plan on staying in Richmond or downtown Vancouver there's a great there are great public transit options it's called the sky train so there's three lines that branch out from actually very close to where LTX is if you are anywhere not on the sky train our public transit sucks and we don't have Ober so I would strongly recommend finding a hotel that is near a sliding station so the Waterfront station is about five minutes from the Vancouver Convention Center walking and pretty much everything can get to waterfront if you live locally or plan on renting a car there's ample parking located under the East Building of the Vancouver Convention Center road-tripping to the great white north if you're taking i-5 up from CF from Seattle you'll cross into Canada gee Sarge border-crossing which is open 24 hours these are actually really great tips you guys are gonna wanna go check these out over at LTX Expo comm and we've got some information about hotel accommodation and options um yeah we don't have lyft or uber week I cannot make that clear enough we do not have ride share here because the taxicab mafia is still somehow winning it's it's unbelievable Mexico and taxicabs are kind of garbage here too yeah if you stay in downtown Vancouver it's roughly a 20 to 30 minute walk max and then there's always taxis or public transit as options it's a decent City to walk through though um so there's some four and a half five star for 600 to 800 a night that's pretty expensive if the rest of downtown is a bit of a mixed bag ranging from 80 bucks a night for hostels to hotels in the 300 dollar range and if you're looking at Airbnb zs-- there's options from single rooms to full apartments in the 125 to 350 range if you don't mind traveling more or you want to rent a car cuz you're gonna run around and see the city like I know Steve from gamers Nexus ended up going up to Whistler and doing some biking and stuff since he was in town anyway um you can stay outside of the downtown core and it's quite a bit less expensive so like hostels as low as like 50 bucks a night so uh yeah that's pretty cool what Colton it's gonna be it's gonna be sick these are from spectrum they're they're driving glasses oh they're actually they're actually like tinted kind of like differently than their regular just like blue light filters this isn't during the sponsor spot anymore so I'm gonna I'm gonna go into it the style of them reminds me very strongly of destiny skins really yeah they're like gold with the carbon fiber and then other matte black this is a really sporty very destiny skin style this almost looks like like an impact resistant like sports goggles to me yeah this one doesn't this one's more like like stylish like I could actually like I could actually see myself like just wearing this when I'm I could see you doing something active you could see me wearing them yeah you mean literally yeah thanks Lou no no
