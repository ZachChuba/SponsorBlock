time thanks again to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode if you need a new website or a domain definitely check them out they're a great option especially for photographers I've used myself for ages and I love their templates how clean they are and how they put your images front and center and make them look good one of the clever things they do is when you first load up your images and your big file sizes they generate smaller versions of that file so that people are looking at your website on it on a tablet or on a mobile device they're gonna serve up the smaller file sizes they're still a great on those devices but it makes your website really fast and really responsive start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to Squarespace
