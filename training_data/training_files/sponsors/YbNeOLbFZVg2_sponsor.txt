But now we've watched this movie about a boy who won't come back to life, it's time to talk about something that will. Zombies. Because today's video is sponsored by The Resident Evil 2 Remake. [Narration Danny]  The zombies have taken over. And even though I'm safe... For now. I fear I may be the only one left. *spoopy music(some real spoopiness)* Hey, hey, hey!!! Woah woah! Get outta here! [Zombie] Hi! Go away! Go! [Zombie] What? Oh. I'll kill ya! [Zombie] Okay, can you put away the knife? Please? I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just a regular guy! What? Y-You're a zombie! Get outta here! [Zombie] What? A zombie? Me? Ha, no! No, dude! I'm just here because I saw you have power, and I just bought this new video game, The Resident Evil 2 Remake, and I wanted to see if you wanted to play it wit me. You wanted to play a video game? [Zombie] Uh huh. About... killing zombies? [Zombie] Yeah... Don't you think that's kinda ironic? [Zombie] I think it sounds fun! Okay? It's a spine-chilling re-imagination of the classic from 1998. It's been re-built from the ground up with a new modern and perspective control scheme, terrifyingly realistic graphics and two separate campaigns... one for each of us! Dude, I'm not going to play a video game with you! [Zombie] It's available today for X-box, Play-Station and Steam! You gotta go man, you gotta get your little zombie bUtT out of my house. [Zombie?] Why do you keep saying that I'm a zombie, huh? What, just cause I'm pale? Just because I have red circles around my eyes? Where's your foot? [Zombie?] Huh? Your foot. It's gone. [Zombie?] Oh I, uh... I must have forgot it in the.. car. Why are you bleeding? [Zombie] Oh, oh, oH! This? Like you just got bit by a zombie? [Zombie] This is just because I'm... sO eXcItEd To play a game with you... You're bleeding because you're excited? [Zombie] Is that not... something that people do? Why would you think that would make me want to play a video game with you? Does that make you seem healthy? [Zombie] Come on, just play with meee? Pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssssssse? It's fun? It's a fun game? [Zombie] Uh huh. And you promise you're not gonna bite me? [Zombie] Uh huh! Alright... *SiGh* Let me see the game. *awkward silence* gGNoOMmM *crunch* OWWW!
