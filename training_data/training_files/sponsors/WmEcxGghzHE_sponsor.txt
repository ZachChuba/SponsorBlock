So before we get started, I wanna thank the sponsors
of today's episode, which are the folks over at Squarespace. They've got some brand
new summer templates that are just, (whistles) fire, I guess the cool kids area saying. But if you don't know, which
I'm sure you do already, it's the all-in-one platform where there's nothing to install, patch,
or upgrade at any time. And if you need a website or a domain or you need a store or a blog, basically an online presence, these are the guys I recommend you go to. They've got 24/7 customer
service which is award-winning, so if you manage to break
the internet in the process they'll sort you out; you
can get your domains there, and like I said there's
tons of award-winning designer templates to choose from. And if you wanna get
started, check it out, try it out, all that kind of thing, head over to squarespace.com/mckinnon, enter McKinnon at
checkout and save yourself 10% off your first purchase, so thank you guys for
sponsoring this episode.
