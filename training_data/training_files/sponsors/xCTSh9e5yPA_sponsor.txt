one actually hold up flag on the play I forgot to mention I am now a Nord VPN affiliate and I have a link in the description of every single video I will ever post from here to the end of time because having a VPN is almost essential for destiny too because its peer-to-peer and people can see your IP address and that they really dislike you that day like you were using one ID mask mountaintop and recluse then there's a chance that you probably might get booted offline you'll get ddosed long story short this has happened to me I've had my entire modem fried and been kicked off the internet for hours at a time to the point where I just have to go and get a new modem it of course happens on my main account just because I'm a YouTube content creator but it even happens on my alternative accounts when I'm playing comp just because people don't like playing against a better opponent and they think me not playing the game is the best chance of them winning so in conclusion if you're an avid destiny player or planned to commit a lot of time to this game especially if you're a YouTube content creator or streamer but then I highly recommend you invest in a VPN service it's happened to me so many times where I get booted offline and how my modem fried that I'm done with it and want to supply the biggest middle finger I can and luckily Nords got my back by hooking you guys up with this affiliate link if there's any DDoS sirs watching this video remember you're a loser and you can change that by just not doing it anymore will forgive you will forget and for everyone else I'd appreciate it if you'd help me on my quest to be extremely Petty and get yourself a VPN you don't have to use the link nordley wants me to talk about a lot of different things regarding internet privacy and that sort of thing well no I just want to be really really petty because I really dislike D dollars please get yourself a VPN it doesn't have to be three years one years one month whatever you can use a link if you want to give me a little bit of pocket change but really just get yourself a VPN so
