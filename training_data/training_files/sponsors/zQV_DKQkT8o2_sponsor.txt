If you want to learn how it works, though,
the best place to do so is brilliant.org. Their machine learning course makes this advanced
concept simple because their simple explanations, illuminating graphics, and thought-provoking
questions break a concept down into small packages and then builds it back up to the
final result. They truly are experts in successfully teaching
complex topics. They also have plenty of other fascinating
courses on topics like computational biology, number theory, artificial neural networks,
and more. You can start learning for free at brilliant.org/Wendover
but then, if you want to access the full range of classes with their premium subscription,
the first 200 to use that link will also get 20% off their annual premium subscription. Thanks for watching and weâ€™ll see you again
in three weeks for another Wendover Productions video.
