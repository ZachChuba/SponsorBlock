gradual descent into madness that the advent
of aerial bombing fostered, I highly recommend watching this documentary titled the Bombing
War: From Guernica to Hiroshima. It takes you from the first small grenade dropped from
a plane in World War 1 all the way to the monstrous and unnecessary bombing campaigns
that took place in Europe and Asia in World War 2. It’s a fascinating insight into the
minds of the civilians that lived through those times and the madness that gripped the
military leaders that approved them. You can watch it now, for free, by signing
