Now before we get started, I want to thank
the sponsor of this video, VideoBlocks, who also provided the cool stock footage you just
saw, and that I'll also be using in more of this video. Videoblocks has one of the largest stock video
libraries out there, with over 3 million videos, after effects and motion backgrounds, and
it's constantly growing. Plus, their contributor marketplace gives
100% of the commissions back to the artists. Of course you can also use these clips in
your own videos, because they all come with royalty-free license agreements, so you won't
get hit with any copyright claims. And you guys are getting a deal, because VideoBlocks
is giving away 7 days of free access to their library, and yes, you can keep using the videos
you download afterwards because you get the royalty free license with them. So be sure to check that out at VideoBlocks.com/YouTube,
or click the link in the description. And now, let's continue.
