If you want to learn how to make apocalyptic
jam unfortunately Brilliant does not have a course on that but they actually do have
a course on how to make regular jams, traffic jams. Their physics of the everyday course includes
a whole section teaching how traffic jams form and work. Brilliant, as you know by now, is the best
place to be taught complex concepts as they teach the intuitive principles so you understand
rather than just learn. If you want to become the sort of person who
can explain the physics of traffic jams, Brilliant is the place for you as they have courses
on that and plenty of other interesting topics such as artificial neural networks, number
theory, and solar energy. Best of all, you can try Brilliant classes
for free by signing up at brilliant.org/HAI and then, if you decide to upgrade to their
premium account, the first 200 to do so at that link will get 20% off.
