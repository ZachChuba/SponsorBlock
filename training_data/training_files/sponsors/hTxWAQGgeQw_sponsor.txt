If you'd like to play around with some spacetime
diagrams yourself, I highly recommend checking out the “propagation of light” interactive
quiz on Brilliant.org, this video's sponsor. This quiz is seriously cool – it uses spacetime
diagrams to guide you through how astronomer Ole Rømer deduced that the speed of light
must be finite just by observing the orbit of Jupiter's moon Io. It's a super clever idea, and the quiz does
a great job of using spacetime diagrams to help visualize the situation and guide you
through calculating the speed of light yourself. In fact, this quiz is part of a whole course
on Special Relativity that Brilliant has available at brilliant.org/MinutePhysicsSpecialRelativity,
and doing problems like theirs after watching videos like mine is a great way to practice
and really internalize the ideas of special relativity. If you decide to sign up for premium access
to all of their courses and quizzes, you can get 20% off by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics,
or even better, go to brilliant.org/MinutePhysicsSpecialRelativity, which lets Brilliant know you came from here
and takes you straight to their relativity course.
