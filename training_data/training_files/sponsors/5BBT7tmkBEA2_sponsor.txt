At this point, there are just so many good
sponsor segues so I’ll do three. (If you want to evade your taxes like the
rich, Skillshare has a course for that! Not even joking! But they call it “tax reduction”/ The
good news is that there’s no tax for browser windows because with the number of courses
Skillshare has, you’ll need plenty of them./If you don’t have any money left after taxes,
I have good news, because you can get 2 months of Skillshare for 99 cents.) As it turns out, learning is good for you
and Skillshare is a great place to do just that. They now have over 20,000 classes about pretty
much anything and everything. If you’re like me, you aren’t interested
in just some things, you’re interested in everything so if you want to learn about music
production on a Tuesday, negotiation techniques on a Wednesday, and sport photography on a
Thursday, do yourself a favor and sign up for skillshare.org. You can sign up for free at https://skl.sh/hai9
and then the first 1,000 people to upgrade to a premium subscription will get their first
two months for free.
