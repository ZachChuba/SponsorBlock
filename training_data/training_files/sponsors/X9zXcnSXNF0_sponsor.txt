disregard the robot in the frame i'm going to tell you about today's sponsor audible before you say oh sponsor and get out of here a couple reasons to stick around one i'm going to be trying to carve the promo code in this pumpkin this is actually the first time i've ever tried to use this robot and there's a good chance it's not gonna work so hopefully an interesting result the other reason is audible's awesome i love it and i think you're gonna love it too it's a vast collection of audio books and other spoken word things the great thing about it is i can learn while i'm doing other things it's kind of like getting extra hours in your day because you get to get more out of every hour if i'm writing a business book one of my keys to success would be audible sorry it looked like my robot was about to kill itself i really love learning about how people did something especially something hard there's this book i was reading recently about the effort to make the atomic bomb has the really original title of the making of the atomic bomb it's an absolutely epic book it goes into the science the physicists the politics it's so good there's so many takeaways from your book like this you can learn so much from the past the only problem is it's a really intimidating book it's like a 50 hour book but because i can listen to it when i'm in the shop or just doing whatever things my brain is idle it's great all right here it goes we had a slight technical difficulty i was cutting too deep so it was cutting something though let's try again signing up for audible gets you access to a gigantic library of titles they call it their plus library as well as a credit every month for any book can you see the problem it cut it backwards you should try audible it's amazing you'll get more hours in your day and you can get a free month by going to audible.com stuff made here or texting starting off after enough athletes three he didn't passing it i'm just kidding you can text stuff made here to 500 500. let's go get this cleaned up and see how it looks definitely some stuff to improve but i'm happy you'll be happy too if you go get audible get your free trial at audible.com
