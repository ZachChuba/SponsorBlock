That's why I think you
should be making time for this habit, as well. And one resource that I'd
recommend you check out during this time is Brilliant. Brilliant is a learning website that takes an incredibly
active, problem-centric approach to teaching math, science,
and computer science. And because they take this
active approach to designing all their courses and their challenges, when you're going through the material, you're actually stretching your brain's problem-solving capabilities, becoming a more capable,
creative problem solver. Brilliant's library includes
over 50 in-depth courses, and they also have a feature
called daily challenges where every single day you can log in and get a new problem in a different area which can expand your
horizons and your interests and again, build that daily learning habit and build your problem-solving skills. So, if you wanna get started for free, go over to brilliant.org/thomasfrank and you're gonna get free access
to those daily challenges. And if you'd like to upgrade your account and get access to their
entire course library, be one of the first 200 people
to use that link and sign up and you'll get 20% off your
annual premium subscription. Big thanks, as always, to Brilliant for sponsoring this video
and being a big supporter of my channel.
