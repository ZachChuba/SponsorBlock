And I also read online that if you’re born
in early November, that makes you something called a Scorpio, which means you’re resourceful
and brave, but also jealous and… oh wait no that’s the Zodiac again. The Zodiac is made up—don’t @ me—but
you know what’s real? My hour-long documentary Alaska’s Silent
Summer, which is about a small town in southeast Alaska whose entire economy was based on cruise
ship tourism, going through a year where every cruise ship in the world sat empty in a harbor. It’s an important story, and we worked really
hard on it, so I hope you’ll check it out. It’s up right now exclusively on Nebula,
and the best way to get access to Nebula is through the Nebula-CuriosityStream bundle,
where for less than $15 a year, you’ll also get access to CuriosityStream, which has thousands
of great documentaries including another great one about a town going through a difficult
period—Pompeii: Disaster Street. To get that bundle for the current sale price
of just $15 a year, go to curiositystream.com/HAI, and when you do, you’ll be helping to support
independent creators like me.
