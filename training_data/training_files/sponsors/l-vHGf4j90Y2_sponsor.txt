If you don’t want to waste your life completing
pointless challenges. You could try the challenges on Brilliant
instead. Where they present you with daily challenges
that you can solve with Brilliant’s community. Brilliant just released offline courses on
iOS, so you can work on learning new things even on an underground train or a plane. Brilliant also recently released their fantastic
course on Python coding called Programming with Python. Python is one of the most widely used programming
languages, and it is an excellent first language for new programmers. It can be used for everything from video games
to data visualization to machine learning. I used it in my own Master’s thesis to create
custom plug-ins for my finite element analysis software, but I had to teach it to myself
and work through consent errors. This course will show you how to use Python
to create intricate drawings, coded messages and beautiful data plots, while teaching you
some essential core programming concepts. This is just one of many courses on Brilliant,
with more courses due to released soon on things like automotive engineering. If I have inspired you and you want to educate
yourself, then go to brilliant.org/RealEngineering and sign up for free.And the first 500 people
that go to that link will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription, so you can get
full access to all their courses as well as the entire daily challenges archive.
