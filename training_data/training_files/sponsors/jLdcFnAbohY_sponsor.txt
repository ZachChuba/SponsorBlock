I think it's fair to describe many of Recess' episodes as character-driven short stories. Short stories are an excellent way for a writer to hone their craft or launch a professional career. If you want to get better at short fiction then I recommend checking out even Yyun Li's course on Skillshare the sponsor of this episode. Fittingly, the course is called Writing Character-Driven Short Stories, and I think it'll be useful for you no matter what medium you're working in or how long the thing you're working on is. Or you can check out the thousands of other classes on Skillshare in fields like Creative Writing, Film Production, Productivity and more. You can get two months of Skillshare for free by clicking on the link in the description of this video and get access to all of their classes.
