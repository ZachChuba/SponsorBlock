deal so at all times be sure to do your homework and make sure you're making the right decision for you but I am personally so excited to announce that as of this very month November 2019 I am personally finally free of student loans after just seven short years no actually I was super fortunate my loans were very manageable but the most annoying part about it for me is that it was spread across so many little loans that all had their own terms rates and due dates if you have the same problem whether it's student loans or not upstart might be able to help it's a great way to knock down higher interest loans or just consolidate a bunch of little loans into one easy payment guys if you'd like to find out how low your up start rate could be or just get more information you can do so by going to upstart com slash SCB it only takes a few minutes and it will not affect your credit score
