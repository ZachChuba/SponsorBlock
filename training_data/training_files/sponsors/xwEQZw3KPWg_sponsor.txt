microwave I'd like to thank audible for sponsoring this video since getting into audio books I've spoken to a lot of people who do audiobooks and someone said to me you've listened to Harry Potter of course and I said no because I mean I've read Harry Potter when when the books came out so why would I listen to the thing when I've when I've already read the thing and he said you know it's read by Stephen Fry and it's amazing and he's amazing it's like the perfect combination Harry Potter and Stephen Fry so I'm enjoying those books all over again I want to book four already they're really really good if you want to enjoy Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry for free or indeed any book from the audible range they have the best range you can sign up for a 30-day free trial go to audible.com forward slash Steve mould or click on the link in the description if you do
