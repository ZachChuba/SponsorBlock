And if you also love learning new stuff than
this is the best time to sign up for today’s sponsor, Curiosity Stream, because you now
have access to two education platforms instead of one. CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming
service with thousands of documentaries and nonfiction titles crated by the original founder
of Discovery but NOW your CuriosityStream subscription is now 2-in-1 - with your monthly
subscription, for 2.99 you also get access to Nebula, a streaming video platform built
by and for independent education creators, like MinutePhysics, Half as Interesting, Thomas
Frank, Real Engineering, Wendover, Tier Zoo and so on. Nebula is a place where education creators
can keep producing content and original series without restrictions, without ads and most
of all, with the support of an entire community dedicated to learning. Basically when you sign up for Curiosity Stream
you gain access to the thousands of documentaries they have as well as free access to Nebula
and all of its content, including original series. By signing up at [CuriosityStream.com/Mariana](http://curiositystream.com/Mariana)
you’ll be helping the education community continuing producing education content without
YouTube’s restrictions and also without ads.
