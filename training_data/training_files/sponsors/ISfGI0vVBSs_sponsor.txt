deep dives into weird topics it tends to come back to a lot of my foundation ideas about how society is organized and about the large impact we can see from seemingly small things one of the most formative stories for me when it comes to that is Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood which is this speculative fiction story all about genetic experimentation and what it means to be human that's why I'm really happy to be sponsored by audible for this video because that's one of the many audiobooks that's actually available on their website right now it's a really good audiobook and I would recommend people check it out because it was really cool and impactful for me personally please talk to me about it if you do one thing that's cool about audible is that you can do things like control the speed of the narration and share clips with others on the app which is really cool for me because I always want to share really cool moments from books that make me super excited they also have this great listen guarantee where if you don't like one of your audiobooks you can just swap it with another they also have a special promotion going on right now and you can get three months of audible for just 695 a month which is more than half off of their regular price if you sign up using my link which is audible.com slash Sarah Z or you text serozha to 500 500 you can get one audiobook and two audible originals completely free again that is audible.com slash Sara's
