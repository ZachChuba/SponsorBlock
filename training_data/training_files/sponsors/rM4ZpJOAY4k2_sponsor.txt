If you find yourself stuck in an airport for
18 years you’re going to need something to do and what better way to use your free
time than learn something new, perhaps on brilliant.org. Brilliant is the best place to learn new things
as they have mastered the art of teaching. Their courses are superbly designed and help
you learn complex topics like number theory, special relativity, or gravitational physics
in a way where you’ll actually understand the why and how rather than just learn the
what. All their courses are great but if you’re
looking for one to start on I particularly enjoyed their “Games of Chance” one. Check out Brilliant at https://brilliant.org/HAI/
and sign up for free. That will let you try out some classes and
then, the first 200 people that go to that link will also get 20% off the annual premium
subscription.
