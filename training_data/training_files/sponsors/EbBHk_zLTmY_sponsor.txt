A few months ago, we got a call from
the folks at Creative Assembly, probably one of the coolest
we've ever received. And they told us “Hey so, we’re
finishing up our next Total War game, and we’ve got some money left over in the
marketing budget from our publisher. The way we see it we could buy a
few more banner ads, OR we could underwrite you guys making some
videos to teach people about Roman history. You don’t have to mention us or the
game, just teach some history.” And we said:
“That’s AWESOME.” And we ARE going to mention
them AND their game, because I would love to see
more companies do this. I want to see companies use their
ad budget to not only garner sales but also do some good. So to everyone else marketing a game
that has something worth discussing, there are dozens of content
creators out there who can do a lot more for you than few
banner ads are going to. So good on the folks at Creative
Assembly for setting an example. We approve. But let’s get started, huh?
