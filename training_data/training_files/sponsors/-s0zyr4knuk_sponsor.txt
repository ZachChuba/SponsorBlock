OtterBox reached out they wanted to sponsor a video and the cooler just came in and I wanted to do this campus coat so it was very convenient seemed like a great time to test this cooler over I'm using it to keep my food from freezing as opposed to the normal usage of keeping it cold it's already cold if I left my food out overnight or even during the day while I'm hiking around with him and stuff it's going to to freeze and be hard to deal with have to thaw it out all that stuff and why deal with all that nonsense when I'm car camping well no camping right over to my truck here I want luxury I want the amenities this specific OtterBox cooler is the Ventura 45 these rugged versatile coolers are built to keep your group happy full and hydrated from either a day trip in the woods to a weekend Trek or a week-long disappearance into the bush the cooler has custom modularity they created a platform so people could use the cooler as more than just a piece of cooling gear they've thought about organization as well there's a built-in slot for separators and a dry storage tray making organizing your cooler a breeze keeps up to 14 days you don't watch ice you can put this bad boy the latches are a different design than I've seen before they're easy to open and drop down out of the way the handles are sturdy and then make caring easy and they serve as tie-down points and all this is made in America as well Oh Cheers for a limited time if you go to OtterBox comm and purchase a venture 25 cooler you'll get a free black dry box thanks a lot to OtterBox for the sponsorship
