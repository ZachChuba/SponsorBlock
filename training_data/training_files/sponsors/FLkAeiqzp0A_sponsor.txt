speaking of not that bad we should talk about our sponsors because they're not that bad yeah yeah meanwhile like poor poor jord watches here is like really clearly they've never sponsored linus tech tips before so these are hand crafted using sustainably sourced hardwoods from around the world so yord i'm glad i'm saying yord because they're swedish that's good york is swedish for earth which is where they draw their inspiration from so they have designs for men and women they have battery or automatic power they use quartz movement and they have something for everyone now this one needs to be adjusted to be the right size for me but uh here i can give you guys a look at that check that out that's a i like the square one better really yeah what do you think i like mine but i see why you like yours well you know what's funny they actually picked out designs specifically for us i think that worked out which is uh which is actually pretty cool so the whole thing that's a really nice one so it comes with extra links this is i don't generally i'm not a stylish kind of guy no i don't think either of us really are but like i wish i wish it had one link out of it because then it would then it would fit perfectly but that looks really sharp so they do free worldwide shipping um the one that i've been wearing pretty good the del mar series so that's a dark sandalwood with an obsidian carbon watch face so you can actually see the like the carbon the carbon fiber finish on there looks really nice and then luke's is in a dark sandalwood this is the frankie series with an emerald watch face so if you guys use offer code ltt oh the box is magnetic oh jeez so far it is if you use offer code ltt you'll get 25 off and a free sizing at yordwatches.com we're going to have that linked in the video description oh man i wanna yeah i wanna get this uh i wanna get this size and then like this is the kind of thing that i could actually the clasp is where if i went out somewhere nice like yeah no no mine's different oh i think i've seen that style because it goes in both directions oh oh oh yeah which makes it actually way easier if you have big hands but they didn't feel that i needed that i guess [Laughter] oh your watches thanks guys you guys are i'm gonna i'm gonna keep that safe i'm gonna have to deal with that later all right other sponsor did i just get burned did i just get burned by a first-time sponsor they picked my sizing like perfectly so spectrum glasses all right mystery meet which one do you want yeah perfect that was that was me picking essentially i actually didn't really look that carefully which one was in there these are like i think that's the small one i think that's the one that's better for me but you know what i'm gonna wear the boulder frames today because the point of spectrum just because they look good doesn't mean that that's necessarily why you would run out and buy spectrum glasses staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes and also make it tougher to fall asleep so spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at a computer screen instead of using a software one like flux which doesn't offer the same kind of filtering that these glasses do so they're high quality they come with a one year warranty the glasses are durable they've got a ton of different styles including ones for kids they have low color distortion so they don't just turn your entire world urine yellow which is nice but they block high energy blue light and while they're primarily focused around the canadian u.s markets they do ship internationally so go check them out at spectrumglasses.com collections slash products and finally an oldie but a goodie savage oh there we go you know what i'm listing out today
