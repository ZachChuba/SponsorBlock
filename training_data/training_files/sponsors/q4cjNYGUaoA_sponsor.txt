And, if you wanna start
building some initial competence in these outside areas, you
should aim to do it actively. And, one of the best places that you can do that is Skillshare. Skillshare has over
17,000 courses and a ton on different topics including all the ones I just mentioned above: graphic design, AI and machine learning, marketing. In fact, they have a
fantastic marketing course from Seth Godin who is
one of my favorite authors that you should definitely check out. And, the best thing
about all their courses is that they have hands-on,
practical components. So, instead of just watching videos, you're gonna be able to sink your teeth into some challenges
that will really stretch your capabilities and
accelerate your learning. Now, while they do have
thousands of courses for you to choose from, I do
wanna recommend one course in particular this week. And that's Keith Yamashita's
course on storytelling. Human beings are wired to love stories. So if you can learn the
elements of good storytelling and how to craft one
yourself, you're gonna have an easier time connecting with people and getting them onboard with your ideas, whether you're giving a presentation or interviewing for a job. So, if you wanna go through that course or dig into any other area
that you're interested in, give Skillshare a try. And, the first 500
people who click the link in the description down below and sign up, will get a two-month free
trial of unlimited learning. After that, a premium
subscription starts at less than 10 bucks a month and you

I wanna give a huge thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video and continually supporting this channel.
