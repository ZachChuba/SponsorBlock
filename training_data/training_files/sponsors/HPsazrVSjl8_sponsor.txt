of learning now, a great place to begin your journey is at Brilliant. A learning platform that uses hands-on problem solving as a basis to help you learn math, science and computer science, really effectively. I'm actually taking their computer science fundamentals course
right now, and as I was going through the first
section on algorithms the quiz questions they gave me forced me to learn new math I had
never learned before. I had to dig into wikis
and example problems. And eventually I had to get out a sheet of notebook paper and literally draw out algorithms step-by-step so I could understand what was going on. This process provided me
with a much more intense and effective learning
experience than I got sitting through most
of my college lectures. And these types of challenges that really force you to dig in, form the foundation for all of their courses. Which include probability, logic, calculus astronomy, computer memory and more. In addition to the structured courses Brilliant also has weekly challenges that you can use to improve your skills and has a community where you can talk with other learners and
it has a fantastically detailed and helpful wiki with lots of explanations and examples.
