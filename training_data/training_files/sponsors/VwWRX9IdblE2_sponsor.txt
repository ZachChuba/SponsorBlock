If you are interested in learning more about the weird and wonderful
world of quantum mechanics, Brilliant.org has an entire course dedicated to quantum physics, starting off with a detailed description of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, including all the physics behind it, as well as the notation used
to describe spin probabilities called bra-ket notation. It includes interactive
step-by-step quizzes so you can learn at your own pace and check your
understanding at every step. The course also covers the
math used for quantum physics and takes you all the way
to Schrodinger's equation and something I absolutely cannot wait for is the quiz on quantum
entanglement coming soon, not to mention all the other
courses included on the website mainly about math, physics
and computer science. The first 200 people to click
