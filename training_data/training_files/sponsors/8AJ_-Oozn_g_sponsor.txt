And one area where people
often fail to do this is in their digital life, especially when it
comes to their security. I cannot tell you how many
times I've met a friend who's using the same exact
password for their bank as they are for their Final
Fantasy VII Fan Fiction forum login. And that is a big problem, when you repeat passwords
you open yourself up to a lot of vulnerabilities and the potential of getting hacked and maybe even having your money stolen. So going forward make sure
that you are always using strong, unique passwords for every single online
account that you have. And an easy way to do this and keep it all managed and organized is by using a tool like Dashlane. Dashlane is a really
well-designed password manager that can easily generate,
strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts. And it can also auto fill those passwords and login forms so you can
easily get into the websites that you use every single day and what's even better, especially for me, it can automatically fill in
any other form online as well. This saves a ton of time and
eliminates a lot of friction in your everyday life. Dashlane can also store
things beyond just passwords. They can store secure notes for you and your payment information so you can pay for things
online really quickly and all of your information is stored in a patented security architecture that has incredibly strong encryption. So if you want to start
improving your online security in a very easy and convenient way then head on over to
