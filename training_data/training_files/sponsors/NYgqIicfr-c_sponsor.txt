now before we get further into this video i wanted to thank today's sponsor raycon i'll be honest i was never really a fan of earbuds as i always found them to be a little uncomfortable but to my surprise these ones have definitely changed my perspective on that as they're the most comfortable earbuds i've gotten to wear and the best part is that they start at about half the price of any other premium earbuds on the market and sound just as amazing as other top audio brands you know celebrities like snoop dogg melissa etheridge and mike tyson are obsessed with raycons raycons are great for working from home working out and listening to music and podcasts for hours without disturbing your surroundings their everyday e25 earbuds are their best model yet with six hours of playtime seamless bluetooth pairing more bass and a more compact design that gives you a nice noise isolating fit it also comes in new fun colors if you like a great pair of earbuds without burning your pockets click the link in the description below
