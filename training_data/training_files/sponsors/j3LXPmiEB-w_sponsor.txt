This video was supported by NASA’s James
Webb Space Telescope Project at the Space Telescope Science Institute. There’s still a ton we don’t know about
Europa - the Hubble telescope has detected what we think are plumes jetting from Europa’s
surface - perhaps water spouting up through cracks in Europa’s icy surface, and if so,
the plumes could give us insights into the oceans beneath. The James Webb telescope will use its powerful
thermal imaging and spectroscopy to investigate Europa’s plumes and to study the geologic
activity, tides, and tectonics of Europa and other outer solar system planets and moons,
hopefully answering questions about how they formed, how they continue to behave, and whether
they have conditions amenable to life.
