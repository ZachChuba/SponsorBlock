My favorite book for getting a feel for what
the country is really like and where it may go in the future is “China in the 21st Century”
by Jeffrey Wasserstrom. I read it while researching this video, and
I recommend it - it’s only 5 hours long and you can listen to it on Audible! Let’s be real, we all have busy lives and
it’s kinda hard to find an hour or two during the day where you can sit down and read. But it’s easy to put on an audiobook on
the way to work or school, or while doing chores, or writing long rambling YouTube comments. Not that you guys would do that… What I like about this book, in particular,
is that it’s a nice, general overview of China, It doesn’t pretend to know the future,
and it doesn’t have any kind of agenda, it’s a straightforward, objective explanation. Go to Audible.com/Polymatter or text polymatter
to 500500 to start listening to this book or whatever you’re into for free! Again, that’s Audible.com/p-o-l-y-m-a-t-t-e-r
or text p-o-l-y-m-a-t-t-e-r to 5-0-0-5-0-0.
