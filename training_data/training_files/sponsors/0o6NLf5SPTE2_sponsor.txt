This video is sponsored by Crunchyroll, which I profusely worship as they feed my anime addiction of spiky haired boys and Over-the-top fight scenes. Crunchyroll is the world's largest destination for anime, manga, and drama titles straight out of japan! Professionally subtitled in full 1080 HD. I just started to watch Doctor Stone, I'm like two episodes in and I'm kinda diggin' it! So again sign up for crunchyroll add free premium, for 14 days trial. Link in the description or use the URL crunchyroll.com/Dingo D-I-N-G-O. ...and dingo was her name-o.... sorry. Watch Doctor Stone, so I have somebody to talk to about it! Cuz none of my friends have watched it and I don't want to talk about it. I mean look at that hair! So let me know what you think about it in the comments. So go off and enjoy that sweet, sweet anime hair. Yeah.
