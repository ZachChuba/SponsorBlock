(laughing in the background) Did you guys hear that? I think I know what that means. It's time for an ad read. (sploosh) (sporadic screaming) Are you tired of clumsy kitchen accidents getting you down? Yeah! Having trouble editing your next video? It's so frustrating! Can't find the right design? YES! Well then you've gotta try Skillshare! Huh. Cool. Wow. Okay, alright, can I try it right now? It burns. Sure! Skillshare is an online community with thousands of classes in design, business, technology, and more. Fantastic. Wow, this is great! Okay... Skillshare is a great place for creators who want to learn more about their craft, with courses in editing, T-shirt design, building a business, and so much more. That sounds great. I could definitely use some help with After Effects. And I could use a few design tips A premium membership to Skillshare gives you unlimited access to high-quality classes from experts working in their fields, so you can improve your skills, unlock new opportunities, and do the work you love. Wait, wait. So is this gonna help with the burns all over my body? No. I've currently been watching "The Definitive Guide to T-Shirt Design and Manufacturing." I gotta keep my merch looking good. Yeah, I mean, it sounds great and everything, dude, but I'm going to the hospital right now. I think I might need surgery after this, so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to afford it. Well, Skillshare is actually more affordable than most learning platforms out there. An annual subscription is less than ten dollars a month. That sounds like a great deal! Ten dollars a month? Count me in! Yeah, okay, I get it, it sounds great. But I still don't think that this is what I need at this exact moment, okay. I'll give it a shot later. And the first 500 people to sign up using the link in the description get their first two months of Skillshare free. Fuck, I have a flat tire. With Skillshare, you can keep on learning. Thanks, Skillshare! Thank you, Skillshare!
