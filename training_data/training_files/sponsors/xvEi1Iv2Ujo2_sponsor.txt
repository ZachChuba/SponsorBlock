Though, while we're
talking about breakfast, I do wanna note that reading isn't the only way to
bundle learning with it. In fact, maybe you're
watching this very video while you eat breakfast. That's something that I do all the time, I love watching videos in the morning. But, what I don't like, is sitting through ads
before they even start. Which is why I got together with a bunch of other educational
creators and built Nebula. If you haven't heard about it, Nebula is a completely
self-funded streaming service that lets you avoid ads, and allows us to create what we want without worrying about
YouTube's algorithm. You'll find my content there, alongside people like CDP
Gray, Wendover Productions, Kurzgesagt, and more. Plus, originals that we're
creating, like Working Titles, which breaks down the intro
sequences to iconic TV shows. But here's the best part. We've teamed up with CuriosityStream so that when you
subscribe to their service for just $2.99 per month, you get access to Nebula for free. Which means that you get ad-free videos. You get to support independent creators, and you also get access to thousands of high-quality documentaries on CuriosityStream. If you use my link in the
description to sign up, you can get a 30-day trial for free, and start watching documentaries
like The Science of Sleep. Or David Attenborough's Light On Earth. As always, thanks for watching, and huge thanks if you choose to support what we're building over on Nebula.
