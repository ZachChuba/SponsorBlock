I learned all of this and more by taking the course on Games of Chance over at Brilliant.org, and you can quickly do the same. Numbers and math don't come easy to me naturally and they never have and I'm sure many of you probably struggle with the same issue, But Brilliant can help a lot with making you feel more confident. Rather than simply telling you numbers and facts about games like Blackjack or Poker and hoping you memorize them, they start by teaching you the intuitive ideas behind the probability that influences what happens. By playing through their puzzles, you'll come to understand how Games of Chance actually work and Brilliant has tons of other relevant courses to help you learn more about how our world really works, like probability, logic, computer science and so much more, all of which similarly guide you along as you build up your core knowledge. You can take as many of these incredibly design courses as you want with their premium subscription and which by being one of the first 200 people to sign up by clicking the link in the description you can get for 20% off.
