So I thought I'd share some more Blinkist recommendations for you. Blinkist are sponsoring this video. It's an app that does
something remarkable. It condenses non-fiction
titles into 15 minute reads. They're also audio narrated, so you can listen to them in the car. Here are my recommendations "A Short History of Nearly
Everything" by Bill Bryson. Very good, I read the
whole thing after that one. "Talking to Strangers"
by Malcolm Gladwell. "The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read "and Your Children Will
Be Glad that You Did." It's another parenting book that's been really good
for us and our kids, and "Born a Crime" by Trevor Noah. That's just four recommendations. There's so much to choose from. They've also got some great audio books that you can get a lot
cheaper than anywhere else. The first 100 people to go
to blinkist.com/stevemould will get one week absolutely
free, no strings attached, cancel whenever you like. It's an opportunity to try it out, but if you want to carry on, you'll also get 25% off membership. So the link is also in the description. Check out Blinkist today.
