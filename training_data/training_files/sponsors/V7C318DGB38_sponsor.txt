I’ve been wanting to learn how to use Adobe
character animator for ages, and it just so happens that this video is sponsored by the
online learning site skillshare and they have lessons on character animator. No joke, as of this morning I had no idea
how to use this software, and now you’re seeing me, in stick figure form, animated
in character animator. So yeah, skillshare clearly has lessons for
learning stuff, and not just animation: cooking, photography, programming, etc. It’s about 10 dollars a month, but you can
get two free months by going to skl.sh/MinutePhysics, which also lets skillshare know you were sent
there by me in animated stick figure form. Bye!
