We've personally been
using QuickBooks here at TFD for years,
and every year we've been learning more
and more that we can do with it to help make
running our business feel so much easier and
more manageable. QuickBooks provide a
convenient dashboard for you to look at basically every
element of your business at a glance and tons of
tools to help you do things like get paid on time or
manage all of your expenses for things like
deductions come tax time-- and tax time will come. If you've been thinking
about getting better tools for managing your
money in business, please check out QuickBooks
at the link in our description or the show notes. I can personally say
it has changed my life.
