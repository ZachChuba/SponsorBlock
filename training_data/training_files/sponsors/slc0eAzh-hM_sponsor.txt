Here’s a question! If fingerprints are so foolproof, why was
an innocent man harassed by the government and detained for weeks as he wondered why
they thought he was connected to a crime on another continent? We’ll explore that in a second. Real quick, this video is sponsored by Mine. Going to SayMine.com allows you to see which
and how many companies hold your personal data. The average person has 350 companies. I guessed 141 companies held my data and I
was pretty close. 148. On this email account alone. Clicking “see more” shows me what type
of data a certain company holds and then I can assess the risk level of a data breach
and decide if I need this service. With the many data breaches today, I don't
want companies I don't use to have my data so let’s take care of that. This will send an official deletion request
from my email to the company to erase my personal information. And there we go. And you can review any updates on the request. Mine is free for now but won’t be in the
future so if you want to check out who has your data and do something about it go to
SayMine.com. And thanks again to them for supporting Vsauce2. Okay so.
