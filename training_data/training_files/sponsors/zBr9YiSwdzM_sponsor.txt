daily math & science problems from this video’s
sponsor, Brilliant.org. To turn keeping your brain sharp into a regular
habit, they’re now offering fun daily problems, like what happens when you cut a möbius strip
in half? Can you use a solar sail to crash into to
the sun? If you bake a loaf of bread that’s twice
as big, how should you change the temperature and length of time it’s in the oven? You can solve these problems (& sign up for
a new quick question to your inbox every day) by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics, which
will also give the first 200 people 20% off a premium subscription to Brilliant with access
to all of their courses & puzzles & past daily problems. Again, that’s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
to stop your brain from spontaneously decaying.
