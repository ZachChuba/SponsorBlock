for sponsoring this video I really like Squarespace I've ended up with three Squarespace sites I've been using them for years one thing that I think is important to remember because I also work as a graphic designer and often that involves sourcing photographers sometimes I'll do the photography myself sometimes I will need someone a little bit more specialist I'll often spent days trawling through website after website and photographers and if that website is poor who's taking ages to load or it's not easy to navigate I will just close it and move on to the next one that photography is not getting work because I don't have the time so it's very very important to have a clean easy to access understandable website and I think Squarespace is a really good option for this they have a beautiful range of templates you can pick from they're updating these all the time and what's great about Squarespace is anyone can do it you don't need to install anything there's no patches no upgrades you can do it all through your browser and you can create a beautiful website if you know nothing about how to create a website there are instructions really easy to follow and they've got award-winning 24/7 customer support and now you can even transfer a domain you've bought to Squarespace itself so you don't have multiple vendors you're paying out to most all in one place keeps it nice and simple and you can test it out for free you can just go to the site you can just set up your site you're going to put in credit card details or anything and if once you've set up a test site if you like it then you can go to Squarespace comm forward
