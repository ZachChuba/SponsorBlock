Guys, before we dive on in, I want to give a huge thank
you to today's sponsor Audible. Audible is an app that
I use every single day. At this point in my life,
I feel like I have gotten so busy that I just don't have the time to sit down with a physical book and read. And that's where Audible
makes things so easy. Whenever I'm on the go,
the very first thing I do is just fire up my latest audio
book and it makes the drive to the office, the gym, the grocery store just kind of feel productive. And right now I am listening to The Lost Causes of Bleak
Creek by none other than Rhett and Link. And as such, I feel like it is only fitting
for that to be this month's selection for the Super Carlin
Brothers Audio Book Club. We will be hosting that over
on our Twitch channel on December 12th at 7:00 PM
Eastern standard time. Link to that is in the
description down below, and also mark your calendars. If you'd like to tune
in and get your own copy of The Lost Causes of Bleak
Creek and two Audible originals, and you can do so by
going to audible.com/SCB or simply text SCB to 500-500. Again, guys, if you want to get started with your free 30 day trial, that comes with a free
audio book plus access to two audible originals
you can do so by going to audible.com/SCB or
simply text SCB to 500-500.
