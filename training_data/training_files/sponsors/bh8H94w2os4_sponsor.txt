like this I highly recommend you check out curiosity stream the sponsors for this video their streaming service that provides documentary content like the video you're watching right now offering research insights with quality top of the line editing I personally am a big fan of learning more about the way the world works so I was able to find a documentary right away asking the question what is reality then answering that question from a brain-based scientific perspective not what I was expecting out of the documentary but it made it all the more interesting because of that plans start at $2.99 per month or $19.99 per year but if you sign up with the link in the description below you can get 30 days absolutely free on the website so check out curiosity stream and some of the documentaries they have to offer absolutely free
