sponsoring this video if you need a new website or domain they really are a brilliant option they have a load of beautifully designed templates and it's very very easy to use as a website but the thing that's really impressed me this year is their e-commerce functionality so as you know I have been selling books this year and there are still a few available and I've also just loaded up onto the website ten prints there are a two limited edition and a three open editions and they are the 10 best selects from the book and that's what I'll be doing every year from now and is a book and ten prints come the end of the year they'll disappear and it'll be a new set again I was very nervous about putting a store live and how it would work and would I be able to manage it on my own but it was so simple I I designed and put the store together in an hour hour and a half and the ordering system is so easy I get orders through on the website itself I get email notifications and I have an app which is brilliant where I can see the orders coming in I can write addresses on to envelopes take them down to the post office and while I'm at the post office I can hit fulfill on those orders and all those people are sent emails letting them know that their parcel is on the way so if you're looking for an e-commerce website to definitely check them out they're a brilliant option start your free trial today at squarespace.com and
