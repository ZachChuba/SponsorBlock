Dave, over on Here’s the Bad Version has
an idea for a solution: An app. You’d scan your phone when you buy it, tell
it how often you wanna upgrade, and then it sends you a notification when it’s the best
time to sell. I’m 100% serious when I say I think this
could be a multi-million dollar startup, someone just needs to program it. You could design the app to make predictions
about how the value of your phone might change in the future, for example, with the machine
learning course on Brilliant, which teaches you, step by step, intuitively, with its computer
science and math courses. Their Computer Science Algorithms course will
teach you the concepts behind how you might design the app to scan the iPhone’s barcode
and then generate an eBay listing when the user is ready. In my programming classes, I noticed that
I learned a lot faster when I was actually making something versus when I was just studying
arbitrarily. Plus, it’s just more fun to make something. Brilliant thinks the same way - instead of
“Here’s this new concept, now just store it in the back of your head”, its Daily
