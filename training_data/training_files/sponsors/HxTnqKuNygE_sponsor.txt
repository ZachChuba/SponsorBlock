This is the fifth video in a series about
time and entropy made in collaboration with physicist Sean Carroll. This final video is supported by Audible.com,
a leading provider of audiobooks including fiction, non-fiction and periodicals. The videos in this series are based off of
Sean’s book “The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself,”
which is available, read by him, on Audible. You can listen to “The Big Picture” or
another book of your choice – but really, check out “The Big Picture” – for free,
with a free 30-day trial at Audible.com/minutephysics. Again, that’s audible.com/minutephysics.
