coz Audible is amazing, it's like the best audiobook platform ever. They are actually sponsoring this video. I just didn't know that
when I filmed the video a few weeks ago. And I've been using them
for the last like two years and it's just like one
of the best 7.99 a month that I spend on anything period. Because when I'm in the
car or when I'm at the gym, I can be listening to audiobooks. And when it comes to audiobooks,
I tend to listen to fiction rather than nonfiction. I think nonfiction, it's
better to read on Kindle because then you can highlight stuff, you can skim a lot easier. Whereas fiction, you
know, it's kind of going and the narrators are usually very good. At the moment I'm listening
to "The Wheel of Time" series by I don't even know who it's by but it's pretty good and I'm about halfway
through the first book and I just kind of put that
on when I'm at the gym. If you don't have an audible subscription, highly recommend follow the
link audible.com/aliabdaal and I think it'll give
like a 30 day free trial and a free audiobook and
two free Audible originals some something like that
you should have a look. Yes, that is correct. You can go to audible.com/aliabdaal or you can text aliabdaal to 500-500. And with that code, you
will get a free 30 day trial and you'll get one free
audiobook of your choice along with two free audible originals, so you really might as well give it a shot it is genuinely amazing. As you hopefully saw from
my unadulterated opinion, when I didn't know this was
a sponsored video but yeah, audible.com/aliabdaal or text
aliabdaal to 500-500 yeah. Sign up to Audible it's the
best 7.99 a month that I spend.
