This video was brought to you by CuriosityStream,
a streaming service with thousands of documentaries on science, history, nature and technology,
and much, much more. I could argue that it’s a great place to
learn more about the natural world, the different frames that exist in relation to it, and how
they interact with each other in our society, but if you’re anything like me, you’re
going to use to watch documentaries on dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. They have tons of those. Unlimited access starts at the low price of
just 2.99 a month, and you can get the first 31 days for free by going to curiositystream.com/likestoriesofold and using the promo code ‘likestoriesofold’. But, it doesn’t end there, because if you
sign up to CuriosityStream, you’ll also get unlimited access to Nebula, a brand new collaborative project between me 
and many other creators, where you can watch our videos ad-free, and where your support means your directly supporting us. You can follow all your favorite creators,
and even see some exclusive Nebula originals. Again, all of this is included in 
your CuriosityStream subscription. So be sure to check out curiositystream.com/likestoriesofold, use the promo code ‘likestoriesofold’, and start enjoying the countless hours of
content, today.
