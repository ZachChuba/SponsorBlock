shout out to expressvpn for sponsoring this video so if you like me and you feel like you've watched nearly everything online the number one thing you need is expressvpn see streaming services like Netflix have different shows and movies available in different countries which means there are titles out there that you didn't even know that you don't have access to but expressvpn lets you change your location which essentially unlocks all these different shows and titles that Netflix and other streaming services have so I've been using expressvpn to watch Star Trek discovery which is only available for Netflix in the UK it was pretty easy you just fire up the expressvpn app change the location to the UK and then refresh Netflix or whatever service you're using and that's it it's fast it works on a computer or on my phone or even on the TV so you can watch these new things on a big screen look you've heard me talk about VPNs before and why they're so important for online security and privacy but expressvpn is the one I trust because they explicitly do not track any of your online activity and they've even gone above and beyond to engineer every single one of their VPN servers to run only in RAM which means even if there was a bit of data tracked which there isn't it would be gone with a reboot so thanks to them being such a good partner with the channel I'm giving away three extra months of expressvpn for free so if you want to take advantage of this content boosting VPN feel free to head over to expressvpn comm slash mkbhd so
