Perhaps we can start using machine learning algorithms to analyze and suggest changes to optimize our cities. Machine learning is a fantastic tool for when humans fall short of a complicated challenge, and you could learn more about it using this course on Brilliant. The first three classes in linear regression, linear classification, and trees are already available to get you started on what will likely be one of the most in demand skills for future programmers. With other more advanced classes in things like optimization coming soon. Brilliant is a problem solving site that helps you think like an engineer, by guiding you through problems that are broken into digestible sections, that bring you from knowing nothing, to having a deep understanding of the topic. What I love is that when you answer something incorrectly, it even tells you exactly why, so you can correct your misconceptions.
