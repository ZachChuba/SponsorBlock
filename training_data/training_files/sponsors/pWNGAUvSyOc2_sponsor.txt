But what we can say with certainty is how
to get a free audiobook—you head to audible.com/HAI. As you probably know, Audible is a leading
provider of audiobooks and other spoken word entertainment. They have thousands of great
titles and there are some audiobooks that you can only find on Audible like Artemis
by Andy Weir—the author of the Martian—which I highly recommend. What’s amazing about
Audible is they stand behind their product— if you don’t like what you’ve listened
to you can swap it out for another one with their Great Listen Guarantee. Once you try
out your free book, membership includes one free title a month and 30% off everything
else. I love audiobooks because you can essentially read no matter what you’re doing and I’m
sure you will too so it’s worth going and trying out a book for free with their 30-day
free trial at audible.com/HAI.
