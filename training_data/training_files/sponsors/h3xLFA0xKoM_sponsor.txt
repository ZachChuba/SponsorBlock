And one resource that can help
you in both of those areas at the same time is Brilliant. Brilliant is a learning platform that helps you efficiently master math, science and computer
science through a library of more than 50 in depth courses that all focus on active learning. When you're going through
a course on Brilliant, you're not just passively
in taking information, you're instead immediately
tackling challenging, yet bite size problems that
are laid out in a logical order and they will help you
stay interested longer and learn faster and boost your general problem
solving skills along the way. Now, in their library, you'll find courses on
Calculus, on Probability, Gravitational Physics, Python Programming, and lots, lots more. Plus their daily challenges
feature gives you new problems to solve every single day
in a variety of areas, which can help you make
learning a daily habit. So to get started for free, head over to
