I was one of those people, working 12 hour
shifts with only one task. Weigh a stent and pass it to the next step. During that time I made extra efforts to learn
new skills outside of work to keep myself sane. One way to learn new skills is through Skillshare,
and why not start by learning about the stock market with this course from my friends at
Business Casual, who I have also just made a video about Henry Ford’s rise to success
on their channel. This is just one in over 20,000 classes you
could take on Skillshare. That range from creative skills like painting
and music lessons to technical skills like coding. With professional and understandable classes,
that follow a clear learning curve, you can dive in and start learning how to do the work
you love. .
