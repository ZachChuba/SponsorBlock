Hello viewer, you know, asking for help isn't easy, is it? I know that for a fact, I've been that way pretty much my whole life. But if I'm gonna do YouTube full-time to the best of my ability, I gotta learn to ask for help, and luckily you guys helped convince me to ask a sponsor, and Filmora was happy enough to oblige. They make budget video editing software that's really easy to use, and I can say that because I've actually used it, it's my life. The thing about it, is it resembles professional software so much that I could literally install it, and use it immediately. But you don't have to take my word for it, you can download it yourself for a free trial that requires no signup or anything like that, just install and use. And not only that, they're also giving away an iPhone 11 as part of their Vlogmas giveaway. You make a small video and you can be in turn to win one of them. It's really nice, check the link in the description if you're interested. Great. Thank you for being patient. On to the episode.
