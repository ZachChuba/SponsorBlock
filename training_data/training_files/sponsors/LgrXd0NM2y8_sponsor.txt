I would recommend to you. It is called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
by Thomas S. Kuhn. This is a classic in the history and
philosophy of science. And it'll make you see science
in a different way because it shows us that
science is not just one process but there are actually
revolutions that take place when big discoveries are made. And that really changed
my thinking about science when I first read this book
ten years ago. So you can check it out by going to
audible.com/veritasium downloaded for free and
try out the Audible service.
