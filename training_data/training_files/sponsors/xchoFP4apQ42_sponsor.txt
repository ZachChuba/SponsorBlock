The best thing you can do for yourself on
your Android, or even iOS phone is learning something new. With Brilliant's app, you get
interactive courses that let you solve fascinating problems in math, science, and computer science
from anywhere. What's awesome about these courses is that they're all totally
interactive. You will experiment with pendulum clocks to
master the physics of motion, use rockets to model algebraic functions, and learn probability
by playing blackjack. There are new challenges for you to tackle every day, and if you are
on iOS you can even download courses and solve them when you are offline. This is apparently coming to Android soon as well. So if you want to support TechAltar and get unlimited access to all of Brilliant's in-depth
math and science courses, you can head over to brilliant.org/techaltar/Â to get 20% off
your annual Premium subscription.
