Oh crap. Actually, that's okay
because I have Dashlane. Dashlane makes keeping track of
all your passwords ridiculously easy. Not only is it gonna prevent North Korea from spying
on you, yeah you, because that's likely to happen. But it'll store all your passwords in one super-secure
place, and auto fill them on websites you go to. If you have the same password everywhere, but are too lazy to go to each individual website to change your passwords, well, not a problem. Because you can just click one button
on the Dashlane app, and it does it for you. Dashlane also has a password generator, so you don't have to spend time thinking
up super strong passwords like this one. By going to dashlane.com/kentobento,
you can get started for free. And, if you want some
extra special features like syncing your passwords and
login details between all your devices like IOS, Android, Mac, and Windows, you can upgrade for 10% off by using the
promo code KENTOBENTO at checkout.
