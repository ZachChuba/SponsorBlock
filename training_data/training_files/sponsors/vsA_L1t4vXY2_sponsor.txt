If you’re a totally legitimate billionaire
who hides your wealth in multi-hundred million dollars pieces of art, you’re probably pretty
busy which means you might not have a lot of time to read, but you can still listen
to books with Audible. Audible is the best place to get audiobooks
and other spoken-word entertainment. I use it regularly because there are a lot
of times I can’t read like when editing, doing the dishes, or driving but I can listen
to books. Now, I’m sure many of you have already read
or listened to this book, but if you haven’t I highly recommend you use your Audible free
trial to listen to Ready Player One, especially since the movie of it comes out next month. You can get this or one of any of their thousands
of other podcasts for free by signing up today at audible.com/hai.
