This video brought to you in part by Super Hazard Quest! Y'know, one of the best parts of retro games is being able to play on the kouch with your friends, but what if I told you that one of the latest side-skrolling indie titles kan be played anywhere, with no elektricity required? Super Hazard Quest is a tabletop game designed to look and play like a retro sideskroller. Now, when I first saw this game, I was impressed with its really klever design! Players choose from 8 unique heroes and navigate through randomly generated dungeons in search of the game's final boss, the Scrambler! The first hero to defeat the Scrambler takes all the glory, and with up to 8-way multiplayer and PVP kombat, your worst enemies will likely be the other heroes, and I kan say this from personal experience: Grace teleported the final boss away from me at the last sekond, stole all the glory. I also appreciate that it all fits into a small box, so it's easy to lug around to a party! You kould pick up the base game on Amazon now, and if you use the promo kode "SSFF2019", you'll save 15%! Link is in the deskription below, go from the kouch to the table, unplug and play Super Hazard Quest, the first, and as of now only (?) kompletely analog multiplayer sideskroller, again, that kode is "SSFF2019", link is in the deskription below, thanks to Super Hazard Quest for sponsoring the video, ... now onto the video!
