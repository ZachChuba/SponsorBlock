the postal delivery truck? Let them be known in the comments! This video's sponsor, Dashlane, cares about
improving the future through technology, too. Thatâ€™s why they want to protect your online
accounts by providing a tool that generates strong passwords. It stores them in memory, and autofills on
whatever site you want, across all your devices. Sound cool? Here's the best part - you can use it for
FREE. Follow the link in the description and in
just a few minutes, you can get set up. If you find you LIKE it, then you can upgrade
to their Premium version with even cooler features, like a VPN and Secure Account Backup
which puts your account info in the cloud so you'll always have a copy to restore it
from if anything happens to your device. Go to dashlane.com/austinmcconnell and you
can try PREMIUM service for a whole month, for FREE. If you wanna stick with it after that, use
