And today I wanna
talk to you about one of our favorite
places to watch movies, MUBI. MUBI is a treasure
trove of films. Everyday, MUBI
premieres a new film, whether its a movie
you’ve been dying to see or one you’ve
never heard of before— there’s always something
new to discover. So in this world
where it’s very easy to spend hours
debating what you should watch, MUBI
is like having a really cool friend with amazing
taste in movies making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to
come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings,
influential art house and foreign films,
lesser known films by your favorite famous
directors, and more. Plus, you can even
download the films to watch offline and
there are no ads, ever. One movie you can
check out right now on MUBI is Sleepwalk,
Sara Driver’s directorial debut. In this fantasy-drama,
a woman finds that an ancient Chinese
manuscript has powers that begin to take
over her life. We can’t recommend
MUBI highly enough. You can try it out now
for free for a whole month. Just click the link
in the description below.
