Then going right back to working on her Squarespace website or something sidenote if you go to Squarespace.com/alex You can save 10% off your first purchase, build yourself up a website like my teacher. "I had no idea it was so easy to build a website you get an A." No way around it This is a sponsored video But the cool thing about it is that I don't wanted to redo my website for a while and thanks to Squarespace I think it's gonna happen. I know you're sitting there typing in the comments "Gee willikers Alex. That's so neat sponsored by Squarespace, whaaat?" That's right. No plugins no updates. No patches. Ever. the last time I wrote my website I didn't know how to like code and stuff now instead I can focus on what you guys would want on a site So for real if you're gonna come to my website What would you want to see what do you want to know about me that you don't get right here? Or to build your own website like many Clarker already have visit Squarespace.com/alex. That said let's get back to the story
