speaking of my insides feeling last wow Savage dirt oh that's highly applicable yeah um oh there's a Moho habanero oh that's a hot level but not a maximum level I actually want to try that I'm gonna have some maple buffalo bacon first though because I'm just like so excited right now a savage jerky they set out with the goal of making a delicious snack that's not bad for you they may make their jerky without nitrates or preservatives and they've got 13 different flavors like their sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon which is my personal favorite and they also make barbecue sauce which I actually haven't tried but I really want to now because they also make hot sauce which is flippin awesome I've got hot sauce I took home so so far all I had put it on was like some pasta that's normal things that a normal thing putting hot sauce on like I'm like I actually don't know but I did it too so like just a red sauce meat pasta yeah alright that's gotta be ok it's whatever it's good that's awesome meat with hot sauce make sense hadn't had it on a burger yet oh I still have a net on look sharp cheddar cheese burger a little bit of hot sauce on there oh it was so good what is the one that you go I don't remember but I'm just gonna like I'm gonna hold on to the jar and make sure that I get the same one because I'm I'm the kind of person that once I find something I like I don't tend to branch out much so I'm just doing this chicken boxes that we no longer have access yeah but I mean that was something where like Ike I was kind of forced to try it by the sponsor spot that we were doing we were featuring their hot sauce I didn't want to like talk about how great it is without having tried it so yeah I need to try it I was like wow this is good the Tabasco is is done yes I know Tabasco is like the world's most boring hot sauce but it was it was like what I was used to and I don't I don't look I don't switch but I switched I don't regret it anyway they have a trick or treat

supposed to be the the three videos see that that's what I didn't tell you about the beginning okay so you click on one we talked about it till that video ends and you click on the next one we keep talking occluding the next one we keep talking neat that's what's on screen during this book so this video is brought to you by smartdeploy smart so I I started now yeah wow look at that wow this is so slick and fancy yeah smartdeploy is a modern computer imaging software that offers IT control and efficiency through centralized single image management and pre-built device driver packages if you work in IT you might be familiar with old-school disk cloning tools because back in the day you needed a separate image for each computer model and when you have thousands of users it can be pretty tricky to keep a library of ten plus images up to date that haha there goes another one is why smartdeploy was created its hardware independent so it allows you to deploy just one image to any computer model so you can download smart deploy and search their library of over 1200 platform packs we checked out the business class models that we have here at Linus Media Group and they have a ton they also offer one-click user data migration for simplified migrations to Windows 10 and 0 touch network deployment imaging over the Internet so you can set it up in and after so we're giving away 50 and free licenses oh that's pretty cool with one year of support to our viewers so that's six hundred and fifty five bucks worth of free IT software if you're not 19 then you don't have to take it but you could send it to your friend and I t-that would be a good idea so if you work at a company with 50 to 50 thousand computers head to smartdeploy comm forward slash Linus and claim your free smartdeploy licenses it's kind of neat like they gave us this whole thing that I don't think we're gonna make it all the way through but I think you guys mostly get the point oh there's the platform packs surface book surface book - Wow then oh yes no surface book - is not the one that's like very very new that's just the one
