continue I just want to say that hey I feel your pain at the now endless number of streaming services you have to stay subscribe to even though ones like Disney Plus only offers seasonal content and I'm kind of okay with unsub in between now and season two the Mandalorian but that's why privacy calm has been such a godsend to me and by the way thanks to privacy icon for sponsoring this episode privacy lets you pay for things online using virtual burner cards instead of your real credit cards that way you can protect your identity and banking information when you're shopping online but also you can control the limits on those burner cards so for example I've set up an account with privacy and I've linked my bank account created a card specifically for my monthly Netflix subscription payment so privacy will ding you with lightning-fast precision if someone tries to charge the card twice or the charge exceeds the amount you set for it so like in a few months when your favorite show leaves Netflix you won't accidentally be stuck paying for another month of fuller house that you don't want no vendor can overcharge beyond the limit that you have set it is simple it's fast it's really just one click they also offer different plans like there's a free plan that lets you create up to 12 cards a month which is great there's also a pro plan where you can get 36 cards a month and 1% cash back on purchases and it seems plan for small businesses they got something for everyone and now there's a privacy Chrome extension where you can fill out all of your card info to save time one click and all your details are instantly entered just head to privacy comm slash new rockstars and sign up for an account and as a special treat for my viewers new customers will automatically get five dollars to spend on your first purchase for a limited time only yep that's three money folks just go to
