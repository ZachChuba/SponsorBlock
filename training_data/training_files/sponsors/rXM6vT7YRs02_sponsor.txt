Deal?” Hey guys this is Grace
and today I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places to watch movies,
Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove
of films from around the globe. Everyday a new film is added
and the oldest is taken away. So in this world
where it’s very easy to spend hours debating
what you should watch, Mubi is like having
a really cool friend with amazing taste in movies
making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to come by masterpieces,
indie festival darlings, influential arthouse
and foreign films, lesser known films
by your favorite famous directors, and more. Plus,
you can even download the films to watch offline. And there are no ads, ever. One movie you can watch
right now on Mubi is Citizen Four. Laura Poirtras’s
Oscar winning documentary gives a first person look
at whistleblower Edward Snowden’s meetings with her and journalist Glen Greenwald, as Snowden exposed the NSA’S
surveillance tactics. We can’t recommend Mubi
highly enough. You can try it out right now for free for a whole month. Just click the link in the description below.
