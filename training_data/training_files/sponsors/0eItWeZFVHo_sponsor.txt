And one place where you
can find those courses that I wanna let you know about is Skillshare, who's actually
the sponsor of this video. Now Skillshare is an
online learning community that has over 12,000 courses
in a ton of different subjects. And I've actually been
taking a few of those in After Effects animation, but they also have courses in photography, graphic design, logo design, and things like cooking,
guitar, presentation skills. In fact, they have a
presentation skills class from Simon Sinek who
gave probably my favorite TED talk of all time. But one of the reasons
I really like Skillshare is that it gives you the
ability to get feedback from both your teacher
and from other people who are taking the same course. There's two ways it does this. Number one, below the videos
in any course you're taking there's a comments section. And if you ask a question,
you can get an answer from the course instructor. But also, most of the
courses on Skillshare have a participation component. Basically there is a project
section of the course where you can upload your
own work for feedback. Now a membership to Skillshare is normally around $8 a month, which is right around the
same price as Netflix, and potentially a lot more useful. But, if you wanna get three months of completely unlimited use on Skillshare, you can get it for 99
cents by using the link in the description below, and I'll have a few
more details about that at the end of the video.
