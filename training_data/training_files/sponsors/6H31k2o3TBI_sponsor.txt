And I'd like to take a quick
minute to thank today's sponsor for this episode,
which are the fine folks over at Squarespace, and I love
working with these guys, because it's a product and
service that I believe in, I've been using them myself
for more than five years, so. If you have no experience
on the web or designing a store or a blog or a website
or a cover page, whatever it is that you need, it's
an all-in-one platform that they have and it's
all taken care of for you, there's nothing to
upgrade, install, patch. Gone are the days, tons
of beautiful award-winning designer templates to choose
from, you're up and running in no time, you've got
24/7 award-winning customer service, you're never left
hanging, they make domains easy, and if you want to save a
big of money, head over to squarespace.com/mckinnon, I
can knock 10% off your first purchase if you put McKinnon
in the little code box there at checkout, highly recommend
that, link is in the description below, I'll
put it there for you guys, so you guys don't have to
type, you just, I'll make it easy, just like they do,
ho ho, see what I did there? Thank you.
