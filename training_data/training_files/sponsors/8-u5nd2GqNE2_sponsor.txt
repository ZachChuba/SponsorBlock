If you want to help make sure others are alive
and well, you should try out Tab for a Cause. Tab for a Cause is a browser extension that
displays ads every time you open a new tab, except the money raised from those ads goes
to different charities that you choose. The average user generates about $5 per month
towards charity which isn’t nothing. That’s $60 per year which with water.org,
is enough to give safe water and sanitation to one family. Just by having this browser extension which
costs you nothing, you can change a family’s life once per year, which is crazy. So make the easiest impact you will ever make
by installing this browser extension at the link in the description.
