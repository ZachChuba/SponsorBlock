Hey, I wanna give a huge
thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. Squarespace is the best
way, the easiest way, to build a website. I've used Squarespace for a
bunch of my different projects. For the book that I'm writing
over at realoriginsbook.com, and my own personal website, which is really just an
excuse for me to put my face on more things. They've got these beautiful templates that are also highly customizable so that your site can stand out
and doesn't have to look like everyone else's. In fact, just this year they
added eight new templates to really get your creative juices going on whatever project
that you're working on. And because Squarespace
loves you wonderful nerds, they're gonna help you
get started right away. Even easier, even faster, even better. Just head on over to Squarespace
and start your free trial. Start experimenting and building there, and when you're ready to check out, when you're ready to launch
your next big project, head on over to Squarespace.com/NerdSync and save 10% off of your
first purchase of a website or a domain. So, if you're ready to
launch your new business, go out there and make it. And get started with Squarespace.
