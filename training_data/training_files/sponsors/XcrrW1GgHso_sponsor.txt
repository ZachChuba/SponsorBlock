and it gets you access thousands of documentaries, as well as complimentary access to Nebula
for as long as you're a subscriber, and use the link in this episode’s description,
curiositystream.com/isaacarthur. We started Nebula up as a way for education-focused
independent creators to try out new content that might not work too well on Youtube, where
algorithms might not be too kind to some topics or demonetize certain ones entirely and I’m
very glad that we’re partnering up with CuriosityStream as we get ready to invite
in more creators and bring more content to Nebula. So now in addition all of CuriosityStream’s
great educational content, you’ll be able see videos from independent creators like
CGP Grey, MinutePhysics, Wendover, and of course, myself, just remember to use the link
in the video description when signing up.
