In this video I used some basic statistical techniques and analyzed scientific literature to apply real science to fantasy. I have some expertise in these fields, what with the master's degree and the PhD, but you don't have to spend eight years at university to learn how to use these skills and do this kind of analysis. If you found this video interesting then you might want to take a look at brilliant.org. Brilliant is an educational website appropriate for students from age 12 to age 200 who would like to learn by getting their hands dirty and solving problems. What I did in this video is an example of
how you learn on brilliant.org. You learn a new idea or fact and apply your knowledge to some new situation. And just like in this video if you get that wrong, it's absolutely fine. By making mistakes you allow yourself to improve. It highlights things that you might have misconceived or misremembered and allows you to improve your understanding. I can't guarantee that your understanding will involve dragons however. The fastest way to learn a new skill is to simply try using it and learn from your mistakes in an intelligent way. You can use parts of brilliant for free, so there's really no excuse to not check it out. And you can also get a premium account for either yourself or as a gift for a student you know. Which gives access to their fantastic guided courses. If you're interested in getting a premium account then use the link in the description and the first 200 people to do so will get 20% off.
