thing but if you really want to ground
your understanding nothing beats working through practical problems like the ones
on brilliant org. That's what I did while I was researching this video. Brilliant
is a learning website which focuses on math, physics and computer science.
There's an awesome course on number theory which extremely conveniently had
a whole section on infinity. It has a lot of concepts that were included in this
video like cardinality and the different kinds
of infinity, and a lot that weren't like showing infinite series through geometry,
a way I'd never seen it taught before. It was actually so cool to see a visual
representation like that. A subscription will get you access to all of these
courses. Signing up is free and brilliant is offering a 20% discount to their
