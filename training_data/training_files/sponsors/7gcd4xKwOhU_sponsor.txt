this video is sponsored by kaspersky if you've been watching this channel for a while you probably know them by now they're one of the leading companies when it comes to endpoint protection home security all of those things and since they have an excellent track record in our own tasks in this segment we're actually going just demonstrate kaspersky total security and how it could protect you against ransomware like the ones we just saw in the video so we have the same five samples that you saw in the video and now we're going to automate their execution and we'll just see what happens so as you can see dark side was blocked we got a notification it happened pretty fast so let's just go back through the logs so patio was instantly blocked so was our evil so as for locker so was wannacry and and if we scroll up darkside was blocked as well now in order to make this even more interesting we're actually going to go ahead and disable most of the protection components so that we can better emulate what would happen if these threats were say brand new and kaspersky didn't know about them so we'll turn off file antivirus as well as application control so the only thing we're going to have enabled is system watcher which is supposed to protect us from ransomware and other crypto lockers and roll back any changes that they make now we're going to go ahead and restart the test as you can see we've got all of the ransomware back in the same folder we've replaced them with new copies and we'll see what happens in this configuration and of course it's going to say it's being missed because we are looking at the behavioral protection here so we'll see if there's actual encryption that takes place on the system so we'll see if our pictures or documents are affected we're getting notifications saying the processes are being terminated system watcher is taking action get the disinfection prompt getting registry keys being removed we can see some of the behaviors being locked by our program and all of this is being denied and as you can see we still have all of our files they're totally fine if we open this up we have beautiful play from shakespeare working just fine if we go back to our pictures we still have all our wallpapers so there you have it that's kaspersky total security please check it out using the link in the description show them some love for sponsoring this video also if you want to see tasks on kaspersky we have done independent tests as we often
