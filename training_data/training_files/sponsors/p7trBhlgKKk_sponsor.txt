how cool is that? Let me tell you what I've been learning with Skillshare recently, they're the sponsor of this video. It's the same old story really but just a different context, this time the context is photo editing. So as part of my job on YouTube, I do edit stills photos sometimes, is that classic thing, like, I've just been mucking through trying to work it out for myself, and basically getting it
to work, but the whole time not necessarily understanding
really what I'm doing and I'm sure I've learned
some bad habits along the way, it's got to that point
where I'm just thinking, I just need to sit down
in front of someone for like an hour or so,
literally just an hour or so, and they can tell me look, this is the way you should
be doing it and this is why, so that I then have that foundation so that any self learning I do after that, is just gonna rapidly increase my skill because I have that
foundation of understanding. When I get to the end of this course, it's called fundamentals in photo editing, I might decide to go a bit further, there are courses that dive
even deeper if I want to. And it's not just about photo editing, there's loads of different creative stuff, animation, interior design, illustration web design, loads of stuff, business related stuff like productivity, and maybe you've been learning
a new skill on and off, mucking through, figuring out for yourself and you think maybe it's time to sit down with someone literally for an hour or so, to just get those
fundamentals absolutely right. And they're bite-sized
chunks so you can fit them in around everything else
you're doing like I do. You get access to absolutely everything for just $10 a month, and because Skillshare
is sponsoring this video, the first 500 people to
go to skl.sh/stevemould9 will get two months absolutely free.
