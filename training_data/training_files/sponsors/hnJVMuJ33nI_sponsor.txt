Hey guys, this is Alani. And today I wanna talk to you about one
of our favorite places to watch
movies. MUBI. MUBI is a treasure
trove of films. Everyday, MUBI
premieres a new film whether it’s a movie
you’ve been dying to see or one you’ve
never heard of before. There’s always something
new to discover. So, in this world where
it’s very easy to spend hours debating what
you should watch, MUBI is like having
a really cool friend with amazing taste in
movies, making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to
come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings,
influential art house and foreign films, lesser-known
films by your favorite famous directors,
and more. Plus, you can even
download the films to watch offline and
there are no ads--ever. To celebrate Halloween,
this October, MUBI is presenting a series
dedicated to the legendary Dario
Argento featuring a selection of the horror icon’s
best movies. You can check out films
like Inferno, Deep Red and more. We can’t recommend
MUBI highly enough. You can try it out now
for free for a whole month. Just click the link in
the description below.
