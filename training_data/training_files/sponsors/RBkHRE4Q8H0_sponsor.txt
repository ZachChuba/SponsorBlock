item what do you think of these boxers really important question let's see they're pretty cool have you tried them 10 out of 10 would wear 4 out of 10 personally would not wear I want to know your opinion I actually I actually quite I actually quite liked them I think we might make the the design print it a little bit bigger like a little more coarse so that the LT tees are bigger the lines are bigger and there's fuel and I think it's a little bit busy right now ya wouldn't notice the ltte actually yeah just at first glance but the - tech tips on the top is nice yep and so there you go there you go where uh anyway that's not actually what I wanted to ask you yeah I'm just I'm just promoting our merch no the real thing I wanted to ask you was knowing this knowing that the top-performing systems the ones from iBUYPOWER and the ones from and from HP so those two were the highest performance so knowing that they outperform the main gear by a significant margin like double digits they're not twice as fast but I think they're about 20 to 30 percent faster in in games okay so knowing that what would you go back and buy like honest-to-goodness as as a customer who cares about the entire experience because that's the thing as a customer you will have more than just the experience of owning the final product do you do you value do you value those other things or do you just want the best thing for your dollar and you put up with potentially a couple hours on the phone with tech support to resolve it hmm so I guess I feel like vetoing HP just because but like I said I don't like making phone calls and when you expect to spend an hour on the phone every time you have to phone them that would deter me greatly however if it's my computer or if I'm giving it away hold that thought for one second so it's interesting that you said that so would you veto HP over Alienware because Alienware took a long time to solve your problem but they just took a long time to solve your problem you didn't get bounced around the same way so I think HP only ended up taking about another 15 minutes so it was like an hour versus an hour 15 or something like that don't don't quote me on the exact numbers but did Alienware stand out in your mind far less just because you didn't have this this endless loop of frustration and transfers apparently yeah I'm not sure how it all plays into what I would actually purchase yeah well why don't we why don't we say this then so I'll give you two scenarios scenario number one our our mock sort of premise is real so scenario number one is you're buying a system for your brother you're a super nice sister who has 1500 US dollars to spend on a brother for some reason Wow good on you by the way heck yeah which one do you buy okay making decisions with so many things to consider yeah okay so first for my brother I would definitely apparently he's an avid gamer not for real but we're pretending yeah sure so I think in the end because it's a gift I would just like well I went through the hard stuff for him now I can give him this really good computer so I would probably go for like best bang for your buck really so you'd go iBUYPOWER because okay the the research the pre research essentially that you have to do in order to get the best thing and the but remembering though that i buy power i think did reasonably well on pre-sales and they only really screwed things up on tech support so if i'm giving this to my brother who is an avid gamer you know so you I see so you would just go the best hardware that fits inside the box that it fits in for the money that you have and if the RAM is broken or whatever you just go well you know what I've kind of done most of my job here here's a free thing don't complain too hard if you have to invest a couple hours into making it work right to be honest I would give it to him having no idea that anything was wrong because I would not think to start up the computer be fortunate interesting nor would I know how to check those things Ivan told me how to check that okay I like that okay okay so then question number two now it's for you actually no no I have a new question question number two it's for your parents so they are I'm making assumptions here I'm making assumptions forgive me I'm assuming they are less tech-savvy than you is that fair I would say nowadays they are my dad used to be all up on computers in the 90s while ago he didn't keep up so anyway yes as of now they would probably greatly value tech support although my dad hates being on the phone even more than I do so let's see I would swallow the buy like presale phone support just kind of like hey this is what I'm doing to get something for my parents so it come down to tech support and I guess like longevity sure just because then I don't have to do this all kind of thing right so that doesn't really help because we tested them they're gaming PCs and they're yes and we tested them for gaming so I'm not sure which brand would be the best for this scenario so I mean we can kind of draw parallels between in general we can draw parallels between the gaming performance of the system and its performance across a pretty wide range of tasks actually so you know if it's 20 to 30 percent faster for gaming to get the iBUYPOWER or the HP compared to the main gear then you can kind of assume it'll be that similar let's just let's just say that for the sake of argument okay and is that the same for like how long something lasts or we will continue to be faster none of them really none of them really stood out as using very shoddy components it's a little bit complicated so I would say origin actually probably had I'm just trying to remember who everyone even was I think Origen probably had the highest tier motherboard and power supply which is generally something that affects the longevity of a system more than other things but origins spec was much lower than both alien wares and main gears so you kind of had those three performance tiers you had iBUYPOWER and HP and then way down from there for gaming anyway you had your Alienware and your main gear and then down from there you had origin okay so taking everything into consideration I did appreciate main years tech support as well as pre-sales and I it did feel like they just cared enough about you to like not even have any ounce of like you don't feel I disqualified because you don't know much about computers or I don't know what you're talking about cool so yeah so probably then and then would you do the same thing for yourself or would you have other considerations I'm just I'm curious that's my last clip last question for now I'm just gonna go with probably the same kind of like a bit of bang for your buck but I want it to last long and then not knowing much or since I work here I would probably rely on some people around here to help me out with tech support but if I was completely on my own
