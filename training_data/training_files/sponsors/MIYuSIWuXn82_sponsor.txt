Before we get back into the show with Phili D, I just wanna give a thank you to our sponsor: AUDIBLE! Who has graciously supported our show. Now, Audible is a platform for listening to audio books and they have an UNMATCHED selection. I love listening to Audible when I'm playing video games, jogging -*scoff*, which you know I do a lot-, and just hanging out! Anytime you're hanging out, driving, put on an audio book. It makes it INSTANTLY way better and way more entertaining. The book that I'm listening to right now is based on the hit Netflix documentary called "Making a Murderer". Which I know a lot of people saw, about this guy who was wrongly convicted of murder. TWICE! And now there's new books come out called "Indefensible" the missing truth about Steven Avery. And it's written from the opposite side: the prosecutor! And they're talking about how the documentary omitted all these really interesting facts about how he actually did the crime. This was a fascinating look into the other side of the argument. And I highly recommend this book. Especially if you're a fan of the series. For our audience, Audible is offering a thirty day free trial and a free audio book if you use our link: Support the show. Support our wonderful sponsor. Get a great book. It's a win/win guys!
