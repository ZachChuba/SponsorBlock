Speaking of swinging, I'm swinging right into
this sponsor segue. Storyblocks video gets you studio quality stock video clips for a fraction of the cost. You can download all the
stock video your heart desires from their member library, including HD and 4K footage,
AfterEffects templates, motion backgrounds and more. We use it quite a bit on
our Techquickie channel and all the content is royalty-free, so you can use it for
commercial and personal projects such as YouTube videos or YouTube videos or anything else. Just for us, it's commercial. New clips get added regularly so there's always something
fresh to download. Check it out today at the
