If you want to make sure your digital life
is more secure than the bank vault in this video, then I highly recommend using a password
manager to generate and securely store a long and unique password for each site and service
you use. I myself have long used and highly recommend
Dashlane, who are sponsoring this video. Dashlane has legitimately improved my online
life - it generates and remembers a long, unique password for each of my internet accounts
so I don’t have to, it lets me know when my passwords are weak or when a site or app
I use has been hacked, it securely stores and with my permission autofills my credit
card, bank account and address info on websites so I don’t have to waste time typing that
stuff in over and over, it lets me securely share passwords with family and coworkers,
and on top of all that, Dashlane is a VPN, too! Dashlane is free for up to 50 passwords for
as long as you like, so you should just go to dashlane.com/minutephysics right now to
check it out. And if you like Dashlane after trying it out
(which I imagine you probably will), the first 200 people get 10% off Dashlane premium by
going to dashlane.com/minutephysics and using promo code minutephysics - Dashlane premium
gets you the VPN, unlimited storage and syncing of passwords, remote account access, and more. Again, that’s dashlane.com/minutephysics
with promo code minutephysics to simplify and secure your online life.
