- [Maaz] All right, as I mentioned, shout out to Filmora 9 Video Editor for sponsoring the video. You guys don't even understand
how good you have it. Interface? Sleek. Filters? Poppin'. Audio and Editing? Intuitive. Eyes? Ocean. Effects? Endless. Want more effects? Film stocks. Seriously, there are so many
effects, like drop shadow, motion spins, up and
down shake, chroma key, and a whole bunch more that
I grabbed from film stocks, like this emoji element set. It wasn't even that hard to use. All I did was click on the effects, scroll down to whichever one I wanted, dragged it onto the video layer, and then wham-bam thank
you ma'am, it's all done. All of this combines together to make Filmora 9 one of the easiest
video editors for beginners. So once again, click on the
link in the description below to have a free download of Filmora 9. - All right, awesome, cue the music.
