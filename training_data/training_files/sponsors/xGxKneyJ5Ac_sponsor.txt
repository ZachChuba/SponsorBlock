called Robo race this whole time you've been looking at their self-driving cars these are electric vehicles driven by increasingly smart ai's developed competitively by teams competitions have a really long history of accelerating technological progress and portions of the code used by Robo race are going to be open source so they're trying to push forward the development of machine learning and autonomous driving in general they're currently in season alpha this is the first round of competitions between teams around the world that developing hardware software and the actual format of what the races are going to be like this is an incredibly exciting time of experimentation and university teams like the Technical University of Munich are able to take part in it without having to commit to the whole race basically Robo race are trying to create an environment where software engineers can develop themselves and also the field check out the playlist in the description for videos all about the technology used in the artificial intelligence and to learn more about season alpha they can also follow them on Instagram and there's a mailing list again mixed in the description over the next couple of months I'm going to be working with Robo race on a couple more videos learning more about the artificial intelligence and I'm really excited seeing some of season alpha self and of course I'm gonna bring you with me thank you to roba race for
