What should really be the fastest object in
human history, though, is your mouse when you hear that you can learn for free for two
months by signing up for Skillshare at skl.sh/hai23. That’s because Skillshare has over 25,000
courses on an enormous variety of subjects so if there’s something you want to learn,
there’s a good chance they have a course on it. One course of theirs that I would highly recommend
is the one on, “Presentation Essentials.” Presenting your ideas effectively in public
speaking is a skill that is bound to get you ahead in business, school, and life and so
the fundamentals that this course teaches you are crucial. Whatever you want to learn, its no risk to
you to try Skillshare out as you can, once again, learn for free for two months by signing
up at skl.sh/hai23.
