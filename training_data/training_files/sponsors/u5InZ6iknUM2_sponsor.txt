Don't forget to stick around
to the end of this video for some more chat with Matt Parker. - You know that feeling when you're presented with a new puzzle. And you go, ooh, ooh, hmm. You start to think about the ways that you're gonna solve this thing? I remember getting that feeling
when I first saw a Sudoku. But here's the thing about the sponsor of this video, Brilliant. It's a website and an app
that basically gives you that feeling every time you pick it up. It's a new puzzle or a new
problem that you gotta solve. Every time you look at it you go, ooh, oh. Brilliant is actually a learning platform. It's designed on this
principle that the best way to learn something is by
doing it for yourself. So, you work through these
puzzles and problems. They've got courses on broad
topics like mechanics or logic. But you can take deep dives into subjects like cryptocurrency or quantum computing. And actually, they've got a
good search function as well. So if you're ever thinking, you know what, I'd like to learn more
about a particular thing. For example, after watching this video, actually, I do want to know
about how lift works on a wing. You could search for
Bernoulli, for example. And start investigating
that stuff through puzzles. Because it's an app as well as a website, I actually get on brilliant
just before going to sleep. Like a lot of people might scroll through social media in
bed or read a book, not me. If you're the sort of person
who sees a new puzzle and goes, hmm, oh, interesting, I recommend
you check out Brilliant. If you go to my special
URL you can check it out for free, no strings attached. Go to brilliant.org/stevemould. The link is also in the description. So, check out Brilliant today.
