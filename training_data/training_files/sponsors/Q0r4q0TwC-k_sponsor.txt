nick is standing here very patiently what can I do for you Nick what's up dude I did okay I actually totally spaced out because I had done it before so you know what we should do our sponsor starting with the LTTE store Ellen GGG slash elemental so imma be completely honest with you folks out there this shirt has not been a great mover for us so we are looking to - boy do I have a deal for you ladies and gentlemen it's actually crazy I'm gonna blame Nick I'm gonna blame Nick oh I'm also gonna blame myself for not wearing them so because we know that whenever I wear stuff on stream it actually I very rarely see you in these shirts I very I very very rarely very rarely wear these ones so they're supposed to be like not super over-the-top branded but just like kind of kind of clean just like our other shirts they're American Apparel so they are super comfy and they're available in red orange blue and green I'm kind of partial to the orange one but you know they're all kind of the same they're in stock in all sizes from small to triple XL and if you buy either a hat or a water bottle both of which we have plenty of stock of I actually would have really liked to do this as a as a coupon where you could just buy anything and get 10 bucks off but there's a lot of stuff that it's really popular like the stealth hoodie the hard drive shirt the cpu shirt that we just don't have enough stock of and we were worried that we would like launch this promo code and then people would order it and then they would all be gone so what did you guys talk water bottles is that what happened we restocked already water bottles like flew out yep they were gone then we restocked them though yeah so we're good we have I think a couple thousand water bottles right now so we should be okay burn yeah I mean the store's been doing really really well like a couple thousand water bottles is like okay but it's not it's not a ton you guys have been incredibly supportive thank you so all you got to do is add to cart' an elemental shirt and either a hat or a water bottle and you can actually use the code which is elemental up to twice so you could buy a hat and a water bottle and get $10 off two elemental shirts and then you go to checkout and it will automatically apply the code for $10 off the elemental shirt if you use the LM d GG slash elemental or you can do it manually at LT t store calm and the code is elemental all caps died but yeah but he didn't fantastic hi gentlemen our sponsors for the show today Squarespace yes you need to create a beautiful website without the hassle we'll check out Squarespace their all-in-one platform makes it easy to get up and running quickly which is why we use it for Lynas media group calm as well as LTX Expo calm they've got award-winning templates that you can use as a starting point for a wide range of projects and if you need additional help Squarespace offers webinars a full series of help guides and you can even contact their customer service 24/7 via live chat and email if you've already got a third-party domain you don't have to give it up just transfer it over to Squarespace and every Squarespace site includes ecommerce features to help you sell merch or services online and easily manage your inventory and orders it squarespace.com /when and offer code when to save 10% on your first purchase which I guess is a perfect segue into
