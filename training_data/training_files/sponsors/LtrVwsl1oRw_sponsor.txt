Hey guys, this is Alani. And today I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places
to watch movies, Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove of films
from around the globe. Everyday Mubi premieres a new film. Whether it’s a movie
you’ve been dying to see or one you’ve never heard of before, there’s always something new to discover. It’s like your own personal film festival,
streaming anytime, anywhere. So in this world where it’s very easy to spend hours debating
what you should watch, Mubi is like having a really cool friend
with amazing taste in movies making it so much easier for you. They feature hard-to-come-by masterpieces,
indie festival darlings, influential art house and foreign films, lesser known films
by your favorite famous directors and more. Plus you can even download the films
to watch offline and there are no ads ever. One movie you can check out
right now on Mubi is The Thin Blue Line which is considered one of the
greatest documentaries of all time. Errol Morris’ film
follows a Texas drifter who was convicted of murder
and sentenced to death despite evidence
supporting his innocence. We can’t recommend
Mubi highly enough. You can try it out now
for free for a whole month. Just click the link
in the description below.
