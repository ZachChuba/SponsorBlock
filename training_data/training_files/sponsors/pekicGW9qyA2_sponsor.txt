Squarespace for sponsoring this episode apparently this time you sponsored a rant sorry about that so if you have any project and you need a new website or a domain there really are a great option I've used them myself for years now for my photography websites and the thing I love about them the most and this may just show how old I am is that back in the day you used to have to call up a webmaster they would build your site in code and any time I needed to make even the smallest change I'd have to pick up the phone and ask he would have to find time to do it so I'd have to wait and then he billed me for the time that it took to make those changes with Squarespace none of that is true they're already beautifully designed the templates are very very easy to use I can go into the backend I can drag in new images I can change text that can move pages around I can hide pages make pages live I can do that all myself on the fly and for me that kind of freedom is invaluable start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to
