This free video series about the basics of browser exploitation, is supported by SSD
Secure Disclosure. If you find a critical vulnerability in a
popular and widespread software or hardware, for example browsers, my recommendation would
be to first contact SSD. On their site ssd-disclosure.com you can also
find a list of targets they are generally interested in. So letâ€™s say you have found a critical vulnerability
on one of those targets. Then you can send this vulnerability to SSD,
they will confirm and pay you for it, and start a responsible disclosure process where
they contact the vendor and the vulnerability is responsibly disclosed and published while
you still get the credit for it. Not every vendor offers bug bounties for researchers
(for example Apple). Also, other exploit acquisition programs usually
do not disclose the vulnerabilities to vendors. So checkout their site and make sure to read
more about the scope and the submission process. SSD Secure Disclosure is also involved with
the offensive security conference TyphoonCon, so keep an eye out for that conference over
at typhooncon.com
