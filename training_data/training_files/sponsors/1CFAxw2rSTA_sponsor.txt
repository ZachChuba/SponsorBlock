Curiosity is at the
center of everything I do. So when CuriosityStream
approached me to partner up, I was like, yes, please! CuriosityStream is
a streaming service with learning about ourselves,
our planet, and our universe at its heart. If you join CuriosityStream with
my link, plus my promo code, it will support the
making of this show, you get a free month,
and not only do you get CuriosityStream, but
you get Nebula for free, too. Nebula is another streaming
service that is owned by, and directly benefits me,
and other learning creators. Seriously, you get that
with CuriosityStream. All you got to do, sign up
for them, get a month free, and you get Nebula included. The icy places of our planet
are some of the most fascinating to me, especially in an
era of global warming. So I really enjoyed
CuriosityStream's Expedition Antarctica, about
the many living things that exist on our
planet's southern continent. It's super well-made,
it's really interesting. Also, I talked about
working titles, recently. You can find that on Nebula. And you can watch
both of those just by joining CuriosityStream. Just go to
curiositystream.com/trace, use the promo code trace,
and for only $2.99 a month, you're going to get both
CuriosityStream's massive library, and you directly
support creators that you already love with Nebula, which
directly supports the making of more Uno Dos of Trace. So it's actually a double-win. Thanks.
