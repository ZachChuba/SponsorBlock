If all this talk of breaking encryption makes
you a bit nervous and worried about your online safety, well, there’s something you can
do to improve your internet security right now - I’ve been a long time user of the
password manager Dashlane who are sponsoring this video, and if you’ve never used a password
manager before, Dashlane is amazing. It generates and remembers a long, unique
password for each site or service that I use so that I don’t have to worry about remembering
passwords; and of course all of my data and passwords are stored encrypted with very very
large numbers. And Dashlane is more than just a password
manager - it lets you know when your passwords are old or weak or when a site or app you
use has been hacked so you can change your passwords, it encrypts and lets you securely
share passwords with family and coworkers, it can be used to securely store or share
your address, credit card info, and banking info, with just the people and sites you want
to, it can be used as a VPN, and more. Oh, and Dashlane uses 2048 bit numbers for
its encryption - numbers that big are estimated to take a trillion times more effort to factor
than any that have so far been factored by brute force. And of course Dashlane is free for up to 50
passwords for as long as you like, so you have nothing to lose checking it out. But, if you want the very useful features
of unlimited passwords, encrypted syncing of passwords, VPN, remote account access,
and more, the first 200 people get 10% off Dashlane premium by going to dashlane.com/minutephysics
