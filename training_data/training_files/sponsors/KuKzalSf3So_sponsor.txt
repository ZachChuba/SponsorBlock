quick, less-than-a-minute word from this
video's sponsor, whose support helps keep the video game mysteries and discoveries
keep coming. Now I'm sure you've seen it everywhere and, yeah, they got me too. But - I
checked out Raid: Shadow Legends for myself and I gotta admit: for a mobile
game the production value is great and if you're gonna go on a road trip like
myself, it's a perfect match! You can assemble a team of different characters,
travel across 13 different environments and even start a trade with some of your
friends. It's even gotten 15 million downloads in the last 6 months,
catching rank as one of the top 3 RPGs on the Play Store, so you know they're
doing something right. The best part of course is that it's free; plus, new
champions monthly, progression awards and a road map of updates for the next six
months. Go to my video description, click on the special links and you'll get
50,000 silver and a free epic champion as part of the new player program to start
your journey. Good luck and I'll see you there... Now back to the show...
