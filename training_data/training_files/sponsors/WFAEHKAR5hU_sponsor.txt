And if you want practice using proper time
and spacetime intervals to understand real-world problems, I highly recommend Brilliant.org's
course on special relativity. There, you can apply the ideas from this video
to scenarios in the natural world where special relativity really affects outcomes, like the
apparently paradoxical survival of cosmic ray muons streaming through Earth's atmosphere. The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you go deeper on the topics I'm including in this series,
and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that's Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
