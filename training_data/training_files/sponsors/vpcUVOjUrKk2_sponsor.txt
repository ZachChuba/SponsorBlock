If you want a little bit more of the action
side of snow-sports, and a little bit less of the business side, believe it or not, Curiosity
Stream has something for you to watch next. The series, “Jeremy Jones: Higher,” follows
professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones as he attempts to be the first person to snowboard
down sections of the Himalayas, and shows everything that goes on behind the scenes
of an expedition as huge as that. This goes to demonstrate just how diverse
the selection of non-fiction shows and documentaries Curiosity Stream has, and they have even more
through their bundle deal with Nebula. Now, your Curiosity Stream subscription, if
you sign up at CuriosityStream.com/Wendover, comes with a Nebula subscription too. On Nebula, you’ll find all the regular videos
from loads of your favorite creators, plus a bunch of their big, special, exclusive projects. The first of mine was the documentary we made
on St Helena, and then in a few weeks myself and a crew are flying off to another far-flung
part of the world to film our next documentary, which will be out on Nebula soon. You can watch this, plus all the other great
originals on Nebula, plus the thousands of documentaries and shows on Curiosity Stream
for as little as $20 a year by signing up at CuriosityStream.com/Wendover. This is truly the best deal in streaming,
and even better: it goes to help support independent creators.
