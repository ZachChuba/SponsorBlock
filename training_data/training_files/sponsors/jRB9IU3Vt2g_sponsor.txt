anyway I suppose I should say something about my sponsor audible now all we'll just in case you don't know you've been living under a rock or something is an enormous website which stocks audiobooks and if you go to www.ewtn.com and you'll be able to download your first order book free gratis and for nothing and yes there's and you will get to count them to all do audible originals what is inaudible original well it's something which is only available on audible these are these are audio products audiobooks of the conventional sort but also dramas with with acting and sound effects know all that yes are those available too and there are only quite a lot of them and they're only available through audible didn't get to two of them for free if you go to www.hsn I hope you were Linda beige to 500 500 and and the selection there is is is pretty impressive and I know that some of you like that you like fantasy stuff for instance I notice that one of the audible originals was Terry Pratchett's oh heck what was it called yet unseen Academical that was it and so if that's something you might want want to listen to also the sci-fi and some of you I imagine they're into sci-fi and I thought they had some dramatized story set in the aliens universe involving aliens I'm guessing but I think with good reason because I noticed that they had pictures of aliens on the cover and if you like war memoirs and if you're watching this video then you probably do well I just typed in just experimental you understand the war memoirs and I got 31 pages of results at one of which and who dis was dead land by kinky Carew which is a book that I I enjoyed actually I've met the writer at the wicket and Book Festival it was and and that was the book which gave me a lot of material for the the video I made some while ago on the French Resistance and it's it's not strictly a war memoir because it's written by the daughter of the man who did all these things he was alas not long for this world and his daughter realized that it's it was important that his story gets set down before he got lost he had a I say a very interesting war fighting out in the Far East in Burma and then later with the French Resistance anyway so that that's that's one which I would recommend anyway so that is audible my sponsor thank you highly much
