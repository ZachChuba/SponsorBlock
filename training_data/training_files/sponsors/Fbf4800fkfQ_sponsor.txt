If you guys enjoyed this video, maybe check out the short circuit where we did our initial unboxing and impressions of it. Actually we kinda covered everything that we said in that one
but in more depth today, so maybe go check out the PC Pro, where we built the 32 core
Quadro RTX 8,000 monster that you see before you. This case alone was like over $1,000 so. Look it doesn't even have as
much front IO as this one.
