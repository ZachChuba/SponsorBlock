And to deepen your personal understanding
of the resolution to the twins paradox, I highly recommend Brilliant.org's course on
special relativity. There, you can work through the calculations
I've glossed over in a step-by-step guided exploration, giving you essential hand-on
experience with spacetime intervals and other tools of relativity along the way. The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you go deeper on the topics I'm including in this series,
and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that's Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
