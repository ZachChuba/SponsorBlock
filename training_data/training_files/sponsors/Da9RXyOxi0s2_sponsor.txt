Thanks to tThe Great Courses Plus for sponsoring this video. They're a subscription-based learning service with 11,000 lectures. They have many different categories and it allows you to learn about anything that interests you. The lectures are from top professors from globally recognized universities and experts from places like National Geographic and the Smithsonian. Their courses go extremely in-depth and give you a good look into the topic you want to learn about. I really enjoyed watching the lecture about the developments in medicine and surgery as part of the course "Undersatnding the Inventions that Changed the World". It does a great job at explaining exactly how medicine became intertwined with technology and significantly progressed after the 19th century. These developments over the years are responsible for why Tuberculosis sanatoriums, like the one we explored in this video, saw a significant decline in the 50s and 60s. The Great Courses Plus is giving our viewers a free trial, so you can watch this lecture for free (or whatever else you're interested in).
