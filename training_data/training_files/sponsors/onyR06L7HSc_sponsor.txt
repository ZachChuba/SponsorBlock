too. Big thanks to Squarespace - they’ve been
a consistent sponsor of my videos this past year, and without them, the exciting stuff
I’m prepping for 2019 just wouldn’t be happening. They care about creators - they want to help
make it easier for them to get their creations seen by the world at large by providing them
a way to quickly put together a beautiful website. Squarespace has a number of stunning templates
that are completely customizable to make your own, and you can try it out for free by going
to squarespace.com to start a free trial - nothing to lose. If you decide, as I did, that you like the
experience, then when you’re ready to launch, go to squarespace.com/austinmcconnell to get
10% off of your first purchase of a website or domain.
