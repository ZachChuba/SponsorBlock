And if you wanna learn
how to set yourself up for success with this
particular type of challenge then you might wanna go watch through Rich Armstrong's course, on Skillshare, called The Perfect 100 Day Project. In it he teaches you how to intelligently pick the right challenge,
how to structure it, and how to give yourself the best chance of sticking
with it the entire time. Plus, since Rich's
course is on Skillshare, taking it, means you'll also have access to more than 28,000 other
courses, many of which can help you make progress
on your individual goals. If you're trying to improve
your web development skills, there's a course for that. If you wanna learn how to
make great YouTube videos, there are courses for that too. And if you just wanna
learn how to get organized and stay on top of things, well I made a course
for you all about that, which has already been taken
by almost 20,000 people. A premium membership on Skillshare gets you unlimited access to an
entire library of courses and it's really affordable as well, as their annual subscription
is less than 10 bucks a month. And if you would like
to give it a try first you can use the link in
the description down below to get a two-month
unlimited trial for free. Big thanks goes out to
Skillshare as always for sponsoring this video and being a big supporter of my channel
