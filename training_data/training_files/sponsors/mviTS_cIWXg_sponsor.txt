That’s the power of a website like Brilliant.org,
you take control of your learning on topics like computer science, math, and physics. Behind all the technology in this video are
some really fascinating concepts like machine learning, neural networks, and computational
logic. All of which may sound intimidating, but are
actually pretty fun and rewarding to learn with Brilliant. In too many of my classes, and probably yours
too, we’re taught the steps to do a problem, but not really why, or how. That’s because we’re only memorizing one
specific problem, not actually understanding the process. The latter is what’s actually fun and useful
in the real world. And that’s what you get with Brilliant - you
practice the skills and see examples along the way. Here we’re learning about how computers
store information, There’s an explanation, a visual, and a
chance to check our understanding. All very approachable. If we answer incorrectly, it shows us exactly
how to get the solution. It really is a fantastic way to learn, especially
if you’re currently a student or just like learning new things. You can support PolyMatter and learn more
