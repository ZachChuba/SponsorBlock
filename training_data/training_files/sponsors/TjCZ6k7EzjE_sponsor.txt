There are only a few things I can think of
more crazy than believing that electromagnetic waves, which have existed since the beginning
of the universe, make you sick among them being living in Jacksonville, Florida, believing
juice is good for you, and not having a brilliant.org account. There’s honestly so much relevant to this
video you can learn like about radio waves and how light works but there’s also a whole
course on astronomy from which you can learn the fundamentals of this fascinating field. Brilliant is the best place to learn complex
topics like astronomy because they break down these topics into easily understandable bites
explained through graphics, simple explanations, and thought-provoking questions. They make the complex simple. They also have loads of other great courses
and you can take any of them, for free, for two months by being one of the first 200 people
