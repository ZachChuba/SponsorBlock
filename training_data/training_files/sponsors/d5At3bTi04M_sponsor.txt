I'd like to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this episode Skillshare is a learning community with thousands of classes covering dozens of different creative and entrepreneurial skills in fact just recently Jeff was telling me he wanted to learn some core video editing techniques so he went and checked out Jody venda puts Adobe Premiere Pro for beginners class but then his learning took quite the scenic detour when he saw an introductory to aerial photography course from wild rabbit studios whoo pretty tyrone shots so whether you want to fuel your curiosity creativity or even your career for way cheaper than in-person courses Skillshare is the perfect place plus if you sign up with the link below you can get yourself a two month free trial dang
