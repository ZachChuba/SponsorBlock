The fourth hack is directed to everyone that doesn't like drawing but still, loves to decorate their bullet journal with hand drawn doodles. GraphicStock was kind enough to partner with me for this video (#Spons) So I accessed their illustration database to show you how you can find copyright-free doodles online. And download them and bring them to stick them in your journal. If you aren't interested in paying to download these images that's fine and understandable. You can find the 7-day trial link in the description box and you can download these banners for free And keep them in your computer for future use with a maximum of 140 downloads for that 7-day trial. This website lets you download unlimited images without having to pay for each specific download Which happens in most stock image websites. If you happen to think on selling stickers or use images for other commercial uses You can use all of GraphicStock's images freely, since they come with 100% royalty-free agreement. So basically all you need to do is print a desired image on sticker paper, cut the stickers And simply decorate your bullet journal with this really easy hack.
