[Background music] (Off camera)[Nick:] What's going on man? [Jake:] Thinking man [Nick:] 'bout what? [Jake:] Well mostly about Squarespace because this episode is brought to you by Squarespace But more importantly when I come up here to think about life's most important questions, like... ...Is life more than what we think it to be? I ask the 8-ball "You may rely on it." Life is more than what we think it to be Squarespace is also more than you think it to be. You don't need to take it from me Does Squarespace have beautiful, award-winning, designer templates? "Signs point to yes." Does Squarespace have award-winning 24/7 customer service? "It is decidedly so." Does Squarespace have an all-in-one platform, so there's nothing to install, patch or upgrade ever? "It is certain." Is Squarespace flexible for any kind of website? "Most likely." If you sign up today by going to - will you get 10% off your first purchase? "Most likely." As in - Yes. Will Sam and Niko let me combine the channels? "No."?!
