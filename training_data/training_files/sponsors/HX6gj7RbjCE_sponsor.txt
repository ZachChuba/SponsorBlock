And yet, that’s still a very big and strange
set of options, and we’ll be exploring that in the first installment of our new Nebula-Exclusive
series, Coexistence with Aliens: Xenopsychology, which is out now on Nebula, our new streaming
service, and you can get free access to those if you signup with our partner, Curiositystream,
with the link in the episode description, while also enjoying all of their awesome documentaries
and other Nebula-exclusive content from many other education-focused channels. We started Nebula up as a way for education-focused
independent creators to try out new content that might not work too well on Youtube, where
algorithms might not be too kind to some topics or demonetize certain ones entirely, or just
doesn’t fit our usual content. Unlike our previous Nebula episodes, which
aired a couple months later on Youtube, the Coexistence with Aliens series isn’t a good
fit on Youtube and I did want to have some content there that was exclusive for Nebula,
same as we have some exclusively on Soundcloud. The Coexistence with Aliens series, which
like so many started off with the intent of being a single episode but grew into a project,
will begin with Xenopsychology then move on to Trade, Alliances, and War, and possibly
more, but those will come out over the next few months on Nebula. And again, you can get free access to that
by signing up with Curiositystream, along with all the other Nebula-exclusive content
from other creators like CGP Grey, Minute Physics, Wendover, and More. A year of CuriosityStream is just $19.99,
and it gets you access thousands of documentaries, as well as complimentary access to Nebula
for as long as you're a subscriber, and use the link in this episode’s description,
