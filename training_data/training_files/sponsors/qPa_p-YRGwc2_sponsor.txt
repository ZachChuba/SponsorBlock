So do you sleep in them yet? >> No, I'm not quite there yet. >> You will. They're beautiful earplugs >> You're intense.
>> That make the world go away and all of your
favorite audiobooks, podcasts, short stories, everything and music it's all, oh so good. >> Are you liking the new E25s? >> Super comfortable, nice and easy, I love the new pillbox
design, stays in my pockets, doesn't take up too much space,
holds tons of battery life. There's nothing I don't
love about my Raycons. >> Oh yeah and they've got
some extra bass in there. Because a lot of those ear pods
don't really have any bass, so it sounds kind of tinny. This is a pretty good point. We should point out that
we're talking about ear buds. >> And they're amazing. >> They are wireless,
they go in your ears, they recharge inside of a pod. >> That part's important. Sorry, we skipped over that. >> Best part, they're
not a bazillion dollars like all these other ones. >> They are a fraction the cost of all of the other leading ear pod brands and they are really comfortable
and they sound great. There's no reason to spend all that money to get to the more expensive ones. Here's the important part, Raycon's are far and away our
favorite wireless earbuds. Go to buyraycon.com/rouge to get access to Raycon's Black Friday,
Cyber Monday deals. I can't even tell you how
good the deals will be, you'll have to check them out on the site. >> There is no reason not to do it. This is the device that caused me to shuck free the chains of being tethered with a little cable.
[Brian laughs] Did I get too-- >> I think they're sold. [laughs] >> These Raycons have freed
me from the imprisonment, I don't know, they're awesome, buy them. >> Shed the yoke of wired
oppression. [laughs] >> That's what it is,
that's what I meant to say. >> I like shucked free though. >> Shucked is good. The way that you shucked. [digital scanner]
