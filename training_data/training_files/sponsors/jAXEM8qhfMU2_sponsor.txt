Brian, I was subscribed
to World of Warcraft for like two years before I remembered hey, I'm still subscribed to this! [Brian laughs] It's a true story. >> Dude, that's the horror of putting your credit card
and attaching it to anything. That's why I'm done with all that. Privacy.com has changed my life. It's a debit card. You tie it to your account
like any other debit card. But the best part is unlike credit cards they don't sell your information. They respect your privacy. Even better, you can generate one time burner cards and set limits. So long after that card runs out of money you don't have to worry about it. >> Modern Rogue hero Frank
Abignale recently said "Do not use the bank-issued debit card." Privacy.com is a way around that. >> Oh my gosh, yeah! Because if that information leaks out, everybody just bleeds your account dry. But because each individual burner card is associated on one particular account, you can find out that the
entire World of Warcraft got hacked and you'd be like "Pfft, so?" Ain't none 'a mine. >> Kermit gif. >> Exactly. So go to privacy.com/rouge and get $5 now to spend wherever you want. >> Yeah dude! At the very least you could spend that at scamstuff.com, get some sweet tutorials that you could download
instantly for freesies! Privacy.com-- >> Slash rogue. >> Oh, that's right. >> Yeah, that's important. >> Like we planned that.
