I know a lot of you guys do your shopping online, So I invite you to check out our sponsor today: Massdrop It's a community driven platform for pledging and purchasing awesome products at bulk prices. If you're curious to see how high end audio sounds, Massdrop asked me to check out their exclusive headphones: the Sennheiser HD58X I got my hands on these headphones And personally I find its sound quality to be very clear and balanced, with a good but not overwhelming amount of bass I tried it with different genres of music and I find that it really brings out the vocals in songs, making them crisp and outstanding, almost like you're hearing it performed live, and not sound muddy and buried within the music. I don't really consider myself an audiophile, but I do consider these to be of high quality Especially for its price So if you're interested in experiencing high-end headphones for only $150, check out Massdrop by clicking the link below New users get $10 off their purchase.
