Um, so anyway This is a message for Danny Gonzalez and all of his viewers, I am The Game Master, and I'm taking over this channel to tell you all about Squarespace. Guys, you know there's two things I truly love in life, snacks and pennies. Both things I love to eat, but what you might have known, is that I also love making websites about snacks and pennies. That's why I use Squarespace. Squarespace is an all-in-one platform that lets you find a domain, set up a site in just minutes, and even create an online store to sell things like snacks and pennies. And with Squarespace, it's super easy to create a professional looking website because of their beautiful designer templates. Not to mention they've got great 24/7 customer service, so they can fix your problems any time, anywhere. Now Danny, if you ever want your channel back, your fans will have to pass the test. They'll have to go to squarespace.com/danny to get 10% off their first purchase, and use Squarespace to create a website about Greg and how it's the fastest growing army on YouTube. If they do this, you can have your channel back, but if they don't. I'm gonna delete all your videos, or, something like that. I haven't really decided yet but I'm gonna do something, with your videos. Okay. Bye.
