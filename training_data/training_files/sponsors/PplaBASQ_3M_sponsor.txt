can try audible out by downloading a free audiobook of your choice. I'd like to recommend the book Unruly Places:
Lost Spaces, Secret Cities, and Other Inscrutable Geographies by Alastair Bonnett [called Off
the Map in the UK] â€“ it's a tour of all sorts of weird, abandoned or disregarded places
around the world, from the unrecognized self-declared island nation of Sealand to traffic islands,
and beyond. Again, you can download your free audiobook
at audible.com/minutephysics and thanks to audible for helping me continue to make these
