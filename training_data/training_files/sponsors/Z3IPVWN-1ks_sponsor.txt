This story is partly based on the truth (I’ll
leave you to figure out which parts), and I first told it at the festival of Bad Ad-Hoc
Hypotheses (BAHFest), where the idea is to listen to crazy made up scientific theories
in the hope that we’ll be, well, both entertained, and more aware of how science actually works. And you can listen to more entertaining stories
(science and otherwise) on Audible, this video’s sponsor. Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks
on the planet, including best-sellers, mysteries, memoirs, originals, and science books - I
very much enjoyed “How Not To Be Wrong”, by Jordan Ellenberg, a more correct but similarly
sarcastic book about how to use simple math to not be wrong (it has plenty of fascinating
stories of big mistakes that have been made because people misused math). To start listening with a 30-day trial, go
to audible.com/minutephysics or text ‘minutephysics’ to 500500 and you can choose 1 audiobook and
2 audible originals each month. Again, that’s audible.com/minutephysics
or text ‘minutephysics’ to 500500, and thanks to Audible for supporting MinutePhysics.
