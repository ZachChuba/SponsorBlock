Once again, for this kind of topic a smooth
segue isnâ€™t appropriate, but videos like this would not be possible without Brilliant. My goal for this project has always been to
inspire the next generation of engineers. Brilliant is the perfect partner for this
channel because their courses are designed to educate you from knowing nothing to having
a deep understanding of a topic. Perhaps you feel like you could brush up on
your statistics skills, a valuable analytical tool that help you academically and in your
everyday life. This course on statistics guides you through
problems that are broken into digestible sections with fun problems to test your knowledge along
the way, allowing you to see the pattern in complicated data. This is just one of many courses on Brilliant,
with more courses due to released soon on things like automotive engineering and Python
Coding. If I have inspired you and you want to educate
yourself, then go to brilliant.org/RealEngineering and sign up for free.And the first 73 people
