to talk about our sponsor this video is sponsored by the rake on a 50 wireless earbuds the only earbuds on the market that are currently in my ear the rake on e 50s has a earbud for any activity whether it be just chillin watching your favorite movie or working out because they're stylish they're discreet and the best part they don't have those pesky wires hanging off of them like other headphone if you currently work out with regular headphones that have wires coming off of them and you've never tried switching them out for wireless ones like these holy moley does it make a world of difference I seriously never realized how cumbersome the wire was until I started using wireless earbuds these earbuds are made by Ray Khan which is a company founded by Ray J and celebrities like Snoop Dogg are raving about them that's right they're at a rave right they're at a rave with them or they just like them I think that's what that means is that they just like the Ray Conny 50s are about half the price of any other premium wireless earbud on the market they're comfortable they sound great and if you go to buy Raycom slash danny gonzalez you can get 20% off your purchase or just click that link in the description baby thank you - ray con for sponsoring this video and thank you to you guys for checking out ray con because when you guys check out our sponsors it directly helps this channel it helps me keep making videos so thank you for checking out our sponsor ok bye
