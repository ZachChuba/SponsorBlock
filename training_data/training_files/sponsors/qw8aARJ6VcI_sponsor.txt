best shooter games of 2020 frag pro shooter with over 50 million players total and over a million playing each day i was dominating the leaderboards the game is simple it's either a 1v1 or a 2v2 with a friend you man every single player on your team when you die you switch to the next player you battle it out with your main goal being to take out the enemies tower but first you gotta take out their bunkers the games are short and quick and actually very fun and if you use the link in the description there's a bunch of rewards that you can get even if you've already downloaded the game before as you can see i dominated and i always like to end on a win so i was about to get off on this note
