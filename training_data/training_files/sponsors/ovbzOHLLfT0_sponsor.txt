uh one thing i want to say is that these these tequilas um which i have chosen here if you have a hard time finding liquor locally um your liquor store is very far away it is poorly stocked i'm partnered with curiata if you go to drink.curryetta.com you will find yourself at the how to drink collection of spirits stuff that i've used on the show stuff i love i use all time if you want to follow along at home it's a great way to stock up curiata currently services i think 28 or 30 now states of the us which do represent i think 80 of the us population if you're looking to pick up any of the bottles i use on the series and you want to follow along at home drink.curiata.com has you covered they ship i think next day uh shipping is not free but if you order 200 and you use code how to drink at checkout you will get free shipping every single time all the time that's not like just a promotion that's forever as far as i know um and i don't know i mean if you're not buying that often 200
