check it out so that's it it's a short one so you can go enjoy the rest of your friday but even better we have a great sponsor for this one all right now we got a shout out to the sponsor of this video skylum they make this pretty incredible app called luminar ai and it's an image editor based heavily on ai artificial intelligence and that might sound pretty crazy at first because it kind of is on the surface but what that means practically speaking is a whole lot of really huge time savers and incredible functions just kind of built right in with a single button press so i've been messing around with it a lot personally for instagram edits recently it's kind of amazing for that check out this photo at first glance it looks pretty solid right but the original photo unedited shot on my iphone is this and this is a very different photo and all the stuff the sky replacement the re-lighting the color adjustment all of this took me a couple of clicks and maybe 60 seconds so there's all kinds of tools you're probably used to seeing in an image editor color temperature exposure sliders all that fun stuff then there's things like sky ai which automatically detects where the sky is if there's a sky in your shot does all the masking work for you as complicated as it is and lets you drop in any of the skies you want which you can then mess around with with the sliders to make relighting and filling in the gaps work perfectly i happen to think sunset one looks pretty good so that's what i had in my photo and i think it came out pretty good look it even added the part of the matching clouds to the window of the car like that is a sick before and after for a quick minute or two instagram edit and there's a bunch more creative ai-based tools that use 3d mapping technology analyzing everything in your scene in your photo to do as much work for you as possible so look at how these sun rays i'm adding not only match the light of the scene but reacts to the objects in the foreground versus the background or in this photo the atmosphere ai lets me add fog and sort of mess with the depth of how it rolls down the mountain all the way to the lake in the foreground here let's play let's play a little game right i'ma show you a photo that i edited in under 30 seconds and you tell me what you think about that photo is edited versus original so this photo from hawaii yeah that wasn't the sky at all it looked a lot more dramatic in my edit than the original photo or how about this photo from matterhorn yeah pretty much everything absolutely massive white balance adjustment corrections since the pixel that took this photo kind of turned everything blue the sky the clouds i added over the mountain plus a little film grain for taste so that is really cool that is super sick i'm glad i found it i'm glad they reached out to sponsors this video because i'm going to continue to use this app for the future uh instagram edits that i want to just get done pretty quick like that i'll have a link below if you want to check it out if you use code mkbhd at
