Daitomodachi: Since Amino really liked the previous plug for them they actually sponsored another video. Dai: If you guys didn't know already Amino launched a new feature called stories. Dai: They're basically short videos in which you can talk about any topic that interests you. Dai: For me, I started doing Amino stories talking about my love with Kamen Rider. Dai: I did one on build and another one on Drive. Dai: In fact, I'm doing another one talking about Kamen Rider OOO since I'm close to wrapping up that series. Dai: There even might be a possibility of Kamen Rider animations coming to my Amino profile if they don't come here. Dai: If you guys interested in hearing my thoughts on Kamen Rider follow me on Amino in the link down below and watch a few of my stories. Dai: Every story you watch while following me does support what I do. Dai: With that said please enjoy today's animation. [Daitomodachi Theme]
