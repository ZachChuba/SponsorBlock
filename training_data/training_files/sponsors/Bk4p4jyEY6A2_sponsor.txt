Squarespace for sponsoring this episode if you need a new website or a domain they're a fantastic option I've used them myself for years long before their response Iran this channel this year has been great with them just because the selling books from my website was something I was quite anxious about was it gonna be too complicated to keep track of orders and inventory and all the rest of it but it's built into the backend of Squarespace so apart from the fact that if you're a photographer their designs really make your work look good if you sell any kind of product they make it really really easy for you to keep track of orders coming in and print labels and check on where your inventories at and keep track of money coming in it really couldn't be simpler start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to Squarespace com forward slash Sean Tucker to get 10%
