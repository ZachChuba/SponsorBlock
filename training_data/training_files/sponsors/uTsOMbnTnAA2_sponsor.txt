(snaps) I wanna give a huge thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video and
for also being super patient with me as I changed
topics the last minute because I got inspired
to talk about Thanos. Squarespace is the best
way, the easiest way, to build a website. I've used Squarespace for a
bunch of my different projects. For the book that I'm
writing, realoriginsbook.com, that was built on Squarespace. I also use it for my own personal website. They've got these beautiful templates that are also highly customizable, so you're website doesn't have
to look like everyone else's. You can really dive in
there and make it your own. In fact, just this year they
added eight new templates to really get your creative juices going on whatever project you're working on. In fact, just because Squarespace
loves you wonderful nerds they're gonna help you
get started right away, even easier, even faster, even better. Just head on over to Squarespace.com,
start your free trial. Start experimenting and building there and when you're ready to check out, when you're ready to launch
your next big project, head on over to Squarespace.com/NerdSync and save 10% off of your first purchase of a website or a domain. So, if you're ready to
launch your new business, go out there and make it. And get started with Squarespace.
