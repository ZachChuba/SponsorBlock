Guys, I want to take a quick minute, and talk about Casper,
the sponsor for today's video. We should be spending
one third of our lives in bed, so why not make sure that
bed is super comfortable. If you are looking to
upgrade your quality of sleep, you can now get $50 off
of selected mattresses from Casper. Just go to
CASPER.COM/THEKINGOFRANDOM and enter promo code
THEKINGOFRANDOM. The Casper brand mattress
is carefully engineered with several types
of layered memory foam to give you just the right
combination of support, and sinking in. Even though this is a nice,
thick, very squishy mattress, they do manage to smash it down, small enough that it fits
an impressively small box when it arrives. It is still a decent-sized box
because it's totally a mattress, but it looks way too
small to be holding this. When you're buying a Casper mattress, you're buying directly from the company, you're cutting out the middleman, and you save on those costs. You don't have to pay someone else
to be storing it in their warehouse, and then showing it off, and then all of the salesmen
fees and stuff like that. You're just getting the Casper mattress
directly from the people who make it. After you get your mattress, you have a 100-day sleep on it trial, which means you get to have
this bad boy for over three months, making sure that it
is the mattress you love. And if you don't like it,
they have a no-hassle free return. Thank you to Casper
for providing my mattress, and for sponsoring today's video. Remember, you can now get $50 off
of selected mattresses by going to CASPER.COM/THEKINGOFRANDOM and entering the promo code,
THEKINGOFRANDOM.
