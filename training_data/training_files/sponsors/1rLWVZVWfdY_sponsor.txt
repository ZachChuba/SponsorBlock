And while you're waiting for the next special relativity video to come out you might want to check out this video's sponsor: Brilliant.org a site full of interactive quizzes and mini courses on physics and math. As you've probably heard me say before, if you want to understand physics deeply, you really have to think through ideas and solve problems yourself and Brilliant offers a great way to do just that-- either by learning a new topic, like neural networks practicing problem solving in an area you already know, like algebra or solving tricky puzzles, like this one. If you decide to sign up for premium access to all of their courses and quizzes, you can get 20% off by going to brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that's brilliant.org/minutephysics, which lets Brilliant know you came from here
