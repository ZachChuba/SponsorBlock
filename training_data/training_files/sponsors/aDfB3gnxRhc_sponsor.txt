To dive deeper into the energy sources that
DO power the world, I highly recommend checking out the “Fuel the World” course on Brilliant.org,
this video’s sponsor. Fuel the world is part of their series on
the “Physics of the everyday”, and guides you through the basics of solar power, fossil
fuels, nuclear reactions, dyson spheres, and how much energy mammals need to survive. There’s even a section about the fusion
reactions that happen in the sun! And the “physics of the everyday” course
as a whole gives a great overview of the physics of household items, sports, weather and climate,
and more. And the first 200 people to go to Brilliant.org/minutephysics
can get 20% off of a premium Brilliant subscription with access to all of brilliant’s courses
and puzzles. Again, that's Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access so you can seriously hone your math and science skills,
and it lets Brilliant know you came from here.
