Of course, the easiest
way to get up to speed is to listen to some
incredible books on Watergate and impeachment on Audible. I've actually been refreshing
my memory about Watergate by listening to Impeachment,
An American History. It's a fantastic book
in which four experts on American presidency
review the only three impeachment cases from history, against Andrew Johnson, Richard
Nixon, and Bill Clinton, and explore the power and
meaning of impeachment today. And you can also listen
to Neal Katyal's audiobook Impeach, The Case Against Donald Trump. Katyal wrote the
independent council statute under which Robert Mueller was appointed and was the former
acting solicitor general for the United States. So that book is absolutely
incredible and gives you a window into the arguments for
and against impeachment. And right now, Audible is
giving Legal Eagles like you three months of Audible
for just $6.95 a month. That's more than half
off the regular price. There's going to be a
lot more impeachment news over the next three months, so it's a great time to
get an Audible subscription and learn about the history of impeachment in the United States. All you have to do is go over
