It just came out this month. It's called Thrawn. Which is the story of one of the most legendary villains in the Star Wars multiverse. Is Star Wars the one with Captain Picard? No Hila. Doctor Who? Doctor who... that's not... Written by Timothy Zane and it's already being hailed as one of the best Star Wars books ever written. I recommend this book, highly. I've listened to about half of it, I'm enthralled and I'm thawned. That's the name of the book: Thrawned.
