Thanks to NASA's James Webb Space Telescope
Project at the Space Telescope Science Institute for supporting this video. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able
to observe the most distant emissions from some of the earliest supermassive black holes
in primordial galaxies and hopefully help us understand how black holes drive galaxy
evolution and development. Webb will also spot black holes via the stars,
gas and dust they attract, and help us understand black hole energy dynamics, including the
powerful relativistic jets they can produce.
