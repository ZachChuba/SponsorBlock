On that note, you know what’s also pretty
dumb? Having an old school, broken website that
is hurting your business more than it’s helping it! It’s time to be smart about things, and
that's why we love using Squarespace. Squarespace allows us to create a beautiful
website within minutes, using their all-in-one platform. There’s nothing to install, patch, or upgrade—ever,
and that’s going to save you a lot of time and money. We’ve been using our website to post all
of the scripts, videos and sources. We’ve also been getting a lot of great suggestions
for future topics. If you want to suggest a topic, you can visit
our Squarespace website at www.theinfographicsshow.com. Please keep ‘em coming! We will be sure to let you know if we decide
to turn your suggestion into a video. If you already have your domain and are hesitating
about switching to Squarespace for that reason, there’s nothing to worry about. You can now transfer your third-party domains
to Squarespace. Instead of working with multiple vendors to
maintain your online presence, you are able to manage all of your domain and billing settings
with Squarespace, and take advantage of their easy-to-use DNS interface. Head to Squarespace.com/Infographics for a
free trial and when you’re ready to launch, use the offer code INFOGRAPHICS to save 10%
off your first purchase of a website or domain.
