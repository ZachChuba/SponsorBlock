two quick things before I go the first is I am running my first workshop here in London on the 11th and 12th of December the photographer's gallery just off Oxford Street it's a beautiful venue and I've worked really hard to build a workshop experience that I think we're really rich and challenging for you and you'll go away with a lot to think about there are only three spaces left so you need to get on fast on the link below and book those spaces if you want to be there I will hopefully if this goes well I'll be running workshops next year in the States and Germany in Canada if I can get it all done so go and check it out anyway and if you want one of those last free spots and you're available grab them and the second thing is thank you so much to Squarespace for sponsoring this video if you need a new website or a domain they're a brilliant option especially for photographers and film makers if you want a website that's gonna make your images sing that's already designed and you just need to make little tweaks and they make it super easy for you to do that this is the way to go and I want to say a quick word about Squarespace because I get people in the comments going I'm sick of seeing Squarespace ads on so many videos the way I see it I'm incredibly grateful that there's a company out there whose product I already believe in that is willing to sponsor channels like I can make free content for you which you get to enjoy and so many channels I enjoy a sponsored by Squarespace as well and I wonder if they weren't doing that how much of that would still be around so I would love it if you go check them out go and have a look at what they do if you are looking for a website and I'll give you a code at the end which you can use for a discount start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to Squarespace com forward slash or
