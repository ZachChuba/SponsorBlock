And if you wanna accelerate
your skill development in the field that you choose and master new techniques
quickly, check out Skillshare. Skillshare has an expensive catalog of over 20,000 courses and
tons of different topic areas like digital animation, video editing, drawing, and business, and lots more. Their courses are also hands-on, almost always including a sample project that you can sink your teeth into so you can start learning actively. Now one course that I wanna
highlight for you this week is the Fundamentals of DSLR
Photography by Justin Bridges. Photography has a ton of disciplines, yes, there's macro photography, there's landscapes and portraits, but all of these disciplines rely on a fundamental foundation
of camera skills, aperture, lighting, ISO, shutter speed. And Justin's course goes
through all of these different techniques
along with recommendations of what camera gear you
should buy in the first place and the best settings to use. So if you wanna start working
through Justin's course, or any of the other courses
in Skillshare's catalog, then click the link in the description down below and sign up. And when you do, you're
going to get two months of completely unlimited access to their entire catalog of
courses absolutely free. After that, Skillshare
is still very affordable, costing about as much as
a Netflix subscription so this is definitely
something you should try if you wanna start improving your skills. I wanna give a big thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video and being in support of this channel
