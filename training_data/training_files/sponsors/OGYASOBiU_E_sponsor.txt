PST December's theme was underdog and in it I found some cool stuff from my hero academia, black clover, Saint Seiya, and Batman in the Justice League. Wait, that's a manga? Cool, but if you missed out on that you can look forward to January's crate Game On featuring items from Stein's Gate, Danmachi, Final Fantasy, and Sonic the Hedgehog.
