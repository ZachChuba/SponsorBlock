This episode has been supported by Weights
& Biases. Weights & Biases provides tools to track your
experiments in your deep learning projects. It is like a shared logbook for your team,
and with this, you can compare your own experiment results, put them next to what your colleagues
did and you can discuss your successes and failures much easier. It takes less than 5 minutes to set up and
is being used by OpenAI, Toyota Research, Stanford and Berkeley. It was also used in this OpenAI project that
you see here, which we covered earlier in the series. They reported that experiment tracking was
crucial in this project and that this tool saved them quite a bit of time and money. If only I had access to such a tool during
our last research project where I had to compare the performance of neural networks for months
and months. Well, it turns out, I will be able to get
access to these tools, because, get this, itâ€™s free and will always be free for academics
and open source projects. Make sure to visit them through wandb.com
or just click the link in the video description and sign up for a free demo today. Our thanks to Weights & Biases for helping
us make better videos for you.
