If you love to learn as much as I do and if
you want to incorporate learning into your routine more often, than this is the best
time to sign up for todayâ€™s sponsor, Curiosity Stream, because you now have access to two
education platforms instead of one. CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming
service with thousands of documentaries and nonfiction titles crated by the original founder
of Discovery but NOW your CuriosityStream subscription is now 2-in-1 - with your monthly
subscription, for 2.99 you also get access to Nebula, a streaming video platform built
by and for independent education creators, like MinutePhysics, Half as Interesting, Thomas
Frank, Real Engineering, Wendover, Tier Zoo and so on. Nebula is a place where education creators
can keep producing content and original series without restrictions, without ads and most
of all, with the support of an entire community dedicated to learning.
