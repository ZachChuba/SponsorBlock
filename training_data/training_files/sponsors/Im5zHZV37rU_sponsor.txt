Look, these influencers
can't seem to stay home. And I think it's because the walls in
their house are boring. That's where today's
sponsor, Displate comes in. Displate is a service that
creates beautiful metal posters that could turn your
boring walls into cool walls. And for every Displate
sold, they plant a tree. So you're also helping the environment. You mount Displates to your wall with this fancy magnet thing. And it's easy as staying home and not going to quarantine parties. You won't even damage your wall. There's a Displate designed
for pretty much anything but just off the top of my head, you could get a Displate
for a Bulgarian snack cake slash our fearless leader. The possibilities are endless. Using the link in my description you'll get 30% off your order. So definitely do that. I'm not saying the Displate
will cure your need to party during quarantine, but it will. Thanks again to Displate
for sponsoring this video.
