Calm down, it’s ok, though, because Skillshare’s
iOS and Android apps allow you to download any of their more than 20,000 classes offline. If there’s something you want to learn Skillshare
probably has a class on it. For the impending post-war nuclear wasteland,
you can learn things like how to make fire, give CPR, and make enchiladas. They also have courses on things more applicable
for today’s world like the course on “How to Make an Animated YouTube Video” by the
great YouTuber PolyMatter. Just because Skillshare loves you so much,
the first 500 people to sign up at skl.sh/hai17 will get to learn for free for their first
two months so get learning today at skl.sh/hai17.
