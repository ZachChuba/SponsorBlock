And if you think it's fun imagining what an entire civilization would look like inside of one building, then why not listen to The World Inside by Robert Silverberg. This book fully explores an entire universe and story set inside of a building much like what you just listen about and goes into far more detail than I ever could in just an eight minute long video. I use Audible to listen to audio books while I'm driving, stuck in traffic, working or just for fun. It's a new year so why not start off by listening to some of the greatest books ever written while driving to work or to school. You can get any book for free when you start your 30-day free trial so if you find something that interests you besides the book that I suggested then that's completely fine for you to download as well. You can listen straight off of your phone or tablet so if you'd like to get started please go to
