I was going to mention dbrand's new Grip case
at the end of this teardown and how good it would be at protecting a cellphone, but now
that I don't have a cellphone to put inside, I can't really mention it anymore. If I did happen to mention dbrand's new Grip
case though, I'd put a link in the description.
