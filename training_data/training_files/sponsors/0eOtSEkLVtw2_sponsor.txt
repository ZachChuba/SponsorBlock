If you’re anything like me, however, that’s
still not enough time to learn calculus because it’s just a bunch of nonsense numbers. That was, of course, until I tried brilliant.org. Rather than just teaching you how to do calculus
problems, they start by teaching the intuitive ideas behind calculus. When you understand how calculus works, you
understand how to do the problems so this course would be great for anyone currently
learning the subject in school, or for anyone who never really got an understanding of it
before like me. Brilliant also has tons of super interesting
courses on topics like solar energy, probability, number theory, and machine learning and you
can take as many of these superbly designed courses as you want with their premium subscription
which, by being one of the first 424 people to sign up at the link in the description,
