I've been rewriting the start of this video a few times and I'm still not entirely sure what to say the confirmed suicide of Desmond and mophir also known as Etica on Tuesday has given me a lot to think about with regards to mental health and how content rates are perceived by the world they create content for but I think it's important to remember what Etica gave us I never followed his work obsessively but I knew he was a vibrant character of a natural talent for entertainment and I do have some seriously fond memories of seeing him react with such genuine excitement to smash broz reveals things haven't been okay with him for a while but above all else I'm gonna remember the energy and warmth he gave back to the community and I hope that ultimately becomes his legacy but etic is also a tragic case study into the stresses of being a content creator and how mentally taxing this profession can be at times I almost want to mention this now because I feel like the focus should be on etiquette but seeing as these issues contributed to his death it would be irresponsible of me to not talk about them having a large active audience is daunting at times and there's a danger of losing yourself in the constant push for internet relevance and the need to be on at all times ultimately views and subscribers don't matter as much as how you feel about yourself and the world around you to that I'd say to anyone out there making content and really a place for everyone else to surround yourself with people you can talk to not necessarily about YouTube or your day job or whatever just people you can have random discussions with and ultimately try to be kind to each other it's it's not hard and can actually be kind of fun mental health is unbelievably important and I'm hoping it doesn't take another suicide for people to realize this rest in peace etiquette you've gone way too soon you
