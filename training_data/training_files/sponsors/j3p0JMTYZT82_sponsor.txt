Hi, guys,
I want to talk to you about Skillshare, an online learning community we love. With over twenty-five thousand classes
taught by seasoned pros, Skillshare has a class
on pretty much anything you could want. You can develop your creativity through
a class on calligraphy, graphic design, or writing. You could learn to succeed in business with
classes on how to make it as a freelancer, market a podcast,
or become an instagram influencer. You can use it to master new technology through classes on web design,
coding, and data science. Or you can bring that extra flare
into your lifestyle, sharpen your knife skills, l
earn paper-making, Spanish, or let illustrator Vashti Harrison teach you how to bring your
digital illustrations to life. Right now, Skillshare is offering
