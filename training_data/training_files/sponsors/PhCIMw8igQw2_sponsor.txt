I love playing games with the animals at
Animal Wonders, and I also love playing games with my own little animals,
meaning my family. When I go looking for new games to play with my family,
it can be hard to know if a game is going to be too hard or too easy and end up being boring for the kids. Which is why I was so happy that Z-Man Games gave us the opportunity to test play My First
Stone Age and see how my family would like it. And I’m so happy to say that it was a success! My son is seven years old, and I’m always looking
for a game that’s fun for us to enjoy together. My First Stone Age perfectly combines a simple
concept with a few more in-depth strategies that only took him a few rounds to understand. Once he got into it, he didn’t want to stop, and
I’m looking forward to playing with him again. If you have any little humans in your life,
I’d recommend introducing them to the fun of strategy board games
with My First Stone Age. You can find the link to Z-Man Games below
and with the holidays coming up, this is the perfect time to get something
for the whole family to enjoy!
