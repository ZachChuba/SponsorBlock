As all web-enabled time management apps, my
Study Life relies on a password so you can access it anywhere. If you're using your Google account to get
it, then you're using the same account that has a lot of sensitive and personal information,
which is essential to keep protected and for that there's no one out there better than
today's sponsor, Dashlane. 1. Dashlane is the only tool you need to stay
safe online. It’s got you covered - it protects your
from people monitoring your history, hacking your data and accounts or stealing your passwords. Basically Dashlane compiles 3 or 4 different
privacy tools in a cheaper package. As soon as you download it you won’t have
to worry about online security issues ever again. Dashlane will tell you how many times you've
reused a password, inform you about whether your data is compromised by hackers and do
a scan so you are sure your info is not being used by hackers. 2. Dashlane has a basic free version, but Dashlane
Premium has ALL of the above features, and is cheaper than most VPNs or standalone security
services. The value you get is not just in the features,
but in the peace of mind knowing that Dashlane is actively protecting you from every angle.If
you want to try it out, I've got you a promo code that gets 10% of Dashlane Premium for
anyone who clicks that link.
