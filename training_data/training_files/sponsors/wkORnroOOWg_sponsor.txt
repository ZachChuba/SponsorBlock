Audible is a great service for listening to audiobooks I used to commute like an hour each way to work every day And I would listen to audiobooks all the time in the car, long car rides are like the perfect time to listen to audio books and audibles like the perfect service for that I really like listening to books by some of my favorite comedians ,one I listen to today egghead by Bo Burnham I've Read the book before but I recently I just listened to the audiobook cuz it was only like an hour and a half and it Was great, it's great to just like put something on and listen to it while you're writing Or if you're going for a run and you want to just forget about what you're doing and just listen I feel like for me for someone who tries to be funny for a living always Listening to other people who are funny and that I think are really funny is really helpful to me -Demetri Martin has a book on Here, too well
