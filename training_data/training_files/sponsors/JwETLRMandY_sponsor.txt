Just like my segue to our sponsors. Thanks AFK Arena for
sponsoring today's video. It's an RPG strategy, card style game with a unique fresco art style, that's designed for hardcore gamers and casual ones as well. So it doesn't take too much
time if you're more casual, but offers in depth, strategic
and advanced mechanics for the hardcores out there. You can collect different
awesome looking hero cards, assemble your lineup and
develop winning strategies. And to celebrate their
one year anniversary, they're collaborating
with classic arcade game Samurai Showdown,
featuring Ukyo Tachibana, who is going to join AFK Arena, and players can try
him out for seven days. Samurai Showdown, if you're not familiar, is a classic 2D fighting series, dating all the way back to 1993. There's also an anniversary
bonus code, happybd0409, which will get you 10 common hero scrolls, five birthday gift
chests and 500 diamonds. Also, if you log in before April 20th, you can get 50 more scrolls
to summon more heroes. Check it out at the link below.
