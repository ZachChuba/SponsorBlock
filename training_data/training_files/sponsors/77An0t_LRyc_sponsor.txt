sponsors audible I've been using audible for years in fact every single hermit craft episode every single redstone video that you watch has some form of audio book behind it but I've been using it for so long that I'm actually started to wonder I wonder what it would be like if I didn't have audible what would I do with how audible well the solution number one seemed pretty obvious just a quick in his departure over to me when would you be able to speed things up and point out one point four times and maybe take the volume down about 20% and also can you go back 30 seconds because I kinda wasn't listening so we're Vicki now not talking to me it was time for Plan B yes yes yes the place looked like Sun right now so clearly audible is the tool for the job you're not gonna put up the screen again yeah I know you're sending the screen from this below dome just joking fine fine if you want to sign up to audible head over to audible.com forward slash mumbo or txt mumbo - 500 500 give me a second one book I personally recommend listening to breath written and narrated by James Nestor it's all about the importance of breathing properly which is definitely something that I've never thought about before so give it a listen
