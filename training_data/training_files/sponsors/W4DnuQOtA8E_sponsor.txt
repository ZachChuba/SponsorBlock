So I live, here, and I took a plane to Kevin's pool, way over here. And on the plane ride, I was listening to the Harry Potter book series. And I know this is quite possibly the least cool and sophisticated audio book recommendation that I've ever given on my channel. But I read the books, 15 years ago, and it was really fun to rediscover like a bunch of the little details, that I'd forgotten Plus the dude who reads them, does all of the voices. And he does a really good job. So if you want something fun to do, while commuting, or work around the house. You can rediscover the Harry Potter book series, like me, or you can get any other book for free. All you do is use the link in the description, or go to audible.com/MarkRober By supporting Audible you support me, and future plane rides to places like Kevin's pool.
