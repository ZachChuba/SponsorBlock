friends over at Squarespace who are
making website design super modern and super simple now I know that you know
it's time to stop procrastinating start putting up a DP that filmmaking rail for
everyone to see so first step that you need to do is of course upload it to
Vimeo or YouTube and then Squarespace you actually make custom image overlays
on your website to bring that real from Vimeo to your home page in just a few
clicks then all I need to do after that is just purchase a domain which you can
actually do directly on Squarespace which market over 200 third-party
domains like ComNet TV and of course just slap it on to a nice contemporary
template under the portfolios tab and you are good to go yes it is literally
