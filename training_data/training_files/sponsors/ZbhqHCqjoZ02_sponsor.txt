Squarespace. If you are wanting to create a new website for your next project then Squarespace is the absolute easiest way of doing it. I've personally used them before for several different projects and what I think is best about them is that you don't need any programming skills in order to make a beautiful website. It's incredibly easy and can be done in just a few minutes and there's always someone to call 24/7 if you ever need any help. You can create a blog a store, a page for your music, art, or really just about anything, and what's best of all is that you can get 10% off of your first order by using the code "Real Life Lore" over at "squarespace.com/reallifelore" That also means that you'll be directly supporting my greed and help me to create additional new videos, so please go ahead and check them out over at "squarespace.com/reallifelore"
