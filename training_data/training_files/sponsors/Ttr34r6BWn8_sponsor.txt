before continuing I would like to talk for just a brief moment about my sponsor for this video crossing void I've mentioned them earlier crossing void is a massive crossover of some of the most popular light novels and most of the most popular characters within those lighten up everyone I've mentioned thus far and three more that I am about to mention is just seven and there are like 50 it's an anime turn-based RPG mobile game where the fights are fun the character Gathering is amazing and it has all the basic high points of what a mobile RPG can offer except bonus it really encapsulates the feel of the different anime and different characters my favorite character to use in this game happens to be Shizuo heiwa Jima because the raw greatness said he exhibits in Durarara is perfectly captured in crossing voice the madness of this guy's slappy is the potency street signs is exactly what I want in a mobile game and more and with the game implementing anime characters of course the community is of one mind as well maybe I'm biased because I'm an anime tired but it's one of my favorite communities I've seen in an RPG and in fact there are even community awards if you follow them on Facebook and Twitter it's an RPG where there are meta events that are community based as opposed to just within the game not to mean that there aren't also massive events within the game but that's an entirely different story there are events where you have to guess which anime character they're talking about based on the silhouettes with of course in-game rewards and all-in-all if you're an anime fan that's looking for an RPG I highly suggest crossing void and if you pre-register now by clicking that link in the description boom you get a bunch of pre-registration rewards thanks
