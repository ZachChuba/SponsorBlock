A great way you can fuel your passion for
learning is through brilliant.org, the perfect place for learning science, math, or computer
science. I learned about Brilliant.org a little over
a year ago and instantly fell in love with them because they actually help me understand
difficult concepts at a deep level. No bamboozle, I actually used Brillaint.org
to help me out in my environmental science class last semester. One really cool thing about Brilliant.org
is their daily problems feature. Every day, when you have a free five minutes
and want to use it to learn something new, you can just check out some of Brilliantâ€™s
curated puzzles on everything from how prehistoric humans tracked time to how to cut a mobiles
strip in half. They're honestly mind-blowing. If you wanna get in on these puzzles and so much more, you can sign up to Brilliant for free today and help out Technicality by going to brilliant.org/technicality. Plus, the first 200 people to use that link
get 20% of a premium subscription so you can view all the daily problems in the archives and unlock dozens of courses. Thanks everybody!
