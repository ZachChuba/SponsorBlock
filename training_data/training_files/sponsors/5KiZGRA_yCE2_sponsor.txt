If you’ve just realized “ghost train”
is a great band name and want to make a website for
your new group, you should try Squarespace. Squarespace makes building a website super
simple with their customizable templates, powerful website builder, and 24/7 award-winning
customer support. They even sell domains and the good news is
that ghosttrain.band is available. Having a web presence for whatever you do
is incredibly important since that will be what shows
up on Google when someone searches for you. The good news is that you can build your website
with Squarespace for 10% off by going to squarespace.com/HAI. I’ve used Squarespace for
years because it just works and you should too by going to squarespace.com/HAI.
