Huge thanks to Squarespace for making it possible
to launch my website snomangaming.com! I wanted to make sure you knew I’ve posted
a new editing tutorial on animation that you can check out RIGHT NOW in the description
below. Not only was it super easy to use the tools
Squarespace provides for sitebuilding, but it helped me to create something I’m really
proud of. There’s so many templates and options to
choose from and I had no issue purchasing the domain through them as well. Due to being extremely helpful through customer
support and full of resources to learn from, I had the confidence to try and create beyond
what I thought I was capable of. So if you’re in the market for a website
of your own, you can go to squarespace.com/snoman and use the offer code snoman for 10% off
your first purchase. Buh-bye!
