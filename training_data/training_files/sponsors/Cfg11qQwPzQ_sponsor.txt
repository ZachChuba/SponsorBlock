Thanks to Katie Mack, aka astrokatie, for
collaborating with me on this twitter-thread-inspired video poem. Now, if you’ve ever wondered how we can
know things like how far away distant stars and galaxies are, Brilliant.org, this video’s
sponsor, has an interactive course on just that, exploring trigonometric parallax, standard
candles, supernova, and more. Or if you want a small daily dose of science,
Brilliant has a short problem of the day, every day, that gives you just enough background
information to figure out a math or science puzzle; in fact, here’s one about measuring
the distance to the stars! You can sign up for free at brilliant.org/minutephysics,
and the first 200 people will also get 20% off an annual premium subscription with full
access to all of Brilliant’s courses and puzzles. Again, that’s brilliant.org/minutephysics.
