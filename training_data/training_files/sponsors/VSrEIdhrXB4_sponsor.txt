Skillshare, I want to tell you a story. I
recently turned 30, but back when I was in high school, I was super into computer visual
effects and sci-fi movies – however, there were very few easy ways to learn how to do
visual effects yourself. I mean, consumer access to digital video cameras was still
very new, personal computers were just starting to be good enough for legit video editing,
and youtube didn’t even exist. I had to scrounge in vfx chat-rooms, dvd special features,
and arcane blogs to learn enough to make my lord-of-the-rings and star-wars parodies.
Today at age 30, the situation is night and day – you can shoot and edit high definition
footage on a telephone, for crying out loud! And it’s much easier to learn how to use
more powerful tools like After Effects and Photoshop – services like Skillshare, for
example, now allow you to find tens of thousands of video tutorials on design, photography,
programming, visual effects, and more. And Skillshare is offering 30% off a year-long
premium membership for the first 200 people who go to skl.sh/minutephysics30 – again,
that’s skl.sh/minutephysics30 for 30% off – and it works even if you didn’t just
turn 30!
