recently i've been listening to lots of books that encourage me to fulfill my full potential like the four hour work week that's why i'm proud to be working with audible i've been a subscriber for almost a year and the books i listen to there help me keep my mind on the ball and stay focused on my goals and listening to other people's stories helps me reflect and improve myself if i wasn't doing that what else would i be doing with my time [Music] the most successful people i've met have consumed an insane amount of books i can pretty much do anything while reading these books and that's why audible is such a good resource allowing you to read audiobooks from anywhere and on any device you can even switch between devices and pick up where you left off on top of that you can download all your books and listen to them offline eventually it was just too much to pass up so i had to become a member a year ago and i've never looked back i swear by audible they're free for the first 30 days and actually you help me a lot by just signing up for that free trial if you smack that link in the description below this video it'll take you right to where you need to be and i hope you learned from it just as much as i have in the last 12 months oh snap there's one of those scammers any choice last words choose wisely and i'll make it quick
