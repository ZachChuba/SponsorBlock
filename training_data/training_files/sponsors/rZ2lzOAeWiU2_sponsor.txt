But first, here's a quick
message about the sponsor. I've got this friend who sends
me YouTube videos sometimes and he says, "Don't worry about
the thumbnail and the title. "It's a good video, I promise." And he's always right
because he knows me well. And I wish that would happen more often. If you feel that way, then you should check out
the sponsor of this video, Curiosity Stream. It's like Netflix for nerds, basically. They've got thousands
of movies and TV shows on topics like science, history,
nature, food, technology, travel, loads of things. I've just finished watching their "Engineering the Future" series and it's really good. Actually, their exclusives and
originals are award-winning. But the point is they're
hand-picked by experts. They're curated by people
who know what they're doing. It's a bit like that
friend of mine but better. Of course the service is
available on desktop and mobile, but it's also now
available on your smart TV. The promo on this one is really good. If you use my special URL,
curiositystream.com/stevemould, you get a whole year for just $14.99. The link is also in the description. So check out Curiosity Stream today.
