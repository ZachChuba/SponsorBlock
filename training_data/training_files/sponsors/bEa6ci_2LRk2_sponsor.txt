just have to lay it all out in notion notion is like a note-taking app a to-do manager a database and a document cloud all-in-one and you can use it either on your own or as part of a team it works like a box of Lego's letting you flexibly stack software tools however you want to build exactly the productivity system you want I mean just look at what people like Thomas Frank have accomplished with it it's mind-expanding now after every video I try to write down one thing I want to do specifically to focus on being better in the very next video but I've been doing it in an utterly disorganized way and a way completely detached from my usual production process mostly because I've never had a tool that felt like it could just do that job for me but I think notion can so I'm trying it out now and if you want to sign up to for free just go to bit dot Li slash notion vector and jump right in
