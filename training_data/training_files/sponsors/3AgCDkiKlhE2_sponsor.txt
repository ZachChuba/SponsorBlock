This is Alani. And today,
I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places
to watch movies: MUBI. MUBI is a treasure trove of films. Every day, MUBI premieres a new film. Whether it’s a movie
you’ve been dying to see or one you’ve never
heard of before, there is always
something new to discover. So, in this world
where it’s very easy to spend hours
debating what you should watch, MUBI is like having
a really cool friend with amazing taste in movies,
making it so much easier for you. They feature hard-to-come-by masterpieces,
indie festival darlings, influential art-house and foreign films,
lesser-known films by all your favorite
famous directors and more. Plus, you can even download the films
to watch online. And there are no ads, ever. One movie you can check out
right now on MUBI is “The Chrysanthemum and the Guillotine.” This explosive film is set
in 1920s Japan and follows the intertwined stories of
an anarchist group and a troupe of female sumo wrestlers. We can’t recommend MUBI highly enough. You can try it out now for free
