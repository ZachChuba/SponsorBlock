to be the president of the Engineering club at my college super smart guy so he's down to help me with this but the problem is he lives in a different city so it's kind of hard to build something together when you're not there building it together so Joe and I have been working together over the new Dropbox paper and it's been really easy to collaborate on this so he's been sending me lists of stuff I need to buy he's been sharing me diagrams 3d files that I could print to help improve the strength of my glider he's been sending me videos on other people building gliders he's been sending the advanced PhD level math on how to fix the center of gravity for my plane so the new Dropbox paper has just made it really easy to collaborate on stuff you can share pictures make lists do all kinds of you know timelines and calendars and just share everything
