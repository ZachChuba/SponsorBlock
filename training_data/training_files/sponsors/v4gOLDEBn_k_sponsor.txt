Over the next few years, SpaceX will be hiring
thousands of new employees to work on Starship. When it comes to hiring, Elon Musk has admitted
that he doesn’t care about college degrees. In fact, in the early days of SpaceX, Elon
taught himself rocket science by reading books and talking to people in the industry. Nowadays we are surrounded by amazing tools
