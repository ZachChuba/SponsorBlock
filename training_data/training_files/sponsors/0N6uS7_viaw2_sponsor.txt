thank Squarespace together sponsoring this video if you guys need a beautiful website in my opinion Squarespace is the best place to do it I've used a lot of platforms to build website over my like several years of being in the industry and none of them have worked as smoothly just so happy that they're continuing to sponsor me because it's a brand that I love and I will continue to use all the time oh also I just updated my website speaking of my website with my FAQ page there basically is that I get asked a lot I'll link that below and also for those of you who weren't receiving my newsletter and you had signed up or if you wanted to have a look at the newsletter without signing up I've made a page that has like the off kind of my newsletters which is only like two two newsletters but I mean if you're interested it's that and we'll build up over time so maybe by the time you see it it'll have three newsletters those pages were super easy easy to create it's literally took me a minute per page so I would definitely recommend trying Squarespace if you want to try it out go to squarespace.com slash very little page you will get a two week free trial and a 10% discount on your first purchase
