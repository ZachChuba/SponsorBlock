anytime thank you all well thank you so much mayor and i i definitely will enjoy the peaches picked right from the mayor's farm so thank you it was very thoughtful of you we're going to go to the phone line for questions just a reminder it's one question and one follow-up your first question comes from alan benner with st catherine standard please go ahead hello hi uh well welcome to niagara thank you um i just uh wondered since uh i suppose we entered stage two we we've seen uh really thousands of people from the gta congregating at our beaches uh clifton hill neither in the lake any other year that would be a great thing but uh it's leading to certainly concerns about uh social distancing uh mass wearing that type of thing um wondered if you have any advice for uh for our local political leaders on how to cope with that well i think the local leaders first of all are doing an incredible job they're fabulous i think i have advice for the people from toronto and gta and uh by all means i understand why you come down to a beautiful region dying down to niagara it's absolutely gorgeous here and you end up over at niagara falls again a beautiful area but folks you got to practice the golden rule social distancing make sure you have a face covering when you when you go on lines be it uh down on the strip there in niagara falls i they briefed me this morning i saw pictures this morning and you know we've come so far as a province and everyone is pitched in you know right across the board the technology we see at cleanworks today is one example world-class and i always go back to saying we have the brightest people anywhere in the world and i truly believe that and here's another example how we can pretty well sanitize anything through through the machines and i really encourage every manufacturer we have a lot of manufacturers especially in the food industry call clean works and get this piece of equipment because it's guaranteed sterilization 99.99 but in going back to your original question uh my friend you know it's just about consideration uh respecting uh other people that's really what it comes down to it's not about lack of advertising so more money on advertising the feds have municipalities have everyone knows the the rules just just respect them not as simple as that we're leading north america in the lowest cases they they came out with a number of 91 cases again 19 000 tests yesterday and again i say to every newscast i'll continue saying i play the smallest part in this it's all the rest of the 14.5 million people actually i better start changing that it's 14 million 770 000 people right here in ontario and we're growing rapidly best place anywhere in the world bar none can't compare us to anyone best of the best here very good thank you so much thank you you have a follow-up next question next question your next question comes from rob ferguson with the toronto star please go ahead hi rob hi premier um thanks for taking our questions today i just wanted to ask um uh with the pandemic pay um we're still getting sporadic reports that nurses for example still aren't getting it i hear the money has flowed the hospital but what's going on is we're coming on like five months here yeah it's all it's all out the door at the the province it's in over 2 000 employers and they have to distribute it i keep telling the employers i know there's 2 000 of them it was a little complicated but we got you the money start dishing it out like these people are in need of it by the way no one's gonna lose any pay it's gonna be retroactive right from day one it'll be nice to get a nice check but still these people can't wait you know people are scraping by right now it's hard to pay rent hard to pay a mortgage hard to put food on the table hospitals get your act together the ones that have already distributed i thank you but there's no reason this has taken way way too long let's get the money into the people's pockets that's the reason we put it out there so thanks for for mentioning that rob and i'll i'll make sure we have a health follow up with with the folks who still have the money and who hasn't distributed and i'll get our finance department and we'll get you a list by the way rob because these people have to be held accountable if they have the money they're waiting around it should be out the door simple as that but great question rob follow up and i'll bring you a couple of peaches
