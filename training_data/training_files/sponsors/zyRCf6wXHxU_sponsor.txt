but first this video is sponsored by mech arena becca arena is a mobile game i've come to enjoy a lot it pits you in fast-paced pvp battles that are quite balanced compared to other shooters but you're also in really cool mix there are a variety of game modes like 5v5s or even 2v2s and control point being a support in healer main in any game i've ever played my favorite mech was easily the md which has the ability to place a healing ore around itself to repair other banks in the midst of battle but doesn't lack the ability to lay down damage as well i also enjoyed the kill shot mech with its ability to ramp up the speed and plow into enemies or you could use the ability to apply pressure around the map and there's always events happening in mac arena as well like daily rewards all the way through the month netting you a bunch of cool weapons including the new disc launcher weapon and tons of halloween events to take part in mech arena is free to play on android and ios and you can use the qr code on the screen or you can use the link in the description to get a forced digital skin 200 acorns and 10 000 credits to help kick start your game and while you're at it feel free to add me in game and we'll blow up some mechs together
