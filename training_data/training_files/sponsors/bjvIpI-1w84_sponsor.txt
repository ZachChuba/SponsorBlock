And also thanks to Audible for supporting
MinuteEarth – Audible is a leading provider of audiobooks including fiction, non-fiction
and periodicals, and they’re offering free 30-day trials for our viewers at Audible.com/minuteearth. I’d like to recommend the book Predictably
Irrational by Dan Ariely, exploring various ways that humans reliably make irrational
decisions (like, how we’re often willing to put way more effort to get something that’s
free than the free thing is actually worth). Predictably Irrational is available on Audible,
and by using the free promo at Audible.com/minuteearth you help support MinuteEarth.
