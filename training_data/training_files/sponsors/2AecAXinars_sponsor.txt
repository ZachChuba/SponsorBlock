super promising but before I try it out on a call it's time for a quick ad from this video sponsor honey now we all enjoy online shopping and it's supposed to be pretty easy but when I do it I always have this nagging feeling am I getting the best deal because of promo codes you see lots of websites have promo codes that you can apply at various times they always vary and sometimes they have good savings and other times not so much but the tricky part is actually finding valid ones now this is where today's sponsor honey comes into play because they can automatically scan coupon codes for the website run and automatically apply them to your shopping cart and it's definitely the JIT because it's part of the PayPal and venmo family now to get honey it is completely free and all you have to do is go to join honey dot-com / DIY perks and installing it is super easy because it's just a browser add-on so it's just a couple of clicks which is super cool makes it super easy to get basically free money because at that point why not so again that's join honey dot-com / DIY perks and you could save all sorts of money on all sorts of things definitely a no-brainer and recommended
