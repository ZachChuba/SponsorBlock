I try to kick start my mornings on a positive note after I watch the "Perfect Morning"  team lecture on Skillshare which is a website that features tons of classes on any possible subject which you can bookmark and save into your account Lots of those classes also have featured projects which you can complete and discuss with the community online, so you can get the most out  of the subjects of your preference. There's actually a limited promotion where you can have unlimited access to Skillshare during three months for 99 cents. You can find all the information in the description box below.
