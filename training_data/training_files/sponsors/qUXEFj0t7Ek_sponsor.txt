I used some conceptual terms in this video,
like friction, rolling resistance and magnetism. These are foundational concepts, the kind
that is crucial to understanding how machines work, whether it’s a hovertrain, or supersonic
jet. But it’s one thing to be made to memorize
a concept and the formulas, and another to actually develop an intuitive understanding,
one that’ll actually benefit you in the real world. And that’s why I love Brilliant.org . It’s
not only a highly effective way to learn math and science, but also a lot of fun. Brilliant gets you engaged by letting you
solve problems and learn through doing, instead of just listening to a lecture and jotting
down notes. They strengthen your reasoning, creativity
and problem solving skills, which are essential to everyday life. A great place to start acquiring the critical
building blocks for understanding physics is ‘Physics of the Everyday’. Go to Brilliant.org/mustard and sign up to
get started. And also, the first 200 will get 20% off the
annual premium subscription for a fun and
