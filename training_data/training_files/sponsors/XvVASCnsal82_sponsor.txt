I wanna give a huge shout out
to today's sponsor Squarespace They're one of my favorite
companies to work with. And their product is
absolutely phenomenal. Every time we've had to make a
website in the past two years whether it was my own
personal merge website or just a joke website that
I made to add an extra layer of production into a video, I've always turned to Squarespace
and it's always so easy. You can start by choosing
one of these amazing designer templates that
will help you achieve whatever Look you're going for. Whether you're making
a blog, an online store or even a photo collection of your life size cardboard
cutout of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Squarespace can help you do it quickly, easily and beautifully. Already have a website
or multiple websites but you wanna transfer
those domains to Squarespace to have more consolidated
management of those websites? You can do that. Need help with your website
at four in the morning 'cause you're very tired and forgot how to change the font size? Call customer support, they'll help. They're 24-7, they're award-winning help. I didn't even know you
could win awards for that but Squarespace did. To get started making a brand new website, go to squarespace.com/drew and you'll get 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain
at squarespace.com/drew. Do it. Thank you so much to Squarespace for
sponsoring today's video and helping support my channel
for over two years now. And thank you to everybody
who uses the products that I tend to plug on this channel. It's because of you guys at
the brands keep coming back and supporting me. And so, you're also supporting me by supporting them and
everyone's supported and that's great.
