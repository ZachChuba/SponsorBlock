If you don’t want to pay $40 but still don’t
know how to make tea, you can go to Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community
that has over 16,000 classes on pretty much anything and everything. If you want to learn something, chances are
Skillshare can teach you. That opening line was not even a joke. There are dozens of classes about tea, but
there are also some more, uh… useful classes about topics like graphic design, drawing,
photography, and more. An annual membership gives you unlimited access
to their classes for less than $10/month, but the first 200 people to sign up over Skl.sh/HAI2
can learn whatever they want on Skillshare for free for their first two months and they’ll
be supporting the channel while they’re at it.
