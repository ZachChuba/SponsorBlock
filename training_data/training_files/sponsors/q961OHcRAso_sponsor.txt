into that this video was kindly sponsored by Ray Khan when Ray Khan contacted me and said that they wanted to sponsor a video I was so excited because I already used ray cons and I really really liked them I am super particular when it comes to ear buds my ears get so sensitive to the shape of ear buds that certain pairs will make my ears hurt nose I wonder if my ears get bruised home some of the buds but these are so good these are affordable wireless earbuds that were created by Ray J these are such good quality for such a fair price and this is their newest model I'm actually gonna unbox this for you they sent me another pair even though I already have them and I really feel like I put them to the test last week I had two flights in one day you guys know how that goes you know changing planes is a whole thing and I wore my Ray cons as I was walking through multiple airports and getting on and off the plane I'm the type that just wears them right from the plane all the way to the baggage claim they stay in your ear they're comfortable I also always sleep on planes with my headphones in and I could sleep on them without them causing any pain to my ear they come with a bunch of different sizes to find your perfect fit for your ear and I really appreciate the way that this is set up for you and then they also come in this tiny little it's almost like a little beam and you open it up and there's your headphones and they also charge in here which is so convenient these have six hours of continuous playtime seamless bluetooth pairing more bass and a more compact design and they start at about half the price of some of the other premium headphone out there so if you want to check out recons go to buy it ray cons calm slash Kendall right and that will also link you to their Black Friday deals and
