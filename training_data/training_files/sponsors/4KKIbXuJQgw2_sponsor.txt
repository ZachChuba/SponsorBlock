Hi guys, this is Issac,
the newest team member of The Take. And today I want to talk to you
about Skillshare, an online learning community we love,
with over 25,000 classes taught by seasoned pros. Skillshare has a class
on pretty much anything you would want. You can develop your creativity
through a class on calligraphy, graphic design, or writing. You can learn to succeed in business
with classes on how to make it as a free lancer, market a podcast,
or become an Instagram influencer. You can use it to master new technology
through classes on web design, coding and data science. Or you can bring that extra flair
into your lifestyle, sharpen your knife skills,
learn paper making, speak Spanish or let Fraser Davidson,
a Bafta award winning director and animator, teach you how to animate
amazing characters. Right now Skillshare is offering
our viewers two months access to all their classes, for free. Just clink the link
