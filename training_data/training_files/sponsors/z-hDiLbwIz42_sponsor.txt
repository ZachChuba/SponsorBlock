And of course, I want to thank
today's sponsor, Squarespace. Squarespace is the best
way, the easiest way to build a website. I've used it a bunch for
my personal projects, like the book that I'm working on, realoriginsbook.com, that
was built with Squarespace. It's got niswander.com, that was also built with Squarespace. They've got these beautiful templates that are also highly customizable so your website can stand
out among the masses. And in fact, just this
year, Squarespace has added eight brand new templates
for you guys to dive into and customize and make it your own. They're beautiful, they're great, they're gonna help get your
creative juices flowing on whatever project
that you're workin' on. And just because Squarespace
loves you wonderful nerds, they're gonna make it even easier for you to get started today. Head on over to squarespace.com
