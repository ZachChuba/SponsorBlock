I was inspired to do this video after watching
a couple of videos on Skillshare about planning, organization and time management. One of those videos teaches how to create
planner pages using Adobe Illustrator so that’s why I decided to show you how you can some
basic layouts using software that most people have in their computer – Microsoft Word. Skillshare is an online learning community
for creators with thousands of classes on planning, productivity, learning and so on. Premium Membership gives you unlimited access
so you can keep learning, find inspiration, and take on new projects whenever you want. The first people to use the promo link in
the description box will get their first 2 months free, then it’s as low as $10 a month
after that to continue learning if you like it. Or cancel if you don’t, there’s no risk. You can also learn from anywhere: download
the mobile app on Android or iPhone and tap into classes even when you’re offline.
