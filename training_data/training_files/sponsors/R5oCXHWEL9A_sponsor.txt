For a deeper look into how to compare relativistic
velocities, I highly recommend heading over to Brilliant.org's course on special relativity. There, you can explore custom scenarios that
build off the topics in this video to get an intuitive understanding of the mathematics
of relativistic velocity addition - like how to warn earth of an incoming relativistic
alien invasion. The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you take the next step on the topics I'm including
in this series, and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that's Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
