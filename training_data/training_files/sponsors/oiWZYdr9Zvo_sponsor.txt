but before that I just want to talk about reflections again we talked about fractions earlier I want talk about in relation to the sponsor of this video so this video is sponsored by brilliant org if you don't know what that is yet it's a website full of puzzles and problems you work through these puzzles and problems and by the end you you've learned something it's like it's like online learning but through puzzles and problems and I've said this before I'm a strong believer the best way to learn something is by doing not just watching my videos and that's what you get with brilliant dot-org and I really like the way they've curated the the puzzles and like the the progression of them is really good it's not too hard it's not too easy and you feel Reece Mart by then because you are smarter you've learnt something and I'm really grateful for them continuing to sponsor my videos I really think their hearts in the right place that their philosophy of learning and stuff like that all my interactions with them have been really great so yeah if you want to think like a scientist think like a mathematician go to brilliant dot org forward slash Steve mold the links also in the description there if you use that link it helps me out because they know that the sponsorship is working and as a bonus the first 76 people to use that link get 20% off annual premium membership should they choose to upgrade Oh what was I gonna do with reflections so you know that's the other thing about brilliant is like there's little search box and if you're thinking about particular thing I think about reflections did they type it in and it'll bring up all these courses about whatever it is just doing that today I found this lovely puzzle about reflections like you've got this incident ray it bounces around it comes out and is parallel if it's bounced around five times it's parallel what West the angle be and the way you work out is you get this long equation they all cancels back down again you get the answer it's really good fun
