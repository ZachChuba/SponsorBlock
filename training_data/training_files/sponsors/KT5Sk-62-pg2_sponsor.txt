We covered here. I highly recommend checking out brilliant org who I'd like to thank for sponsoring this video Brilliant is an educational platform that hosts over 50 interactive math and science courses They not only teach you the technical information. You need to know for the various subjects, but they also challenge you with interactive practice problems Programming and just in general more hands-on approach. So you have a real fundamental understanding of what you're learning If you're like me and really enjoyed the unique applications of mathematics, then you won't be disappointed by what they have to offer If you like the topics in this video, for example, then their astronomy course would definitely be something you'd enjoy It starts off by going over the essential technical information to get you started with astronomy and astrophysics topics But then it goes more into what you saw earlier such as geodesics Services with different curvature and the mathematics of non Euclidean geometry as it pertains to the shape of the universe Then they go much further covering dark matter dark energy black holes and more if you're looking to understand more of the strange mystery It's about our universe. I highly recommend checking this out and they're adding new courses all the time like recently they came out with a puzzle science course where anyone can develop foundational physics knowledge while playing around with fun interactive puzzles and For the more advanced people they have things like differential equations courses that go beyond what I even saw my college curriculum So there's something for everyone to learn So if you want to get started right now and support the channel You can click the link below or go to brilliant org slash major prep to get 20% off your annual premium
