Oh, you know what that means. It's time for a word from our sponsor, Audible. Ugh, What am I gonna do with all this stuff? Guys, I know I mentioned this already, but I'm moving soon. In just a couple of days me, my wife and my dog are gonna be driving from California to Illinois. We've got all our stuff in boxes. We've got board games, card games and board games packed up in boxes. Guys, if you've ever spent 30 hours in a car before, you know that spending 30 hours in a car sucks. Just take it from Peanut! But one thing that can make car rides a lot more bearable is listening to a good audiobook. Audible is the best place to listen to audiobooks. It's an app you can get on your phone. They have thousands maybe even more than that. I have no reference for how many audiobooks they have, but the amount that they have is insane. You can listen to them right on your phone. *bark* It's so crazy than my dogs getting excited about it! *bark* H-Honestly a little bit too excited. That's enough outta you, Peanut. *woof* Gosh, one thing I've always wanted to do is read the Harry Potter books. I've only ever seen in the movies because I'm a piece of millennial trash and I- I don't like reading. But since I've got 30 hours in a car where I'm not doing jack shit, I'll probably just listen to it on audiobook. Plus, Laura won't let me read books while I drive cuz she's a jerk. Laura: Okay.
