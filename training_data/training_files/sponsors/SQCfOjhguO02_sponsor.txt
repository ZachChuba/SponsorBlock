Unfortunately, Brilliant
didn't exist in 1957, so they maybe they have an excuse, but
fast forward 60 years and you don't, because it's right here. Brilliant is a problem-solving website
that teaches you to think like a scientist through interactive quizzes and courses
that are designed to be interesting. You can see there are many courses you can choose from but if you want to be a nuclear physicist, and I mean a good one, that hopefully
won't cause the next Kyshtym disaster, then Brilliant will help you understand concepts like
the difference between the types of nuclear reaction, how a chain reaction can be
used to generate electricity, and if in fact every chain
reaction results in an explosion. We love explaining about
Asia and the world around us, but the best way to learn is
obviously by doing it yourself. And much like our videos,
what Brilliant does is it takes a problem, breaks them
up into bite-sized concepts, presents clear logic in each part, and then builds back up to
an exciting conclusion. If you go to brilliant.org/kentobento,
you can get started for free, and if you're one of the first 200
people to sign up with the link below, you will receive 20% off
your premium subscription. It's an incredibly engaging
website, we use it! And by giving Brilliant a try, you will also be supporting
us here at Kento Bento.
