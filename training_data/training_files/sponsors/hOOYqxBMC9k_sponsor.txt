this video is sponsored by the ridge wallet i have right here my old wallet that i've had since high school and needless to say i am very glad to have a new one comparing the two wallets the ridge wallet is a lot smaller lighter more thin and isn't awkward and bulgy in your pocket so with the ridge wallet if a girl asks you what's that bulge in your pocket you can say it's not my wallet actually that might not work out in your favor now i know it is current year after all and no one uses cash but if you want to go to that sketchy wing place down the street that only takes cash and charges you four dollars to use their atm well the ridge ball can also hold cash the ridge wallet holds up to 12 cards and it's very easy to take the cards out you just push it in there fan your cards out take the card out that you want and then slide them back in it's made with rfid blocking technology which protects you from digital pickpocketers trying to train their thieving the ridge team is so confident with their product there's a 45-day money-back guarantee and there's a lifetime warranty on it too go to ridge.com mudkip check out their wallets check out their other products they have free shipping and returns worldwide and make sure to use the code mudkip at checkout for 10 off and thank you again to rich for
