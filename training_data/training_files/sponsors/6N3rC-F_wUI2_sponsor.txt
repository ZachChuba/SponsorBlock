to learn. They have over 17,000 courses about anything
and everything. They even have a course by yours truly about
how to make an educational video essay. If you decide to attempt to break this record,
you should definitely sign up for Skillshare because their iPhone and Android apps let
you download any one of their classes offline so you can learn from anywhere. The best thing is that you can learn for free
for two months by being one of the first 200 people to sign up over at skl.sh/hai3 and
then after that itâ€™s as low as $10 per month. Now get out of here.
