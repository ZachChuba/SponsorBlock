brought to you by audible I'm so excited to partner with audible again because I'm a huge fan of audiobooks I'm a slow reader and hardly have time in my busy schedule to sit down and read but with audible you're able to integrate audiobooks into your busy schedule I listen in the shower in the car while I'm cooking and cleaning or when I'm exercising outside and right now audible is giving my viewers a 30 day trial with an audiobook and two audible originals for free all you have to do is go to audible.com slash the elk or text the elk one-word to 500 500 right now I'm reading Marvel Comics the untold story which chronicles the history of Marvel comics creators like Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the iconic superheroes they helped create over a 70 year span if you're a fan of comic books I can't recommend the title enough audible members can choose three titles every month one audiobook and two audible originals that you can't find anywhere else not only is this a great way to access a ton of content but it's also a fantastic way to help support entertaining ilk so I can make more videos so again go to audible.com slash the elk or text the elk to five hundred
