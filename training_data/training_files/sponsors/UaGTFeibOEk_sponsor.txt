If you're an Amazon Prime member, then
for a limited time you can start an Audible membership
and save 66% on your first three months,
which is $30 off. It's $4.95 a month for the first three months,
and after that it's only $14.95 a month. The offer is valid from the 1st July
to the 31st July 2019. Every month, you get one free audiobook and two
free Audible Originals from an ever-changing list. I've spent a lot of times
on planes recently, and a good way for me to pass that time
without constantly staring at a screen is to listen to audiobooks. I really enjoyed Seanan McGuire's
Sparrow Hill Road, it is a lovely set of ghost stories set on
the sort of American backroads that only exist in the imagination. Go to audible.com/trustme
or text ‘trustme’ to 500 500 and start listening. It'll help keep your mind occupied
wherever you are,
