And if you’re interested in becoming more
familiar with the science that’s all around you,
Brilliant.org can help. Brilliant offers a new Daily Challenge every
day —and the questions cover all sorts of topics, from statistics to electricity to computer
science. You can see each new Daily Challenge for free,
but if you sign up to become a Premium member, you’ll get access to the entire archive. Each problem comes with all the context you
need to solve the problem yourself, as well as illustrations, animations, or interactive
visualizations to help you get there. It’s a great way to stay curious about the world
around you—and learn basic concepts by applying them to real problems. To find out more, head to Brilliant.org/SciShow.
If you’re one of the first 200 people to sign up, you’ll get 20% off the annual Premium
subscription! So if you’re interested, check it out. And
as always, thanks for watching SciShow!
