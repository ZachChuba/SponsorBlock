about reading materials I want to quickly give a shout out to hi PDF sponsor today's episode so basically I PDF is an all-in-one clear solution that allows you to convert comprise merge and protect PDFs so just like I was saying if you are in college you probably get most of your study and reading materials emailed to you by your teacher or listed on an e-learning platform in PDF format and that means that having software that allows you to make those files a little bit easier to access and work with will be tremendously useful during your time in college for instance I always use merging and converting programs to create a single file where I can compile all of my reading materials and then we organize them according to my syllabus insert my own type notes in between two sets of reading materials and so on also you can now use hi PDF for simple PDF editing tasks like editing rotating cropping deleting pages extracting images from PDF files rearranging pages and so on most of IPF tools are actually available for free although the paid version allows for features like compressing files via email email supporting English access to OCR which is a tool that can convert text in image files to editable text as well as a lot for conversion of bigger files whether you pick the free version or the paid version depends on your budget and your needs but either way I have both option
