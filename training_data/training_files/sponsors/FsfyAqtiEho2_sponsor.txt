Not everyone has an up-close view of rising
sea levels, but, I, for one, can really relate to the feeling of having your head underwater
- being totally overwhelmed with so much to do and so little time to do it. Recently, after watching this class on Skillshare,
I started planning pretty much every minute of my day. I used to put everything on a to-do list. But, let’s be honest, I usually ended the
week with more to do than when I started - it’s a lot easier to add to the list than remember
to check it. I highly recommend checking out Thomas Franks’
class on Productivity, or one of the others on design, programming, investing, cooking,
and lots of other topics. You can try Skillshare today with a 2 month
