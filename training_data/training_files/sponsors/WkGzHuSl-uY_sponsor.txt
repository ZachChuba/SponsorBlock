If the leader does make the trip to the US,
he’ll, of course, have to deal with the long flight but he can make that time productive. He could use the Skillshare iOS or Android
app to watch their course on negotiations offline. This great course teaches you the skills needed
to get a raise, reach better business deals, leverage your country’s thermonuclear weapons
development program to remove economic sanctions, and buy things for less. With over 22,000 courses, if there’s something
you want to learn, you can almost certainly learn it on Skillshare. It’s a great engaging and fun way to use
downtime for personal development. Best of all, by being one of the first 500
to sign up at skl.sh/hai20, you can learn for free for your first two months.
