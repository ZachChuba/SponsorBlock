this video is sponsored by dungeon craft the coolest idea for a book with not one to reign peace not to the like a lot more than that and they all look good the front and back sort of good and evil variations are my favorite with such incredible punch-out tiles oh you got to cut them out damn it well it's a good thing there are so many more pages to use and hey man sniffing papers is therapeutic it's like they knew it takes me a while to actually freaking draw a map and not accidentally smear some of the details but I threw this map together in less than five seconds with such an incredible product they're also really close to reaching their goal and the book is only like 30 bucks if that ain't a steal then neither is raiding a Best Buy during a blackout except only one of these great deals is legal now go watch
