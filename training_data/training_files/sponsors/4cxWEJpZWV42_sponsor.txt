If you want to create an illegal emoji merch
store, though, please don’t use Squarespace. There’s probably something in their terms
of service against doing that, but if you’re doing legal stuff, you should absolutely have
a Squarespace website. If you run any sort of business or hope to,
you should have a professional internet presence because how else are people going to find
you? In a phonebook? If you know absolutely nothing about design,
like me, don’t worry because Squarespace has amazing templates that pretty much make
it impossible to build a bad looking website. Their website builder does, however, have
powerful customization tools so you can make exactly what you want to make. Best of all, you can go to Squarespace.com/HAI
for a free trial and then when you’re ready to launch, use the offer code HAI to save
10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.
