the glass layer we can control what
colors of light are reflected and absorbed, just like Bernard. This is an
interactive cartoon from today's sponsor, brilliant org. You can adjust the
wavelength of light and the thickness of the glass to control which colors are
reflected, then use what you've learned to answer today's problem about creating
anti-reflective coating in a solar panel. If you find that this excites in you a
passion for solar energy you can talk about it with the other engineers
discussing the problem or check out a whole course about it. This is just one
of brilliants daily problems, which range from vector calculus to computational
biology to quantum physics, and every problem has an accompanying course to go
with it. Signing up is free but I strongly recommend their premium
membership which gives you unlimited access to all their courses. I use
brilliant pretty much every day to deepen my understanding about the video
topic I'm working on. I've used it for a bunch of my quantum physics videos and
pretty much whenever I need to brush up on math, and I find it to be an
invaluable tool. For a 20% discount be one of the first 200 people to sign
