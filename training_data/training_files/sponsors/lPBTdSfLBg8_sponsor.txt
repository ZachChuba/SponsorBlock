The company that’s trying to use the particle-accelerator
technology I talked about in this video to make solar cells on a commercial scale, this
company is called Rayton Solar. This is a challenging and expensive endeavor and they’re
looking for investors, so they sponsored this video to get the word out - startengine.com/startup/rayton-solar.
I’m not going to make any endorsement – I mean, I’m neither an investment expert,
nor a solar industry expert – but I do believe strongly that we need both political and technological
solutions to secure our planet’s energy future, so I’m happy to help Rayton reach
a broader audience to help give them a chance for this clever idea to succeed, and I’m
making a small investment myself. Hopefully they’ll end up being one of the many many
pieces that come together to provide a civilized long-term future for humanity on earth.
