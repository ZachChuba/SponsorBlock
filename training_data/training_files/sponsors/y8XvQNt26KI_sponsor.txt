Maybe you could also use a little nudge, not to pursue anything as ambitious as asteroid mining, just to try something new and fun. Let us give you some tailwind there. We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community with thousands of classes in all kinds of creative skills like graphic design, music, photography,
illustration and animation. They have something for every skill level, so no matter from where you're starting, there'll be tons of things for you to explore! If you'd like to take a glimpse
behind the scenes of our animations, for example, we've made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how we animated scenes from our videos, with video lessons classes and hands-on projects. Or if you'd rather come up with your own characters
to breathe life into, we recommend 'Character Illustration: from Concept
to Final Artwork' by Matt Kaufenberg. But it doesn't really matter what you pick, as long as you get started,
improve your skills and have some fun. Unlimited access to all classes is only $10/month
with an annual premium membership. But we have a treat for the
first 1000 Kurzgesagt viewers to click the link in the description: you'll get a two-month trial for free! If you want to leave your comfort zone
by exploring new skills and support Kurzgesagt, give it a try!
