Yeah. So a fun fact about Annie that
may come as a shock to you is that she actually has
to pay taxes every year. Go figure. It's rare, it doesn't happen
to everyone-- just kidding. You all have to pay taxes. And when you do it, you're
going to want the right tool. And as we've mentioned
before on this show, there is an awesome product
called TurboTax Live which basically takes the TurboTax
that you have loved-- so explain to us a little
bit about your relationship with TurboTax. Yeah. The first time I ever
filed was with TurboTax. And I-- Memories. Yeah, memories. And then the next
year that I did-- so I have a really hard
time making myself to like logistical things, actually. So as an accountability
thing, I made some friends came
over and do theirs at the same time as
me on their laptops. You had a tax party. It was fun. I love that. Did you have snacks? We ate candy-- yeah. Candy. Yeah. I love that. Yeah. So now that you've taken
TurboTax, which allows people like Annie, who
maybe typically are avoidant toward that kind
of thing, do their taxes. And they have boosted it with
TurboTax Live, which gives you access to real tax experts. They're certified
and guaranteed, who can talk with you anytime
of the day about questions that you may have, advice
you need, et cetera. And you can speak to them
by one-way video chat, which is very cool because it
means you get to see them, but they can't see you. So you can be in your
pajamas or whatever. And basically, they just help
give you that extra layer of reassurance that
some of us need when they're doing
their taxes, because it can be really intimidating. Like if you feel like you're
doing something wrong, it's really scary. So definitely check out
TurboTax and TurboTax Live. We'll link you to that in the
description and the show notes.
