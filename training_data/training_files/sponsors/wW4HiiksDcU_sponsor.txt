The Elgato Cam Link takes your mirrorless,
DSLR, GoPro, or camcorder and turns it into a higher-quality facecam than any webcam could
ever provide - without the hassle and headache of normal USB webcam drivers or their terrible
settings configuration. Get an uncompressed, low-latency 1080p60 signal
from your camera straight to your stream with this little device right here. Buy one via the link in the video description.
