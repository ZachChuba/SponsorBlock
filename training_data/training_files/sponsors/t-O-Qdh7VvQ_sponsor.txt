If you’re wondering how I calculated the
efficiencies of converting mass to energy, you can just divide the energy any reaction
releases by the mass energy of the things involved – for example, when radium radioactively
decays into radon and helium it releases 6.6 MeV of energy, and the mass energy of a single
neutron or proton is about 940MeV, so I’ll leave it to you to figure out how efficient
alpha decay is at converting mass to energy! Or you can learn more about nuclear fission
and fusion by finishing this quiz on Brilliant.org, which is this video’s sponsor and is full
of interactive quizzes and mini courses on physics and math. If you really want to understand physics deeply,
you have to work through calculations and solve problems yourself, and Brilliant offers
an interactive online way to do just that. You can check out their course on black holes
for free using the link in the description, and if you decide to sign up for premium access
to all of their courses, you can get 20% off by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that’s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which lets Brilliant know you came from here.
