get into that I'd like to give a huge thank you to obviously McAfee for sponsoring this video they sent me one of their kits and they come with squishies and also all of these cool slime toppings and they have different names and textures and this one was my favorite as you can see it really resembles a typical same thing I think it's called a jammies texture and the best thing about this is that you can add loads of different textures and they separate so easily they're totally customizable to your preference like the best bubble pops as you can hear here and then they just separate all of them don't mix together and they're just really fun to mix up and just play with and the squishies are so soft and they don't have the weird smell similar as well which I find own lots of squishes too so I really enjoyed experimenting with this and playing with
