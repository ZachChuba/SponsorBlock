Like bees, we humans are also hairy - and
for those who want to keep their hair in check, there's Dollar Shave Club, our sponsor. For a limited time, new members get a month
of the Executive Razor with a tube of Dr. Carverâ€™s Shave Butter for only $5 with free
shipping at dollarshaveclub.com/minuteearth. After that, razors are just a few bucks a
month, with no hidden fees or commitments. My husband and I both tried it, and they really
were awesome razors, delivered right to our door, for a great price. To get your first box, go to dollarshaveclub.com/minuteearth
