thanks to D Bren for sponsoring us here at CES 2019 there dbrand grip cases which I will be doing plenty of drop tests with our super grippy their impact resistant and they're built with the same precision you'd expect from D brand with nice accurate cutouts for your camera your touch sensor anything else you might have like say for example a headphone jack or stylus did I just break my stylus the stylus popped out is Oh nope nevermind still good haha that's good and they've got super clicky buttons but the really new thing is their prism screen protectors when they told me the demo I'd be doing with this thing I thought they were freaking nuts not only did they have me hammer a nail into a piece of wood using the screen of a phone only to have it not damaged they had me hit the front of the screen with the hammer to demonstrate just how impact resistant it is and it comes with this really cool little piece that goes into the bottom of your phone and helps you align it perfectly every time so check out the D brand grip and D brand
