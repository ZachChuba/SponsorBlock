merch has kind of a new directive now it honestly doesn't matter like kind of how much margin we make on it or if it's necessarily the most sensible thing to bring down the road map at this time or whatever the thing is any LTTE merch moving forward because I was really unhappy with some of the old stuff just needs to be good you need to get it I need to feel like oh they cared yeah they cared enough that this is good so I'm fine if it's a little bland but I would be really upset if the quality of it was not acceptable yeah so that was what that was basically that unjust before getting on the show I would I had this been delivered to me with my name on it with shirt so I can't possibly forget things cuz everyone knows I'm pretty about it which is great thank you Boyd but I put the shirt on and immediately before the show even I was like wow it feels really nice yes like the shirts are just better the designs not out there or anything these are really logo this is a really simple desert desert this is a really simple shirt that we'd like anyone to kind of quickly feel like they're not you know shilling for a line of sanity a group by wearing it they just it's just I just want to see like look into nice shirt that's comfortable and that they they like to wear and once we get that down once we feel like no you know what every item that ships from our warehouse it's just nice then we can start to do some more out there stuff yeah I got to tell you the store has been doing amazing we did a coupon last week and we did the most orders that we've ever done in a week by a country mile and we have the thing is we still only got like what four or five shirt designs and like cable ties and I think there's like one other thing like some of the really cool stuff that I think is gonna I made I bet Nick do you have you seen the water bottle prototype I think so oh okay I gave it to Steve so I Q won't have another chance pretty sure I saw yeah I gave him our first prototype the one with the circuit board on it right yes so matte black with a glossy black circuit board and Linus tech tips up the side and orange it looks incredible I bet Nick I told them if we don't sell a thousand of them in the first like three
