such as the mystery of
the second Mona Lisa, whose very existence
has puzzled art experts for over a century. Why are there two
versions of The Mona Lisa? And is the one sitting
in the Louvre in Paris even the original? Now, if you want to
find out all about this, there's an excellent
documentary breaking this down (similar to this video) that I highly
recommend you check out. It's available right
now on CuriosityStream, a streaming service with thousands
of high-quality documentaries, created by the same guy
behind the Discovery Channel. So there's The Mona Lisa Mystery
which you should definitely check out, but if you're one of those people who doesn't quite understand
how to look at art, or how to look at a painting (kinda like me who finds
it all a bit baffling) I'd also recommend this
12-part series called, well, "How to Look at a Painting". Now if you love the Kento Bento channel, you're almost certain to be
