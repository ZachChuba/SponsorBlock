Dashlane is the ultimate tool to help you
stay safe online. Worried about losing access to your accounts,
having weak or reused passwords, worried about hackers, concerned about somebody monitoring
your internet history? Dashlane has you covered with a myriad of
tools as your disposal, such as a password manager, autofill for personal info and payment
details, a VPN with country selection for safe private browsing, and dark web monitoring
to see if your data is being bought and sold on the dark web. There’s a free version with basic elements
but Dashlane premium gives you access to all these benefits at a cheaper price than other
security services that have less features! Dashlane does all in one package what you
would normally need 3 or 4 different tools to do. If you’re not convinced yet, Dashlane has
graciously allowed me to offer my viewers a FREE 30 day trial of Dashlane Premium. Just go to dashlane.com/t1j and you can see
all of these features in action, and try out Dashlane for yourself. If you like it, make sure you use the coupon
code T1J at checkout for 10% off your purchase. And remember, by supporting sponsors like
Dashlane you not only get access to a great service, but you also support me and allow
me to take my content to the next level.
