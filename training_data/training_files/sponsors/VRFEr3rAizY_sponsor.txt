time for our sponsor master on the mast Rob Sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones sound fantastic and why shouldn't they they're based on Sennheiser's legendary HT 6 50s with pretty much nothing tuned that is why they have sold over 50,000 units of this stuff just nice natural bass and a really full sound to these open backed cans we've got a detachable six-foot cable now instead of the 10-foot one that's based on community feedback because people don't want to get tangled up in it and they include a 1/8 inch plug that's versatile for everyday use a quarter inch adapter so you can plug it into anything you'd want and Sennheiser's long-term support check out the link below to join the drop today oh
