tangible or relatable as the things we interact with on a regular basis. And if you, too, want to dive deeper into
the physics of everyday objects, look no further than Brilliant, this video’s sponsor. Brilliant has a whole course on the physics
of everyday objects, including fridges and water towers and bikes - bikes are great!
- and Brilliant also has fun, short daily challenges and puzzles to learn about stuff
like regression to the mean and fluids and thermodynamics without the huge time commitment

of MinutePhysics and they’re offering 20% off of a premium subscription to the first
