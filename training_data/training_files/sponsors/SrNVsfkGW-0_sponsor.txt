more into the details of relativity of simultaneity,
I highly recommend heading over to Brilliant.org's course on special relativity that they've
been developing simultaneously with this video series (well, at least, simultaneous from
my perspective). There, you can explore custom scenarios and
do actual puzzles and problems that help you build on what you learned in this video, like
figuring out how laser tag would work at relativistic speeds! The special relativity questions on Brilliant.org
are specifically designed to help you go deeper on the topics I'm including in this series,
and you can get 20% off of a Brilliant subscription by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, thatâ€™s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
