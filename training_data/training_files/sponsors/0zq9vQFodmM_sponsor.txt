So for that reason, I am happy to have
this video supported by Skillshare. Skillshare is a place where you can
develop your skill based interests through classes on things like
design, innovation, and technology. For my audience, I would
recommend some courses on Python, including this one for 
data science and machine learning, and this one covering the
basics of Python programming. I do have a special link where my viewers can get
two months of unlimited access to Skillshare for free, so I'll put that link on the screen
and down in the description. I'd really encourage you to check it out
because they have over 20,000 courses, I'm sure you can find one there to try and develop some of your own skill based interests and start learning. So thank you guys for watching this video,
and I'll see you next time.
