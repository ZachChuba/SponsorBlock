Ethan: Once again, I'd like to thank Audible for supporting our podcast. Audible has an unmatched selection of audiobooks. Original shows, news, comedy and more. I personally love using Audible when I'm playing Overwatch or hitting the gym, losing that fupa. But if you're just goofing around and need something to listen to, Audible is as good as it gets. The book that I've been reading is "Alexander Hamilton" by Ron Chernow. It's the book that actually inspired the Emmy Award-winning Broadway play, "Hamilton." It's a really fascinating book about one of the most influential and underappreciated figure in American history. For our audience, Audible's offering a free audiobook with a 30 day free trial. If you wanna listen to it, Audible has it. Go to audible.com/h3podcast and browse their unmatched selection of audio content. Download a title for free and start listening. It is that easy.
