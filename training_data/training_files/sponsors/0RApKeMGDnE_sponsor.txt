If you don’t want to make silly math mistakes
like Einstein, then you should probably head to Brilliant.org, this video’s sponsor,
to sharpen and hone your math and science skills. In fact, Brilliant has a whole interactive
course on cosmology and within it, a quiz specifically titled “The fate of the Universe”
that was tailor-made for giving you a deeper understanding than you can possibly gain from
simply watching a video like this one. Brilliant also has fun daily challenges, which
are bite-sized math and science-puzzles - like this one about what happens to a thermometer
if you put it in space, and then rotate it. Does it still read the same temperature? Or hotter or colder? Brilliant is offering 20% off of a premium
subscription to the first 200 MinutePhysics viewers to go to brilliant.org/minutephysics
- that lets Brilliant know you came from here, and gets you full access to all of Brilliant’s
courses, puzzles, and daily challenges. Again, that’s brilliant.org/minutephysics
so that you don’t mess up like Einstein.
