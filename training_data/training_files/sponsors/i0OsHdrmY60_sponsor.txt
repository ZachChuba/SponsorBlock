nope we're gonna talk about sponsors get wrecked everyone the first sponsor is private area access and I don't have a banner for this but I kind of want to can I do this yeah okay I'm just gonna remove the banner in its entirety so what everyone knows that this is not like a normal section of the show this is the sponsor section of the show why this is gonna join us real quick that's not it focus at all is it whatever Lance is gonna join us for a second so private Internet access private Internet access as you guys know is av P n we've talked about a ton on the show I'm sure you guys have heard about it in general but we have a partnership with them in ways I guess the business guys are going to hate me because I don't know the correct term for this affiliate we haven't affiliate with them they have a great VPN it works for tons of different stuff like Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux Google Chrome specifically if you don't want to have it on your whole computer and you want the ease of use of it just activating in your browser with support for several other platforms coming soon so like practically freaking everything and even more stuff later on you can connect up to five devices at the same time under one plan with private Internet access and it has an internet kill switch this part I think is quite important and is actually really cool the internet kill switch will block all traffic will essentially temporarily cut off your internet if the VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly the reason for that is if you're currently using your internet and you are expecting to be protected by a VPN and then the VPN turns off and you keep broadcasting you just compromised everything and it was completely useless so that is actually very important that is a very important feature a lot of people overlook check it out today the link is in the description if you're on twitch yeah I don't know if you want to type this in it's private internet private Internet access com / pages / - - tech - tips slash Linus way in which is the the easiest URL I've ever heard I'm just going to dump that and chat real quick if I even can but nope I can't get rekt so again private access comm / pages / - - tech - tips / linus Wham there you go I'm sure that's I'm sure you got that next up humble bundle I have we advertised humble bundle before I don't I think this is a first I haven't used humble bundle in a little while but I think like probably probably like half my steam library is from Humble Bundle I've gotten a ton of stuff from them and it's really cool because you can adjust sliders and give money to charity or give money to Humble Bundle or give money to the developers all this all this fun stuff save money on games and help support charity with Humble Bundle check out their summer sale that's cool they've got great deals on games like planet coaster pray fallout 4 and more they've also got Humble monthly where you sign up to get a curated bundle of games sent to your inbox each month this month you can sign up for $12 and 10% off most games in their store and you'll get overwatch what the heck ok I was expecting is gonna be a whole bunch of tiny little indie games but you get overwatch for 12 bucks if I'm reading this correctly you sign up for their humble monthly you get 10% off most games that are in their store and you get overwatch cool check it out at our affiliate link in the video description again don't got one for you live but on YouTube it will be down there the the URLs the Humble Bundle URL in general is GE n i dot u.s. forward slash capital double capital w lowercase C capital a capital X capital B six the humble monthly link is GE ni us forward slash lowercase X uppercase u uppercase Q lowercase M and uppercase L and I can't copy and paste that into twitch chat and I don't have a lower banner for you so good luck I believe in you I absolutely believe you can make it put it in the chat I can't I'm not logged in to twitch my bad going back up I'm running away now okay
