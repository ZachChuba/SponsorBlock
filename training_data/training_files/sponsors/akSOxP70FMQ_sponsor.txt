get these in sour lemon, bubblegum or ice mint. 
They've partnered with Meridian so the speakers   give a balanced and clear sound and let me show 
you something cool. You only need one of these but   if you happen to buy two you can have your music 
playing on one and you can play that from songs   on whatever music service you use and then if you 
press this little button on the inside of each one   and then just wait a second, then you can pair 
them together for dual play and double the output.   If you want to turn the volume up, press 
it on one and it goes up on both and down.   Or you can of course control it from your phone. 
If you press sound boost it seems to boost the   bass on both to give bit more of a party sound 
and if you pause it so you can talk it pauses on   both of them. They've got 10 hours of battery 
life and are splash-proof so you can use them
