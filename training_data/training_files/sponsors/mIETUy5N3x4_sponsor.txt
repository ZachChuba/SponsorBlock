while we're waiting for the rocks to melt over there I'd like to take a moment and think Wix for sponsoring this video if you haven't heard of Wix before it's a service that lets you build and host websites at no cost basically it allows you to build highly customizable and professional websites using simple tools just like drag-and-drop feature to drag whatever you want right onto the page and put it right where you want it basically the possibilities are only limited by your imagination anybody can use Wix so you don't need any experience and I'm sure even the pros will appreciate the tools that Wix can offer them you can either start from scratch or choose from one of hundreds of beautifully designed templates so which can be used by anybody and it can also be used to make almost any website you can use it for a business a blog a shop or a place to host your dog and cat videos because apparently posting them all over your YouTube channel is off-brand now we can include more information about myself and my videos I can put information about how to license a clip for one of my videos if you want to use it and another YouTube video I can put links to my shop and I can cram as many dog photos onto my website as Wix servers can handle so if you need a website for any purpose go to Wix calm slash backyard the links down below in the description click on that link and
