Thank you to Audible for supporting PBS Digital Studios And, right now Audible is offering Eons viewers
a free 30 day trial. Just go to audible.com/eons to access all
their audio titles and programs. This week, I want to tell you about “A Short
History of Nearly Everything” which is Bill Bryson’s wry take on… well… a lot. From the Big Bang to Civilization, Bryson
is funny, informative, and insightful. Sometimes science writing can get a little
heady and Bryson does a wonderful job of both making it all much more clear and making it
fun and funny. You can check out this title and many others
by going to audible.com/eons. Make sure you use this link to help us out
and to get your membership trial.
