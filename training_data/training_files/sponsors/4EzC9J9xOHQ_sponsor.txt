this video is brought to you by I fix it I fix this Manta driver kit includes a hundred and twelve steel bits coming with standard bits like Phillips and flat head and also torques tripoint and gay it's as well it includes not one but two aluminum screwdriver handles a hefty quarter-inch drive for full-sized applications and a smaller four millimeter for precision work and both of them have nice freely turning top handles on them all I fixed the tools are backed by their lifetime warranty so if something breaks they'll replace it for free that is how warranties work and you can check them out for yourself at
