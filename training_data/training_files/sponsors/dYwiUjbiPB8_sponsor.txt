but first a quick word from my sponsor this week this is you you love the internet but you probably don't love your private business being monitored do you well you might be one of those people but if not you should get a vpn specifically nordvpn a vpn or virtual private network is like a tradesman's entrance to the internet which encrypts your data and masks your ip address from everybody else and that's a good thing nordvpn lets you connect to over five and a half thousand super fast servers in 60 countries from wherever you're hiding even if that's a certain very large country over here somewhere you want to watch all that world-class rust flicks content from bulgaria why not feeling hungry treat yourself to a turkey internet sandwich or pretend you're from wherever i don't care you can use it on pc mac android ios chrome and probably even your auntie's bread maker it works while you're out and about comes with a cyber security suite an ad blocker and can be used on up to six devices simultaneously with unlimited bandwidth most importantly right now you can get a two-year plan at 68 off plus an additional four months absolutely free and you can get this by using my link
