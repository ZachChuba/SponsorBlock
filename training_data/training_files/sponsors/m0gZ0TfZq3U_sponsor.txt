Bad Boy Danny: Hey guys, it's me. Bad Boy Danny. You guys know that a real bad boy cares a lot about protecting women, *heh* when it's convenient for him. But did you guys know that I care about protecting something else, too? That's right, my data. I'm very protective of my data. In fact, to show just how protective I am of my data, I've prepared a short video. (Song): Is that, Your hand On my Data? Is that, Your haaaannnnddd????? *whomp* That's why I use ExpressVPN. I spend a lot of time in my day being a dark, moody bad boy at local coffee shops in my area. And one thing I'm always worried about is giving strangers access to my bad-boy data, while I'm using the public Wi-Fi at these coffee shops.
