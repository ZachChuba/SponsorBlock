Before you go and set up your online dating
profiles, I want to show you how to set up NordVPN on your devices... Because internet safety is more important
than ever, especially since we’re about to use the internet to help you pair up! Like it or not, everything you do on the internet
is being tracked and monetized, including the dating game, but you can get a little
bit of your privacy back with NordVPN. It’s like, “Hey eavesdropping big money
companies, hackers, get out of here, and let this woman educate the planet!” Check out the link nordvpn.com/sexplanations
(it’s the top link in the description) to get security for up to six of your devices
with one account. Please use the link to support Sexplanations. Once you’re on the site, choose 75% off
a 3 year plan, then use my code “SEXPLANATIONS” to get an extra month for FREE! Scroll down, add your email address and payment
method. Congratulations! Now you have a virtual bodyguard for your
data. I like you! I want to help you find healthy partners for
successful relationships. That’s sexually, romantically, platonically,
commercially, and technologically. Step one, be safe online at NordVPN.com slash
S-E-X-P-L-A-N-A-T-I-O-N-S. Go now!
