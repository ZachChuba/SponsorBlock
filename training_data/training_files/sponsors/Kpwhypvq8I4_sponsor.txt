If you’re like me and concerned about your
online safety, Dashlane is the essential tool for you because it’s a password manager,
a VPN, and security monitor all in one, and it’s way cheaper than if you were to get
all of these tools separately. Signing into websites and online accounts
is painless with Dashlane because it’ll auto-sign you into your accounts when you
visit websites, it’ll work on every platform and every device, and it’ll generate super
secure passwords for you when you sign up for new accounts. I honestly couldn’t imagine my life without
Dashlane — this tool is a life saver — so if you wanna support the channel and get Dashlane
for free today, you can sign up at Dashlane.com/Technicality. Plus, if you wanna upgrade to the premium
