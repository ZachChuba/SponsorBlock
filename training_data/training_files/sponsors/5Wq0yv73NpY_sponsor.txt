Ting can help you save money by using those
exact same networks in the U.S. but without a monthly plan. The truth is WiFi is everywhere - we spend
most of our day at homes, school, work, and shopping. So it might not make sense to pay for the
same 2, or 5, 10 GB a month. With Ting, you only pay for exactly what you
use, so itâ€™s a good way to save money. The average bill is $23 a month, and if you
use my link in the description, you get a $25 credit, which is essentially a whole month
free. Thanks to Ting for sponsoring this video and
to you for watching.
