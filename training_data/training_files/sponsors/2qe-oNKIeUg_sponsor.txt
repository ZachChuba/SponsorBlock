And that made it much easier to do things like 
create your own website. With Flash, the process   was extremely complicated and required hiring 
a web developer. But now we have Squarespace,   which allows you to create your own high quality 
website by using their simple drag and drop   interface. Plus, Squarespace automatically 
optimizes your website for mobile devices,   so you don’t have to waste time creating a 
desktop and mobile version of your site. They have   built in analytics tools that report page views, 
traffic sources, time on site, most read content,   and more. You can create an exclusive 
paid membership area just like on YouTube,   and you can even create an entire e-commerce 
store to sell physical or digital products.   I actually did that a couple years ago to sell 
merch and it was way easier than I imagined. Also,   if you Google Apple Explained my website is one of 
the first results. Thats because Squarespace has   the best search engine optimization tools that’ll 
make your website more visible to more people.   So go to squarespace.com for a free
