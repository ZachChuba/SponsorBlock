quick and lodge thank you to Squarespace but once again choosing to sponsor a video it's really helpful for me to have sponsors just because it allows me to focus on making the vlogs I use it myself and I have done for years find it really easy if I want to make a blog post it's like two clicks if I want to list something in my store it's like very very simple it's really gorgeous the things that they have on offer a really diverse and I think that no matter what you're doing if you want an online website you'll be able to find a theme that works really well for you I'm pretty sure the first time I used it I wanted a online catalog for a solo show that I was having I laid that out by just having stored each listing was a painting on the night I only sold a couple of pieces and then I released the catalog afterwards and all of the pieces in the show sold so that was my introduction to Squarespace now I'm on like the top tier plan I bought it all you know what I mean if you guys want to test Squarespace out there is a discount code down below it gives you two weeks free access to Squarespace to build your website and you also get a 10% discount on your first purchase anyway thank you
