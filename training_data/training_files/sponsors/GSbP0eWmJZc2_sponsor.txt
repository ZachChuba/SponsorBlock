They’re super sleek, with no dangly wires or stems getting in the way, and more importantly, they’re super comfortable. And their latest model, the E25, is their best one yet, with 6 hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, and a more compact design that gives you a nice, noise-isolating fit!
