oh yeah gave us some mojo jalapeno hot sauce can i hold something for now because that's almost certainly going to come home with me and never come back you're saying moho it's not mojo no it's not mojo jalapeno i said mojo forever and then we got very much corrected by the twitch chat and they're apparently correct i looked it up what does moho mean in spanish i don't know i'm gonna look that up i know what boho means what's what is boho bohemian in the pinterest world moho spanish pronunciation ammo well exo not going to try that uh yeah it's sauce yeah it just means some type of sauce okay we have ghost pepper uh buffalo sauce and sriracha bacon and original jerky here and he's got mojo jalapeno which is so far my favorite jerky from savage jerky in sauce form so i'm super excited to try that at home because i'm definitely gonna steal it it's not coming back unless someone tells me to bring it back in which case it will immediately come back uh their jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with the goal to create a snack that is full of flavor and spice and isn't bad for you all at the same time they have 13 different flavors which goes on top of the ones that we have here i left this world for a second there [Laughter] is dog right now uh they also include things like sriracha bacon which i have here and maple buffalo bacon and many others they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and spice rub like the hot sauce mojo jalapeno that we have here uh their carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world which is pretty crazy we don't have um i've tried the the jerky and uh it's pretty brutal it's an experience i think i did the last show that linus was on i ate one just nonchalant without telling him and he didn't notice so i was pretty proud of that because usually i like sort of die when i when i eat it i remember it's on it was the first branch i was ever on i tried it and i tried to play real cool and you're just sitting there and then suddenly like your pupils fill up with liquid it's like i'm cool yeah it's there's blood coming out of my ears it's not that hot dude it's like it's pretty pretty normal one thing from coming from someone who enjoys spice i like spice but to a limit like once it gets to his once it gets past my limit it becomes not fun that's everyone in the world dude no there's some people that enjoy the paint oh there's absolutely people that enjoy this masochist i think my dad is one of those people cause my dad will eat any hot sauce ever he will like taunt people at restaurants where like you know there's like like indian heat you order something india is spicy as a white people spicy yeah yeah like if you're like very hot they'll be like all right i'll give you a medium he'll like taunt them yeah so that they'll like intentionally spike it even harder and he just loves it but then if they come out and he's sweating and he's like dabbing and he's like huh then they win but he also wins like he wants that my dad's crazy he also like that's a freak he'll also just pop jalapenos and not react at all because he's just a machine but anyways his mouth is just dead it's just it's just like a callous i've lost the hot sauce he has calluses for everything else i've lost all sensitivity in my mouth it makes me cool that's like why everything that's an acquired taste so it's bad coffee cigars olives whiskey olives is an acquired taste it was for me okay a lot of people don't like olives i like them now and i get them and nobody eats them like at parties and stuff i we're getting off here i'm going to switch off this for a second i love olives and to like a point where it's a character fault almost when i was a kid my mom used to buy canned olives and like the neighbors and my brother and i would like the neighbor's kids and my brother and i would all sit down and like play a board game or something and i'd just grab a can of balls and just eat the entire thing and then when i was done i would drink and it drove people insane but i didn't do it for that reason i actually just really liked it but anyways but we have an olive story okay i had a party once and we're all eating olives and uh and then this one friend of mine was like we're just commenting on olives and blah blah blah and it was at the stage where i was just getting into them wasn't sure if i liked them or not yet and my friend was like this sounds so hardcore he was like uh yes i had a flight of all right and he was like i think eating olives is like kind of erotic and then everyone was like i was like okay i never got to that everyone kind of just went silent it was like okay [Laughter] moving on like i'm not holding it against him like no i mean maybe it is whatever i just hadn't had that thought and it was just it's a very non-offensive thing to be into in that way but like geez anyways moving on fresh bush i mean if you want to like
