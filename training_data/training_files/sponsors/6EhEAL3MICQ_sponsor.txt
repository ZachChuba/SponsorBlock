I guess I’ll have to check out the original
story on Audible, which we’re lucky enough to have as our sponsor! Audible’s content includes an unmatched
selection of audiobooks, original shows, news, comedy and more -- In fact, a lot of the original
fairytale stories featured in Shrek are available. If you’d like to help support the channel,
use our link in the description for a FREE audiobook and 30 day FREE trial. Sign up at audibletrial.com/wickedbinge. We love cartoons and movies, but we also love
binging audio-books on Audible.
