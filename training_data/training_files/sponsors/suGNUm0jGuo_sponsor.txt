domestication I want to give a quick shout-out to this week's sponsor Skillshare as a full time author illustrator and zoologist I'm often juggling dozens of projects at once I need to be able to capture ideas as they strike me but carrying a notebook with all of the necessary art supplies just isn't realistic one of the best ways I've found to solve this is by keeping a digital sketchbook using the application procreate to figure out the best workflow I turn to one of my fellow animal lovers and professional illustrator Steph Weiser Coleman her class on Skillshare procreate basics keeping a digital sketchbook on your iPad pro is a great introduction and helped me go from dabbler to illustrator for my upcoming books she'll walk you through all of the basics then take you through some of her own sketches and show you how you can work procreate into your everyday life I loved it the Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes on hundreds of different subjects and you get unlimited access to all of them with the Premium Membership it's a lot more affordable than in-person classes and workshops an annual subscription is less than ten dollars a month but because Skillshare is sponsoring this video you can join me and get a 2 month free trial by clicking the link in the description
