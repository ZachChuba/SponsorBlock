I wanna thank audible for their support on this video not only are they the best when it comes
to audio books but they've been working with me and supporting my channel for a couple of
years now while making this video I listen to the book "Surely You're Joking
Mr. Feynman and I loved it" Richard Feynman was a genius Nobel Prize winning
physicist who chilled with Einstein and helped discover atomic energy but that's
not what makes him so interesting this collection of stories from his life made
me laugh out loud a bunch of time it starts when he was a kid and used to take
apart radios to make homemade burglar alarm and then in college at MIT he used his engineering skills to pull pranks and then he eventually taught himself how to
break into safes and use science to pick up on women he had this lifelong
fascination with learning but in a practical sense not in a memorize facts
from the textbook sense he's just such an intelligent colorful human being so if you
want to listen to "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" or any other audio book for
free all you have to do is use the link in the description or go to audible.com/markrober
