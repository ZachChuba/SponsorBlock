it's time for our favorite sponsors sponsors assemble half of you were gone because of the anyways that doesn't actually matter but we're gonna come back to us as us now uh let's see yeah that's not my twitter handle there first one there we go Sergey if you're an IT professional or a power user I'm neither uh you're not a power user you wouldn't classify yourself a power user it's a spectrum if you're an IT professional a power user or just person who has two computers or like a computer and a laptop which is that's still at the same time that run different operating systems or the same one I don't know why this is necessarily worded the way that it is you can connect them together and share a mouse and keyboard between the two my favorite use case for this personally is actually one that I've never done and I've done the more hardcore one but whatever is when you if you work with a laptop at work that you bring home quite a few people do this these days a lot of workplaces just have docking stations and you just bring your own laptop in you can bring it home put it on some type of like laptop arm or dock or something like that and synergy will automatically detect that it's there and share your desktops mouse and keyboard to that laptop so if there's stuff you're working on you want to keep working on it or there was something you saw during the day or whatever whatever whatever you could drag it from computer to computer because it has that that functionality just drag and drop from one desktop to the other and it shares your keyboard or mouse between the two it's it's it's super super cool I went off-script there let's note though it's it's very cool I've always liked this for me I had I had to Computers setup I don't even remember why but if you go back and watch the original mineral oil computer video back when I was filming and editing videos not in front of the camera I'm filming Linus doing like a room walkthrough of my room showing off my mineral oil computer and there's two computers but there's two keyboards and two mice yeah and it was super late that's bush league did ya know and I had like different monitors set up for the different computers and it was it was a nightmare anyways you can you can check out synergy and get signed up there at this crazy link that's below us or if you're watching the vaad in the description down
