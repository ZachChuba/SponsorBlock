you probably play D&D right if you do then you probably also have a crippling dice addiction am I correct well then I'm going to feed that addiction with a discount code because today's video is sponsored by ez roller dice they're a fantastic company that I genuinely enjoy working with all their products are stylish and very well made and it's all heck and cheap if you punch in the code room when you check out you save 20% off your entire purchase they toss me a shiny coin and everyone's happy but if you want to save even more than that they also have one or more daily deals that range from 25 to 60% off I swear it feels like they're giving stuff away they've got dye sets for D&D and other games packs of specific dice types dice bags cups jails these cool case things and even bar where actually I'm gonna grab this cup it looks cool I strongly recommend you go and check them out look through the inventory and maybe buy one or two sets of dice that you definitely don't need all right thank you easy
