Okay, I really like this piece. It gives me a nice contrast. So I've got these tracks in
here, I've downloaded them, they're free previews that you can use to do your edit. But let's say you're happy with this song. You want to actually use it. What's really great about
the new Music Vine is this. There's the song right here
and you want to buy it, they now have different types of licenses. Because most of the time you don't really need a
full license for broadcast. Maybe you just want to
put it on the Internet on YouTube, just like me. So Music Vine figured out
a way to structure a deal that is really advantageous for you. They have a new license where you can get any of their tracks if
you're only using it for personal use, vlog,
indie channel, podcast. Only $10 for a song. But look at all the variations here. We talked about this one, wedding, $25, non-profit, $30, student, $25. When Tatiana was talking about be careful when using music you
can't get the license for, here you don't have to worry about it. If you're working on a short and you maybe have three or four tracks for probably less than $100 you can get the entire
score of your film covered. (mouse clicking)
