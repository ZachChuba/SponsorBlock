watched this far that it's quite likely that you're a war gamer or a roleplay gamer and or a model maker or possibly you're one of my many of you errs who are working on novels I get quite a steady trickle of emails from people who are working on novels or have some question about world building that they want to put to me and maybe occasionally I help a little bit anyway so if your that's all the person then maybe my sponsor will be of great interest you my sponsor being world and yes now world anvil oh god be consistent is a browser-based platform so they go it's online and it's there for you to organise that vast mountain of data that you as the responsible and conscientious world builder have amassed what do you do with all this data all the all the families and all the people in them and all all the timelines of all the battles and the histories and things that happen in the past and all the borders that have moved this way in the other and all the maps you got so much data wouldn't it be great to do what to me a pen and paper cannot do and cross-reference everything and have maybe interactive maps and then and a showcase it's not just your immediate friends but to the world wouldn't that be good well with world anvil you can and if you go to www.engvid.com you don't I mean you don't have to type in because that's silly okay I should just I should have missed out them possibly okay so dummy I'll be sound at this time don't need only W dot world anvil dot-com then you will find that you can make use of okay not all the features but for a lot of the most of the major features for free yes for free you can try it out and then if later you feel that is definitely for you you can pay extra for they call guild membership and with guild membership and you get certain extra things including perhaps most importantly privacy because maybe you want to keep your world secret you don't want other people to see it maybe if your players read ahead it'll spoil the game for you or something like that or maybe you think that you've got such a bit of hot property oh yes at the rest of the world we queuing up at your door to buy it from you so that they can having given you some financial recompense enjoy your world as well so if you think you've got a saleable world then yes maybe that's another reason you might want privacy or maybe you want to restrict access to certain players in your game the guild of mages they get access to the magic stuff but they don't know about the other stuff and so you can control all that sort of thing or maybe you have patrons on some site like patreon and you want to be able to give them the advantages of generously being your patron and by getting access to your stuff so again privacy settings will be something you'll be after and you can if you are a guild member you can invite in co-authors and other people to contribute to your world and so it just builds up and up and you can join a community yes a community of over two hundred thousand world and Ville Earth who are also working on their worlds and you can perhaps consult them with questions you might have and offer them advice and just generally team up and make the world just that little bit better so if you reckon that this is for you why did you go - w-w-w-whoa and Ville comm and find out it's it's online it's available it's largely free and good Lord it's British so go to world anvil today all tomorrow I mean you don't know media
