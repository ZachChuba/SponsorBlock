In the meanwhile, to get more hands-on with
the math of special relativity, or economics, or machine learning, I highly recommend Brilliant.org,
this video's sponsor. In conjunction with my video series, Brilliant
has rolled out their own course on special relativity with their own unique illustrative
scenarios – like relativistic laser tag to understand lorentz transformations. If you want to understand a mathematical topic
deeply, there's really nothing better than thinking through the ideas and solving problems
yourself. And Brilliant helps you do just that. Once you're ready to go in-depth into special
relativity (or perhaps linear algebra or group theory, which are both also relevant for relativity),
you can get 20% off by going to Brilliant.org/minutephysics. Again, that’s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which gets you 20% off premium access to all of Brilliant's courses and puzzles, and lets
Brilliant know you came from here.
