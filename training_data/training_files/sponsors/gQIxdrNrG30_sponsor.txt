by the way wouldn't have been possible for me to make in this tight schedule I have if it wasn't for today's sponsor once again the amazing skills here and once again they also provide a URL that you can use to get two months free premium access to all of the content of their website and in case you're sitting there like my dev watch the other free videos that was sponsored by the skill share but I have no idea what it is allow me to explain skill share is an online learning community with thousands of classes and art design business and more their premium membership gives you unlimited access to all of the classes and whether you're looking to learn something new or just want to brush up some old knowledge you will most likely find it on skills here I recently took this class on painting light and shadow the basic for portraits and characters and I really recommended because people often ask me about lights and shadow and I bet you I can't do it any better than Gabrielle here so if you're just going to watch one art class in schools here I recommend that it be this one so use the link in the description below to claim one of the 500 spots that I have for you guys for those two months free trial on Skillshare and if you decide to stay on Skillshare after the trial has run out their annual membership is less
