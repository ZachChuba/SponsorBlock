This might surprise you and you’d probably
ask, “how,” and I’d answer, “Curiosity Stream.” As in, go check out this documentary on Curiosity
Stream that explains the science behind how people survive plane crashes. It’s just one of over 2,400 documentaries
that you can watch on CuriosityStream on all these different platforms for just $2.99 per
month. Their documentaries span every genre and are
available worldwide from Paraguay to Peru—the long way around, I guess. If you sign up at curiositystream.com/hai,
though, you’ll get your first 31 days completely for free.
