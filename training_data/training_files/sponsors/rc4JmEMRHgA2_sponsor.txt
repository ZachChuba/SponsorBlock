And, truthfully, we should all be learning
skills to survive in the new economy, and a great way to get started is with Skillshare. In short, bite-sized videos, like this one,
you can watch me teach you how to make your own animated videos, or Business Casual show you how to invest
in the stock market, or Thomas Frank, teach you how to do more
of the learning thing and less of the, say, playing video games thing. There are 25,000 classes in business, design,
programming, you name it, and you can try it today with a 2 month free trial with the
