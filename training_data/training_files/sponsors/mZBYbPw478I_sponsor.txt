I've got a new Bluetooth speaker, it's called the Commuter by Kove. I'm really happy with this
thing, it sounds great. I love the fact that I can actually set it in the cup holder of my truck. It's got two audio modes
both normal and bass so it sounds really good
no matter what environment I'm in which I'm grateful for because the stereo's broken in my truck. Another big benefit, it's water resistant so it's pretty safe for me to take it on the go. It has a touch slider
to skip to the next song and a real volume ring on top so turning it up is easy
to do even without looking. Something that really intrigues me though because of its small size,
is the idea of putting this inside of a proper other cosplay. It would be easy enough to
run like an atmospheric sound or maybe an engine noise or
even just the theme music to whatever's going on. I really wanna look into that 'cause I think that'll be nice. It doesn't weigh that much and with the eight hour charge, I'll be good for the whole Con. But don't just take my word for it, look up Kove Audio Commuter speaker. The reviews for it speak for themselves. I wanna thank Kove for
sponsoring my channel and as a thank you, they gave me a special
code that you can use to get 65% off your
very own Audio Commuter. It's om65. Plus, there's a link in the
