videos to deal with death or to talk about operations where maybe it would be helpful to show some footage from theater but these things tend to trip the youtube nanny mechanisms and the video gets throttled or demonetized so that's why i've teamed up with some fellow educational youtubers to make nebula nebula is an advert free streaming hand-picked farm-fresh home for all your favorite educational creators to make things that they want without worrying about all that youtube nonsense you'll find creators like braincraft adam neely mustard real science lindsey ellis but you'll also be able to discover many more including an ever expanding list of nebula originals which are exclusive to the platform how about this med life crisis a real practicing medical doctor well that doesn't sound like a brick expert to me but let's take a look huh as a cardiologist i see this almost every day a patient comes in with a severe myocardial contusion and some kind of fanciful story the nebula version of this video has this entire sponsor segment removed and has some bonus material and to build this we've been supported by curiosity stream as have i personally they have supported me for over a year now even with all that's been going on in the world their support's been unwavering and really appreciated for a limited time they're offering a year's subscription to currency stream and nebula for only 15 a year it's actually 14 something uh because it's 26 percent off their regular price why 26 because it's more than 25 so if you find the stuff i make useful please consider hitting the link below because it really supports the channel that's access to thousands of high quality documentaries about biology space history and health including a whole new series on coronavirus at curiosity stream and of direct relevance to this video why not check out the science of survival series about humans that have pushed into that gray zone between life and death and made it back so that's just under 15 for a year of both curiosity stream and
