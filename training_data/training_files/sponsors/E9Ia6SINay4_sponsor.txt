And something that is always part of my morning
routine is sitting down with my planner and my laptop, opening Notion and seeing what's
going on in my life. Notion is an awesome tool and I've made three
videos about how I use it to organize every single thing in my life and the good thing
is that Notion is sponsoring today's video to let you know that it's finally free for
students and teachers! Notion is productivity software that combines
all your essential work tools in one place. It's flexible, allowing you to organize everything
in workspaces and move things around seamlessly. Two weeks ago I showed you how I created an
academic planner in Notion, which includes class notes, a calendar, syllabi pages, task
lists, project planners and so on. With this free personal plan for students,
you can now have unlimited space to organize everything. All you have to do is sign up using your school
email address or, if you already have Notion, you can change your account e-mail to the
e-mail of your school and that's it. You can also access a bunch of templates designed
specifically for students and educators, which will be linked down below. And if you aren't a student anymore, that's
not a problem â†’ you can enter the promo code "mariana" to get your own free notion
Personal plan by following the instructions in the description box below. Also, if you're curious about how I've been
using Notion, I will link my past three videos as well.
