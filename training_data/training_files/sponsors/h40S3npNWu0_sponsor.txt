second let me just wait wait what the oh i forgot that this video was sponsored by will to live an mmorpg survival game that honestly for a free to play game was extremely fun for me to play you start out by choosing between four unique characters that all have different benefits that will help you survive you take on quests at the start to earn money and level up so you can upgrade to better weapons and armor the world is dangerous and during your quest you battle mutants other players and explore the lore behind these weird anomalies that you find around the map also if you didn't want to you can play in pve servers so you don't have to fight other players but the pvp was pretty fun you can team up with friends and create clans to fight these mutants and other players as well and along the way there are many side quests that require you to do unexpected things like ally with random parties to help defend the safe zones because they're getting attacked by mutants will to live is available on the my game store for free and you can support my channel by using the link in the description to download the game doing this will also reward you with an extra 50 credits to spend on in-game weapons and items that will help you start your journey so explore the world engage in fights with mutants join clans and struggle for existence to prove your right to live [Music]
