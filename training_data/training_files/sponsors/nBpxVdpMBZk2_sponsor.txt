I'd like to thank Audible for sponsoring this video. I love Audible because they've really gotten me back into books. It's my favorite way to multitask, especially when cleaning up this s***â€” Seriously? Thank You. Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks in the known universe. I just listened to "Born Standing Up" by Steve Martin. He talks about the grueling years of developing his act before he finally made it as a stand-up comic and film star. It's raw, heartbreaking, funny, but more than anything, he's an awesome writer, and I could not put this book down. You can get that book, or any other book you want for free when you start a 30-day trial. Go to audible.com/ysac or text "YSAC" to 500500 to get started. That's audible.com/ysac or text "YSAC" to 500500. [whispering] And have a great day. Bye.
