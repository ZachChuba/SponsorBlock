And if your budget is too tight to enroll
in on-site classes or expensive courses on how to become more organized or productive
and revamp your life, watching online classes is a great way to organize your time around
your learning sessions while improving your skills and managing your projects And the
best place to learn more about new things is today's sponsor, Skillshare. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for
a couple of classes, Skillshare allows you to learn almost everything for less than 10
dollars a month. They have thousands of courses on management
and business, productivity, photography, writing, languages, illustration and design, music,
cooking and so on. To start the year off with the right foot,
you can watch this class on Real Productivity where you'll learn how to create your ideal
week by doing exercises for prioritizing tasks, creating an ideal week calendar and trying
different apps to balance your projects. With Skillshare you will never have an excuse
to stop learning, as you can watch all of these courses on the go, participate in class
projects and get involved in a community of people who want to learn the exact same things
as you do, And even if you're not willing to start paying
10 dollars a month for classes, that's not a problem because using my promo code will
give you two months of classes for free, no strings attached. Using this promo code also tells Skillshare
that you came from my channel which is always nice if you enjoy my content and want to keep
