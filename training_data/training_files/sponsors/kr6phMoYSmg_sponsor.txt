Big thanks to Keeps Hair Loss Prevention for sponsoring this episode. The sad fact is that
two out of three dudes will experience some form
of male patter baldness by the age of 35. Luckily that's 17 years away for me. I'm only 18 years old. But honestly, it's never too early to prevent hair loss. Keeps treatments are up to 90% effective at stopping and reducing further hairloss. And the best part is, you don't even have to go
