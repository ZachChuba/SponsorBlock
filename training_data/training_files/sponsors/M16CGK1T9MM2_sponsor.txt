If you’re looking for a way to set up an
illegal black market stock photo site for European landmarks then please don’t use
Squarespace because I’m sure I’d get an angry email. If you’re looking for a website for anything
else, though, you definitely should use Squarespace. You’ve probably heard their pitch before—beautiful
customizable templates, 24/7 award winning customer support , build in search engine
optimization—but what you might not realize is that you can try all of this for free without
even giving your credit card info so you can see what all the hype is about. You can get that free trial over at squarespace.com/hai
and then when you do decide to buy you’ll get 10% off your order. They make this show possible so please go
at least check them out over at squarespace.com/HAI.
