If you want to break the flight endurance
record, you'll need a solid grasp of the fundamental forces of flight like lift and drag. Luckily, I know just the place where you learn
exactly that. Brilliant.org is a fantastic online learning
platform where you can learn about math and science in a guided, approachable way by solving
fun and challenging problems. For example, in their classical mechanics
course they have a section where they teach you how to calculate the hypothetical maximum
flight duration for a Drone since as you put more batteries in a drone you need more power
which requires more batteries. To learn about this or any of their other
fascinating topics, head over to brilliant.org/hai to try courses for free, and then the first
