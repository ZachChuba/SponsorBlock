The sponsor of today's
video is actually Cinemark. One thing that we really like about going to movies at Cinemark is they have the Cinemark Movie Club, and for Leslie and I,
we're lucky if we can get to a movie theater
at least once a month. You get one credit every
month to go to a movie, and you don't have to pay any fees, whether you book it on
your app, or online, or even at the box office. And if you don't use
your ticket that month, it actually rolls over to the next month, and it's transferable. - Dude, what's up. - How's it going? - I'm so sorry to interrupt. I'm so sorry. I love your YouTube videos. - Thanks - I always watch. I'm so sorry. - So, you have four
tickets that are built up. You could use it with your family members, or if you're doing a double date. Also, you get 20% off of
concessions, like popcorn. There's no commitment to join. You can cancel it at any time. So, if you would like to
get Cinemark Movie Club, or give it to somebody for Christmas, it could be a really good gift, we'll put a link in the
description for a special deal that will give you 12 months
of Cinemark Movie Club for the price of 11. So, thanks to Cinemark
for sponsoring this video.
