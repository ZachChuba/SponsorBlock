factors I talked about can be calculated using
the time dilation and length contraction formulas - once you know how to use them, you can plug
in any speed you want and see how much distances and time intervals will be distorted. And Brilliant.org, this video’s sponsor,
is a great place to learn about not just the details of time dilation and length contraction,
but many of the other amazing equations that describe our universe. Like, they have a course that leads you towards
understanding the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics, and one on Hubble’s law
in astronomy, and the famous Bayes’ theorem of probability and statistics. And the first 200 people who go to brilliant.org/minutephysics
will get 20% off a premium subscription to brilliant with access to all of brilliant’s
courses and puzzles. Again, that’s brilliant.org/minutephysics
for a deeper understanding of the equations (and not just the concepts) that underlie
our universe.
