a couple of days ago secret lab sent me something dope i immediately opened the box and there she was my dog ash all right but now for what they really sent me a monolithic device fit for the asses of men and gods alike i cracked open the bolt and instantly started gutting the contents within the back support is like no other it gives the posture and confidence of a fabled bow master missing shots with a bow what even is that anymore these wheels will carry you to glory on any wipe rolling over all foes who dare cross your path the brain cushion cradles the mind with supreme comfort and opens your third eye to the highest of iq plays the legs are made of proto-adamantium i think the same stuff they use when forging kept an american shield we carefully picked up the sole of the chair which had the arms already attached with these arms i'd get no recoil with my shots while sitting in supreme comfort and now for the heart the engine of the throne with this i could recline to any angle and go up and down to any height to comfortably salt my loot and finally these dwarven forged tools to put it all together featuring magnetic capabilities to handle the peskiest of jobs and that is how i forged my new throne thanks secret labs for sponsoring
