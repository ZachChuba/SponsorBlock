Here's a question for you. Do you use Chrome browser? statistically speaking You probably do and I used to but I don't anymore you might think that switching browsers is a massive pain in the arse But I wanna explain why it doesn't have to be and it's really interesting actually So Chrome is not an open-source project But it's based on an open-source core called chromium and other people can build browsers based on this open source chromium, for example the sponsor of this video brave and the great thing about a chromium based browser is Chrome extensions work in chromium based browsers So if you've got your Chrome browser set up just how you like it with all your extensions and everything You can transfer your extensions your settings and your bookmarks Over to a browser like brave in a minute, but why would you switch well? chrome isn't a privacy based browser a Part of Google's business model is to know as much about you as possible Brave is a privacy focused browser. It blocks all that kind of tracking it blocks fingerprinting It blocks third-party ads because these third-party ad networks tend to be the ones that are interested in Getting to know you and following you around the internet. The upshot is that brave is faster, and it uses less data There's an Android version of the app as well So you can have everything in sync it even saves battery on a mobile phone go to brave dot com forward slash Steve mould the link Is in the description as well normally at this point in a sponsor message I'd say hey get 30% off the link in the description, but Brave browser is completely free and open-source, so I can't say that All I can say is yeah, please use that link because that helps me out It lets them know that I sent you download brave today
