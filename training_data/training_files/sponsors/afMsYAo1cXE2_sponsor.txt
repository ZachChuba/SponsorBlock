that. Here’s the problem:
Imagine you and a flock of little birds weighing as much as you do eat together day after day. Which of you would need to eat more calories
to stay alive? Did you get it? If you enjoy problem solving exercises like
this I suggest you check it out brilliant - a learning platform that uses exercises
like this to teach you mathematics, physics and computer science. The problem I just gave you was one of their
daily challenges - free exercises released each day that test your problem solving skills
and make you a little smarter in the process. You can check out the correct answer as well
as the explanation for it with the link in the description. These daily challenges also give you a sneak
