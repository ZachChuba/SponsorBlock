Let's hear a word from our sponsor Does this ever happen to you? You're trying to sell a really great product But no one knows where they can buy it because you set up shop in the woods And so your dad tells you you should build a website, but you don't know what that means So you start hammering stuff together because you thought that's what building was But then you hammer your finger real hard on accident and start crying so loud that your dad comes into your room and tells you have to move out because you're 75 years old and So you're homeless now all cause you didn't know how to make a website Has ever happened? Well then you gotta use Squarespace ya dummy. It's the easiest way to make a beautiful functioning website in no time at all and without any coding experience You don't even need a hammer.

Now when people want to buy your product They don't have to try to figure out what woods you're in because you didn't know what address to give them So they accidentally go to the wrong woods and get eaten by three bears They can just go to your website on their home computer or cellular device! Now, that's easy And with this new awesome website, I bet your dad's gonna totally regret kicking you out. But don't take it from that guy, take it from me.
