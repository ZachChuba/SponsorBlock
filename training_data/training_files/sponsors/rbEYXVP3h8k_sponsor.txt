Thank you to NHTSA for paying for this video. Before we go any further, we want to remind
you to drive sober. You probably already know the risks of driving
drunk. You could cause a crash, you could hurt someone, incur a lot of legal expenses, lose your job. Don’t tell yourself it’s not a big deal,
‘cause it is. So while we’re going to be talking about how to maybe take the edge off your overindulgence, always, always drive sober -- or get pulled
over.
