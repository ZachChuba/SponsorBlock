know that I still have books available if you want to pick one up it's a great way to help support me doing what I'm doing this year it's 45 color 45 black and whites from last year as well as some quotes from some of the different videos and speaking of which thank you so much to Squarespace for sponsoring this video I was super nervous about selling things from my website and putting a store live I was worried it would be too complicated that the the payment system would be too complicated that or keeping orders in check and being able to send things outward would cause issues but actually it took me probably a total of two hours to put the entire store together and set it live and the orders come in I can see where everything's coming from really really clearly and as I post out books there's even an app where I can just swipe the orders right and it automatically sends emails to everyone letting them know that their orders on its way so if you're looking for a new website definitely take a look at Squarespace especially if you're looking at an e-commerce option start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to
