>> All right, hit me up! Next big Halloween spooky thing, go ahead. And go.
>> Oh, uh. >> It's a crab. >> Guy on the bus that smells like soup! >> And he's got a crab in his fist. >> Sure! >> And when he gets
near you, catch phrase! He whispers...
[slurping noises] >> Uh, you got crabs! [cackling] >> And if he looks at you, and he says, "have you shaved them?". And you're like, what
are you talking about? And that's all he keeps asking! He goes, "have you shaved them?". And then if you get too close, he'll go, you got crabs! Oh, sorry. >> This is terrifying! You, like, turned into some sort of bizarre David Lynch thing. >> Look, man, I'm a monster pitch man! That's how it works, but now we've got to get the word out! How do we get the word out
for Soup-drinking Crabman? If Soup-drinking Crabman
wanted to get the word out about his Halloween legend,
he would need a website! >> He would definitely need a website. That's the best way to do it. >> It would have to look-- He's not an HTML guy. >> No! >> He's sitting on the bus drinking soup, you think he's got time to write all that? >> Instead of homing pigeons, he throws the crabs out
there to spread his message, it's really ineffective. >> So what he needs is an easy way to make a beautiful website that, most importantly, will scale, because you know what
happens, you get Reddited or all of a sudden you
become a viral sensation. You need virtual servants
that are going to scale with the excitement so
that it doesn't crash on you. >> Yeah, and Squarespace has lots of tools for getting your crab-related and soup-related messages out there. They have podcast support, mailing list service, and email campaigns you can manage right from their utilities. >> Eventually he's going to want to sell Soup-drinking Crabman merchandise. They got commercial solutions as well, so that's going to really easy! >> Yeah. >> But where does he go to get started? >> Squarespace dot com
forward slash rogue. He can get ten percent
off his first purchase, and get a free trial. >> Oh my gosh, so you're saying he can become familiar with all the tools, and when he does decide to launch, all he has to do is do rogue, and he'll be supporting our
show and getting a discount? >> Yeah, and getting the
crab soup revolution started. I don't know what he calls it. >> You're welcome, Soup-drinking Crabman. >> Watch out for him too. Don't ride the bus. [laughter] >> Money in the bank! [clap]
