To learn more about this, I used Audible,
the world’s largest audiobook service, to listen to Michael Graziano’s 
Rethinking Consciousness, which provides an extensive overview of consciousness as it evolved in life on Earth, discusses the hard- and meta-problem 
of understanding it, and presents the attention schema theory of consciousness as a possible way forward. And if you go to Audible.com/likestoriesofold,
or text likestoriesofold to 500 500, you can listen to Rethinking Consciousness as well
with a 30-day Audible trial that lets you listen to one audiobook, 
and two Audible Originals, for free. With the Audible app, you can listen to audiobooks
anytime, anywhere, and on any device. So if you want to dive deeper into 
the science on consciousness, or simply explore Audible’s vast collection 
of audiobooks, be sure to check out Audible.com/likestoriesofold, 
or text likestoriesofold to 500 500, 
and start listening today.
