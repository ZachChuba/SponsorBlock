[Music] hey it's me today I am going to be doing something very different and very special I am partnering with Elmer's that's right OMERS to do a massive slime challenge now I know I don't do a lot of slime on my channel I don't have much first-hand experience with it but I've been watching slime a slime how's it going I've been watching you not in a creepy way so when Elmer's asked me if I wanted to take their what if mystery unboxing challenge I said bring it on let's do this I'm gonna roll up my sleeves they're already kind of permanently rolled up and I'm gonna get my hands dirty slimy so I want to thank Elmer's for sponsoring this video this is going to be an epic experience I can feel it they sent me a little something yeah this is what showed up at my door that happened and I'm like okay alright alright then they're not fooling around can I be scared no I'm excited and scared so what is all of this let's find out together so we've got this baby big big baby it's beautiful oh my gosh what if you made a slime masterpiece oh I like that I'm feeling precious did you say masterpiece yes masterpiece I'll try see what we're working with here it says to complete this challenge you'll need numbers and all your artistic skills wipe the combination right there oh and don't forget to bring along your love for all things slime all righty this is a nice quality card what is this made of vinyl Wow what else we got here okay okay blue four days metallic blue litter glue colored glue more glitter glue these look amazing okay I'm excited paint brushes a whole mess of them seen these before I am loving this art theme art is my favorite thing this box Oh lots more glue so many there's like an imprint in the confetti why do I want to live in there oh sorry yep I'm I'm growing up big box Oh an article of clothing oh goodness it's an apron how do we wear this what is going on back there can you help can I pull this off we have Elmer's magical liquid add to Elmer's glue to make slime some loose glitter black litter glue okay so this ended up being just a sample of what Elmer's sent to me they sent a lot more a lot more and in addition to the enormous supply of slime materials they also sent this humongous custom-made canvas just for me this is six feet by 6 feet that's massive in case you didn't know huge I was so completely blown away by this this is insane right here look at that that's me it has a giant desert castle with ice cream cones Squishy's at the bottom a giant rainbow over the top and it says Elmer's loves me I'm touched it's basically a giant paint-by-number but instead of using paint we call you slime to make this into a slime masterpiece did you say masterpiece but step one let's make some slime I'm gonna go for this pinkish metallic color I'm a fan of this this is gorgeous oh that is nice Oh where's that apron here we go now we take our magical liquid and we turn this glue into slime this was my very first time using the Elmer's magical liquid to make slime and let me tell you it was so much easier to make this than I expected it's just two ingredients and it turns out so amazing and really fun to play with Wow even though it was actually really easy I was still proud of myself I made this it's beautiful oh that is nice okay more another I need more we're gonna need much more than that so I got a little bit of glue here just a little bit it's heavy this is like a dark metallic blue color so get our magic liquid and pour Elmer's even sent me a few members of their team to help me out which was great because for some reason I was just like nervous about this I don't know why it was so easy the only difference with making a larger batch is that you have to need it more wow this is intense but it's so worth it having a huge batch of slime like this was such an experience whoa my baby so shiny whoo-hoo slime roll well how long have I been playing with this probably too long no we need a lot more slime to fill that huge canvas so it's probably time to move on several hours later I had 9 more huge containers of slime oh my gosh I was just having a ball playing with more slime than I ever thought I would have I love how there was so much variety in the look and feel we got solid colors metallics glitters it's like they all have their own little personalities this gold was definitely one of my favorites except that I still have some of the purple slime on my hand you're contaminating it so we've made a lot of slime that's that's clear so I had the canvas down on the floor all I have to do is fill each space of the canvas with the proper color of slime to create this slime masterpiece I started right in the center of the canvas with this king of the ice cream cones I needed to actually sit on top of it to be able to reach the center so I work from the center outwards so that I wouldn't be trying to reach over areas that I've already painted or be dropping slime where it shouldn't be so this kept everything nice and neat there was quite a lot of that background teal to fill in so I got started on that right off the bat oh my gosh this makes such a cool time-lapse oh ho ho it looks so cool sorry it was a bit of a precarious situation trying to navigate around this it's basically the size of my entire art room oh oh but I got this I got this everyone yeah when it came time to the details of course my perfectionist self was very active our 36 square feet of canvas to fill in just something to think about when you're scraping off for tiny specks of glitter I can't help it luckily the grooves were nice and deep and super sturdy this thing was really well made so it was pretty easy to keep everything neat and in its place why haven't I filled the center of that are yet to fill it to do it no filling the rainbow was one of the most satisfying moments of my life so it was really just like painting with slime oh yeah and moving right along yep that would be me what is that face so Elmer's did provide me with a color guide just like any traditional paint-by-number I guess I'll put the color guide in the description in case you want to look at it I don't know just I don't know what you want but they also let me know that I could use my own creativity if I wanted to I did really like how they designed it already so I actually did go with their design for the most part but especially toward the end I started adding a bunch of my own ideas and color choices Oh No hold on problem I'm gonna take care of this I'm handling it it's okay it's all good and now I'm just moving down to the enormous magical golden palace and I must say this was just such a cool idea for a challenge it combined art with slime in such an interesting way I cannot believe the amount of time and thought that Elmer's put into making this challenge it was so awesome and I really did enjoy myself throughout this whole process I'm so glad I kind of stepped out of my comfort zone and tried something different it was really cool seeing the potential amazing creative things that you can do with slime comment down below if you have a cool idea for another slime what if okay I think I definitely just stepped in the slime right there yep sure did throughout the whole time making this I kept having these visuals of myself like tripping over something and dumping an entire bin of slime over the artwork because that's definitely something I would do oby was also just having himself a good old time waltzing around like he owns the place I decided to add some little colorful foam balls to the ice cream cones to be like sprinkles because clearly that's necessary [Music] and finally I'm now working on the little characters at the bottom which I'm glad I saved these fur toward the end when I had gotten a little bit more practice with this because they were probably the trickiest part just working around their little faces and namilama trying not to completely drown them and slime oof not your best look my dude but I was able to pretty easily just like clean up the outlines by rubbing the slime away this did take me a solid four hours I believe to fill this whole thing in so this was quite the challenge but it was totally worth the effort for the bottom I decided to do a darker blue to create some contrast and variation down there I don't know you know just something different cuz we already had a lot of the teal on top plus I was really obsessed with this blue color my baby so I wanted to find a way to use more of that and we are starting to get down to the wire now filling in some more of the details I actually did end up using some of those paint brushes that they sent me not how you would normally use a paintbrush but the handles were actually good for kind of pushing the slime down into the smaller little crevices and I have one last little area to finish let's do it I chose pink slime for the little heart at the top because you know how love is pink and I left my logo for the final step because it's like you know signing my masterpiece with my signature and you know I had to make that rainbow I just I just had to not even a question in my mind I knew as soon as I saw it yep that's gonna be rainbow and yes I did steal some of the blue slime from the rainbow Shh tell anybody once I finished my signature the masterpiece was finally done here it is all complete and looking amazing this turned out so good even better than I imagined honestly but we're not done there is still one more phase to this challenge and you're gonna love it but let's let's just appreciate this for a second [Music] so now they're gonna pick up the whole thing and prop it up so that we can watch as all the slime runs down the canvas and there's only one song that I can think to play for this okay come come down here let's go play in the slime puddle even after putting that slime through all of that and having it sit out for many hours it still has a beautiful nice stretch to it alright guys well it's been an adventure I mean it's been nuts this has been super fun I want to thank Elmer's again for making all of this possible I hope you guys enjoyed this video be sure to follow hash tag Elmer's what if to see more mystery unboxing videos and I will see
