And the funny thing is
I didn't actually read the book physically, I listened to it using
today's video sponsor Audible. I remember when I first
listened to the War of Art, I was looking on Reddit
for book recommendations and "The War of At" came up. So I downloaded it on Audible. I listened to the audio version while I was starting to
clean but something happened, whenever I listened to
it for like five minutes, I had to take action on
the most important things in my life, it completely
was a paradigm shifting book. And the nice thing about
Audible is you can listen to books while you're being productive. You can be cleaning the kitchen, you can be driving somewhere, you can be going to the gym and you can be in taking valuable information while you're already doing
something constructive, it's like a double whammy of productivity. Audible has the largest
