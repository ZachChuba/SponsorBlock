Announcement alert. Other than the face mask thing. I have a podcast it's called Sad Boyz. It's a comedy podcasts about feelings. We just had internet
heartthrob D'Angelo Wallace on the show, which is super cool. Definitely check that out, I'll leave some links in the description. Our next guest is the one
and only Danny Gonzalez. And, it was a super fun time. So look out for that one. - Thanks to Thio Felia and Rigaski Milashovski Boyarski, which is a great grandmother of the person who sent me this message. I um, I'm pretty sure I said
it exactly perfectly correctly but if you want me to butcher you name or pronounce it impeccably then send me a message
on Instagram or Twitter. All right, that's all I have. Goodbye.
