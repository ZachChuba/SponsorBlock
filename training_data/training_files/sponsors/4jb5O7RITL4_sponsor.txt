But if you ARE comfortable in the kitchen, the 20+, weekly curated recipes can help you out of a rut if you wanna switch it up and learn something new. It's flexible, so you can skip weeks if you need to. Or pick meals based on your food preferences- Ooh! Cheese-Millipedes! One thing I really like is the variety. I had this Peanut Stew, Ribs, and this Salmon all in the same week. And I've definitely never cooked such a wide variety of food in one week before. Because: I am lazy.
