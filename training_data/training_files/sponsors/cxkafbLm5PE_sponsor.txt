months calendar for you to use this school
year. The calendar was created by using Graphicstock’s
exclusive watercolor illustrations and a bit of photo editing. For instructions on how to download and print
the calendar, just check the description box below. Graphicstock has the largest unlimited download
library of graphics, photos and illustrations. All of these come with a royalty-free agreement
so you can use them freely and distribute them, just like I am doing with these printables. You simply save your favorite images into
a project folder and then start downloading. You don’t need to buy or get access to individual
files like in other websites – as soon as you’ve signed up, all of the images can
be downloaded, with no hassles. We are giving away a seven-day free trial
of GraphicStock so you can get access to all their images and DIY your own calendar, agendas
and printables for this year. Just click the link in the description box
below to start downloading and get started today!
