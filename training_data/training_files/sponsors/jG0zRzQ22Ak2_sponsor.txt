This video is sponsored by the Deck of Many, animatedspells.com. They make convenient animated spell cards for you to use in your 5e games with pretty art on the front, and the info on the back. This year I started to play more 5e (sorry 3.5), and these cards have really come in handy since I play caster a lot. I already made this joke, but it's a big issue. So go pick up yourself some pretty cards, and for all of you that thought I animated dancing lights... Wrong. I would never animate the bane of my existence. Good guess though. But I did animate one so next video I will... maybe tell you. So go check them out even to see the pretty art. Alright?
