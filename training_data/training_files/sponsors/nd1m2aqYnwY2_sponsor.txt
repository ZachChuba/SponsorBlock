way to build your website. You guys know that I've used Squarespace for a bunch of my different projects, like the book that I'm writing
over realoriginsbook.com, also my own personal website which I'm sure exists for some reason. They've got these wonderful templates that you can customize like crazy, so your site can stand out above the rest. In fact, just this year they
added eight new templates for you to play around with. And just because Squarespace
