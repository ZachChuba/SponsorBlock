mentioned before I'm using this peak originally equipment technology for Asian vehicles and this is exactly what my car needs so a rule of thumb for me is I buy a little bit more than I need just because I don't know how much cool is gonna come out I don't know if I'm gonna have any leaks down the line and you always want to have a little bit more than you need and so you guys can get what you need I worked out a deal with peak to get five dollars off these gallon jugs of oae all you have to do is hit the link in the video description below and you can take that to your local auto parts store where they sell these guys it's pretty cool because you can take out all the guesswork in your cooling system and it's very affordable
