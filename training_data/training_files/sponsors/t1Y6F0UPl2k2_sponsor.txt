There are way more people behind the scenes
here at SciShow than you normally see on the screen. From writers and editors to hosts and producers,

come in. Monday.com is a team management tool that works for teams of any size, from two freelancers working together to worldwide collaborations. Its visual layout is digestible and easy to
