refresh myself with what I've learned that you need to share with you guys and I really like reading and learning new things and relearning old things and I've been using brilliant website to learn physics for the first time ever I'm so excited it's I'm slowly but sure than getting there and pretty soon I'm gonna dump a whole ton of knowledge on y'all brilliant pretty great because they know that effective learning is active and not passive and they also know that just watching videos alone isn't the best way to learn something new as much as I wish it was they also know that it's essential to apply what you learn as you learn it which is why they've created an awesome course on the essentials of science it includes the core concepts necessary for a strong foundation in science which will then allow you to go on and do some challenging science problems the course is designed to offer an engaging opportunity to explore key concepts through problem-solving and you can go check them out by going to brilliant or for science with Katie or you can sign up for free and also the first 200 people to use that link will get 20% off their annual premium subscription
