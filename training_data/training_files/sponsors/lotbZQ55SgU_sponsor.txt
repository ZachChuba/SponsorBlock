you know on all of these long flights I always need something to help me pass the time and I know what I'm going to be doing tomorrow I will be listening to the brand-new audiobook from Bill Nye the book is called undeniable evolution and the science of creation and he actually narrates this book himself so I can't wait to listen to it and if you want you can download this book for free by going to audible.com/veritasium or you can pick any other book of your choosing for a one month free trial so I really want to thank audible for their support they've helped me go to all of these amazing places and they have hundreds of thousands of audiobooks so
