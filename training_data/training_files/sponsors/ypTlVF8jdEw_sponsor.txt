This video was made possible by TheArmchairHistorian.com,
a new streaming platform made by The Armchair Historian for history YouTubers to be able
to make the videos we want to make for you all without ads or YouTube demonetization. The website features series from the likes
of Alternate History Hub, Invicta, Mr. Beat, Overly Sarcastic Productions, and many other
channels you might know of. I myself have a new series out, it's a more
serious, 3-part mini-series about the history of propaganda, and the first part is already
out. If you want to try it out, click the link
below and type code KhAnubis75 for the first month free, and the first 200 people who sign
up will be 75% off their second month. (Also, if you're a patron of mine, you'll
actually get the service completely free, just check the patron feed). This website is only possible with your support,
so please go and give it a try!
