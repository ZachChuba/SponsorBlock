before we get started we do have some words from our very supportive sponsor raid shadow legends so i've been playing raid for close to a year now and still to this day my favorite thing about it is all of the champions that you can collect and personally customize for example here i am on the pc version of raid because it is both mobile and pc friendly and with that ancient shard i did summon a new champion to add to my collection the iron clad with hundreds of champions to collect over time such as the ironclad or even this one here as well as the millions of players who play raid every month it's no surprise that raid has seen over 25 million downloads so far with such devotion to bringing in new players and such an outstanding community on reddit discord facebook youtube and even twitch all of those sites mentioned is where you can meet other players help build your clan up and learn more about the game in general if you ever have any questions with a lot to learn and so much to explore and just look at the insane graphics there also since we mentioned champions earlier they just added champion fragments which lets you collect pieces of champions that you could use to summon specific ones with a special event running right now to get the amazing horden there's also a new bazaar where you can load up on high value items with the gold bars that you win in the tag arena and they just extended the daily login rewards up to 270 days with free champions available just for logging in it's been a crazy month for updates so there's never been a better time to start and if you do decide to play you can find me in game under the name mr no sleep and if you are quick enough you can even join my clan so what are you waiting for guys go to the video description below click on those special links and if you're a new player you will get 100 000 silver plus one free champion the death chanter all of this treasure will be waiting for you here and the rewards will only be available for the next 30 days for new players good luck guys and i will see you there and as always a big thank you to raid for sponsoring the video and a big thank you to you guys for checking out the links and also checking out the game without their support i definitely could
