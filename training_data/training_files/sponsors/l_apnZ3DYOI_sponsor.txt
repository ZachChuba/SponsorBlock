Over the past couple months you might have noticed that Squarespace has sponsored a few of my videos I'm honestly really thankful for this too, because it has allowed me to dedicate some time to revamp in my own Squarespace powered website. I just want to quickly go over all the changes that I was able to make. The layout of my initial website was very basic so I decided to completely change it. They offer a lot of different templates, and once I found the one that I wanted, it took less than 30 minutes to set it all up. I was even able to add a cool banner video to the main page which I really liked Additionally, I added a couple new pages to the top where I update you guys with my current projects and make occasional blog entries. I only have two entries in the blog so far, but I plan to keep updating it. I was also able to change my logo and it gave me the push to add a bunch of new merchandise to the shop, which had been sitting around for a couple weeks. The website that I have now is completely different, and I'm honestly really happy with it. What's great too is that if I ever get tired of this layout I can easily change it again if I want to. Anyway with that being said, I genuinely think that Squarespace is a good and affordable service. And as I mentioned earlier, they're offering all my viewers a free trial and 10% off their first purchase.
