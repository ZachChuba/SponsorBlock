a big THANK YOU to Skillshare for supporting YouTube creators and sponsoring this video Skillshare is an online learning community for creators they have over 25,000 classes ranging from photography to software tutorials to business and marketing and lots more I actually used a skill show class to help me achieve that VHS effect being store at the start of this video it was this class here by Jake Bartlett and what's great about Skillshare is that it separates out all the lessons as I already know quite a lot about After Effects I was able to navigate through this class and just pick the effects that I wanted to achieve and watch those specific lessons without having to go over stuff I already knew an annual subscription to Skillshare is less than $10 a month but I will put a link below this video that will give anyone who clicks it a two month free trial so if you want to join the seven million users already signed up and learn skills that you're curious about or maybe learn things that will help further your career then hop over to skill share calm by clicking the link
