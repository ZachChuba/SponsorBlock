breaches, there are tons of ways our online
security can be compromised. That’s where the password manager Dashlane
comes in. I downloaded Dashlane back in 2018 because I needed a password manager that works
on both Google Chrome (on my laptop) and on the apps on my iPhone. Dashlane works across
devices and platforms, so it was perfect. When I first downloaded Dashlane, I saw I
used the same password on 411 different online accounts. That’s almost laughably bad, because
if a hacker gets a hold to any one of those, they’ve got access to everything. Luckily, Dashlane has a feature which can
log into websites and change insecure passwords for you so they’re longer a security threat.
And that’s not the only amazing feature Dashlane has; between a built in VPN, auto-filling
long forms, and Dark Web Monitoring, Dashlane not only saves you time, but also keep you
safe. Here’s the best part: Dashlane is free.
So go to dashlane.com/technicality to download Dashlane today. Plus, if you wanna upgrade
to the premium plan (which allows you to sync across devices and get access to a bunch of
other features), you can use the code “technicality” for 10% off.
