If you enjoy our content and want to learn
more about the universe, you might also like the documentaries on CuriosityStream. They’re a subscription-based streaming service
with more than 2,400 titles, and they have some pretty great space content. Like, one series, called Cosmic Front, explores
a bunch of stuff, from black holes to NASA’s Space Shuttle
program. And whether you’ve been a space fan for
years or are just discovering the night sky, there’s a good chance you’ll learn something
really cool. If you want to check it out, you can get unlimited
access to CuriosityStream starting at just $2.99 a month. And for our audience, the first 31 days are
totally free if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com/Space and use the promo
code “space” during that process. When you sign up, you’ll also be helping
SciShow research and produce more episodes like this. So, thank you!
