One of these communities that I’ve been
really enjoying lately is Amino. Amino is an app and community that features
tons of posts, quizzes, challenges, polls and pictures that motivate you to get involved
with other people all over the world and share your experiences. There are tons of back to school Aminos, like
School Style, Bullet Journal, School Days, HighSchool and so on, but my ultimate favorite
is the Studying Amino because it gives you a general overlook around different study
methods and tips and has a broader audience which makes it easier to get involved. It features study music, public chatrooms,
questions and answers, a featured page and so on. I have made a few posts on Amino with study
tips for 2017 so be sure to check them out – just sign up and click the link on the
downbar to get started so Amino knows I’ve sent you!
