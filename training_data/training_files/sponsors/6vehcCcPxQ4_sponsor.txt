but before we get into this video this video is brought to you by rosetta stone rosetta stone has been the leading language learning company for 25 years and we're working together to bring you guys a unique opportunity obviously right now we are stuck at home and it looks like lockdown procedures are going to last until the rest of this year and well into next year as well and during this time we owe it to ourselves to come out of this experience better than when we entered it and a big part of that is learning so i myself am trilingual and i can't tell you guys how important it is to be able to speak multiple languages and how useful it is and i think especially for anyone who's a k-pop fan whether you listen to k-pop music or you watch dramas or you watch variety shows it's better to understand what they're saying on screen rather than reading subtitles it distracts from the emotions that you can see on people's faces personally i'm using rosetta stone for travel for me i don't like visiting a country unless i know how to speak some of the primary language where i can survive i don't like sort of feeling helpless and not being able to communicate important things so i'm currently learning japanese because the next place i want to go to is japan now obviously with everything going on i'm not traveling anytime soon but this is also the perfect opportunity to hurry up and learn so that when it is possible to actually travel i can go to the places that i want to go to and so i thought it'd be perfect for you guys a lot of people often ask me how do you learn korean or what's the best way to learn korean or if i go to korea do i need to know korean and honestly yes it's better to know the language so you can better understand and appreciate the culture and what's the best way to learn immersion which is what rosetta stone offers and so if you use the link in the description down below my link specifically you get a great discount off of monthly subscriptions for rosetta stone but also for only 199 you get a lifetime subscription of rosetta stone that's up to 250 hours of immersive lessons per language with access to 25 languages for life you can learn multiple languages not just korean you know once you learn korean you want to learn new things you can switch it up on the app and challenges to keep it interesting for you guys so thank you to rosetta stone for bringing our viewers the opportunity to better connect with the kpop music that we check out on this channel so if you guys want to learn korean or any new language be sure to use the link
