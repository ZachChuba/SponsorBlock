but before that a quick word from today's sponsor we're talking about raycon today you guys know how much i love raycon and how much i talk about them on live stream as well rake on earbuds start at half the price of any other premium wireless earbuds on the market and they sound just as amazing as those top brands raycons are great for working at home and they fit really really easily and nicely and it's great to just be able to listen to music or whatever you listen to without annoying the people around you their everyday e25 earbuds are the best model yet with six hours of playtime and what i love is it takes literally one click of the bluetooth button on your phone to connect them and they connect every time seamlessly there's a load of different colors to pick from i went with white because i like the slick sort of clean look to them but if you use the link in the description by rakon.com links ocarina you can get yourself 15 off the earbuds i promise you you will not regret it
