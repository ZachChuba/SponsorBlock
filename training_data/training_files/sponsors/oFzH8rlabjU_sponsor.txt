Thanks for learning about this with me, and thanks to Ridge for sponsoring this episode
of SciShow Space! The Ridge make wallets and other products
to help you streamline your life. Their flagship product is The Ridge Wallet,
which launched on KickStarter in 2013 and today sits in the pockets of over half
a million people. And now they also have backpacks, phone cases,
and more, all intended to help you carry less extraneous
stuff. Like, their Commuter Backpack comes with a
power bank holder so you can charge your phone or laptop on
the go. There’s also a lifetime warranty on all
products, and free returns if you don’t love them. If you want to learn more, you can go to ridge.com/scishow. If you use the promo code “scishow,” you’ll
