just want to say thank you to Squarespace who has been our sponsor on this channel for the last year now and I've been using them for the last four years and before that I did bounce around other website building platform and I have to say I stopped its quest because it's literally the best one need i say more if you don't know what Squarespace is and if you haven't heard me talking about it you must be new here because I pretty much talked about it every single time I make a video Squarespace is a website building platform basically they provide a bunch of gorgeous templates a lot of you that follow me our young creative people and I think sometimes we rely on social media to be able to showcase our work and we don't realize that social media dies myspace died it's still there but it's dead dailybooth that's completely gone now MSN gone how will people find us it's important to have like your own online space so that you can direct people to what you're doing next and what you're up to when you're a freelancer it's super super important to have a portfolio that looks professional you want to convince people that you know what you're doing when it comes to visual stuff so when I was starting out I think just before I left my agency job I got Squarespace before that though there was times where I was sending links to my tumblr to people by email that is not professional you want to give yourself the best chance to showcase how good your work is you don't want them to stop at the website and be like this is bad I'm leaving like you wanted to look up professional before they've even looked at your work all the squarespace's templates are freaking amazing you can look at my website I've got one up there it's great just don't wanna brag but it's amazing and that's a Squarespace template and I've been using them for so long well I love you Squarespace I love you so much if you would like a two-week free trial go to squarespace.com slash phone and pitch and if you like what you see and you like how it works you will also get 10% off your first purchase if you continue with Squarespace which you will because it's amazing so if you would like to support my channel and the videos that I make supporting my sponsors is a great way to do it another way is visiting my store as I said we have Zayn's forming timer if you liked what you saw then you're probably gonna like this because it's the same thing and it's just it print fun you can see wait let me find a comparison right now I'm not sure I'll show up on camera look at this look look at it it's like an actual it kind of looks better in print
