with the tour of this room now I just want to thank today's sponsor which is still shirt I've worked with Skillshare a few times now they're a company that I absolutely love and I genuinely use their online classes to help me with a whole bunch of things Skillshare is an online learning community that offers a membership with meaning you can explore all the skills that you've been wanting to learn say you've been wanting to learn how to cook how to do illustrations graphic design there are so many classes on that website this definitely is something to fit everybody I personally in the past have done a class on how to use my editing software I've done a class on home decorating and this time I've taken the class for how to look after houseplants I've recently got a lot of houseplants I'm looking at one right now it's so cute and it's nice to take a little short course on how to like pot your plants look after them well it's taught me a lot so I can't wait to watch them thrive and grow I think we should all make 2020 the year where we explore new skills everybody who's got something that they're interested in and skill show makes it to get lost in creativity and broaden your talents Skillshare offers classes for real life so you can learn and grow with short classes that fit a busy routine honestly some of the classes I've taken are literally two minutes long so if you've got a spare two minutes you can use them to learn new things it's incredibly affordable when you compare it to real-life in-person classes they can cost so much money but Skillshare is offering you guys two months a free premium membership which is incredible you can learn all of the skills you could possibly want to with that so click the link in the description box if you guys would like two months free on Skillshare after that it's around $10 a month there's so much to explore and real products to create and you can also get the help of other creatives if you need it if you're struggling with something everybody is so nice on Skillshare and so helpful to each other it's such a nice place to learn so don't forget to get your two
