If that sounds like you, let me recommend
these videos on Skillshare. This one is taught by Guy Kawasaki, the guy
responsible for marketing Apple’s revolutionary 1984 Macintosh. In short, bite-sized videos, he answers business
questions like How to ask for money from investors, how to pitch your idea, and why you should
network. If you already have a business idea in mind,
there are also lots of specific lessons. The head of production at Anchor, for example,
has this class on how to start a podcast. Whatever you want to learn - how to draw,
take better photos, make YouTube videos, Skillshare probably has it. Better yet - for you, it’s free, for two
months. Just be one of the first 500 people to use
the link in the description.
