I'm still confused about the whole
rocket stuff humne I feel you this is when I go over to brilliant with
brilliant I can learn a little bit every single day I can learn about quantum
physics or machine learning calculus waves and light gravitational physics
problem solving even just logic puzzles it is so awesome yell personally I never
really get something like really get it deep down until I get the why of it and
brilliant helps me get there for example I wanted to know more about interference
and radio telescopes I know it's a really nice thing it's covered in a lot
of videos I've done and I've talked to experts about it and I'm like still
confused so I took the course over on about light and waves and I found myself
saying huh a lot which is a good thing by the way if you're learning and you're
like huh that's really cool so I think I actually get interference now which is a
super awesome feeling try out brilliant let me know if you learn something new
