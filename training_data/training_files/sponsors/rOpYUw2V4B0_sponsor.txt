that okay yeah but he got one and he received it that was cool I guess he likes it the system works yeah it's good we actually have some we actually had some new merge pictures oh okay I'm uh I was the photographer for them so I'm just gonna go ahead I'm gonna pull this up and she's it this is that okay so this is a teaser for an upcoming video I don't want to say too much because I don't know what's public yeah very little is public actually this is gonna be a pretty fantastic video so I'm just gonna pull this up so basically Brandon gets pretty triggered every time someone messages him on Twitter and is like I want to be a great photographer what camera should I buy and he's like alright so it's hard to give you the right answer when you're asking the wrong question because becoming a photographer is about developing a style learning the fundamentals you know understanding the correct way to take a photo so that you can push the boundaries and experiment with the art form note that I didn't say anything about your camera okay another way to trigger Brandon show them one of those key notes for a cell phone launch where they say take DSLR like phone with your phone yeah he'll be like no that's just actually not how that works so on the one hand Brandon gets triggered if you ask him which camera to buy to make you better photographer but on the other hand he gets triggered if you tell them that a phone is just as good as a real camera so this is great Brandon actually came up with the idea and we got in a camera that he was really excited to play around with 51 megapixels is it 51 point 4 megapixels so this is the Fujifilm GFX 50 are so crazy camera like crazy camera to the point where I'm sure people out there would think wow with a camera like that in my hands I could be a photographer no problem and so what what he came up with was we weren't really sure how to like make a video about a product like that because it's a medium format camera which is really designed for a certain type of work like it's it's a tool designed for a certain type of job you'd say high fashion photography you know anything that you were to photograph that you would expect to print the size of you know the site of a building you would capture with a camera like that like the level of detail that it can capture is incredible and I kind of forget where I'm going with this very roundly story but long story short Brad and I were talking and he kind of pitches me this crazy idea and he goes how about this we do a photography challenge but we take an inexperienced photographer and I am at best an inexperienced photographer I think that's generous we take an inexperienced photographer we arm them with the GFX 50 R and then we put them up against an experienced photographer with a smartphone and we resolve once and for all does a smartphone hold up against the real camera and once and for all does an amazing camera turn you into a photographer if you're just some random scrub I love part of this concept because you're basically making him fight against himself because if he does too good of a job so Brandon with a pixel three versus me with a Fujifilm GFX fifty are now I'm not going to share a ton of this with you but I just want to show you guys one of my photos some of them are just far too spoilery but beyond the store at some point okay I mean it's wonderful oh it's not it was just loading yeah yeah okay I mean the highlights are a little a little blown out on that one yep his face is like actually just pure white yep yeah I mean it is coltan it's probably pretty close so in fairness to me yeah like you shine a light at coltan the guy's pretty white does he have a bottom Sun at all no he doesn't have pants on my understanding is that he was wearing underwear okay but it's possible he wasn't I have no way of verifying that he was in fact wearing underwear okay anyway guys look forward to this video if nothing else it's gonna be a ton of fun if nothing else seeing Colton with no pants on ten out of ten and there's this there's fun there's there's far worse no I'm sorry guys I really can't show this to you guys because it's gonna be such a moment in the video but make sure you don't miss the photography challenge I'm actually very proud of this photo you guys need to put that on a wall so just cuz it's so awkward it's pretty out there so you've seen that one yeah well yeah he's he's seen all of it he's seen all of it so guys I mean should I you know what I will give you I will give you one small spoiler it's really close like this does not end up being a blowout so no matter what you think no matter what preconceived notions you come into this video with you're right [Laughter] oh people are so bad in chat I'm so me not showing them though any of those pictures guys it's like actually come on I really can't I really can't yeah I really can't show you I did show you it's like if we showed the benchmarks for every benchmarking video on wine show before the video came out yeah it
