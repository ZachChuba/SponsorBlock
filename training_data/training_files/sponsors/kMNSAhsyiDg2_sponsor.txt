Or if you would like to begin learning more
about programming and build a solid foundation of understanding, then you could take this
course on Computer Science Fundamentals on Brilliant which will start with an intro to
algorithms and gradually build you up to more complex ideas like data types and structures,
by the end of this course you will have discovered algorithms that can be used to extract answers
from data, and when you are finished you can take the follow up course in computer science
algorithms. This is just one of many courses on Brilliant,
with more courses due to released soon on things like automotive engineering and Python
Coding. If I have inspired you and you want to educate
