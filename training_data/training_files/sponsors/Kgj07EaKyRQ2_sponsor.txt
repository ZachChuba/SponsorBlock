And today's video was made possible by our sponsor Raycon. I really like these
ones when I'm traveling. Raycon makes innovative
wireless headphones that a lot of people have these days, whether you're at the
gym or you're driving, you're using them all the time. But, the nice thing about
the Raycon headphones, is that you still get a really cool design and really high quality product with great sound for half the price of what most of the
competitors and leaders of the market are, out there. Newsflash, not everybody
has the same size ear hole. - That's actually so smart. - This is a lot of different ones that can fit inside of your ear. I like the way that this fits so that it blocks out
some of the outside noises that you have. So Raycon, thank you for
making this video possible so that we could actually
do something awesome like make a butterfly
out of a Galaxy Fold. - It looks so cool. - If you want to support
