Hi this is David. I wrote this video because my kids kept asking
me questions about why some animals get so big. To help foster their curiosity about the world,
their Nana got them subscriptions to KiwiCo, which sends them a box of hands-on science,
art, and math projects called a KiwiCrate every month. I was super-excited when KiwiCo offered to
sponsor this video because we love the crates - and I’m sure your family will too. Sign up at KiwiCo.com/minuteearth, and they’ll
give you the first month for free - just in time for the holidays.
