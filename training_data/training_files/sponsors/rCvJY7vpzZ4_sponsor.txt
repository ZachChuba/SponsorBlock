the cofounders of secret lab reached out and it was nice enough to send me their new Titan XL gaming chair after sitting on this thing for months and months turns out a good quality chair can really do a lot for your health comfort and aim first of all it fits me perfectly which is pretty rare for a big guy like me at 6 foot 2 and this thing is super comfortable my old chair had an armrest I couldn't even move in a really bad supporting cushion and compared to that the Titan XL is a godsend the adjustable 4d armrest and the Titan XL allow me to have my elbows at the same level as my desk and for me having that alignment helps protect my wrists from having to be in weird angles and also stabilizes my aim since it's all in one level I can also have the chair adapt to my exact preference whenever I game with a heavy duty multi tilt mechanism I can lie all the way down when it's nighttime and rust to rest or just as easily sit back up when I need to focus I've had a long talk with the cofounders and not only found out that they liked my videos but they're really down-to-earth people that care about the product the chairs are very high quality and I definitely recommend getting a chair from them if you've been looking for an upgrade if you'd like to get one you can use my link in the description and come on even faker uses their chairs
