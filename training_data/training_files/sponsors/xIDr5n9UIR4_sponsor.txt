So, I've talked about
the video wall and floor. It means there's no green screen key,
and it means my eyeline looks perfect. We've talked about the camera tracking
and the virtual set extensions... ..and about the real-time media server
that's putting all this together. There's one more important thing here: there's only one other person
required in the studio. We have me, and we have
Luis on camera. That's it. There are a few other folks outside
in the production gallery, but that could be
anywhere in the world. Right now, when shows
have to be made while everyone keeps their distance,
that's important. If you don't want
just a televised video call— and let's face it, the world is very tired
of televised video calls— then this SmartStage and disguise's
xR pipeline is a brilliant solution. And if you'd rather
the stage go to the talent... Well, White Light are used to delivering
enormous live shows in arenas and stadiums. One of these stages can get packed up,
set up in a truck, and sent to anywhere that there's power. Broadcasts, presentations,
education... Anywhere that you can get a shipping container,
you can get one of these stages. So, thank you to White Light and disguise
for helping pull all this together. There are links to all of them
in the description. I'm so grateful.
Right, back to the Final.
