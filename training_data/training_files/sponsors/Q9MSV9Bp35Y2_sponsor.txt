other books about alternative history that you can actually read about though like the man of the high castle which explores a world in which the Axis powers were victorious in world war ii or 11/22/63 which explores a world where JFK was never assassinated and both books are available on audible if you're like me the best way to fit reading books into a busy schedule is through audible audiobooks audible has an enormous library of books and audio programs including an entire section devoted to alternate history that you can listen to entirely offline anywhere with their apps best of all though you can sign up for free by clicking the link in the description or by going to audible.com/veritasium five-zero-zero and a download man in the high castle 11/22/63 or any other audio book that you want for free in addition to two audible originals also for free thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again next week
