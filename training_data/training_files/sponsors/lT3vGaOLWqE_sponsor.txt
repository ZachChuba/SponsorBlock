#Giveaway Time!# Hey, I've survived one million subscribers, and hopefully I'll survive another million too. And, to show my appreciation to everyone who made this happen, ...I thought giving away a few 3D printers is in order. Lulzbot makes some top-of-the-line printers. I've had this Lulzbot Mini for a while now, and I'm pretty happy with it, and I thought you deserve the same. So I'll give two of these to my patrons at Patreon.com who are automatically in the draw, and the other two go to the viewers. So, like last time, if you have a need for a 3D printer, leave a comment so I know you need it. Something like... I don't know, be creative. Bring smile to my face. And I thank you again.
