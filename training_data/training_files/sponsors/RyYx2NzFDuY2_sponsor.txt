While our planet documents history in its
soil, maybe you are interested in documenting some stories of your own. And no matter how you want to do that, Skillshare
can help you learn the ropes. Skillshare is an online learning community
to help you create and explore. For instance, if you ever wanted to try filmmaking
but don’t have all the expensive equipment, you might like Skillshare’s course on iPhone
filmmaking—which shows you how to make cinematic films with just your phone. An annual Skillshare subscription is less
than $10 a month, and with a Premium membership, you can get unlimited access to its classes
and communities. To try out a two-month free trial of a Premium
membership, click the link in the description. And as always, thank you for watching SciShow
Space.
