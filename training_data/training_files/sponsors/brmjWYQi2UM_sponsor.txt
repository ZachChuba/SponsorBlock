And after that, you could head over to this
video’s sponsor, Brilliant.org, for more interactive quizzes and mini courses on physics
and math. In fact, they even have an introductory quiz
specifically on black holes and gravity which guides you through deriving the Schwarzschild
radius formula and other cool stuff like that, with just the right balance between hand-holding
and creative problem-solving - I’ll link to it in the video description . And the first
314 people to go to either that link or Brilliant.org/minutephysics will get 20% off a premium subscription to
Brilliant. Again, that’s Brilliant.org/minutephysics
which lets Brilliant know you came from here. Good luck problem solving!
