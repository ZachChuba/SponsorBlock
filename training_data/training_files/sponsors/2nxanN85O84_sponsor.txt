but i need to be training this over the weekend and bringing home one of these giant machines can be a pain in the butt but we just got some razor blade pro 17s and they have an rtx 3080 inside except i had got an extra one with a razer core x which is an external gpu box that has an rtx 3090 in it so you're saying this laptop has a 30 90 attached to it yes i'm saying this laptop has a 30 to 90 attached to it not in it it has a 3080 in it the 30 90 is the only gpu that can do deep fakes good enough for what we want to achieve here sorry i'm nerd alert real hard here but deep fakes require a ton of ram uh specifically vram which is only on your gpu and up until like this year everybody's like ah you don't need a lot of vram what do you need vram for and there was like ai and they're like oh and then they actually put a bunch of vram on gpus now it's really cool it's great we're turning the corner of technology laptop actually has 16 gigs of vram which is still super impressive with this crazy setup using the razer and the core x i can be running a deep fake at the quality of what we did with the luke skywalker one and i can do it for my home i can do it over the weekend and i can just bring it with me back to work think about it we're using a razor blade not to shave a mustache but to grow one
