bugs so you know if you're trying to run a business in a country where you can do that use fresh books it is a super simple to use invoicing tool that makes it so you can send invoices in like less than 30 seconds you can generate them super quick you can check to see if the person that received your invoice is actually read it you can track your time with their timesheet function you can manage your expenses to keep track of who owes you what which is absolutely super helpful when you're when you're starting a new business especially a very small business may be where you are the only person in the business whatever your country calls that I think it's sole proprietorship here yeah if you're running something like that these little bits of paperwork just creating an invoice checking to see if that person received the invoice checking to see who owes you what following up on all these different little things can take a huge amount of time so the fact that you can just generate one in 30 seconds the fact that FreshBooks can manage all your expenses and expense things for you can just take a picture of the receipt it handles the rest all that kind of stuff is actually super freaking helpful it also has a feature that tells you oh I just read the same note again it tells you when clients look at their invoice for the first time so that you know that they've seen it at all if you have any questions and you feel that you need to reach out and ask their staff so you can just do that and you'll speak directly to a real human there's no phone tree no escalations now return calls or anything you just talk directly to a person yeah great god yes it's nice yeah visit fresh book stockholm /when and enter when and how did you hear about a section to sign up for a free trial and
