what a vpn is that it's not edible and that it's the easiest way to protect and encrypt your online activity for a much safer browsing experience but what makes surfshark special is that it also blocks ads trackers and other types of malware and you can use it on as many devices you want at the same time it's also been extremely helpful for me to gain access to netflix servers from around the world to watch shows that aren't available outside of those territories and if you're like me and like to be overly cautious with your data you can use a feature called multihub where you can connect to multiple servers at the same time for additional protection and surfshark even has its own search engine that doesn't track any of your logs obviously so if you go to surfshark dot deal cosmo and use my code cosmo you can get 83 percent off a two-year plan and three months for free
