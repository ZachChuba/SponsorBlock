Before we go on
we have some exciting news. We are now creating
stories on Amino. We’ve been wanting to experiment
for a while with fun new formats and shorter content. So we decided to partner with Amino
to do this, because stories on Amino are different
from stories anywhere else. They’re still fun and quick
but they don’t disappear. Right now on Amino
you can check out our two brand new video essay style quizzes. Clink the link in our description
or search for Amino Apps to download Amino. Then search for The Take. Every time you watch a story
you’re supporting us.
