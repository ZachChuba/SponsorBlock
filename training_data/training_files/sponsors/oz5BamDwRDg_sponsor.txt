I've been trying to recover from a cold these past few days and the sponsor of this video, Trade Coffee, really helped me feel better. Trade is an online service to help you find the perfect cup of coffee for your taste and deliver it straight to your door. It's roasted to order, fresh, premium coffee, so you know you'll always be enjoying a great tasting cup. The website first asks you a couple questions to figure out what flavors you prefer, and then it will recommend a coffee based on that. Since I'm sick, it's nice being able to know I'm going to have a great cup of coffee no matter how bad I feel. And you can enjoy a great cup of coffee too, with a great deal. Trade is giving the first 100 people who click the link in the description 30% off their first coffee. Just click the link in the description and use the code, PROPERPEOPLE2.
