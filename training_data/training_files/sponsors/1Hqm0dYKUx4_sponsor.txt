This Minute Physics video is brought to
you in part by audible.com, the leading provider of audio books across all types
of literature including fiction non-fiction and periodicals. If you go to
audible.com/minute physics you can try audible out by downloading a free
audiobook of your choice. I just read 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss.
It's a fantasy novel with a very music and scientifically oriented protagonist and I thoroughly enjoyed it. You can download this audiobook or a free audiobook
of your choice at audible.com/minutephysics and I'd like to thank audible
for helping me continue to make these videos
