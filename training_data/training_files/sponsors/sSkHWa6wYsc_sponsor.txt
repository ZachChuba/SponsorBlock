today's video I partnered with December and picked out three different designer perfumes to try because I've heard a lot of reviews that they smell amazing they come in this pretty velvet bag that I can put in my purse to take with me or travel this is how they look outside of their bag and I really like the packaging the colors are really cute one thing that really stands out to me is the amount you get to test out we all know that perfume can get really expensive so to try to design our fragrances for only 14.95 is a great deal to take the perfume out all you have to do is twist the bottom and it pops right out I don't want to spend a ton of money on a perfume and end up not liking the smell so this is perfect to try a designer perfume each bottle will last you a month and they have 450 perfumes to choose from these are 100% authentic scents I pick the Burberry British sheer versace bright crystal and for my husband the versace arrows they have men's cologne too which is awesome so your significant other can try these out as well I will leave their website in my description box and a 30% off your first month discount code I really like the perfumes that I tried out my favorite is the versace bright crystal if you've been hearing a lot about a designer fragrance and want to try it out a highly recommend scent bird thank you sent bird for sponsoring today's
