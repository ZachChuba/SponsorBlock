interact with anyway before we continue watch this ad you can take everything i'm about to say from both a long time runescape player and long time audible listener i'm not a fan of reading i find myself to be a pretty busy person today and most of my life is online i spend a lot of time in front of the computer whether it be playing video games editing videos or just about anything else and the ability to put on an audio book to learn or enjoy listening to something while playing runescape for example is incredible i can't imagine playing the game these days without something going on in the background and it makes it extremely enjoyable you can also listen to audiobooks on the go like i'm about to do i have a flight tomorrow and it was as simple as downloading the audiobook that's in my library i'm going to be listening to peter thiel's book zero to one it's a book about startups and how to create companies that create new things straight from one of the creators of paypal and palantir very excited to listen to it and i can do that on the go with audible genuinely one of the best value subscriptions that you can have and that's why i love taking these ads because i feel like audible is something that everyone should try and experience and it's for a lot more than just audio books as well if audiobooks aren't your thing they have podcasts guided wellness programs and audible originals that you will not find anywhere else you can visit audible.com
