Alright, now it's time to do my ad read for Honey, so without further ado here is the ad that I made for Honey. HONEY! Is that... Is that the whole thing? HONEY! DOWNLOAD IT NOW IT'S FREE! Uh...Okay Well I'm not gonna use that and instead I'll just tell you all about honey! Honey is actually really great. I had been hoping that they would sponsor me for a long time cause I have actually been using it for months. It's a tool for shopping that you can basically install to your web browser that automatically searches for like promo codes and coupon codes and all that stuff when you're shopping online. It's personally saved me a lot of money, it works on like Walmart, it works on J Crew, lot li— works on over 30,000 stores. I personally use it most on Amazon. The best part about it is you don't really have to do anything after you've installed it, it jus— it automatically applies every coupon code that it finds to your purchases. Like look at this I put $220 worth of stuff in my Best Buy cart and Honey searches for coupons and saves me $44 of my order. It only takes two clicks to install, so if you wanna get just go to joinhoney.com/greg the link will be in my description. When you think about it there's really no reason NOT to add it because it doesn't really do anything except save you money and it's totally free, so, why wouldn't you get it? So go ahead and download it for free, it helps me out, it helps honey out, and it helps you out. So it benefits everyone involved. *sigh* alright much better.
