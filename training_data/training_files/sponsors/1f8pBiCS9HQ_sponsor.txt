start watching a documentary on a service
like CuriosityStream. CuriosityStream is an extensive and constantly
updated collected of exclusive and high-quality documentaries that was actually created by
John Hendricks, who is the founder of the Discovery Channel, which was my absolute favorite
TV channel when I was a kid. Now, unlike normal TV channels, with CuriosityStream
you can access those documentaries on all of your devices whenever you want. They're in your web browser. They're on iOS and Android. They're on Roku and on many other platforms
as well. Once you start digging into their library,
you're going to find tons of different documentaries and topics ranging from science, to technology,
to nature and lots, lots more. If you're looking for a recommendation of
where to start, a documentary that I really enjoyed recently was called Order And Disorder,
specifically the episode on the story of information, which traces the development of how we communicate
with each other. Membership on CuriosityStream is really affordable
at just $2.99 per month, and if you go over to curiositystream.com/thomas and sign up,
you're going to get 30 days of completely unlimited free access, so it's a great way
to try out the service. A big thanks goes out to CuriosityStream for
sponsoring this episode and being a big supporter
