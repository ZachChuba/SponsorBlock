start off by saying thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring today's video you guys have heard me talk about Squarespace quite a lot and I'm so happy to have them sponsor my videos every now and then it means so much to have a sponsor that I actually love and use myself and so I can feel good about recommending it to you guys if you don't know what Squarespace is it's a website building platform where you can build really beautiful websites from scratch using their templates that are super customizable you can change the colors you change the phone scene change the layout of different things add more blocks they like use blocks to edit so you kind of drag stuff in move it around they have so many different templates and they're organized really well on their website so if you're a photographer you can go and look and they even recommend different templates that they think work well for photography but you can always mix and match and there's so many like options that you can choose I use Squarespace to display my own portfolio at the moment and if I'm ever applying for jobs I'll just send on my website and that counts as my portfolio it's super easy it shows them what I've been doing and who I worked for in the past all in one place so I really love it and if you guys would like 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain head to Squarespace com4 / Cellini and that will also give you a 14-day two-week free
