wanting to crash all the time I'd hate for you guys to get bored and crash out of this video before I tell you about our sponsor the mass drop HD 6xx headphones are one of mass drops all-time bestsellers with over 60,000 units sold and no wonder because they've got an unchanged driver structure from the HD 650s which are an absolute legend they've got a detachable six-foot cable instead of a 10-foot cable unlike the HD 650 s but the sound signature is unchanged so you've got nice balance mids natural sounding bass and they're open back for a nice natural soundstage they come with Sennheiser's long-term support and you can buy them at the link
