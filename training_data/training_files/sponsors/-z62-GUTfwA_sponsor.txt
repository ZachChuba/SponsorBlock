Making your money work means
figuring out which spending priorities are actually
important to you and which ones aren't. And the more intentional
you are with your money, the more confident you can feel
about investing in your future. With a company
like Wealthsimple, it's easier than
ever to get started. Wealthsimple is online
investing that's a simple and human as it gets. In just 5 minutes they'll
build you a custom portfolio to fit your personal
goals and timeline. Just answer a few easy questions
and they'll manage your money for you on autopilot. Set it, forget it, and let your
money grow in the background. You can turn on automatic
deposits as well as set up a smart savings account with
higher rates than big banks for your shorter-term goals-- your wedding, your next great
adventure, or that handbag you need. They also have a socially
responsible portfolio that invests in green
stocks and companies that support gender diversity. The fees are much
lower than big banks, and TFD viewers will get their
