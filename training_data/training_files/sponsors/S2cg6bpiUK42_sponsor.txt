If you need to not be seen in public for security,
secrecy, laziness, or other reasons you need to remember to eat and one of the best eating
methods is with Blue Apron. Each week, Blue Apron delivers boxes to your
door filled with farm-fresh pre-apportioned ingredients that you can use to quickly make
the recipes included. I’ve tried plenty of different Blue Apron
meals and they’ve all been delicious and unique. Each meal is between 500-800 calories per
person, takes less than 40 minutes to prepare (and often only 20 to 30 minutes), and costs
as little as $7.49 per serving. If you want to try Blue Apron out, the link
in the description will get you $50 off your first two weeks.
