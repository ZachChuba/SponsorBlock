afternoon hope you're all well before we get into the video those of you who saw the series new york to la with no money might have joined in on some of my live q and a's along the way and i love doing them but for some reason i've just not done many more since well i want to do more and i'm going to start doing more and i've teamed up with a new app called stereo where you can actually send the voice message instead of me just reading a question that you've typed kind of like this where's somewhere in the world that you've been that is a must-see i've got a few but i'm gonna say this petra in jordan i'm just saying mayo's much better than ketchup oh wow wow do you think with youtube being so saturated now it's easy enough to get your videos noticed you know if you're passionate about something and you love doing something you know you're gonna stick at it and you know what if you don't build a following and you don't turn it into a career at least you love doing it and you know you're experiencing it anyway i've already done two live conversations on this so far which brought back so many memories and thank you so much to everybody who jumped on and sent their voice messages it's crazy that it's the same people jumping on stereo that it was jumping on when i was going through america with no money love that thank you if you missed the last two live streams you can catch up on them on the app and i'm also going live tonight at 9 00 pm if you're free and fancy jumping on make sure to download the stereo app if you haven't already so you can join in later if you're over 18 i've put a link to the stereo app and my next live conversation at 9 pm tonight at the top of the description
