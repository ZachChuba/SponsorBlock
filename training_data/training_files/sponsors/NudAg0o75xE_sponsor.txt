i've lost an entire hard drive's worth of data because i plugged in the wrong external power source and just like that i'd lost years of memories so for the past several years just as i have home insurance for the contents of this room in case of fire or burglary i also have insurance for my data from a company called backblaze i've been a happy paying customer of theirs for years and so when they offered to sponsor a video it was an easy yes with batblaze you can upload as much of your data as you want and it can be documents photos videos whatever and upload it to their servers then in case your data is lost or destroyed on your local disk they can send you your data that can be a download to your new device or they can send you a hard drive with your data on it and considering that i have approximately 10 terabytes of data with them i think i'd probably go for the hard drive batblaze is recommended pretty much everywhere they've got tons of satisfied customers they've restored over 50 billion files and in all the years that i've used them i have nothing to say but good things if you'd like to check them out then you can get a 15 day free trial at batblaze.com simon clark which allows you to test out their service and also supports this channel if you do want to carry on after that trial then it's just seven dollars a month which i think is an absolute bargain considering that we pay for home insurance and car insurance your data is arguably even more important and considering that you can upload as much data as you want i think seven dollars a month is a very fair price for peace of mind that's batblaze.com forward slash simon clark if you want to give them a try thank you to blackblaze for sponsoring this video but also for
