completely unrelated to that have you ever seen someone hacked into a racist animatronic Elmo doll to show people on the internet how a VPN works well guess what because today's sponsor is Nord VPN you may have heard of them from [ __ ] everywhere and that's actually part of the reason why I'm so excited to be working with nortis cuz I see their ads all the time and they tell you about how Nord is gonna make you more secure but no one ever shows you how it's gonna make you more secure so let's hack [Music] Minecraft's hey how's it going I hope everyone's having fun because I'm about to make it so you never feel comfortable in public ever again so let's just pretend we're in a star bees and this is their router and this is gonna be your regular computer connected to the star bees wireless you could be doing whatever reading email watching porn whatever you do at Starbucks but then this is the computer of the creepy old white man sitting at the back of the Starbucks he's gonna be trying to see what you're doing online vomiting is trigger me I want to show you what the creepy [ __ ] over there I can see when you're not secure on the internet because Elmo sends requests over the Internet to get race data and so it should have detected my face by now let's go see what old man never cracker Pepsi so here's the wireless data from the last couple of minutes let me just filter that for just HTTP roll down Oh would you look at that look as an application touch touch stays on file we used an application test JSON file in the ELMO I wonder if it has anything to do with this oh look at that we pulled the URL from thin [ __ ] air which literally anyone can do on an unsecured Network if they have a computer and no life here look I'll show you where it goes um I got to restart the computer to get internet access back so I'll just save the URL to a file alright we're back we got Internet so I'll just copy paste over the URL and to fire file would you look at that it's the same [ __ ] image now let's try the same exact thing but with Nord VPN enabled all right starting it up and you should notice an immediate change in the Wireshark protocols column it should go from TCP UDP and HTTP to Open VPN which implements aes-256 military-grade encryption that's a lot of buzzwords though you don't give a [ __ ] about buzzwords you just saw that computer you just saw that computer rip a data packet out of thin [ __ ] air a packet that was never intended for it I'm sure you just care about results so I will show you results instead of stupid ELMO thing you got my face all right cool let's go over to Wireshark let's check out the protocols would you look at that is all open VPN I cannot pull a [ __ ] from it there's no data for me to read because it's all in crypt so I'm secure whether I'm on a secure network out in public or not and that is a terrifying but harsh reality of unsecure networks but the good news is I can get you 77% off a three-year plan with Nord VPN if you want to start protecting your internet experience today all you got to do is go to Nord VPN comm slash Michael Reaves and use the code Michael Reese generated under and I get it if you're like I don't really use my computer to Starbucks I just whip out my mobile phone browse read and do whatever unfortunately mobile phones are susceptible to a lot of apps are really insecure and vulnerable to this but Nord can protect your phone traffic to sync got to worry about it I mean you ever send nudes from a Starbucks and I haven't but you know yeah just keep in mind the old guy at the back that's Nord VPN comm / Michael Reese with the cold microwaves I add
