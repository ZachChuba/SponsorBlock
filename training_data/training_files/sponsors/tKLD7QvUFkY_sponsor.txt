into that I wanted to talk to you about today's sponsor which is Skillshare now I've mentioned Skillshare in a few videos before and I personally think they are incredible if you've got anything that you're wanting to learn they're the place to go so people post these video tutorials of pretty much anything like you can learn how to use editing software if you are wanting to make videos and you've got no idea how to cook they have so many different videos but what I've been using it for recently is to learn how to use my illustration software better so I've been doing these illustrations whenever I've had a bit of spare time because I did really well in art at school and I feel like I haven't used that skill since I left school so on my iPad I use an app called procreate to create my illustrations I basically taught myself that absolute most basic skills on it and I have no idea how to work anything else and that is where skill share has really helped me so skill share is an online learning community for creatives they've got more than at 25000 classes in design business and so many more things if you just have a browse on there you will find something that aligns to what you're wanting to learn a new skill in and as I've just touched on I am really enjoying doing kind of illustration things at the minute and I wanted to learn some more so I'm gonna show you on the screen a couple of classes that they've got that I found really useful there's one in how to actually use the app that I use and then you can learn how to do like calligraphy typography how to write nicely which is something that I struggle with I'm not very good at the write-in side of things if ever I wanted like poor graphics on anything and there's also a class in how to find your creative voice so if you like being creative but you don't know really what your style is there's a class for that which is super helpful largely premium memberships give you unlimited classes so you can learn as many skills as you want and find the classes that and the communities that are right for you one thing that I really like about Skillshare is you can actually join groups with like-minded people so he find a skill that you're wanting to hone in on like cooking you can join a group and receive feedback from people there are more than 7 million creators learning with skill share and if you guys want to join them skill share is giving away a two-month all access trial to my subscribers I'm gonna leave a link to it in the downbar if you just click through you can get two months free and after the two months is over if you're really enjoying the skill show which I'm sure you all will it's only $10 a month to carry on and as I said you get unlimited access to learn whatever you want to so again the link will be in the description to Skillshare go and get your free to once learn some new skills along with me and let me know
