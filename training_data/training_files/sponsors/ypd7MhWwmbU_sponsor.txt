I love how soft it makes my skin feel, and my wife happens to like it as well. Ain't that right, Amanda? *100% not Amanda* "Boy, oh boy, I sure do. I love your face when you use Bulldog." She's standing just outside of frame. That's why you can't see her. But she said it. But anyway, Bulldog's great because they're very careful about what ingredients they put in all their products Their products have great natural ingredients like aloe vera, camelina oil. They don't just make moisturizer and face wash. They also sell deodorant, shaving cream, beard balm, which I use religiously every single day. They're vegan friendly; they're cruelty free. Both those things are good. They never use synthetic fragrances or artificial colors, which are terrible for your skin. So whether you got sensitive-ass skin like me or maybe more oil prone skin, all their products are specially formulated to help you look and feel your best. Come on, you deserve this.
