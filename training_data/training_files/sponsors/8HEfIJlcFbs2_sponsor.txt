six-year-old me would be so stoked to know that i would eventually build a robot that could set up all the dominoes for me so if you want the same feeling of making things with your hands to do cool things but you don't want to wait 35 years then my friends at kiwiko have got the answer in fact this is an actual mini version of the dom i designed together with them just for this video i mean how awesome and adorable is that he's like the protege the dom jr they've got an incredible team of designers that work on each project and honestly if i wasn't making youtube videos i think i would apply to be on their team then all the concepts are kid tested and then it's delivered right to your door every month so you can foster your creativity and make your abilities in a fun and natural way so for example for this domino machine box inside you've got all the supplies you'll need to put it together you've got simple instructions and then a booklet with more info like a q a with someone you might know and this is the tinker crate line but they've got eight different subscription lines each catering to a different age group and topic so if you want to support my channel and feed your brain while having fun at the same time go to cubico.com roverdomino or use the link in the video description to get an exclusive offer so thanks to kiwico for being so great to
