This is a video by Real Life lore Sponsored by seriously digital entertainment and their mobile game, Best Fiends Beiefly before the main portion of the video begins In about 45 seconds, I'd like to thank my incredible sponsor. Their game is about a meteorite that crashes into a fictional planet that apparently transforms it into a free puzzle adventure game where you can collect and upgrade little characters by matching the same colored objects to just meet virtual slugs, in the real world meteorite impacts often caused nothing but mass destruction and chaos with maybe a few extinction events. But in this virtual world it's actually created a pretty fun game with some character question where you can win virtual prices like gold and hopefully not going extinct  there's quests every 50 levels and you can play competitively against your also not extinct friends on Facebook through their leaderboards I'm on there at level 32 so if you're the type of person that has to be better then you can download the game for free with the link in the description and if you actually play it to level 10 they will throw some free virtual golden diamonds your way that's apparently were four dollars and ninety-nine cents if you skip the video until now that you should feel just a tiny bit bad about yourself but the main portion of the video begins
