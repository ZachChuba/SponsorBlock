Alright guys I'm walking
around the office again. You know what that means, it's time for the sponsorship. This week's episode of
Wheelhouse is brought to you by Squarespace. You know what Squarespace is, you've heard it allover. It's the all-in-one platform that makes it easy to build a beautiful and vibrant website for your brand or business. Ferrari dude. Sweet. Guys, 2019 is gonna be here
faster than you know it and if you're thinking about
starting a business next year, there's no better platform for you than Squarespace! With Squarespace you can
build an online store, easily track orders and inventory and you can track analytics
with super easy to use tools. It's so easy guys. If you already own a domain name, which a lot of you do, Squarespace makes it
super easy to transfer that domain name over
to a Squarespace site. The name of the game
with Squarespace is just, it's easy. Everything is easy to do. Even I, someone who often has problems
connecting to a printer, can use Squarespace. It's just that easy. Guys, when you're ready to build a website go to squarespace.com and then when you're ready
to launch that website, go to squarespace.com/wheelhouse and save 10% off your first website or domain name. Guys I don't walk around the neighborhood talking to my phone like
a lunatic for nothing. I do it because these sponsors
help us make these shows so please, use their stuff.
