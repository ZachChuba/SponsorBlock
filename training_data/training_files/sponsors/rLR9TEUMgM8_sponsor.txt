Curiosity Steam, so when you sign up with
my link in the description, you not only get their catalog of thousands of documentaries
- including this series on China - but also access to Nebula so you can watch many of
our videos ad-free along with exclusives. The annual subscription was an already affordable
$20 a year but now, with Nebula, it’s an exceptionally good deal. And, if you’re
quick, it’s just $12 for the holidays. When you sign up with my link, you’ll get a welcome
email with access to Nebula. Thanks to Curiosity Stream and to you for watching this video.
