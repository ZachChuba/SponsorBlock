things that allows anyone to transcend their money is the right budgeting tool basically no one is good with money until they have a clear look at exactly how they're spending what they're saving and what they could be doing better I am someone who used to be incredibly avoidant with my money I would literally avoid looking at my bank account statements I would make sure that I never hit like view balance when I went to the ATM I hated it because I knew that I was making a lot of decisions that if I looked at closely I would feel were really wrong I knew I was basically cheating myself out of the financial life that I deserved so several years ago before I even started TFT I downloaded mint onto my phone so I could start managing my finances putting together a budget and really understand exactly what my spending habits were and mint does everything from give you beautiful little breakdowns of all your different spending categories to sending you little reminders when you're going way over budget in a certain category which often was my case if you're someone who's been looking to get a hold of your money and wants to get started with the right tool I highly recommend you check out mint at the link
