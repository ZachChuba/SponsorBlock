hey are you going i hope you enjoyed the video and just real quick if you're wondering what that song was that was just playing that was actually one of the entries that someone submitted for the stimpy theme song competition in my discord so if you'd like to submit your own song i think there's still like a day left so you can jump in my discord and do that if you don't want to do that then you can listen to all the other submissions there's like 20 or 30 of them um and they're all actually surprisingly good i don't i was actually expecting a lot less anyway we'll be going through all the songs and picking a winner next time i stream and the winner actually wins a little bit of money and the next competition will be the best thumbnail so yeah maybe join my discord if you're talented
