glad I got to hear that in high quality thanks to these Rikon earbuds this video was sponsored by ray cotton high quality in affordable earbuds they're completely wireless which means they're the perfect solution for subtly ignoring all those annoying people you know their everyday e25 earbuds are noise isolating Bluetooth compatible and have a six hour playtime are they also come in a bunch of cool colors too I have a home gym and when I work out I like to listen to loud music and this means here that my neighbors get really upset where I run the risk of getting tangled up in a pair of white headphones so for me these little babies are literally a lifesaver but more Bali than that they're about half the price of other premium wireless earbuds on the market if you're interested in getting a pair for yourself go to buy rake on comm forward slash then beat for fifteen percent off your order
