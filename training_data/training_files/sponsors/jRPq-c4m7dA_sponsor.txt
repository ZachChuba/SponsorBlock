video I just want to say a quick thank you to today's video sponsor today's video is sponsored by bricks break request thanks for helping me afford my enamel pen order you can download the game using the link in my description box below bricks break requests is a free-to-play app in which you shoot balls at bricks in order to knock them out you start with a set amount of balls and after aiming you release them all at once each brick has a number on it which shows how many times it needs to be hit before it breaks and the goal of the game is to break all of them before they reach the bottom the game provides many different modes of gameplay including the normal level based mode classic endless mode and the 100-vault challenge it's easy and quick to pick up and play when you want to take a mental break and focus on something simple and fun it can be played with one hand on the go and on any phone or tablet device you can even track how well you're doing compared to others on the leaderboard as well as by earning achievements after I downloaded the game to be honest I kind of got lost in it for a while I kept telling myself that I'd play one more level and stop but that was kind of hard to do since it is a bit addictive so if you'd like to download it please again check the link in my description box below thanks again to Brix brake request for sponsoring
