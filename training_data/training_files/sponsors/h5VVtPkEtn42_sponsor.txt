have told you about my sponsor which is the Dollar Shave Club now the Dollar Shave Club is it's a service they they send you men's grooming products through the post and you get little parcels now I must admit that I have not been using a service like this possibly you can tell but I can say that my whole life I have used a not wildly dissimilar service which is that being British I am able to have milk fresh milk delivered to my door every day and do you know it's really nice you open the door and yeah there's your morning painter I guess someone's thinking of it now okay I know my true relationship with with my milkman which is not genetic it's a financial business relationship I understand that but even so it's nice someone has done that for me and I don't have to go out to the supermarket anything like as often as I otherwise would because milk is something you have to buy frequently and it's perishable and so forth so getting milk deliver this is nice and we like receiving stuff in the pinup in the poster now obviously if you don't like receiving parcels then a service like this is probably not for you but don't we like oh someone sent me a box of stuff and I'm not into the shorts in there it's a bit like opening a Christmas present or something there's a there's a little bit of excitement there so that's one of the reasons that you might want to use one of these services but the more perceptive of you and I would say the less perceptive of you and I would extend this to to those of middling perceptive abilities may all have drawn the same conclusion which is that I am not an obvious ambassador for a company that sells men's grooming products and I intimated this to them and they they persuaded me they said no you see you're a victim and that's what we need you're you're someone that life has just crushed and we could use you you you serve as a as a warning to the rest of humanity to the possibility of what you may end up like if you don't use our products and you serve as a sort of universal before picture doesn't matter what male grooming product we're trying to sell with you as the before picture you will serve I did actually see their point anyway so they've sent me a box and I'm contractually obliged to open it with you I've already slit the plastic bit so it comes open that's get rid of that and yes yes that's the smell I was expecting and I see I see a toothbrush which appears to be like a toothbrush and we need two brushes otherwise our teeth not always a clean and ah no this is ah yes they have favoured me cuz this this is no ordinary handle for a razor no no this I I see straightaway is the executive handle I'm not entirely sure what that means it doesn't have a smart suit on it's not carrying a briefcase and it's probably not going to give it give anyone in the orders but but it's an executive one which is got a bit of heft to it and some grippy rubber and yes and this must be yes these are the blades and this is called a cassette apparently you you get four months of them here oh and my goodness how many blades are we up to do you think it's actually so many they're difficult to count it's it's six we're up to six blades now so there you go for those of you who have used a smaller number of blades you may have found that sometimes your primary blade doesn't do the job in a bit of hair gets passed but then maybe your secondary blade gets it but sometimes it doesn't so then your tertiary blade comes into play but you know even the tertiary blades sometimes let you down so then of course on on other lesser razerheadz you've got your special contingency blade which comes into action but there's still not about 100 percent guaranteed to do the job so then comes the emergency backup blade well ladies and gentlemen I suppose mostly gentlemen although actually I'm told that only four million customers that Dollar Shave Club has had about twenty percent of them are women yes now if your first second third fourth and fifth blades all let you down the last resort blade on this will do the job probably what I don't know what the limits are I mean it's certain there are mostly limits of physics and engineering to the number of blades that they're actually practicable on ahead we're up to six now it seems maybe in years to come that people have just sort of a rack like a washboard do you some rub your face on it or something I don't know anyway seven tubes of stuff I have a tube of hydrating daily face cleanser which is citrus and Hawaiian ginger now hydrating is good of course because some people have a lot of trouble drinking water and so the only way they can get water into them is to rub it through their skin daily face cleanser I know what cleanser is that just means cleaner but it sounds better and date I don't actually have a daily face which is quite evident mine is weekly or even more of a monthly face but if you've got a daily face and it needs cleansing or cleaning presumably that'll do and an Hawaiian ginger is like ordinary ginger but with more vowels citrus doesn't say what sort of citrus mystery citrus oh nope it's great for chocolates my favorite and this one is okay I've read it three times now and I disappearing post-shave do our words that I've never seen in that order before disappearing it evaporates do that's that's water right post shape I understand what post shave is anyway it says for a light and soothing finish a lot well there you go so if you if you are someone who's in the habit of shaving and I imagine that most of my audience does not have beards then you may find that sometimes your your shave finish is too dark or too heavy in which case this will perhaps help here we have easy shave butter I'm a beginner to this sort of thing so I think it's appropriate they sent me the easy version I imagine that others of you will be able to order more advanced shave butter butter I've known again shave butter but anyway for us it's a for effortless delightful shaving delightful they go for some people I'm sure shaving is a hobby no delight so um that'll be good and I have the super bra no I have misread that it's super BA and oh it's toothpaste you know let's put the Handy size actually fit for travel in your Airport and so forth and it says peppermint kick so there you go superb ah for people with teeth that need a kick and here we have hydrating again which is which is good don't don't overdose on water kids hair and scalp shampoo which is sage and black pepper sage of black pepper as Moses huh I spot a masculine scent isn't it and I suppose in an emergency he could double his a cooking ingredient hair and scalp shampoo and is that is that different from normal shampoo have I been doing it wrong all these years is there such a thing as just scalp shampoo how do you use that without getting it on your hair that's be really tricky well just hair shampoo so you don't go all the way down to the scalp because then something will go horribly wrong I don't know but this one does hair and thank goodness scalp and then there's this which is a mandatory prep scrub so there you go this one's not optional it's it's mandatory and properly prepare for shave greatness it says okay I'll do that and here we have more hydrating my goodness I'm gonna be so hydrated it's coming just flowing out of me body cleanser which is calming amber and lavender calming amber calming amber is amber even a smell does amber smell or some other thing and while Brazil II there's they have quite a wide range of products presumably if you want their panic-inducing amber you can get that too so there you go now if you go to www.hsn.com or US dollars if you're American and some near equivalent if you're from one of the other countries that they serve which is Australia Britain and Canada but no British forces supposed to overseas yet I'm afraid sorry chaps but they're working on it anyway so you can there's an offer and yes in in time I will of course give this a go but not right now because if
