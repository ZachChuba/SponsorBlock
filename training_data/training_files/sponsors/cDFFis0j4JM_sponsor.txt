One of the scientists who fled Germany in the 1930's was none other than Albert Einstein. Our sponsor for today, "Brilliant", allows you to master the kind of problem-solving and logic that would have been familiar to Einstein himself. Jumping into science, math, and physics sounds like an extremely daunting task, especially for an armchair historian like yourself, but "Brilliant" allows you to learn these concepts through fun bite-sized problems. In all of "Brilliant's" lessons they're both visuals and thorough explanations. If you're currently a student or just a lifelong learner, we highly recommend you start your free trial at "brilliant.org/armchairhistorian". The first seventy-six users, the amount of years that Einstein was around, will get twenty percent off of their first annual subscription. So, please support our channel by signing up today.
