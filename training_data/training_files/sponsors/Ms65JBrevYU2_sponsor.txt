I want to be able to show you
the videos when I make them. And I don't want any
algorithm in between you or I. So here's what I would propose. Please
consider going to smartereveryday.com. And I'm going to, I've got an email
list there. I've already made it, but this is the first
time I've announced it. So if you consider going to smartereveryday.com, 
clicking on the email list, I will literally email you when I
upload a video and I will keep you up to date on all the latest
worm news and Alabama. I mean, you know what I'm trying to say! I want
to explore the world in a curious way. And I want to show you what I'm learning
because that's what smarter every day is for me. So THANK YOU also to the
Patrons. I should've sent you a baseballs. If you're a patron, if not,
I'm still sending baseball. So if you'd like to be a
patron at smartereveryday.com, No!     Patreon.com/smartereveryday, I'll send you a baseball and like thank
you for pitching in and making this happen! But I realized that not everybody is
willing to pitch in financially to support a channel like this. So that's
the purpose of the email list. If you want to go back to internet
1.0 with me and let's just do this, the old school way, I will email you when I make a video and
there will be no algorithms in between you or I and we're going to do this
brute force and it's going to be awesome. So if you're in.. THANK YOU. I will leave a link down in
the description of this video, go right to the email list and verify
your email address and feel free to unsubscribe anytime. But
anyway, internet 1.0, me and you just going to explore the
world, using science and have fun. I am grateful for you. Thank you for considering support via 
Patreon and also thank you for considering
