question have you ever wondered what you would do if you found yourself in the middle of a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a deadly virus great news escape the invasion is for you escape the invasion is essentially an at-home escape room except exceptionally more immersive basically each month you get a cool box like this in the mail and it's full of a bunch of codes and clues that you need to decipher a break to complete that month's assignment personally I played it last night and yeah it's basically an at-home escape room but while I love escape rooms I always just roll my eyes but never to get to the part where they're telling you the lore around whatever you're breaking out of or rescuing it's just like let me get in and solve the puzzles already but this is very different for this the lore is very important you need to understand the story and the characters in order to break the clues in advance in the game which for me as a whole new layer of fun and if that sounds like fun to you too you can head over to escape the invasion calm slash SCB to get 20% off your first month again let us escape invasion calm /sc be 20% off your first month find out if you can it survive the alien apocalypse link in the description down
