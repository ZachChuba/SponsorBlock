Whether it's on your phone, laptop or smart tv,    there are endless 
opportunities for an educational distraction via the thousands of documentaries available on CuriosityStream.  History, science, nature, travel,   all of my favorite things in one place.  My mom actually 
bought my dad a subscription for his birthday, so with Christmas coming up maybe that's a good gift 
you could give someone.  You can sign up using the link in the description below, and if you use the code ‘TASTINGHISTORY’     
 you get an entire year for just $14.99.
