This video is brought
to you by one of our favorite places to
watch movies, MUBI. MUBI is a treasure
trove of films. Everyday, MUBI
premieres a new film, whether its a movie
you’ve been dying to see or one you’ve
never heard of before— there’s always something
new to discover. So in this world
where it’s very easy to spend hours
debating what you should watch, MUBI
is like having a really cool friend with amazing
taste in movies making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to
come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings,
influential art house and foreign films,
lesser known films by your favorite famous
directors, and more. Plus, you can even
download the films to watch offline and
there are no ads, ever. One movie you can
check out right now on MUBI is
L’enfant secret. This haunting melodrama
meditates on the obstacles of an unstable
relationship, borrowing biographical
