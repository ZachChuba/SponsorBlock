And once you build your dream budget PC and
install your game store of choice the next thing you should get is Dashlane, this video's sponsor. Dashlane is a mobile and desktop app that
gives you a shortcut for everything you do online. It fills forms fast with one-click logins
& autofill for personal info and payment details. It auto log ins you into websites and services
using a safe password. It Responds easily to breaches and hacks with
personalized security alerts. It has a built-in VPN lets you access the
content you want when you want it, or you just don't want your internet provider to
know each website you go to. It Works everywhere on every device, across
Mac, Windows, iPhone, or Android. And it syncs between devices! Passwords and personal data are locally encrypted
and not even Dashlane can access it. Definitely better than solutions like Login
with Facebook which... seriously, at this point does this need an
explanation? Honestly, I have Dashlane installed on basically
any PC I personally use and it has been instrumental both on making my life easier with my growing
number of accounts and passwords and the growing number of data leaks that come as a result. Here's the good news. If you go to dashlane.com/lowspecgamer you
can test this yourself with a FREE 30-day trial of Dashlane Premium, where they can
see these features in action and if you like it, you can then use the coupon "lowspecgamer"
at checkout for a 10% off discount. Thank you to them for sponsoring the video
and supporting the channel for this long and
