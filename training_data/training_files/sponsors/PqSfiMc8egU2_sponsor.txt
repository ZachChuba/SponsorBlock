ending—no, no, come on that’s just insensitive. But you know what’s not insensitive—Skillshare’s
Cultural Diversity Sensitivity Training For Trainers course that teaches you how to conduct
a Cultural Diversity Sensitivity seminar. Now, granted, the number of you who are HR
professionals that need to learn this skill is probably low, but this just goes to prove
how niche the classes that Skillshare has can be. With over 21,000 classes, they almost certainly
have one on what you want to learn whether that be nighttime photography, creative nonfiction
writing, or motion graphics taught by the senior motion graphics designer of Kurzgesagt. What’s best, you can get access to all these
21,000 classes for free for two months at https://skl.sh/hai11 and you’ll be supporting
the show while you’re at it.
