i'm going to show you how after a quick word from this video sponsor ming river baijiu we just cooked up an authentic sichuan dish and bringing the authentic flavor of sichuan to you is what ming river baijo is all about following some century-old traditional techniques to this day but that is not where they stop because combining tradition with new approaches is something they're very passionate about best example their original baijo cocktails for this episode i tried a drink called pear in red where we mix ming river baijo with dark rum red vermouth and pear juice i like my drinks pretty cold so after a good icy shake this drink was right where i wanted it to be it's strong but it's good i do like how the flavor of the pear plays with the exotic tropical notes of ming river it's an unexpected but pretty good match if you guys want to get to know the super unique flavor of the original sichuan baijiu in a cocktail or just as is ming river baijo is certainly the way to go and it's available in the united states united kingdom and europe check out the link in the video description to find out how to get your hands on the good stuff
