On behalf of everyone here at MinuteEarth,
I just want to send out a big thanks to audible for supporting our channel. Audible.com is the leading provider of audiobooks
with more than 180,000 downloadable titles across all types of literature, including
fiction, non-fiction and periodicals. Right now, Audible is offering a free 30 day
trial for MinuteEarthlings – just go to audible.com/minuteearth to sign up, then download
a title for free and start listening. And if you don't know what you want to listen
to first, I'd recomment The Poisoner's Handbook by Deborah Blum – it's a fascinating history
of famous poisons and poisoners, and the first forensic scientists working to detect and
track them. Again, that's audible.com/minuteearth for
your free 30-day trial. Thanks Audible!
