Speaking of bad, it would be bad if you guys didn't check out our sponsor here at Computex 2018, LastPass With LastPass, all your passwords can be stored conveniently in your vault where they can be accessed on any device from anywhere in the world and even shared with people This is something that has come in handy for me a lot of times while I've been traveling and LastPass stores more than just passwords You could store your passport number so that you can quickly jot that into the website when you're trying to check in for a flight, for example It can store your social security number or your children's care card numbers so you don't have to carry around cards that are not only expensive to replace, but also a huge potential problem if they get into the hands of ne'er-do-wells Or even things like credit card numbers for something like the business credit card that you would never actually carry around but you might have to use from time to time Check out LastPass, you can try it out for free.
