If you're interested in
getting a firmer grasp on some of the concepts
we talked about today I would highly recommend a course by today's sponsor on Classical Mechanics. This interactive course by brilliant.org features a quiz on an alternative model to Newtonian mechanics
called Lagrangian Mechanics, which is based on the
same system of thought as the Principle of Least
Action we learnt about today. You'll learn when it's useful
to apply this mode of thinking and how in some situations you can make mathematical
calculations much simpler and more intuitive as well as just learning a different way to think about things which is always a valuable thing to do. Richard Feynman said he
would try to think of at least six different ways to think about a physical concept and that seemed to get him pretty far. Brilliant methodology is to learn by doing which as someone who
completed a physics degree having not taken any
sciences in high school I can say that's really
the only way to do it. It's free to sign up, but
