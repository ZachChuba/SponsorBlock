And if looking at all these pictures is making
you wish you were better at illustrating, well, there’s a Skillshare class for that! It’s about mastering the basics of Adobe
Illustrator and is taught by an artist named Julian Burford. He won’t teach you how to illustrate crocs, but he will teach you all the basics you need
to get started. Once you’re done, you could also check out
one of Skillshare’s other classes. They have more than 25,000 of them, and with
a Premium Membership, you can get unlimited access to them all. Skillshare is a great way to learn new skills
as a creator, and it’s also really affordable at less
than ten dollars a month. The SciShow team actually uses it all the
time! You can join us, and more than seven million
other creators, by checking out the link in the description. The first five hundred people to use that
link will get a two-month trial for free!
