Before we go on,
we have some exciting news. We’re now creating stories on Amino. We’ve been wanting to experiment
for a while with fun new formats
and shorter content. So we’ve decided to partner
with Amino to do this. Because stories on Amino are different
from stories anywhere else. They’re still fun and quick
but they don’t disappear. You can search anytime to find stories
on all your favorite topics. So to kick off, we’ve made two really fun
video essay style quizzes on Stranger Things. First, find out which Stranger Things
kid are you and then prove your pop culture expert chops by seeing
how many of the show’s homages you can catch. Here’s how to watch. Click the link in our description Or search for Amino Apps
to download Amino. Then search for The Take. Every time you watch a story
you’re supporting us. We’re going to be playing around
with a variety of short topics.
