explain a sport I don't truly understand. If you'd like to help with Smarter Every Day and help me do crazy stuff like this, you can support the sponsor which is audible.com. Go to audible.com/smarter you can get a free audio book. They've got thousands to choose from, get whatever you want. You can do a free trial, free book free trial, you can download it and listen to it and if you don't like it you can return it and get another one. It's a pretty good deal. Anyway, I used it long before they asked to sponsor Smarter Every Day so I'm more than happy to suggest it to you. audible.com/smarter I get credit for you checking out Audible, and it helps Smarter Every Day move forward and do more crazy stuff. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.
