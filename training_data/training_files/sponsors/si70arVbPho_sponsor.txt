most favorite mobile gaming apps best things you guys actually might remember that last year I did a makeup tutorial for one of the characters from the game I did one of the evil slugs and add an absolute laugh doing it such a fun makeup so as you can imagine when they asked me if I'd like to do another makeup tutorial based on their latest Halloween update I of course said hell yeah so hence why I look like this one of the most classic classic Halloween characters and I cannot believe I've yet to do it so I'll quickly sum up the game if you haven't played it before best fiends is basically a puzzle solving game that you can download for free on the App Store you don't even need an internet connection for it's fabulous the objective of the game is basically to match several awesome objects like these special effects to make lots of different fantastic combos and every time you complete a level you get a chance to collect and evolve your characters and by doing that you pair them up so they can defeat the slugs it's incredibly addictive and this month best things are doing their biggest holiday update that they've ever done it's a massive Halloween update we get to play to win warmth including a new character and it's exactly this update that's the very reason for my monster II green facade spooky so I'll pop some of the actual gameplay on the screen now just you get to see what it's like firsthand [Music] so the idea as I said is to match as many and young though did you do it levels like new characters to get spectrum very challenging and each time you do an attack here has this guy yeah every now and again you get fantastic move like this and swapper satisfying [Music] hey other stuff another for ages you guys my lucky charm yeah so pop all the information about the game in the description bar below just in case you wanted to check out actually there's a point if you did download the game using the link below you'll actually get five dollars worth of gold and diamonds for free so that's pretty fantastic definitely let me know in the comments below what level you guys run if you're playing along with me because I'm currently up to level 76 and it's getting incredibly challenging and I love that so thank you again best fiends
