This video was made with the support of the
Heising-Simons Foundation, which also supports research in precision measurement of the strength
of gravity at short distances. These experiments are super cool, because
theyâ€™re small, simple, clever, and are testing our fundamental understanding of physics without
the need for giant multi-billion-dollar particle accelerators. Thanks again to the Heising-Simons Foundation
for supporting MinutePhysics, and for supporting fundamental physics research.
