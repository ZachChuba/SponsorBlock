And of course I wanna give
a huge thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. Squarespace is the best
way to build a website. I've used it for a bunch
of my different projects like the book that I'm writing
over at realoriginsbook.com. Or my personal website that
has a lot of my face on it. They've got these beautiful
templates that are also highly customizable so
you can personalize it and make it stand out. And in fact, just this year
they added eight new templates to really get your creative juices flowing for whatever project
that you're working on. And just because Squarespace
loves you wonderful nerds they're gonna help you
get started right away even easier, even faster. Just head on over to Squarespace.com to start your free trial. You can start playing
around and experimenting, building your site, and when you're ready to checkout go to Squarespace.com/NerdSync
and save 10% off your first purchase of

launch your new business, go out there and make it and
get started with Squarespace.
