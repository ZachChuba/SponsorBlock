Speaking of exciting things… This episode has a President of Space! It’s Joshua Furman, who’s one of our patrons
on Patreon. So, thanks, Joshua! We’re glad to have you. And we’re grateful for all our patrons,
too. They make up an awesome community, and thanks
to them, we can keep releasing SciShow episodes every day of the week. If you want to learn more about becoming a
patron — maybe even our next President of Space — you can go to patreon.com/scishow.
