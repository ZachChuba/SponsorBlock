We could not have made this trip without the
help of Brilliant, so if you would like to see more videos like this please check them
out. If you have an interest in this kind of design,
I would highly recommend you take this course on classical mechanics, which will form the
bedrock of understanding for you to start applying physics, like figuring how much batteries
to include for a drone design. This is just one of many courses on Brilliant,
with more courses due to released soon on things like automotive engineering and Python
Coding. If I have inspired you and you want to educate
yourself, then go to brilliant.org/RealEngineering and sign up for free.And the first 73 people
