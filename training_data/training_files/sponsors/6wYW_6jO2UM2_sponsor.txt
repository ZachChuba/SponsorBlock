Guys, honestly, take it from me, I am about done with trying to code my own websites. It's a little too hard for my brain. So I would suggest going to Squarespace. Squarespace has tons of beautiful templates. They will literally have you up in running in minutes and you don't have to know a single line of code. Sign up. Type in all of your information. Pick a template, and you're done. Now you've got a beautiful website or blog like you've always wanted. Plus if you go to squarespace.com/cow, you're gonna get 10% off your first purchase. Plus, if you sign up for one year, you're going to get a free custom domain. So if you've ever wanted to start a website or blog, go to squarespace.com/cow.
