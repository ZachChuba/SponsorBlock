But first thank you to the sponsor of this video Skillshare. As I pursue my dream of both writing and illustrating books I've realized I need creative help and skill share is just that. Whether you want to try a creative hobby, pursue a career, or learn a new skill, this is the perfect place. Reading books is great and all for inspiration but I found this really amazing class on Skillshare by Daniel older. It's called 'Storytelling 101: Character, Conflict, Context and Craft.' and I was super into it. He has a very energetic way of teaching and I found myself writing over a page of notes on how to write better. He was mesmerizing and I learned a lot. Skill share is super affordable at less than $10 a month. You could not only master a new skill but also support a passion creator like ourselves.
