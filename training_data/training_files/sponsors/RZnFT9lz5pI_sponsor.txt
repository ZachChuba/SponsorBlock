And today I want to talk to you about
one of our favorite places to watch movies, Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove of films
From around the globe. Every day, a new film is added
and the oldest is taken away. So in this world where it’s very easy
to spend hours debating what you watch, Mubi is having a really cool friend
with amazing taste in movies, making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings, influential arthouse and foreign films, lesser known films by your
favorite directors, and more. Plus, you can even download
the films to watch offline. And there are no ads, ever. Right now on Mubi, you can check out
the Adieu Agnès Varda series, a tribute to the beloved
French New Wave filmmaker who recently passed away. One film in the series is
Jacquot de Nantes, Varda’s touching tribute to her husband,
director Jacques Demy. It recreates Demy’s childhood
and adolescence as he discovers his love of cinema. We can’t recommend
Mubi highly enough. You can try it out now for free
for a whole month.
