So, like I said earlier one of the reason I set
the studio up this way was to reduce the friction involved in creating things as much as possible. And when I'm actually
sitting down at the computer, one of the other tools I
use that really reduces the friction in my life is dashlane. Dashlane is a tool that gives me a ton of shortcuts for what I need to do online. It automatically logs me into websites, and even autofills long forms. And it works on every
single platform that I use. Works on my PC, works on my Mac, works on every single
one of my IOS devices when I'm on the go. And if I were an Android user, it would work there as well. Dashlane essentially gives me a convenient and secure place to store and access my passwords, my form data, and even payment information so I don't have to go
hunting for my credit card or build some sort of memory palace every time I want to buy something. And that helps me spend
more time doing the work that I want to do. So, if you want to give Dashlane a try for yourself go over to dashlane.com/collegeinfogeek and sign up to get a free thirty day trial of dashlane premium where you could try all the
features out for yourself. And if you do like it you can also use the code college info geek once you upgrade to a paid subscription to get ten percent off and to support my channel. Big thanks, as always, to Dashlane for sponsoring this episode
