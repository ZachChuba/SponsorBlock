of those are a little bit their feminine yes there we go staring at your monitor all day can be hard on your eyes and also make it tougher to fall asleep that's the the latter note on that is my least favorite part spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at your computer screen or phone actually as well using a software solution like f.lux and Twilight will not give you the same type of filtering that these glasses do features include that they're stylish you might not like these on me because I'm a very weird fit for glasses but I think James looks better in those ones and if I had different ones they might look better or you do like these on me who knows they're also nice quality and have a one-year warranty which is which is good we've had these for over a year now I think oh yeah and they look brand new so yeah there I like how flexible and light these puppies are boom they have low color Distortion they block high-energy blue light while keeping colors as similar as possible so yeah that is a thing any of these glasses will have a very minor amount of color change and it is this is pretty minor a little bit noticeable but it is very minor I've had two other ones that are a lot worse I will tell you that much they're primarily focused around Canadian US markets but they are working on expanding into Europe and they do offer shipping internationally
