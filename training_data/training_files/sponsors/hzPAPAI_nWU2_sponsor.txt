Well I'm off, I'll be back in a couple days. What? Where are you going? I'm going to Japan. Anime. What those like Japanese cartoons? Have you? I know what anime is. Owen why are you going to Japan? Well because they have stuff on 
Netflix that we don't have here. I can't get it here. You kidding me? What? Just install NORDvpn on whatever 
device you're using for streaming. Whether it's a computer, your phone, or a laptop. What's a vpn? Is that some type of like 
animated streaming service I've never heard of? It's a vpn, a virtual private network. It's super simple. One click that's all. Open the map click on a location 
and you'll be connected in seconds. It's that easy! You'll have access to all the Netflix content   available in Japan or in over 50 
countries without leaving home! Damn. I already got a ticket though, is it 
fast because I hate chunky video... It's the fastest vpn out there and it also 
offers a cool anti-malware tool called cybersec. You can be in Japan on your phone while 
you're on the bus on your way home while even protecting yourself from hackers   and bad people trying to read 
your sensitive information. I heard the wi-fi on those buses aren't so 
safe man and that goes for you guys too! Visit NORDvpn using my link below
