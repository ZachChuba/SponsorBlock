I'm often asked how I make
the animations for my videos, and the answer is that I
use Adobe After Effects. For anyone wanting to learn to animate, skillshare.com is a learning website where you can watch video tutorials on just about anything. But they happen to have a
pretty awesome collection of animation tutorials. For beginners I recommend this course, on how to learn After
Effects in two hours. And for anyone who
follows me on Instagram, you know I've gotten
weirdly into cupcakes lately and I can't wait to go to town on some of these baking tutorials. These are just a couple of types of causes of literally thousands. So if you're thinking about signing up Skillshare is offering a special promotion to my viewers. The first 500 people to sign up will get their first two months free. Just sign up using this link which I've put in the description.
