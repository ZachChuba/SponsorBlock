heard of magically let's do ad spots really quick let's jump in boss organizer well put up any one of those I'm gonna give you this one I like this one better one thing I really really like about that one that I bring up every single time they sponsor the show and I think it's the same with all their bags yes it is really bright orange inside I haven't even read what I'm supposed to say yet I just want to bring this up super bright reflective orange insides really cool it looks even more contrasting black at the bottom here you can see the bottom every bag should have that yes yeah it's amazing there's no more like oh I can't find this like black pen in the bottom my bag cuz my bullet the entire inside of my bag is all black and I can't see blacking it's black very well so even have the the black pack but on the inside it's bright orange so you can find things really easily I love it it's so wonderful and it's like slightly reflective so it bounces light around really nicely so you can eat things see things really well anyways here's the animal put an lzt logo on that it would toll mash the color scheme just saying we should get patches that people can sew on stuff we should just get a bag the moss we should we should take this offline but I love that idea I mean I think of a clever name that puts it yeah Moss Moss tips I don't know whatever Moss organizer keeps you protected and organized by making simple products with really cool features I'm heading that little bit in myself the moss backpacks are great for traveling to and from work or internationally while keeping all your electronics safe Moss packing grande this is the black pack is this grande it looks bigger it does look bigger I'm not sure though but moss pack grande fits up to 17 inch laptop this looks like it would fit some teachers laptop I'm not sure the black pack fits laptops up to fifteen point six inches made of sixteen ATD ballistic nylon it feels pretty bullets that's the cool to be honest that makes it tear and abrasion resistant yeah feels like Morgan Freeman that sucker will stop a knife zippers are good too they feel like it one thing that I don't like about a lot of zippers is when they'll get stuck to the side you know what I mean I mean you have to like mess with it and readjust it so you can get it in line so you can pull it properly I have that problem on some rain shells yeah or I have to like go like this sideways and stuff yeah oh I mean like when you're trying to zip it up and it gets stuck sideways oh yeah and you have to like rotate it around and get it to these don't have that problem at all happen I love it it's great the built-in rain fly on the black pack provides extra padding for your electronics when not in use it comes out of the bottom Oh so if you like clunk your bag down and you're not a 12-ounce on the otherwise so I used to use a cover for my backpack when I was going to school because I wouldn't your shopping bag yeah so it was much less elegant but these are actually really smart I used to bike to school so a lot of rain would wake up on to my bag and my what I believe was a garbage bag would keep it clean but I'd have to keep swapping out because it was a freaking garbage bag so if you have this it's probably better off internal mounting for reach see and reach plus power adapters also has a five-year warranty check it out
