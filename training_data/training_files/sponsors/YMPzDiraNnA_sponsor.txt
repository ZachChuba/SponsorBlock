And when I am traveling I like to listen to
them as audio books, because it is just more convenient on planes and trains. And there is actually one I wanted to recommend
to you. It is called Predictably Irrational by Dan
Ariely. It is about how humans donâ€™t really behave
rationally even when we think that is what we are doing. So it provides pretty good insight into how
your brain works and how the brains of everyone around you work. And if you want, you can download this book
for free by going to Audible.com/Veritasium or you can pick any other book of your choosing
for a one month free trial. Audible is a great audio book website with
over 180,000 titles in all areas of literature including fiction, non fiction and periodicals. So you should definitely check them out. I want to thank Audible for supporting me
and I want to thank you for watching.
