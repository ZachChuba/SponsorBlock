We want to give a huge thank you to today’s
sponsor - CuriosityStream. We know you love to learn just as much as
we do, and there’s no better place to get the highest quality documentaries and non-fiction
titles than on the streaming service created for those with a lifelong quest to learn,
explore, and understand. We just watched “How to Build a Castle”
and not only did we learn a ton, now we’re ready to build one of our own! With thousands of videos across science, nature,
history, and more, you’ll never run out of new topics to explore. You can get unlimited access for just $2.99
a month or $19.99 a year, and for viewers of The Infographics Show, the first 30-days
are completely free if you sign up at curiositystream.com/infographics and use the code ‘infographics’.
