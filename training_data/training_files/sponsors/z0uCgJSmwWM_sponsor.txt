rest of the show today I gotta tell you about one of our fantastic sponsors this one this episode it's brought to you by blinka stealing kisses an app I'm gonna bring up this app I apologize if my phone gets interference while we do this sometimes happens but there's not really anything I can do about that I could turn on to airplane mode but then I don't know if I've got the audio and stuff downloaded but blinka it's basically an app which I've just opened up on here uh this is particularly fantastic for me I'm a pretty busy dude I'm making podcasts I'm making videos all the time you know I I love reading I really do but I just don't find the amount of time that I would like so blink astiz fantastic because what they've got is they've got thousands of books in here nonfiction books that you can get what they call blinks from and basically they compress the book into either a 15-minute less listen or like a 15-minute read and and they've divided it into individual blinks so I recently was on holiday and I was actually getting some reading done and I read the books ap inspire I was the chaps name Harare and I like using this to go back and have like a Rica over it so in here you know one of these blinks it's like although not the first humans Homo sapiens came to replace all other human species on earth and then it just kind of continues like that and it really compresses it down and on also if you're like oh I really like reading you can just click this button and little bit like let's turn their luck yeah there we go why would I read when I can listen yes I blink Asst definitely go to blinkers comm port / brain food you will get a week to try it out if you're on a hundred people the first hundred people you'll also get 25% off if you want to go full membership and honestly I think you probably will it's it's a great deal it's a great way to consume content it's a great way to whether you're recapping something you've read before or just discovering something new blink is calm forward / brain foods just go do it sports the show as well which
