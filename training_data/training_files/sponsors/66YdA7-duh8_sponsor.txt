and share with you guys my favorite shopping app which is called shop tagger I've saved so much money and scored many deals with this amazing mobile and web app all I have to do to download this app is sign up with your email address then download the button to your web browser and that's it from here you can go to your favorite stores they have so many to choose from and of course I had to go to G gallery because it's also one of my favorite stores I've been wanting many things from this site but of course I don't want to pay full price so when I see what I want I press the shop tagger button to my right and it instantly saves to my shop tiger cart another way to save an item to your cart is by clicking the button on your web browser and you can choose what percentage you want to be notified when it goes on sale or comes back in stock with shop tagger in my life now I can say what I want and put the items in two different categories to help me stay organized with my shopping I can make any list for example gives Beauty home decor fashion before I knew of shop tiger I would check the items unwanted on the daily to see if they were on sale they never wore so it was a waste of time I love shopping smart and I really like how they also include coupons ready to be used I will leave the link to download shop Targa in my description box I'm telling you guys you will love it just as much as I do thank you so much shop tiger for sponsoring this video now let's go ahead
