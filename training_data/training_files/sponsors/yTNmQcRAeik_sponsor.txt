If there is something I want to change about
myself in 2020 is how much I learn on a daily basis. Between working, managing a business and trying
to conciliate family life with some well-deserved self-care, sometimes there isn't enough time
in the day dedicated to education. That's why it's much easier to rely on platforms
that allow us to watch interesting content during other busier tasks and for that you
have a great combo which is CuriosityStream and Nebula. CuriosityStream has thousands of documentaries
that you can watch on-the-go and when you sign up you also get access to Nebula - a
platform made by video creators, myself included, where we are able to share our content without
YouTube's restrictive policies. Signing up for Nebula allows you to access
a curated library of ad-free educational videos, watch awesome shows you can't find anywhere
else and help support independent creators on making content that is useful and interesting
instead of having to cater to YouTube's algorithm. Sign up using the promo code "study corner"
or click the link in the description box to have your free 30-day membership and start
learning today.
