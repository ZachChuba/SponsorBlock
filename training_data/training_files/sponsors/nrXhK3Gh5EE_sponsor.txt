A big thank you to Brilliant.org
for supporting PBS. You just sat through an entire video about the fundamental building
blocks of the universe so here's more fundamentals for you. Brilliant.org has over
50 interactive courses on computer science,
fundamentals, math fundamentals, and many other subjects like
probability and relativity. Say you took Brilliant's
scientific thinking course, you would develop a solid
foundation of physics while playing with puzzles because becoming good at math and science doesn't have to be a dull experience. Brilliant has a website and an app, and takes a hands-on approach. It's built for curious people like us who want to get better at problem solving and understanding the world. To learn more, go to
