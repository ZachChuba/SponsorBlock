I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video Nord VPN have you ever been using Wi-Fi in a public place regardless of if it's on your phone or your computer your data could be at risk you just never know who's watching on public Internet but with Nord VPN your date is actually encrypted and it doesn't even slow your connection down because they have over 5500 high quality servers it's a great product to protect your sensitive information but I think the most important thing about Nord VPN when it comes to runescape is protecting you from DDoS attacks there are lots of phishing links out there whose sole purpose is to get your IP address too then for example DDoS you off the servers when you're in the middle of a state nor VPN masks your IP address making personal DDoS attacks impossible so if you click the link in the description or use the code sir plugger you get 70% off including a free month
