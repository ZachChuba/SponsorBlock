Now if you really hate silence, you should
always carry an audio book around with you. And I can recommend a good one: The Fault
in our Stars by my friend John Green. It is an excellent book and it has been basically
the talk of the best sellers ever since it was released. And soon there is a movie coming
out and so you probably want to get through the book before you go and see the movie.
Now you can download this book for free by going to Audible.com/Veritasium. Or you could
pick any other book of your choosing for a one month free trial. Audible is an amazing
site with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature including fiction, non-fiction,
and periodicals. So you should check them out. The link is in the doobly-doo, as John
would say. So I would like to thank Audible for supporting
me and I would like to thank you for watching.
