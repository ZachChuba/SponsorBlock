: this battery pack is crazy small and light
– it’s basically eight of these with some clever circuitry – and it has enough
energy to charge a smartphone 10 times, which is equivalent to running this LED lightbulb
for 10 hours. The makers of this ridiculous battery pack,
Anker, are sponsoring this video and also running a ridiculous contest where they’re
giving away ten prizes of two thousand dollars plus one of their battery packs – they’re
asking for video submissions about a time that running out of power was awkward or unpleasant
– you know, like how Apollo 13 almost ran out of batteries, or how I only made it halfway
through mowing the lawn last week. You can find out more about Anker’s batteries
and the contest by going to the links in the video description. And one aspect of batteries I haven’t mentioned
at all yet is power delivery - aka, how quickly they can charge your devices – this battery
pack is smart enough to detect what you’ve got plugged in in order to optimize charging
time. And of course don’t forget to check out
Brian’s video about whether or not it’s even possible to make enough batteries to
power the planet.
