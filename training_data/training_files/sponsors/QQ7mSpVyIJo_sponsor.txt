Speaking of pigeons, they brought me this message from our sponsor, on my phone somehow. Brilliant's mission is to help people achieve their learning goals. So whether you're a student,
a professional brushing up, or learning cutting edge topics, or someone who just plain wants to understand the world better, you should check out Brilliant. You can set a goal to improve yourself a little bit everyday, and Brilliant makes it easy with interactive explorations and a mobile app that
you can use on the go. Check out their Calculus
in a Nutshell course where Brilliant uses visual
and physical intuition to present the major pillars of calculus, the language of change used by ecologists, urban planners, physicists, and economists to describe our world. Brilliant's thought-provoking
math, science, and computer science content
helps guide you to mastery by taking complex concepts
and breaking them down into bite-sized, understandable chunks. The first 200 of you who head
