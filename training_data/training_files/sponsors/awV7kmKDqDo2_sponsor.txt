though, do this: get all your people a Skillshare
account. Doing so will let them learn what they want to learn wherever, whenever from
over 22,000 classes. Whether it be how to structure a story in a novel, the best way
to use Facebook advertising, how to brew an amazing cup of coffee, or almost anything
else, Skillshare has a class on it. For any aspiring YouTuber, I particular recommend
the beginner course by Evan from the channel PolyMatter on, “How to Make an Animated
YouTube Video.” No matter what you want to learn, you can do so for free for two months
