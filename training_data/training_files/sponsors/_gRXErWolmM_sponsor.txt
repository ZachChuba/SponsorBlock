This episode of Really Weird History is brought
to you by Brilliant. Brilliant is a problem-solving website dedicated

can help by proving you with fun and challenging Math and Science problems that will develop
your critical reasoning, and improve your intuition by teaching you practical techniques
you can use in your every day life. Whether you're in grade school or college,
