Right now there are tons of interesting uses
for these mini PCs. For example, in the Airbnb where I was staying
during my short time in London there was no like smart TV or anything that could read media of any kind, so I used some of the Pis that I got for this video simply as media consumption device sand
my favourite background media to have there were some of the excellent documentaries on
Curiosity Streamâ€¦ Such as Catalyst, a look into what the heck
is Quantum Computers and why they matter or Cyber War, a nice long documentary on the
dark world of hacking, vulnerabilities and the effect the general lack of proper cybersecurity
is causing. Curiosity Stream is an online streaming service
from the founder of the discovery channel with over 2,400 high-quality documentaries and
generally interesting content. Available via browser or app which works on
Raspberry Pi or even on a really cheap phone. They have free content for you to get started
and their unlimited access starts at like $3 a month which is a pretty low price to
improve your media diet. And if you use the link in the description
or the code lowspecgamer your first 30 days are free. Their support has been invaluable for keeping
this channel going so be sure to show them some love.
