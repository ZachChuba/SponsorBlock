Fasthosts are a British web host who've been
in the business for twenty years and host more than a million domains. They're offering viewers from the UK the chance
to win a trip to SXSW 2020 in Austin, Texas,
including flights and accomodation. To enter the draw, you need to answer this
techie-test question that I've written: this JavaScript code is meant to simulate
a coin flip, but it's not working properly. Where's the bug? There's one big error that means it's only
returning heads. If you reckon you know, click the link in the description and you
could be off to SXSW. All the terms and conditions are over on
Fasthosts' web site. Good luck!
