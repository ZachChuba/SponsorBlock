sponsorship and collaboration our sponsor is March of Empires which is a free-to-play mass multiplayer strategy game available on iOS Android and Windows the game is historical based and actually allows you to choose which type of culture leader you can play as such as a northern Czar Highland king or desert Sultan each of these come with their own unique benefits and artwork which is really awesome you can see how it looks here I went for the Czar because it's got a cavalry bonus and I'm a big fan of cavalry the one thing I did notice about the game is just the sheer amount you can do with it there's a lot of customization so if you're a fan of these types of games you shouldn't have a problem getting into it another thing I really liked was the gigantic map that's got loads of different castles and cities so if this is something you think you might be interested in go ahead and download it most importantly it's a free app you can find the link in the description below the people over at Gameloft are really helping this channel out with the sponsorship so let's show
