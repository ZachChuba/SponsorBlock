about climate change, or want to take action yourself, then I strongly encourage you to go watch the upcoming film, "An Inconvenient Sequel". Watching the film is taking action, and it goes into far more depth than I ever could in a short YouTube video. The film will be released in New York and Los Angles on July 28th and will be released nation-wide on August 4th. Please go to the description below for more detail. Be inconvenient. *Narrator in trailer talking about global warming*
