But first I'd like to say thanks to our sponsors over a banknote world. I Always say that everyone should have at least one hobby whether that be indoors or outdoors One problem with most hobbies however is the cost and so a better place to start for history buffs Than with collecting inexpensive currency from all around the globe. Our friends at banknote world actually sent me some Chinese and Japanese currency from 1944 to go with the theme of this video This Japanese currency here only costs you about five US dollars and so getting started is extremely easy You can check out our unique link to their website and YouTube channel and the description below
