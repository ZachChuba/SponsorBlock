raid well guys welcome to the bonus segment of this video this video this part the video is sponsored by boss of studios where I'm gonna be showing you some footage from the game I am fish and this is the whole game guys you're just a fish in the ocean and all you do is just swim repeatedly towards the light you're completely free look at this it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful you're just free and nothing can ever stop you oh wait I was lying you're in a fishbowl so the aim is to get to the ocean but you gotta get maneuver this ball using super accurate physics if I hold down my right trigger on my left trigger you can see here it's got inputs on the screen too you can see I'm doing you hold down either of these I can control my tail and then I've got to frantically shake the analog stick to make him flap a tail and then using the left stick will control which way I'm pointing this is what I like to feel as a spiritual successor to I am bread it's unbelievably fun it's very frustrating but I love that in my games if you want to get this game and two other games pigeon simulator and trash bandits you can get them all for free right now from the link in the description of this video they're gonna be taking on your guys feedback and deciding which one of these games to make into a full game I am fish is definitely my favorite but all three of the games are absolutely fantastic and they're free to play so I mean why not grab them right up so I'm an expert at this game now obviously I've played it a few times on stream now and by expert I mean I'm really still not that good but we are gonna roll out of this kitchen and we are gonna fall down onto these ladders everything's okay nothing to worry about and we're gonna grab this little checkpoint here oh yeah there we go is that okay and then we're gonna try and this elegantly fall onto this which we've done honestly I'm nailing this I feel I'm making the game look pretty easy let me tell you this game is very difficult I absolutely love physics-based puzzler challenge games like this so I think they're really really fun and I'm really really hoping the i''m fish is the game that gets pushed into full development because I love this it's so stressful but I absolutely love it just look at this little dude how can you not love him like I said you guys can get all three of these games for free I recommend you download them from the link in my description it's super easy to grab all three there in one neat little launcher and you could help decide which one of these three games becomes a full game and they're actually taking on your feedback there's been a couple of updates since the first I played the game and some of it is literally direct feedback that you guys are given them all my drunkest we nearly fell we nearly fell and if we fall we break and when we break some really sad music plays which if I doesn't happen naturally I will show you we're actually pretty close to the end of level here I've kind of been practicing this level a lot so I am okay at this level but now we have to do is the treacherous road crossing which is pretty random you just kind of have to roll and hope for the best oh no see there's a car there's a car no not like this okay so our fishbowl is smashed we can flail around but we must take a moment to remember this poor fishy fishy we love you and you will come back to life when I press retry and we go from the last checkpoint which is just up here all we do now is Nayla getting across this road and then we're going to get into the ocean it's right there it's right there so if we could perfect thanks school bus for crushing my dreams and also my bowl so this part is a little random I kind of lose control of the fish at this point and just let him swim and see what happens there we go he's fine he's fine he's doing great oh yes look at this oh my goodness we've done it we've actually done it I mean he needs to start going a little bit more left left please left no not this way how did that just break not only is the glass broken my heart is broken too right come on roll to victory roll to victory oh no there's no cars that's a bad sign because that means it's about to be a car oh don't move don't move we're fine we're fine oh no no no get out here no you're gonna run wait you're in the wrong way you're gonna run wave fish no your oh my goodness me I've lost control I've lost control of me fish he's gone mental okay we're fine this is fine this is fine this is fine right now go do is Roy in a straight line that should be easy ah go to freedom to freedom burn almost there okay you know what let's just count down and let's just get him swimming nice and normally we're about to be free into the ocean which is the end of the level guys thanks so much for watching hopefully I've enjoyed this like I said download all three games for free this video has been sponsored by bosses Chile owes its link in the description where
