Now this part of the video is where I usually come up with some sort of clever narrative twist to somehow lead you unknowingly into the sponsored spot or something like that, and I thought I had it really figured out. I was going to build a chat bot. You know, it's relevant to the video, I found a really nice course on Skillshare for it, it's pretty easy to do, and everything was going well, until I figured I was spending like 4 hours just trying to get through privacy policies and GDPR certification, company registration, developer... I just gave up. So instead, let me recommend this Skillshare
class to you, which is unrelated, but the best damn class I've seen on Skillshare yet. It's a hilariously entertaining design masterclass
from Aaron Draplin himself that I can recommend to everyone from design pros to people who
just want to know what goes into really good design. The first 500 people to sign up with the link
