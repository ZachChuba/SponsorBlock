If you end up visiting Guantanamo Bay for…
other reasons, one of your first steps should be buying a black-market smartphone because,
while you won’t be allowed to attend the school, you will be able to use the Skillshare
app to learn what you want to learn. Skillshare, you see, has over 20,000 courses
so if there’s something you want to learn, whether that be self defense or knife skills,
Skillshare probably has a course on it. You can do anything from learning cool bar
tricks to building up skills that could eventually land you your dream job and, as mentioned,
they have a mobile app where you can download classes offline for when your on the go or
in areas without service. What’s best is you can get two months of
their premium membership for free, and support Half as Interesting, by going to http://skl.sh/hai13.
