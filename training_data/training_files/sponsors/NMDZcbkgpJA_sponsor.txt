today's video is brought to you by audible perhaps the most common question i get asked here on this channel is where i find my topics for my videos and while i've stumbled across a good amount of stuff online by far the most consistent way that i've been able to digest complicated and interesting cases has been through audiobooks i listened to final destination disaster in regards to flight 980. i listened to the book of satoshi and referenced it a lot from my satoshi series and finally in regards to my silk road video i highly recommend a book by the name of american kingpin by nick bolton there are just certain topics that are best enjoyed when you can actually sit down and dedicate time to the intricacies of a story and for someone like myself who finds it very hard to just sit down and actually read a book i highly highly recommend audible audible has by far one of the best selections for audiobooks to keep you entertained for hours as the audible plus catalog includes thousands of audiobooks exclusive audible originals and podcasts on a variety of subjects and finding a good rabbit hole to go down is as simple as going to the mystery or true crime section with all of that being said try audible absolutely free for 30 days by going to audible.com sociable or texting sociable to 500 500. once again that's audible.com sociable or text sociable to 500 500 and thanks
