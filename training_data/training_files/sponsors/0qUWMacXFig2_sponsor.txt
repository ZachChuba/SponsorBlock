one of our favorite places
to watch movies, Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove of films
from around the globe. Every day a new film is added
and the oldest is taken away. So in this world where it’s very easy
to spend hours debating what you should watch, Mubi is like having a really cool friend
with amazing taste in movies making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings,
influential art house and foreign films, lesser known films by
your favorite famous directors, and more. Plus you can even download the films
to watch offline and there are no ads, ever. One movie you can watch
right now on Mubi is ‘2 Days in Paris’. Julie Delpy, who’s most famous for her role
in Richard Linklater’s ‘Before…’ trilogy, is the writer, director, composer,
and star of this film about a couple on a rocky vacation in France. We can’t recommend Mubi highly enough. You can try it out for free for a whole month,
