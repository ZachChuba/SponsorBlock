I highly recommend today's sponsor Brilliant.org. Brilliant is a website with all sorts of puzzles and problems about science and math. You can learn things through their guided courses and quizzes, or you can just do their daily puzzles. They have a ton of stuff on there--courses about circuits and electricity and magnetism how electronics work and the first 200 people to go to Brilliant.org/minutephysics will get 20% off of a premium subscription to Brilliant, which gives you full access to all of their courses and puzzles and the daily problems. Again, that's brilliant.org/minutephysics for 20% off a premium subscription to Brilliant and to let Brilliant know that you came from here. Thanks.
