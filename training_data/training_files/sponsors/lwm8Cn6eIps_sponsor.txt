right after this brief message now a word from the sponsor of today's video expressvpn in a recent video of mine i went over an intricate scam that targets small streamers scamming them out of billions of gp the key to the scam was to grab the streamer's ip address and later on ddos them at the opportune time all the streamer did was click a link sent to them in the chat this type of scam doesn't just happen with streamers ddosing and doxxing in the runescape community is unfortunately incredibly common especially at the dual arena or in high risk pvp fights which is why you should protect your ip address and location information with expressvpn which switches your ip address with one of their own so you can stay anonymous and protected even at home while using incognito mode your internet service provider can see all the sites you visit isps often keep logs of every site you visit and in the us they sell these logs to ad companies expressvpn blocks your isp from seeing what you're doing by encrypting your data and rerouting your internet connection through a secure server so go to expressvpn.com
