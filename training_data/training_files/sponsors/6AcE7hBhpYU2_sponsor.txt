Brilliant. Brilliant recently introduced a new feature,
called “Daily Problems”, which will present with you with interesting scientific problems
to test your brain. Like this one that will teach you how solar
sails allow spacecraft to gain speed without rocket fuel. If you answer a question wrong like I did
here, it teaches you exactly why. Allowing you to learn from your mistakes. Brilliant even have an app that you can download
to play these brain teasers on your morning commute. Each Daily Problem provides you with the context
and framework that you need to tackle it, so that you learn the concepts by applying
them. If you like the problem and want to learn
more, there’s a course quiz that explores the same concept in greater detail. If you are confused and need more guidance,
there’s a community of thousands of learners discussing the problems and writing solutions. Daily problems are thought provoking challenges
that will lead you from curiosity to mastery one day at a time. So what are you waiting for? Go to brilliant.org/realengineering/ and finish
your day a little smarter. And the first 500 of you to do so will get
20% off the annual subscription to view all problems in the archives.
