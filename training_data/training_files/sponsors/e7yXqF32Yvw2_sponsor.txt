We’d like to thank NORD VPN for supporting
PBS. Imagine VPN as a secure, encrypted tunnel for online traffic to flow. Nobody can see
through the tunnel and get their hands on your internet data. NordVPN allows you to
use public Wi-Fi in coffee shops or hotels, or anywhere else that you’re on someone
else’s network. That way you can access personal and work accounts on the road, or
simply keep your browsing history to yourself. They don’t log your activity while you’re
online, they’ve got thousands of servers in 60 countries, and 24/7 customer support.
