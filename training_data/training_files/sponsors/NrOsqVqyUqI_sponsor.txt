So I normally use Graphic Stock which I've talked about in a previous video and who have partnered with me for this one. You can click the link on the description below if you want to use their huge library of images to use in your projects and even for school work. All the images are copyright-free and they are now launching a new collection featuring dream inspired images. If you want to try out the subscription for seven days for free, all these images will be accessible for downloading when you sign up.
