Well, Josh, I'd have to say if you want to start a website, the only website to go through is Squarespace to get it done. There, they have amazing templates and you'll be up and running in literally minutes. You don't have to know any coding. Go to squarespace.com/cow because if you go there, you'll get 10% off your first purchase. It only starts at eight bucks a month and if you sign up for a year, you're gonna get a free domain name. 'Kay? I know you wanna make a website, so just do it. Go to squarespace.com/cow. 10% off. See you over there.
