This video was sponsored by the St. Croix
Watershed Research Station, with financial support from the McKnight Foundation. The Research Station is part of the Science
Museum of Minnesota, and its scientists study lakes and rivers across Minnesota to better
understand when, where, and why cyanobacterial blooms occur â€” and how we can prevent cyanobacteria
from harming lakes and rivers and the people and wildlife that depend on them. Thanks, St. Croix Watershed Research Station!
