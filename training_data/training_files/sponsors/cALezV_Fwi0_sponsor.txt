We're actually beginning
to se the first application of swarm intelligence in
autonomous car racing. At the beginning of May, Roborace, the world's first AI driverless electric racing series competition, saw two of its autonomous cars complete the world's first
self-driving car race in Monte Blanco. Their self-driving cars,
which they call Robocars, are able to communicate with each other through the use of
various sensors installed to maintain awareness
of their surroundings. Car-to-car communication could be used to find the most efficient
route for all cars on a road, making Braess' Paradox in traffic networks a problem of the past. Racing has a history of using competition to encourage technological development before rolling these developments
out for mass production. Roborace aims to
accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology through the use of
competitions and challenges, which are part of the Roborace
entertainment platform. The game is simple, the
team with the best AI wins. If you'd like to learn more
about what Roborace is doing, you can see the videos in their show me how it works playlist, join their mailing list for
updates on upcoming races, or follow them on Instagram to check out their latest models. Links to all of these
are in the description.
