Hey guys, so I just want to talk a little bit about designing my new website with Squarespace. They have this really intuitive easy-to-use platform that made it super easy for somebody like me who's never done web design, ever. They have templates, they do domains, they have really good customer service, it's really an all-in-one, one-stop shop for building a really slick web site. And I was really happy with the way mine came out. if you want to try it for yourself, you can start your free trial today at squarespace.com, and enter offer code "babish" to get 10% off your first purchase. Thanks for listening guys, and I hope you enjoyed the new site. I'm going to have all the recipes from every episode available soon.
