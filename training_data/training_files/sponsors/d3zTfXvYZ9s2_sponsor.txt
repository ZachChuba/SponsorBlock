Speaking of actions with consequences, I finally
got the kick in the pants I needed to make this video from my friends at the Corridor
Digital YouTube channel. They've asked me to help promote their new
YouTube Red Original Series, "Lifeline”, which, minor spoilers ahead... is a sci fi
action thriller with time travel in it. What kind of time travel, you ask? Essentially, if somebody dies in the future,
that sends a message back to the present, which allows people to jump forward to just
before the time the person dies and change the trajectory of history from that point
onwards, averting their death. But as you might imagine, things eventually
go awry. Anyway, you can check out the first episode
of Lifeline for free on the Corridor Digital channel or by following the links onscreen
or in the description . And fun facts: I actually know the Corridor guys from back before MinutePhysics,
when I was doing special effects for the "freddiew" channel. We also all grew up in neighboring towns in
Minnesota and even competed against each other in high school sports , though we didn't know
each other at the time. But enough trivia – go check out their
show!
