And the best place to learn more about new
things is today's sponsor, Skillshare. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for
a couple of classes, Skillshare allows you to learn almost everything for less than 10
dollars a month. They have thousands of courses on management
and business, productivity, photography, writing, languages, illustration and design, music,
cooking and so on. And if you're wondering how I organize my
life in Notion you can watch this class on how to work with Notion to start using this
awesome organization tool this year. With Skillshare you will never have an excuse
to stop learning, as you can watch all of these courses on the go, participate in class
projects and get involved in a community of people who want to learn the exact same things
as you do, And even if you're not willing to start paying
10 dollars a month for unlimited classes, that's not a problem because using my promo
code will give you two months of classes for free, no strings attached. Using this promo code also tells Skillshare
that you came from my channel which is always nice if you enjoy my content and want to keep
supporting our study corner.
