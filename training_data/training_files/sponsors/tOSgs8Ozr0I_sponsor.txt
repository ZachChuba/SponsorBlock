today's episode of gill in our games is brought to you by audible if you guys have been looking for a way to support gail in our games this is a great way to do so because if you use my link to sign up for a 30-day audible trial which is completely free you help me out massively something i unfortunately don't do enough is read books but thanks to audible i can still consume an enormous amount of content just by listening audible is the leading provider of spoken word entertainment and audiobooks every month members get one free credit that can be exchanged for any audiobook and audible's collection which is then kept even after the 30 days are over i recently got into true crime audiobooks and podcasts and mind hunter has been extremely fascinating that along with the podcast the cases that haunt us not only have me hooked but may also be keeping me up at night just a bit being able to listen while commuting or exercising not only makes time go by faster but it allows me to consume content that i may not have had the time for before which is a great feeling once you guys have signed up for your free 30-day trial at audibletrial.comrs let me know what you guys been listening to and if you have any recommendations
