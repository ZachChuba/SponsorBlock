a massive shout out to today's sponsor which is the ridge you guys know about these guys I've spoken about them before they make stream like wallets that are super small and super lightweight this is actually a carbon fiber one that they do that I'm currently rocking and this thing is so light so strong and smaller than my phone it's absolutely awesome those who watch my streams a lot will know that I do personally use the ridge items for my backpack as well and it has like a hard like leather back as well to protect your laptop it's also quilted inside and you see this thing right here that also is a plug for USB so you can charge up your phone which is pretty sick but click the link in the description and if you use the code tank legs yes tank legs because apparently only Ridge of the people we were going to give me tank legs use that code and you'll get yourself 10% off there's loads of stuff other than bags and wallets in there as well so check it
