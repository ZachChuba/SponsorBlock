Squarespace for sponsoring this video if you need a new website or a domain they really are a great option I've used them for at least 6 or 7 years now when I first started and a headshot and portrait photography the first thing I knew I needed to do was get a website up and it had to have a gallery had to have a contact page it had to have an about page it had to have a blog because I was writing a blog at the time and that was quite intimidating I thought it's gonna be very expensive to hire someone to design that but I check Squarespace out they had some very very clean templates really really well designed and it couldn't be easier to use I'm no coding genius or anything like that but I had a website up and running in two hours and it helped me put my face out there as somebody who is doing this sort of work start your free trial today at squarespace.com and go to Squarespace
