thank a good friend of the channel Skillshare a number of people have signed up to Skillshare and asked me what's a good general knowledge course for Adobe Premiere in other words if I'm new at editing where is a good place to start when I joined Skillshare I was already pretty familiar with Adobe products so the courses I've been watching are more specific and related to design but I want to have a good answer to that question so I've been watching beginner courses related to Premiere there are numerous options for learning Adobe and Skillshare but out of those the one I would recommend is video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro for beginners by jordi van der foot one of the things that I appreciate about Skillshare is that pros make these tutorials and Jordy has been teaching Adobe Premiere for 10 years now he's also a youtuber with 1.4 million subscribers one of my own patrons who needed to learn Adobe Premiere mentioned that he took this exact skill share course and loved it one thing I noticed that impressed me is how responsive Jordy is if you ask him a question under the video he answers in the same day see this one was answered one day ago another one same day another one from the same day that's a great resource then if you get stuck in the course the instructor is present you are here to learn Adobe Premiere Pro good choice Jordy is like PewDiePie and Brad combined into one person skill share will let you try out their site for free and take any of these courses for one month but if you follow the link below touch slash nerd city 5 you'll get two free months to try it out I do like skill share and they've been patiently waiting for me to upload
