And now we’re going to take you from the
freezing dunes of Canada to the more conventional hot ones of the Arabian
desert, where there lives another dune-adapted species:
the sand cat. They’re the world’s only desert-dwelling
cat, and they have about the cutest cheeks we’ve
ever seen, and you can learn about them in the CuriosityStream
documentary “Sand Cats,” part of the series “Small Cats Unknown.” And once you’re done learning about cats, CuriosityStream has over 2400 other documentaries
and nonfiction titles for you to enjoy, including exclusive originals. CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming
service that’s available worldwide, with content spanning science, nature, tech,
lifestyle, and more. You can get unlimited access starting at just
