one of my favorite parts of halloween is the stories i'm a big fan of horror literature so to get into the spirit of the season i just recently used audible to listen to the audiobook of one of my all-time favorite horror stories the king in yellow by robert chambers that book was a formative work for h.p lovecraft and stands as one of the strangest scariest things i've read to this day if you want to hear some good horror stories this halloween check out audible it's the best place to find audiobooks online with an unmatched selection including gripping original audio content but maybe horror is not your cup of tea well if you like my channel you're probably a fan of music and audible has a ton of biographies and titles on artists like bob dylan janice joplin nirvana ozzy osbourne and countless more if you're anything like me you have a long list of books that you want to read and audible helps you get through that list you can listen to the books as you're driving as you're cleaning the house or as you're at the gym more than just that joining audible gets you three free titles every month one audiobook and two audible originals and if you find you didn't enjoy a book you can exchange it for a new one absolutely free so why not give it a shot today if you go to audible.com polyphonic or text polyphonic to 500 500 you can get a 30 day free trial and that comes with a free book and two free originals at the very least why not try it out for a month it costs you nothing it's a great way to knock something off your to-do list and it really really supports my channel so
