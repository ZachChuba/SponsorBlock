This video was sponsored by the University
of Minnesota, where students, faculty and staff across all fields of study are working
to solve the Grand Challenges facing society. One of these challenges involves advancing
public health, such as by protecting the public from threats like Lyme disease. Professors Jon Oliver in the School of Public
Health and Benjamin Clarke in the Medical School are working to better characterize
how tick-borne diseases spread, while Professors Uli Munderloh and Tim Kurtti in the Department
of Entomology are advancing our understanding of the biological relationships between ticks
and the pathogens they harbor. Putting this knowledge to work will help reduce
the incidence of tick-borne diseases in the years to come. Thanks, University of Minnesota!
