Right, now if you see an airplane that looks
like this, you probably don’t want to get on without a life insurance plan, some pepto,
and a parachute. Similarly, if you see a wifi network that
looks like this you probably don’t want to hop on unless you have protection—like
a VPN. Dashlane Premium includes a VPN that encrypts
your online activity so you can stay safe when using unsecured wifi networks. This is just one of many online security tools
their premium offering has including secure file storage and dark web monitoring. You can get started using Dashlane for password
management for free at dashlane.com/HAI and then, the first 200 people to use the code,
“HAI” will get 10% off upgrading to premium to access all the features mentioned.
