Witness me now! -Witness me now! I’m gonna tell you about Squarespace. A few years ago,
if you were a mom-and-pop business, and you wanted
to put up a website for that business, you had to cobble together a bunch
of different skillsets to do that. You’d have to hire a web developer
to build the site, and then bug them to make changes for you
every time the site needed to be updated. not to mention the whole issue
of actually hosting the site, or buying the domain in the first place. Each of those things
requiring some know-how, or signing up for a different service. And then Squarespace came along, and you’ve probably
heard their name by now, because they actually did
something pretty valuable — they took all of those things,
and they put them in one place. If you’re like most people I know, and you know absolutely nothing
about building a website, then that’s pretty useful, or even if you’re someone who does,
and you’re an expert, and you just want to
pop something up really easy. If you think that’s something you need, there is a coupon attached
to the link below, so you’d get 10% off your purchase. Plus, Squarespace will know that
we sent a potential customer their way, and hey maybe they’ll be back
to sponsor Nerd City.
