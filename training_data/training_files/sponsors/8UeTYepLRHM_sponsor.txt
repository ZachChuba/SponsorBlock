Now I know it may be daunting
to focus on self-improvement and to learn some new skills,
but why not make it easier by utilizing the sponsor
of this video, Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes
in design, business technology and more. If you're interested in
making your own channel why not check out "Simple
Character Animation"? Personally, I'm designing
new merch so I found "Hey, Cool Shirt: Designing
Effective T-shirt Graphics" really helpful. Premium Membership gives
you unlimited access to quality classes taught by experts so you can improve your skills,
unlock new opportunities and do the work you love. Skillshare is also way more affordable than most learning platforms out there. With a yearly subscription
being less than $10 a month. But hey, look, that's
enough of me talking. Why not just give it a shot? The first 500 people to
sign up with this URL which is in the description will get their first two
months completely free. So, be sure to be one of those lucky 500. So, thank you once again to Skillshare for sponsoring this video.
