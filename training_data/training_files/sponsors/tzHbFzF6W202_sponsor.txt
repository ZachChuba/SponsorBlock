And it's brought to you by Linode. Linode provides virtual servers that make it easy and affordable to host your own app, site, service or whatever you want in the cloud. Other entry level
hostings work to start up but you'll eventually
want something powerful, customizable and able to
use for cloud computing. You can easily set up your own server with their one click
apps and they've even got a DIY option if you wanna
go full custom setup. You can deploy Minecraft,
CS-GO servers, WordPress and so much more and you can
even spin up your own VPN and have plenty of space to host a website app or game server. They've got affordable
pricing with no hidden fees and the best of all is they're 100% human, 24/7, 365, customer service
via phone or support tickets. Get $20 and free credit
towards your new account with code LINUS20 at the link
