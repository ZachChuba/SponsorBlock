sponsor for this video has been very good to me they're willing to support videos like this when most other companies aren't and the reason why I believe is that Squarespace values artists and they want to see them succeed so as a business they provide a service that artists generally don't really think about how are you gonna get your creations seen by others well you're gonna need a website to direct people to most likely and if you're like me you're probably too busy working on the creation itself to bother with the hassles that can come from website design I use Squarespace because it's fast and easy to make a site that looks good and they offer online store integration so you can sell your work whether it's a book an album a movie a painting or whatever easily and with no previous experience if you guys are interested in that then I have a deal for you you can go to Squarespace comm right now to start a free trial of the service and if you like what you see and when you're ready to launch you can go to squarespace.com slash austin mcconnell to save 10% off your first
