Imitating the structure of materials like wood requires understanding space, shapes,
and angles -- the kind of thing you learn in a geometry course. And if that’s piqued your interest, Brilliant
offers a brand new course on Geometry Fundamentals that can start you off right. It’s an intuitive introduction to the geometry
that’s all around us. Brilliant also offers over 50 other courses
in science, engineering, computer science and math, all with hands-on and interactive
components to help you learn. So there’s something for everyone, to learn
a bit of everything. Brilliant courses are now available offline
using their iOS and Android app. So even if you’re traveling or have a spotty
internet connection, you’ll be able to keep learning. The first 200 people to sign up at Brilliant.org/SciShow
will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription. Thanks for checking it out -- and for supporting
us! {♫Outro♫}
