As you've probably guessed by now, this video
was sponsored by LEGO - I've been a huge fan of LEGO for pretty much my entire life, spending
hours and hours building and rebuilding all sorts of LEGO projects as a child and teenager,
and even more recently sneaking some into MinutePhysics videos. So I'm excited that LEGO wanted to full-on
sponsor a video. The Saturn V sets are super cleverly designed
and really fun to build, and of course I'm a big Apollo fan and I love how the rocket
actually stages like the real thing. Anyway, the folks at LEGO want me to point
you to their online and physical stores which, naturally, have the largest collection of
lego sets, and also allow you to find and buy individual pieces a la carte for custom
projects, get expert lego help, and with LEGO VIP you can get early access to new LEGO sets. Thanks so much to LEGO for sponsoring this
video and filling my childhood with creative delight.
