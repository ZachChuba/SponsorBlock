I love my job.‚Äù This video is brought to
you by Better Help. These days burnout is all
too common, but it can be hard to make time to
talk it out in a face-to-face counseling session. Better Help is the answer.
They let you receive stellar private online counseling from
the comfort of your home. All you have to do is fill
out a questionnaire and within 24 hours you'll be matched
with a therapist who fits your specific needs. Better Help has counselors
who specialize in areas like stress anxiety
and relationships so you know you're
getting care that's tailor-made for you. We've actually used
Better Help ourselves and we love how easy
and accessible it is. Better Help is also
super affordable. It costs only sixty-five
dollars a week and you may qualify for financial aid. Plus it's available worldwide
so click the link in the description below betterhelp.com/thetake
to get 10% off today. Just keep in mind that
Better Help is not a crisis line. If you need immediate
assistance we'll leave a link to a crisis
helpline below.
