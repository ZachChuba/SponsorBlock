get into that I'd like to take a moment to thank our sponsor for today and that is so obviously we love audible around here I have been using audible for so long long before they were sponsoring me as many of you know I am NOT a big reader I have a learning disability and it just makes reading really not enjoyable so that's why I love listening to audiobooks it makes the experience so much more enjoyable for me audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet and now with audible originals the selection has gotten even more custom and even bigger with content main especially for their members every month audible members get one credit good for any audiobook you choose to automatically and you can't get these anywhere else and what's really nice is your audiobooks are yours to keep you can go back and listen to any of the books that you have in your library even if you are no longer an audible member another great thing about audible is that if you get your book and it ends up not really being your style you're just kinda like not into it you can exchange it for another book no questions asked and audible is offering my audience their first audio book for free along with two free audible originals just go to audible.com slash Kendall Rey or text Kendall Rey at 2 500 500 this time I wanted to mention one of the greatest true-crime books a stranger beside me by anne rule which is all about ted bundy as she had a very one-on-one experience with him that no one else really had it's a very intriguing story i think you guys would really find it interesting so be sure to check it out maybe download it as your first free audible book again
