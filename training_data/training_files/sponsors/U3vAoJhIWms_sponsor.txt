This minutephysics video was brought to you by Audible.com, one of the leading providers of online audiobooks across all types of media including fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals. I'd like to recommend The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell this week. It's a book about exponential increases in spreads, uh, trends, social trends epidemics, that sort of thing. And, uh, it's - the mathematic is somewhat related to the mathematics of balancing an object on its... tip, so, anyway, The Tipping Point, by Malcolm Gladwell. Audible.com supports minutephysics and without them, we wouldn't be able to do what we do, so... Thank you to Audible, and, uh, head to audible.com/minutephysics to get your free audiobook.
