Science and technology and purpose ultimately
take center stage on design, and if you want to contemplate how a spaceship might be designed
properly, it helps to have that science background. I’d also say though, and it's an approach
we favor here on SFIA, that we already know it’s beneficial to have a science background
and the important part is learning and practicing with that knowledge on fun topics. That’s something our friends at Brilliant
excel at. Brilliant is a problem solving website and
app with a hands-on approach, and not only do they have over 50 courses to help you learn
new science and math, but they also have daily challenges that can reinforce and strengthen
material in your head. They make it fun and interactive though, because
we not only find it easier to set aside time to learn when it’s fun, but we learn better
that way too. They also appreciate that we often have to
squeeze our learning in when we have time, so they have a great mobile app that lets
you access their courses on the go and use them even when your internet connection is
spotty. If you’d like to learn more science, math,
and computer science, go to brilliant.org/IsaacArthur and sign up for free. And also, the first 200 people that go to
that link will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription, so you can solve all the daily
challenges in the archives and access dozens
