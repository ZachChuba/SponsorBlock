this animated spell book it was brought to you by tail spar which is my favorite virtual tabletop it doesn't automate your bonuses and stuff at this point but it doesn't matter because map making and play feels so incredible you can have multiple people making maps at the same time so the DM is describing something while the players are building maps around another player that's having his own scene I've done this and it feels good check the link below for pre-orders to get into the late February beta I have a hard time playing games on any other virtual tabletop at this point ok and stay tuned for post notes
