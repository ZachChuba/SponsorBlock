This video is brought to you by Cheddar, who
recently launched their YouTube Channel and are making videos that cover business, technology,
media, and news but without the boring parts. I just checked out a story of theirs on protecting
planet Earth from Asteroids, and if you too occasionally have thoughts of existential
dread, you might enjoy it, as well. If you check out their channel, and like it,
consider subscribing and watching more of their videos - they cover some of the top
stories and ideas going on today.
