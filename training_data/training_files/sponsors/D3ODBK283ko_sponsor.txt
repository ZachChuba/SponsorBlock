do you know what for as that car goes by 50 Ramat floor so Amazon Prime video reached out and they said hey Sam the cooking guy people would you like to be involved in talking about Jack Ryan season two we were like oh yeah max is a hell yeah because someone has already begun season 2 so why is this country in the midst of one of the greatest humanitarian crises in history and someone has not and I'm not allowing him to say a word like every couple hours he's like oh holy have you watched have you seen I have nothing nothing I know nothing I know season 1 and I know how amazing season 1 was have you watched season 1 I'll be honest I didn't start watching season 1 until max pushed me pushed me pushed me like you know he's my my my child I was gonna say you're my spawn is that an awful thing doesn't spawn sound horrid so he's my child but you know the little little kids like this daddy daddy daddy daddy and finally you're like what he's like this if you have you watched season 1 if you watched Jack Ryan do you watch season 1 have you watched Amazon Prime video if you're watching if you watch it watch it for fine I'll watch let me tell you something about John Krasinski John Krasinski is Jack Ryan he fully embodies Jack Ryan but I have to admit there are moments when I want him to do what he did in the office they I don't want to give anything away if you haven't seen it so they would talk about some spy thing and I would want John Krasinski to be having a conversation here and then do that thing wait do that thing where he he's having this conversation he turns and he looks to the camera and he goes what like that like a little the office in it and that's not gonna happen and I understand that's not gonna happen look we talked about espionage yes intrigue adventure did you ever imagine John Krasinski would be an action hero no because he is he's so good and he's so good because he he crossed that border of starting out the series's as a a bookish nerd at the CIA and now look what he's doing he's not like Jack Bauer from 24 no a little bit of a different no he's a very different character he's he's so good and it is so good and look if you want something to binge and you want something to get into Jack Ryan season 1 but now season 2 is out and by the way they've done it the right way all of it is out so if you want to sit at home and make what we're about to make and then should go hog-wild and watch all of it well you'll have to make a couple batches but this will be worth it and
