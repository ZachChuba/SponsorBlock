and super excited to announce that this video is sponsored by NVIDIA. Might of heard of them, they are the rock stars of GPUs, also known as graphics cards. I've actually been a fan for awhile. All the way back in 2015 I bought a bunch of stocks in NVIDIA and at the time they
were less than 20 bucks. Best investment of my life, 'cause ever since then
they've been crushing it. This is not financial advice by the way. You should probably never
take money tips from me, 'cause I buy a new
camera every single week. I think I'm about to buy
another one right now, because we are also doing
a giveaway on this video. I started talking to
NVIDIA about a month ago, right after I posted a video where I said I use my laptop for all my simple, basic light editing, but I need a desktop for
the heavy duty edits, and that's when NVIDIA came knocking, and basically they were like. (loud rock music) Clearly you've never heard of what a. I forgot my line. Clearly you have no
idea what radical stuff we've been working on. (louder rock music) You haven't experienced the true power of a laptop and rock
and roll without this. This is the Razer Blade
15, advanced model, with ultra UHD OLED display, and best of all it has our NVIDIA 2080 graphics card. Sorry about your backdrop,
we'll pay for that, and I regret doing this voice for this bit 'cause I'm definitely
going to lose my voice.
