Don't take this
personal, but I do feel like this is just a giant joke. How could I not take
that personally? Folks at home, if you want to
see an actually good Top 10, AKA, mine, which I feel
like is very well-rounded, with some action, some
comedy, some dramas, go to Vudu.com/DudePerfect,
and give it a look. Ty?
