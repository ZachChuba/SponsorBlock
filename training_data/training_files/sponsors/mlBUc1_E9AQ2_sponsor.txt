And today I want to talk to you about one of our favorite places
to watch movies, Mubi. Mubi is a treasure trove of films
From around the globe. Every day, a new film is added
and the oldest is taken away. So in this world where it’s very easy
to spend hours debating what you watch, Mubi is having a really cool friend
with amazing taste in movies, making it so much easier for you. They feature hard to
come by masterpieces, indie festival darlings, influential arthouse
and foreign films, lesser known films by your
favorite directors, and more. Plus, you can even download
the films to watch offline. And there are no ads, ever. One movie you can watch
right now on Mubi is Gloria, directed by Academy Award
winner Sebastián Lelio. It’s the story of a vivacious
middle-aged divorcee, determined to add
some excitement to her life through
her new relationship. We can’t recommend
Mubi highly enough. You can try it out now for free
for a whole month. Just click the link
in the description below.
