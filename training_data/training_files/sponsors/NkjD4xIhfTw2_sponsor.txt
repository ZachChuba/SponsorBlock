So all that remains, is to give you guys this
message from our sponsor. Whether you want something
personal, for business or even something for B2 storage, Backblaze is a cloud storage solution that's both easy to use and affordable starting at just $6 a month. They've restored over 50 billion files, and they've got over an
exabyte of data storage. You can back up almost anything and you can restore your files anywhere. Their mobile apps give you
access to your files on the go so you can directly download them, or they can even restore
your files by mail. Just purchase a restore via hard drive and they will overnight FedEx it to you. After you restore all the data
to another storage device, you can then return the hard
drive to them for a refund. They've got unlimited data
backup at a fixed price and you can receive a fully
