But first a word from our new sponsor: Introducing a revolution in gaming! Footmouse the first science-based gaming mouse
made for feet. I've been using Footmouse since 2017 but not
on LAN. There is a lot of controversy as to whether
or not Footmouse should be tournament legal. It's just such a huge advantage, but it's
still all about skill. Footmouse just raises the skill gap. Nah but really, this video is brought to you
by Raid Shadow Legends. It's the very well-known RPG game. I find it's a very enjoyable and addictive
game with nice looking graphics that you can play on Mobile or on a desktop. So, what you do is you grab a champion from
the game and you can head over to the campaign mode where you can spend hours gaining experience
and advancing through the storyline. You can also battle the dungeons to collect
new artifacts to make your champions even stronger
And use shards to obtain new ones. I really like the variety they have. The game also has a daily login reward program
for new players that has been doubled from 90 to 180 days! Where you can get free silver, gems, shards
but most importantly the Barbarian legendary champion scyl of the drake I invite you to find me in the game under
the name MoiVel so you can battle me or join my clan. If you go to the video description and click
on the special links, they will not only give you 100,000 silver but they will also give
you a free and very powerful champion Hexweaver. You will be able to find it all here. It's a free to play game so go check it out
for yourself. and I'll see you there! Now back to the show.
