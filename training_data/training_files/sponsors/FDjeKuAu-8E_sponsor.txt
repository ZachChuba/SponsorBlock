Thanks to NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope
Project at the Space Telescope Science Institute for supporting this video. JWST is literally the perfect telescope for
studying brown dwarfs: it sees best in infrared light, and guess what brown dwarfs mostly
emit: yup, infrared! Unlike stars which are super hot, the smallest
brown dwarfs are about the same temperature as you and me, and they give off infrared
light right in the middle of JWST’s spectrum. This also means that if you and I were in
space, we’d shine out like a beacon to JWST even with no stars nearby. So JWST will be able to find and study human-temperature
brown dwarfs and compare them with super Jupiters to help settle the brown dwarf debate.
