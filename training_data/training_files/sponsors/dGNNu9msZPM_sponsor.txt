That was amazing. Well, I gotta thank Nubia
for sending us this phone to try out and show you
guys what it could do, 'cause obviously it's given me
a leg up on the competition, even though I don't have legs. (laughs) Now remember, again, this
video was sponsored by Nubia. They sent us a phone to
review, so just so you know. With that said, I do really like it. It's a lot of fun, it's super fast, and if you wanna check it out and maybe get one for yourself, links are in the description below.
