That's right You guys don't know crunchyroll is the best place to catch anime outside of japan? they've got all the new shows from all the new citizens that are coming out over there and The best part is it's made and created by people who actually love anime for people who love anime It's not just some janky streaming service like this pogo stick is where it's created by some Corporation to try to just make money on some content that they don't know what it's for It's actually got all your favorite shows. My hero academia, Attack on Titan, Ah Dragon Ball super, and the best part is a lot of the shows come out only an hour after they air in Japan another cool thing if you guys are already members and you already know about Crunchyroll just know that's some of the money you Pay for your membership goes to anime artists in Japan So they really actually support the community there, which is another awesome thing that I wanted You guys to know about. now please if you guys already know About  Crunchyroll and you already watched shows on it I'd leave a comment below about some of the shows that you watch because people who aren't into anime will want to know Could definitely benefit by... by checking out those shows.
