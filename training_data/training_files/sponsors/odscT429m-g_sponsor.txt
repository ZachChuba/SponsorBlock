Now, if you’re trying to decide whether
to fly this airline, you should hear the review from one of its former passengers—Piper
Kerman. She’s the author of Orange Is the New Black,
the book that the show is based on, which itself is based on her own experience in prison
and it includes a section on when she was transferred using JPATS. I know most people can’t find time to sit
down and read books, so rather, you can listen to this book when you’re driving, doing
dishes, at work, going for a run, or whenever through Audible. Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks
on the planet in addition to a huge amount of Audible Originals. Exclusively in the month of July, Audible
is offering Amazon Prime members their first three months of membership for 66% off by
going to audible.com/HAI. With that, you can listen to Orange is the
New Black or pretty much any audiobook you want, once again, at audible.com/HAI.
