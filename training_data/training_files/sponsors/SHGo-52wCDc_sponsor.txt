I guess that's one of the reasons this video was sponsored by Keysight! This is actually good; Keysight is holding a contest for graduate and undergraduate students all around the world. The winner not only receives up to $50,000 in cash, Their university gets $50,000 in keysight tools. You can enter from the link below Basically, students try to tackle two important global issues, and I will be one of the judges to pick the winners. Is that a good thing? Just for entering your idea in the contest the first 240 eligible registrants get the fancy keysight DMM. So do it! I'll also give away two of them at the end and beside the cash and tools, your brilliant idea may change the world. *huge pop*
