I’d like to thank Audible.com for supporting
this video – Audible is a leading provider of audiobooks including fiction, non-fiction
and periodicals. A book you might enjoy is Nudge, by Richard
H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein, which opened my mind of some to the hidden reasons why
we do or don't succeed in making changes in our lives, or in society, like I don't know,
getting people to stop drinking poop water and start drinking pure-clean-new-fun water. You can check out Nudge or another book of
your choice, for free, with a free 30-day trial at Audible.com/minuteearth. Again that's Audible.com/minuteearth
