let me watch my. Hi, I'm desk Jarvis, remember earlier when I was
talking about Squarespace and said more on that later? That was foreshadowing. I'm really excited to be
partnering with Squarespace for this video because
I've actually been a user of Squarespace for the past few years. Now, I know what you may be thinking, "Jarvis, aren't you a former
software professional with a," (background noises) "comically large degree
in computer science?" Why yes, I am. But because I do know how
to code and build websites, I know how much work is
involved in maintaining them, which is why I use
Squarespace for the website of my comedy podcast about feelings, Sad Boyz which if you don't know, you will soon. Check out squarespace.com for a free trial and when you're ready to launch, head on over to
squarespace.com/jarvisjohnson, that's my name, to save 10% off on your first purchase of a website or domain. Thanks Squarespace. It's my name, how cool is that?
