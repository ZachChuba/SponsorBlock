myself this year is how much I learn on a
daily basis. Between working, managing a business and trying
to conciliate family life with some well-deserved self-care, sometimes there isn't enough time
in the day dedicated to education. That's why it's much easier to rely on platforms
that allow us to watch interesting content during other busier tasks and for that you
have a great combo which is CuriosityStream and Nebula. CuriosityStream has thousands of documentaries
that you can watch on-the-go. Their portfolio covers dozens of different
topics that can help you improve your knowledge in things you wouldn't able to learn in such
a short amount of time. When you sign up for CuriosityStream you also
get access to Nebula - a platform made by video creators, myself included, where we
are able to share our content without YouTube's restrictive policies. Signing up for Nebula allows you to, first
of all, access a curated library of ad-free educational videos, secondly, watch awesome
great that you can't find anywhere else and, thirdly, help support independent creators
on making content that is useful and interesting instead of having to cater to YouTube's algorithm. Sign up using the promo code "study corner"
