thing that I can tell you why it exists though and that is the d-brane grip it's a super grippy case with precision cutouts for your camera your fingerprint sensor it's got super clicky buttons and of course it's deep brand so you can customize the look with any of their fabulous debrand skins and they're also promoting their prism screen protector this thing it's not actually on this phone but don't worry about that this thing is unbelievable so they've got a cool little applicator that makes it so you get a perfect application every time it feels really glassy from the front nothing about this demo is staged I was absolutely dumbstruck so check out both the grip and the prism at the link
