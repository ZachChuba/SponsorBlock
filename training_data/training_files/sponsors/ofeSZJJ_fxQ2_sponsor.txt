Hi everyone, I want to thank NordVPN for helping to sponsor this video. Head to NordVPN.com/polyphonic and use the code "polyphonic" to save 77% right now and to start protecting your Internet experience today. As someone who creates content on the Internet, the security of my data is really important to me. I often worry about the possibility of something like my YouTube channel, my banking information or really anything I do online being compromised. And that's why I'm really happy to be working with NordVPN. Today's Internet environment is one full of issues like net neutrality and ISPs throttling your access so you really can't be too careful. By using military-grade encryption, Nord can really help you protect yourself online on a number of devices. They've got everything from a lightweight Chrome browser extension to Android and iOS apps. I've been using NordVPN and their servers are super fast. Honestly, I don't even notice it's there when I'm browsing the Internet, but I know it's in the background keeping me safe. It's much more seamless than any of the VPNs I've used in the past. If you go to NordVPN.com/polyphonic and enter the offer code "polyphonic", you'll save 77% on your account. That means for a bit more than the price of a cup of coffee a month you'll be able to browse the Internet worryfree on up to six devices at any given time, so head on over now to start protecting your Internet experience, ensure your data is safe and to show your support for my channel while you're at it.
