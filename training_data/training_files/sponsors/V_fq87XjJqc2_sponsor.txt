It’s going to take a lot of research and
problem-solving to get to the bottom of this. And if that sounds like your cup of tea, you
might want to check Brilliant’s Daily Challenges. Every day, Brilliant releases new challenge
questions that cover fields from computer science to statistics. Recently, for example,
they had one about how to win at Twenty Questions. Which is my kind of challenge. You can access the Daily Challenges for free,
but if you sign up to become a Premium member, you’ll get access to the whole archive.
So whether you’re chilling on the bus home from or just want to brush up on your skills,
you’ll have plenty of content. Also, if you really like a challenge and want
to learn more about the subject, there’s a related course that explores the same concept
in greater detail. You can learn more about Brilliant.org/SciShow.
