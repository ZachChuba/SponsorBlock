really enjoying lately um our sponsors I will tell you which game I've been after but we should really do our sponsor yes our first monster is oh is LTX not a sponsor oh no it's a topic well we'll talk about LT excellent yeah yeah that's cool our first sponsor is private Internet access private Internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and authentication they've got apps for Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome they can connect up to five devices at the same time their speeds are fantastic as long as you've got the CPU for it like I've seen I've seen like 30 megabytes a second just like crush my 9900 K in a VM so it's only is it two cores or for course pre-course I don't know but it's that like 70% you anyway it's PIAA I can't say enough good things about it check it out today at LM GGG / p ia when we've got that linked right there and a VPN is good for all kinds of things it's super affordable just do it you want to something a weird interesting fact that I just remember today PA was the first VPN that we used when we were trying to work on and diagnose things with the forum if you remember like way vacuuming way the hack back in the day the first VPN I ever had you pay for for working on forum stuff was PA so technically we've gone way the heck back with them I also have a confession to make while we were still working with tunnel bear I had a paid PIAA account I have a free one now because we're working with them I usually do I still pay for it I don't think so I did too I did use tunnel bear and actually I actually have a really hilarious ton of a tunnel bear story which did I ever tell you about how I saved Intel at PAX yes you did yeah with tunnel there so for some reason battle.net black black listed all of Intel's IPs for some reason to log into battle.net I love that you call it Donald net but carry on because that's what it used to be called back in like the Warcraft to Starcraft days anyways battlenet battle.net the they couldn't log it none of the streamers or competitors there could login to their battle on net accounts battlenet accounts whatever to play overwatch so what I did was I I teamed up with some Intel employees and I got everyone to run around and saw tunnel bear on all the computers and then they would just turned tunnel bear on login turned to little bear off play the game it was great and it worked the whole event they just turned 12 bear on and off to login every time it was awesome the thing about tunnel bear was ease of use yeah exactly I could sell that all day based on the ease of use because like my mom could do it and it was so and it's not just remember ease of use is more than just how many buttons you have to press it's like how friendly the buttons look honestly it it does matter I recommended tunnel there to certain people and I recommended PIAA to certain people yeah and I use tunnel various situations where I just needed something really quick and just for like a couple minutes and it wasn't even necessarily my computer or whatever just get it going free account flow plate and Chad is mad they're like they literally changed it back to battle.net because no one said whatever they renamed it to so I don't know what you're talking about what I know I don't know if that sounds right John says everyone I know calls it battlenet for sure battlenet now redirects to just Blizzard comm yeah so I don't know you guys I think you guys are all just a little bit on the og side here well Blizzard battle.net desktop app yes I don't think they ever changed the actual terminology but what do they call it a keynote I think they call it Battlement also we have another sponsor join honey calm yeah there's literally no reason not to
