sup Nick oh oh he wants us to talk about the merge so this this is our hot item right now this hoodie is finally for sale yeah did you get one yet okay oh really ouch nick is my savior because my luggage was lost you lost it note I did not know an airline did yeah an airline did a hundred percent okay and my sweater was in there but Nick Nick swooped in and got me no all right so this is the one he did but either way this is the one that's like the hot seller on the store right now TT store calm it's got like a little look it's got a little logo here it's got the phone pocket on this side that holds even really big phones this is an early prototype so actually the we had enlarged the phone pocket after this one cuz it didn't really fit very well it was like hard to get it in and out also this one see how yours goes a little bit lower we made it about an inch longer because this is an early one because it was always riding up on me like that I also have a rather tall torso and it fits on me perfectly fine I know some people ask about how different fitting things work so we changed the zipper to YKK instead of whatever this is that's that's good yeah so we made some quality and some wearability improvements that's why these projects take so long because you're sending feedback you're waiting for new samples you're sending more feedback you're waiting for new samples if it was just as simple as like getting a shirt printed this merch stuff would have paid for itself ages ago as it is were okay so we're making money on every item we sell but we're deep in the red in terms of the total investment that we put in but honestly I'm so much happier wearing our ok party the the stuff I was most upset about losing in that life okay one random little tidbit I lost literally every single pair of bottoms that I own except for these shorts that I'm wearing in that luggage said Wow I don't have very many ball can it take you a long time to get free bottoms to replace those bottoms because I know you won't pay that's why I only had that many I know it's because same jeans I've had for like seven years I believe you but okay as an outside source the shirts are insanely comfortable the constellation one is actually my like favorite shirt which is also gone out of stock right now we're working on getting more the problem is we can't get that color of shirt and so we're working on an overseas source but unless it meets the standard of the ones that we are using now we are just we'd rather be completely out of stock and not sell anything been compromised anymore I'm just tired of it and it's insane I'm just gonna step it again still outside source your shirts for 20 bucks yeah basically no influencer shirts or 20 bucks right now twenty dollars a shirt is the like five to ten years ago pricing for most of this kind of stuff which is pretty awesome the shirts feel great the printing is great the sweaters are thin yeah which is usually bad but it's not no it's like a French terry yeah like it's not like a cheap finish I haven't had a sweater like this before so every finn's whatever that i've had sucked this one's fantastic i slept with it over my face when I didn't have another option while I was in Taiwan it was great and then it's gone but I was really sad and I got a new one we're trying to we're trying to keep the pricing reasonable that's like yeah the big 60 bucks for a sweater again it's sweaters are kind of expensive but it takes us a long time to make this stuff so yeah yeah go buy some pants well I have two now okay so I will start Lord really wants to do joggers so joggers would be do i I don't really like them though so my my my new thing with the merch actually I listen to a talk from Kris Jenner of all people you know what you can say what you want about the content but you have to respect the business savvy and she was like look focus focus on what you actually are passionate about and it's a lot harder to screw up and so I'm going you know so I I so I got back to the office and I cancelled the joggers project I don't care about them okay and I was like nope we're gonna do stuff that like I care about a lot so the underwear that's coming yeah it's really nice okay good because I lost also a very high percentage of my underwear the underwear fairly soon literally my entire wardrobe BLTs the under which I'm okay with it's
