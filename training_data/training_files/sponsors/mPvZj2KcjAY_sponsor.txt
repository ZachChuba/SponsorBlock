PBS Digital Studios is sponsored by Curiosity
Stream, where you can stream documentary films, and programs about science, nature, and history,
including exclusive originals! And if you're watching me right now, you should probably check out Planet Dinosaur, a three-part BBC series about the latest discoveries from the days of the non-avian dinos. Curiosity Stream offers unlimited streaming,
and for you Eons viewers -- because I like your face! -- the first two months are free
if you sign up at curiositystream.com/eons and use the promo code...wait for it... EONS.
