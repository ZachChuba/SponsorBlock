Hey guys, by the way, this video is brought
to you by Squarespace, because dreams are cool, but bringing your dreams
to life is even cooler. - Can you not right now? - Oh, sorry. (playful music) Sorry about that. Back when I was in high school, I had this dream to become
a professional filmmaker and run my own business. But back then it was crazy difficult to bring your ideas to life. Now, not so much. With Squarespace, if you have an idea, you can use their beautiful
and professional templates to launch your website
the same day you sign up. Use their tools for blogging, get powerful analytics, connect your social media
accounts, and much more. Or keep things crazy simple like I do and set up a website with
an email sign up form. Go to squarespace.com for a free trial. When you're ready to launch, go to squarespace.com/mattdavella to save 10 percent off your first purchase of a website or domain. Okay, I'm gonna go back to bed now. (sheets rustling)
