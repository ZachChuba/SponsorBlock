doing well today we've got a sponsored video from stadia and they invited me to check out the recent release of pop G on there but how does it work and what is it well stadia is Google's new gaming platform that lets you play games through streaming them instantly providing you've got an internet connection on desktops laptops and even supported mobile phones here's an example of me in my bedroom where I've got it hooked up to my TV using a chromecast and I've got the controller and also here on a pixel for using the controller again you get the gist you can play the games on there which are being streamed to some of the devices that you own there's no need to download the game or patch it it's just there to play straight away I thought I should just show you on desktop how it works on pop G with the click to play link your load chrome click the link and that should open up the game and when you get to the lobby screen here that's it you can queue up into a match at the moment there's a two month free trial for it stadia pro so if you're interested in that and wanted to try it out for yourself there's a link you can click on
