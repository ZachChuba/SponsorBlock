If you (or somebody you know, who maybe you’re
looking for a present for?) are the kind of person who likes to dive deep into quantum
paradoxes, or the cool things waves do when they interfere, then you should definitely
check out Brilliant.org, this video’s sponsor, which has courses and quizzes about all sorts
of fascinating wave mechanics, and quantum mechanics, and math puzzles, and more. Unlike a youtube video, Brilliant gives you
the opportunity to actually practice and hone your problem solving and scientific thinking
skills, for school, work, or because understanding the universe is awesome! And if you go to brilliant.org/minutephysics
you can get 20% off a premium subscription to brilliant for yourself or for somebody
else as a gift - it’s non-materialistic AND arrives instantly! Again, that’s brilliant.org/minutephysics
for a deeper understanding of the weird but true physics that underlies our universe,
for you, or your friends and loved ones.
