excited to introduce the very relevant sponsor
for this video: Brilliant.org. Brilliant is a problem solving website designed
to help you practice and learn math and science via guided problems, puzzles and quizzes:
I know that sounds kind of nerdy, but the truth is that the only way to truly learn
and understand much of math and physics is to actively work through the material yourself
– videos only get you so far. And Brilliant does a brilliant job of making
that easy, sneakily enticing you into doing math and physics problems by means of intriguing
questions structured for all ability and knowledge levels. I say this from experience, because if you
haven’t done a problem for a few days, Brilliant will send you an attention-grabbing puzzle
, and I’ve been sucked in by quite a few of them. If you want to try out Brilliant (which I
recommend), heading to brilliant.org/minutephysics will let them know you came from here, and
you can check out their courses on Probability, the Physics of the Everyday, Classical Mechanics,
Gravitational Physics and so on. Hey, glad you’re still here – in case
you’re interested, there’s a footnotes video covering a few things that got cut out
of this one, like feedback loops and correlations that arise just by chance. The link’s on screen and in the video description.
