you can learn on Brilliant.org. Their pitch is simple: Sure, you can spend
hours reading textbooks, but that’s not how most of us learn. We need examples, challenges, and pictures. Their courses on Science, Math, and Computer
Science are interactive and you can do the problems a few minutes at a time. Even if you’re just waiting in line, you
can quickly do one of their Daily Challenges. I just had to take a 17-hour flight, so I
was glad to see you can now download courses to use offline. Use the link in the description to sign up
for free. The first 200 people will get 20% off the
annual premium subscription so you can view all the Daily Challenges and take all their
problem-solving courses.
