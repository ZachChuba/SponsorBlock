Anyway guys, I wanna give a special thank you to our sponsor, LootCrate! If you guys don't know what LootCrate is, they're a really cool company that sends ya a box of loot every month. Now this month's LootCrate was themed... futuristic! Heh, ve- pretty dope! Here's Item #1! Futurama toy that comes with, its got a magnet... That's dope! I like that show a lot. Next up, you've got a shirt. I can't see it... I can't turn my neck to see the shirt. Hila what does it say? Hila: Rick and Morty! Ethan: Oh it's Rick and Morty, guys if you haven't seen Rick and Morty definitely check it out it's definitely one of the best shows on television. So thank you so much to LootCrate, for sponsoring this video. We've also got... a Megaman toy, a lil' figure Megaman. Dope. Next up, Star Trek... it's a sticker. Sick. I am a big fan of Star Trek, you guys maybe didn't know that about me... so I'm really honored and proud to have received this medal.
