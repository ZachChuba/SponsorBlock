Thanks again to Star
Wars: Jedi Fallen Order for sponsoring today's episode. You play Cal Kestis, a young Jedi padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of order 66 following the events of Episode
III: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi order, you must pick up the pieces
of your shattered past to complete your training, develop powerful new force abilities, and master the art of
the iconic lightsaber, all while staying one
step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. Star Wars: Jedi Fallen
Order is available now on Xbox One, PS4, and PC.
