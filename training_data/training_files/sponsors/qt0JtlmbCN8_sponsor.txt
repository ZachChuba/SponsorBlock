out also i want to thank you guys who each time take the opportunity to hit that like button for me and leave a comment and here's why those things are important it doesn't do much for me in terms of my ego i mean i appreciate it but what it does is it tells the youtube algorithm that this video is doing something for people and it sends it out to a lot more places makes it more discoverable so the more likes and comments you guys leave it makes this video more discoverable for other people to actually get the help and find information they're looking for so please make sure to take a second hit that like leave a comment even that comment is just hi anything helps so appreciate that also if you want to see more of these videos you guys make sure you subscribe uh yeah to the channel because we're just beginning into the beginning of the tesla series we just released number 10 and we have a lot more to come if you're trying to learn for if you're a new person to the tesla or even a veteran who's trying to get used to all the stuff that the actual tesla can do now uh this is the place to find it i'm gonna keep very detailed small videos as you
