Thanks to Hello Fresh for sponsoring this
video. I am always on the lookout for fun things
to do with my wife. Hellofresh is a meal kit that turns the chore
of preparing delicious home cooked meals into a fun activity we can do together. “There’s no need to show off for the camera.” I think the only thing my wife likes more
than making these meals is filming me making them so that I can share with you. “Now your other arm is in the way!” Hellofresh comes right to your doorstep with
fresh, pre-measured ingredients and easy-to-follow recipe cards. “Nice tiger claw.” They have three options to choose from: classic,
veggie, or family, and you can switch between them whenever you want. “Mozzarella!” HelloFresh is America’s #1 Meal Kit and
the best value from $6.99 per serving. Get started today with 8 free meals - that
$80 off your first month of HelloFresh. All you have to do is go to HelloFresh.com
and enter practical80 or just click the link in the description. Thank you for watching and let me know what
you think!
