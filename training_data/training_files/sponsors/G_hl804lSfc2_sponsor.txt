Thanks as always, fam, and extra big thanks
to our current Eontologists, Jake Hart, Jon Ivy, John Davison Ng and everyone’s favorite
hominin, STEVE! Do you want to join them and have me maybe
mispronounce your name and make fun of you? Then go to patreon.com/eons and make your
pledge! Now, what do you want to learn about? Leave the dude a comment, and don’t forget
to go to youtube.com/eons and subscribe.
