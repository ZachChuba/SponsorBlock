Hey guy, welcome back. So it came to my attention this past week that a Twitter and Instagram parody account called @CollegeStudent is taking my "road work ahead" Vine and turning it into a sticker, which they've generously offered me zero percent of the profits for. This isn't at all surprising to me, as this is very much in line with the business model these accounts tend to follow: Steal shit, make money. In fact, if you want to hear me rant about accounts like this for about 27 minutes, You can click on this video right there. But here's the thing: I'll be the first to admit that this Vine has become incredibly oversaturated, and is, in a lot of ways, the bane of my existence. That being said, if anyone's gonna be making money off it, I'd like it to be me. I thought for a long time about how I should handle this and then I figured, "You know, what? Why don't I just do exactly what they're doing to me and steal their design and sell it myself? What are they gonna do? Sue me?" If you guys want one of these go to drewgoodenshop.com. They're only three dollars or one dollar if you buy the shirt. Whatever you do, though, just please don't buy theirs because all you're doing is supporting people who steal shit and people who steal shit are the worst. Unless they're-- Unless of course someone stole something from them and they're just stealing it back--that doesn't count. That's different. That's different. Anyway, thank you guys and enjoy the rest of the video.
