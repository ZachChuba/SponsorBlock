But before we jump into
it, I want to say thanks to our sponsor for today's tutorial, which are the good folks
over at Squarespace, and if you need a website, which you do, if you're an artist at all, you need somewhere to send people, a portfolio, a store, a blog,
it doesn't matter what it is, it's an all-in-one platform where everything's taken care of for you. You don't have to install
anything, patch, upgrade, none of that, I've been using
them myself for five years, the wife uses them, the
whole family's set up. Tons of award-winning designer
templates to choose from. So, something for everybody. 24/7 award-winning customer service, so if you ever get stuck,
they've got your back. Get your domain set up
and just get online. Head over to squarespace.com/mckinnon, enter code MCKINNON at check-out, and save yourself 10% off. So, bo, done, save some
money, get yourself a website. And grab your computer,
sit down at your desk, open up your phone, turn
it landscape, whatever, put your headphones in,
take them out, let's go.
