is brilliant.org. Brilliant is an interactive learning website
which focuses on problem solving and deep understanding rather than memorizing trivial

are these Daily Problems, which are a great way to stay sharp, and nothing gives you deeper
intuition than putting your problem solving skills to the test. See if you can solve what happens if you cut
a mobius strip in half, or how many squares in this grid contain the blue square. Signing up is free, but for a 20% discount
