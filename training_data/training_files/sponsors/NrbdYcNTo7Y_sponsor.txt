In the first video about Flood Basalts we
have learnt what Flood Basalt Eruptions are and what scope they had. We explored using
the example of the Siberian Traps, which are the remnants of one of the largest of these
eruptions in history, what impact this kind of volcanism can have on our planet and its
inhabitants and we have learned where and when else these so called large igneous provinces
arose.
