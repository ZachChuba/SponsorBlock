Something our brains don't need to do, is remember lots of random passwords. Which is why the sponsor of this video is LastPass. LastPass is a password manager that offers unlimited password storage plus free sync across all your devices, and password breach alerts. That way you never have to remember another password or write it down, look for one, forget your passwords, reset them. All of that hassle is just pushed aside and you can put your passwords on autopilot with LastPass. And that way you can free up your valuable brain space for just being bored and thinking about your life rather than remembering your passwords. Now, LastPass has multi-factor authentication which is super important because it keeps your accounts secure. It also interfaces with Microsoft and Yubikey's multi-factor authentication. And one feature I love about LastPass is it allows you to share, safely and securely, your passwords with other people who may need them for certain accounts. That's a very handy feature.
