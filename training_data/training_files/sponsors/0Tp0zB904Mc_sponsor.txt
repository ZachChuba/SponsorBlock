And like always, I'd like to thank everyone
who supports the show on Patreon. We couldn't do it without you, this video
or any other video. And we're so glad especially now to have your
support. If you'd like to join our community, there's
a link down in the description you can learn more about that, and if not, we're just glad
you're here this week.
