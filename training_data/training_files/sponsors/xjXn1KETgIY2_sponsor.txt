but if you want to send me a tweet you'll
have to log into twitter first, which means you could probably use some help from Dashlane. I don't know about you, but forgetting passwords
has always been a problem for me: I'd sign up for a site, use it once, and then next
time I came back I'd have to just reset my password 'cause I couldn't remember exactly
what I put. the only way around that was to use the same
easy-to-remember passwords over and over, which is a huge security risk, so now I use
Dashlane's password manager instead. it not only remembers my passwords for me,
it also generates super strong ones, and all I need to do is remember my master password. plus, Dashlane comes with a bunch of other
security services, including a VPN to prevent you from being tracked online, and dark web
monitoring so if your password gets leaked in a data breach they'll notify you and you
can change it before you actually get hacked. if that sounds good, you can try Dashlane
free for 30 days with the link in the description, and if you like it and want to keep going,
