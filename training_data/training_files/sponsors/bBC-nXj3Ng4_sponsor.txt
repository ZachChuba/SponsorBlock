I also want to thank Protocol Labs for their
support of this video. This is an organization that runs a number
of research and development projects, and if you follow the links I’ve left in the
description to read into the details of these projects, you’ll notice some strong parallels
with the concepts covered in this video. The challenges and benefits of decentralization
are by no means limited to currency and transaction histories, and the usefulness of tools from
cryptography like hash functions and digital signatures are likewise much more general. For example, a couple of Protocol Lab’s
projects, such as IPFS and Filecoin, center on distributed filestorage, which opens a
whole field of interesting challenges and possibilities. For any developers out there, Protocol labs
places a high value on open source, so if you’re interested you can join what’s
already a very strong community of contributors. They’re also looking to hire more full-time
developers, so if you think you might be a good fit for some of these projects, definitely
apply.
