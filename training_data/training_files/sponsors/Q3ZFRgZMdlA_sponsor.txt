you about our sponsors right spectrum oh I got some blast for you yeah which ones you want that one alright let's see you've probably got the lady ones actually I like these ones staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes and make it tougher to fall asleep spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at a computer screen where you still get to stare at the computer screen using a software solution like flux and Twilight doesn't give you the same type of filtering that these do and spectrums lineup includes many stylish frames high high quality products with a one-year warranty low color distortion so even though you're filtering blue light you're still not looking at just the entire world as though it has a big yellow like sheet of you know Cinna foil on it and the highest rated among their competitors on Amazon so they are primarily focused around Canadian and US customers but they are expanding to Europe and they offer shipping internationally next up this is interesting well now that you did I think you did it better did I yeah I think so hold on let's try it let's try again okay you go first we'll let the audience judge okay hold on the time okay well that will let twitch chat just spin it and tell us who did it better okay okay ready three two one okay I think you won I cracked up okay okay thank you I'll bite my cheek I'll buy my cheek all shout is getting timed out automatically by the bot right now so there's that okay Kel look that's my weakest one I want to see what twitch ad says I saw a lot of me yeah James James apparently James win good job James thank you ladies and gentlemen we have a sponsor that has been gone for a while but is back now synergy if you're an IT professional or power user who uses two or more computers at the same time they're run a different operating system on each like Windows Linux or Mac OS you could have a severe keyboard and mouse problem you probably have a bunch of them strewn across your desk and it's hard to remember which one goes to which one that's annoying synergy helps you fix that problem it's a software download that combines your desktop computers into one cohesive experience so you can run a single keyboard and mouse across multiple computers seamlessly including being able to just move the mouse across them and being able to copy paste files drag and drop files all that kind of cool stuff so check out the link below the video that's seamless concise synergy / at Linus tech tips to learn more and then finally we've got moss it was hard to tell the difference I'm actually using one of their backpacks right now I quite like this one so this is the MAS organizer does yours have the orange inside I think I rave about this like every time yes but I love that and you use it every day so do you notice it when I'm looking for something in the bottom of my bag yes it's just I can't now let's see if the one that is on the show actually has I'm sure it does I think they all do oh really yeah I think that's kind of a thing because their logos or injury so it's got an expansion zipper so you can increase the capacity or decrease it yeah personally I don't find that that useful because I want my maximum capacity all the time I do the same stuff but it's slightly wider and thinner oh it's got a wider and thinner quick access pocket so is that this one I don't know what the quick access pocket is but there you go this opens up a lot this is some of the thread used to make the black pack I think they meant backpack no that's the name of this oh oh the black pack oh cool yeah so it's apparently really strong this is a handwritten note in here some of our sponsors are hilarious I love that kind of stuff hello yeah that's super cool okay whoever wrote that note ten out of ten okay now don't sandbag this okay well I want to try first okay don't sandbag it break it if you can okay he's been doing him a lot of working out lately yes you got it no no no no that came off I need more tips your hands or small oh I think I can it did you break it yeah okay so you managed to break it yeah can you do it again oh wow it cuts into you before it breaks I'll tell you that much yeah yeah I need more okay okay all right not bad terms of other features so they've got a sunglass holder in the top that's been really handy on mine I have that same thing as well this one doesn't have quite as many pockets as mine frankly I don't end up using them a lot of the time anyway oh and this one has their built-in power strip thing so you cable manage that through there's a hole somewhere around here can't remember exactly where it is but there's a cable management hole and then it's got a regular outlet and it's got a couple of USB ports so the idea is you can actually have all your devices and stuff like cable managing to your bag so you can charge the whole thing by just Oh am i holding it out of frame free by just plugging in this one plug and then it just sits there and all your junk inside charges including your laptop because it does have a full AC power I'm sorry for doing that to you that's got a tablet holder as well as a laptop pouch and it's got a five-year warranty it's got a removable chest strap and uh yeah that's pretty much it basically good stuff really comfortable um I was using another bag for a little bit before this one and I don't remember what this one's called and I don't think there's a label anywhere that says what it's called that I'm sure you know I'm sure you'll find it on their website so that but see it's got a few more little like management things and especially this pocket the second pocket I think this one's bigger it's got a few more little things that I can put stuff in but I end up just kind of checking everything into the bottom I believe that's just called the moss pack so the pack I guess so I did I did I busted it twice okay by brick the amount of effort that went into busting one thread was was quite high try again it kind of hurts I know but I want to do it now now that you did it I wouldn't have felt that if you couldn't do it oh yeah like it doesn't feel like it's not comfortable yeah I think I almost cut myself how like a few times got it there you go okay okay so there you go moss challenges but it's a single threat Wow so like yeah I know it doesn't feel like I'm good yeah yeah I've got this thing that's not a hand to wrinkle that only hurts yeah
