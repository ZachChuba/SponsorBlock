is this episode's monster now throughout
the episode and throughout a lot of episodes actually we've been using
epidemic royalty free music because guess what it's super easy for creators
like us to find music that we're looking for and fit it into the Edit know you
know stems are I guess what epidemic actually lets you listen to stems in the
player itself which is one of the things I haven't seen a lot of online music
libraries do now obviously John does not use a service like epidemic however we
do and we use it all the time that's specifically because it's not really
possible for us to hire a composer for all the YouTube and content that we do
epidemic actually starts at about 15 dollars a month for the creators license
which is good for pretty much 30,000 plus music tracks which is probably more
music than your everyone to need in your life so if you're interested make sure
you click on the link in the description down below to get a free month of
epidemic and 480 mogul viewers that are watching and want to use music same way
that we do you can actually use the promo code Indy mogul within the next
two weeks for an additional free month
