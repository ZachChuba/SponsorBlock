hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new Ironman loot video for you all today so today I bring you guys loot from 3000 to czar ket and this is actually the stronger and enhanced version of that monster because the original one that came into the game September 19 2005 and at a combat level of 149 you know I didn't think that that video would do too well so I wanted to kill the stronger version of basically the same monster this one being at level 221 and this one was released into the game June 1st 2017 so these strong Goethe's ARS can be located in the inner area of the city which the big difference between these two toys ours is mainly that these since there's such higher combat and so much longer to kill do actually drop the obsidian armor pieces and the other two Czar's do not drop the armor pieces they're just known for dropping the weapons as well as the obsidian capes and there is one small requirement in order to get to this area basically you just have to show a fire cape to the guard right outside the lava vent and once you show your fire cape you will be let in and there's a lot of cool things that a lot of Iron Men accounts can access in this area also some nice fishing spots for mains and do think this is one of the banks that people use when they're about to kill suck not that I would know anything about that of course and if you are curious on how we did track 3,000 kills for this video unfortunately I couldn't use a bone crusher and I wasn't using rune light at all and you can't really find Cesare Zahn any Slayer log that I know of so I went all old-school and I did track all of the kills in this video through range XP averaging about 800 range XP per kill I did realize that once I hit 2.4 million XP past my initial start point there would be 3000 kills kind of reminds me of the very start of the series when a few videos I did actually have to rely on XP so there's always that when it comes to killing a monster pretty much as old-fashioned as it gets but it did work out pretty well and obviously that means that we would hit our third 99 on this Iron Man account that being 99 range and before this video actually did till minute s our monsters on this account for range levels and that's why I already had 43 insult heads in the bay on top of almost a full obsidian set and a lot of weapons and capes from just months before maybe even years before when I was killing these two trained range up but it's no worries because it did take a screenshot of all the drops that I had beforehand so that there would be no confusion when doing the price check at the very end and just tracking all the new drops in general certainly didn't take a lot of time to start seeing my first couple drops the Obsidian mall as well as the cape and the shield are all one in 512 the price of the Obsidian cape was much more than six hundred and thirty K which is what it's valued at as of today but I think the price of that just kind of varies depending on how many people are killing to Czar's because this is actually a slayer task and I don't think it used to be however if you do get a Chad task while doing Slayer I think you can opt out and substitute it for a lot of tzur monsters and maybe that's why the price of the obsidian cape fluctuates so much but I'm honestly not too sure and while the Malda shield as well as the cape are all one in 512 the obsidian helmet plate body in the plate legs are each one in 2,000 and just a couple hundred kills into the video I did actually get my very first plate body so I was very surprised to see that so early on and while I already had a placeholder play body and plate leg in the bank the main goal for me of course was to get as many obsidian items as I could on this account this accounts really just the unique Iron Man you know it's not going for any specific goals in the long term really just trying to make it stand out as much as I can there was really curious coming into this video to see how many obsidian items that I would get I won't spoil anything for you guys but I got very very lucky especially at the very beginning you know my luck was shining bright like a diamond just like that diamond in the inventory and what I mean by this is just a few kills after my plate body drop I did manage to get my obsidian helmet the very first one that I did get on this account valued at just about 564 case was the last piece that I did need in order to complete full obsidian and while the GP value doesn't really matter because this is an Iron Man account it is important to note that this helmet would cost about 84,000 toku or tako not too sure how to pronounce that if you were to buy it in the armour shop which you can also find in this city that was mainly how I actually got most of my obsidian pieces early on on this account because I just had so much taco saved up from all of the other obsidian monsters that I killed before these ones were released into the game so yeah for any Ironman out there you can't actually purchase these obsidian armor pieces in the store you just need to have a lot of tacos saved up and if you are curious as to why people use obsidian armor in general it is basically a 60 defense tier armor and it's really good strength bonus and it's pretty affordable even for main accounts luckily the damage does stack with a berserker necklace so if you're using an obsidian sword as well as a full set of obsidian you'll definitely be hitting pretty high and getting some pretty good strength XP and nightmare zone if you decide to use it there and in the thirty seconds that it did take to say all of that we did actually get two more obsidian capes as well as our second obsidian helmet so yeah the drops just kept on rolling in followed by of course all the common drops which I will touch on briefly but first things first we did of course pull off ninety eight range all from the Dornish in crossbow did start this video with about 20,000 bond bolts which actually was just the perfect amount that I needed for 3,000 kills and most of the range levels on this account were all safe spotted whether it was with a rune crossbow using broad bolts or of course the Dorgan crossbow using bone bolts I think I only chin maybe two or three levels and the reason I stopped cheating on this account was because I actually died for about 4000 red Chin's one day many years ago I think I was actually trying to find my uber eats driver and he got me killed for all those chin Champa so rest in peace but after that happened I pretty much just stuck the safe spotting and while it may be slow is certainly is nostalgic so at least there's that and if you are curious as to why I didn't use an archers ring imbued for this video which definitely would have helped me in the accuracy category also would have helped me speed up some kills mainly because I was trying to make this as afk as possible because sometimes I was on three accounts other times I was just focusing on a boss video on my main so substituting the archer ring with the ring of wealth made it so that every single time that I got some taco from every single kill that I did it just went straight in my inventory and I didn't have to pick it up every single kill so it really did save me some time and definitely a lot of effort over time and here we are over 1,000 kills into the video and we did receive our very first pair of obsidian plate legs completing the whole set from scratch was really nice all from Peavy aiming no purchasing or anything like that in the store that was a neat little accomplishment definitely makes the bank look nicer now to touch on the other drops that you can't expect from these twos are monsters just looking at the bank tab here you know you can expect some insult heads not too many but the prayer XP does add up if you kill thousands of them of course you can expect a lot of uncut gems sapphires emeralds rubies and diamonds diamond however compared to the other gems is rare the other ones are just considered to be uncommon speaking of rare and uncommon just about 10 kills after my obsidian plate leg drop I did get a plate body as I needed another one you know what I mean for the collection and all that oh yeah the luck did continue I was typing a lot in game because you got to understand a lot of these skills were spread out across days sometimes a week so sometimes I just forgot that I would type in a prior clip and then I would just end up typing in like every clip so to my deaf viewers out there that is for you a lot of people always judge me for typing on screen what can I say you know I'm not the best at editing and I'm certainly not the best at creativity so I got to make these videos a little bit different from everyone else and I guess that's how I do it so you know that's kind of why I always do the typing thing if you were curious oh yeah the last drop that I didn't touch on that is actually pretty rare as well but do add up over time you can get them in a quantity of anywhere from one to four that would of course be the onyx bolt tips I do see here on the wiki that you can also get a drop of 20 of them but in 3,000 kills I gotta say I don't think I ever got 20 onyx pull tips and one drop before so I'm not too sure how accurate that is and speaking of accuracy oh there's another obsidian plate body but yeah I was going with the Dorgan crossbow for this video instead of a magic short bow imbued at the very end of the video though I did use 3000 amethyst arrows with a magic short bow imbue just to kind of see the difference and I will say that I should have been using a magic sharp Oh from start to finish the distance is much greater some more obsidian plate legs for me and the hits are a little faster so I would say or at least they hit higher I should say and there's another helmet you know these drops are just stacking up I wonder if the drop rates actually one in 2,000 at this point per item this luck is just crazy and I've really not even spoken about all the malls the capes and the shields really just kind of points out the most expensive and the most rare ones so yeah I'll definitely look into which method is best for you either one of them doesn't really cost too much because arrows and bone bow aren't that expensive in general and no matter what safe spotting method you are doing whether you're using arrows and training range or just throwing spells and training magic the endgame goal of course for us all is that 99 and ladies and gentlemen this is the third 99 that I did get on my Iron Man account that being 99 range almost all of it was safe spotted a little bit of it was chin but not too much and it did take a very long time to achieve so I was very happy about this one and even after getting 99 range starting at 97 with this video I still needed just about 400 K more XP in order to get to 3,000 kills overall but of course I wanted to upgrade my setup just a little bit you know fashion scape wise I had to get something matching those Ranger boots so I did go ahead and hit up the range guild and with 198 K it purchased myself two range capes and I definitely will say I won't be taking this off any time soon so yeah really nice to get this on this account like I said before and at this point in the video that's kind of where I decided to just say let me try out a magic short bow imbued and let me just kind of see the difference in DPS and kills per hour I never really calculated my kills per hour in this video as many hours as it did take I just didn't really feel a need to but I would say no doubt about it that I was not getting any more than 35 to 40 kills per hour and this was always being a fk'd so I never prioritized this account or anything well that's not too bad I mean especially at high range levels with decent bonuses and all that it could have definitely been much worse so your level and your gear and your bonus all depend on how many kills you're gonna be getting per hour but I'm sure most of us know that and to finish the video I did pull out the Robin Hood hat to match everything and just kind of end in style so yeah this did take over 100 hours to do and finally we did finish loot from 3,000 to zark at 3000 amethyst arrows were used as well as 20,000 bone bolts in the making of this video and of course 99 range was achieved like I said the only regret that I really have for this video is I probably should have been using a magic short bow the whole time you know for those of you who didn't know the guy who's ranked 1 in old school runescape in the skill range who's 200 mil range XP he actually got all of that from these two czar monsters they were the lower level ones but he did safespot them all from I think level 80 with a magic short bow all the way up until 200 mm and XP so if you guys think this took me a while just imagine being him a big shout-out to metal shadow will certainly always be remembered for such an amazing accomplishment all right so now it is time for your guys's favorite part looking at the tab beforehand just so we know how many heads and how many items to bring out in the inventory for the price check looks like in three thousand kills overall we did receive just short of eighty thousand taco almost enough taco to buy an obsidian helmet fun fact I think if you have the Kurama gloves you can also spend less total for more items that is something to keep in mind looking at the armor pieces though we do have five shields four capes five malls four Helms three plate bodies and two plate legs over 144 insult heads alongside 151 onyx bolt tips 69 emeralds 149 sapphires 35 rubies and 21 diamonds alright let's go ahead and price check all of these items guys see how much we made from all these twos are monsters ridiculous amount of dedication for this one and I don't really say that much yeah if I was using melee and you know super combats and just praying melee and face tanking them I definitely would have done this much faster like I mentioned before this is a common Slayer task so you don't have to save spy I guess I just like making things longer than they have to be alright ladies and gentlemen let's finish up this price check though so we just had about 2.2 mil and every single item except the obsidian ones so that was just the bolt tips in the gems and overall from 3000 to sark at the enhanced and the stronger version of them comes out to be thirteen point two mil gems onyx tip since old heads and a great collection I'm super happy about how this one turned out and I really hope you guys enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed doing it so yeah thank you guys very much for your support and you know if obsidian items ever do go up in the future you can expect this to be a little bit more money but as of right now the price is what it is and that's it for now until next time guys thank you so much mr. no sleep ow
