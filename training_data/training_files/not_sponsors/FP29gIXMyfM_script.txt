[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Saiyan powers for my next pet steak okay we are on the way to a spirit tree we're gonna go to proof thinnest and start from zero every time I get a pet on this account I stake my entire bank on the last video I staked three hundred and seventy four mil and unfortunately I lost I am now a deficit with three losses and two wins to bounce back from this monumental loss I've decided to do the corrupted gauntlet the gana is the best money making method in the game provided you have zero capital welcome to Varig you poor bastard that's so mean why is it shame what are you canceling me nothing needed here just a spirit tree to preferred in us the corrupted gauntlet is a solo minigame improved in us in which the player is given a limited amount of time to explore a randomly generated dungeon thanks wiki the best possible loot you can get from this is the blade of cell door which currently sits at around 150 mm the blade is 1 in 400 and I plan on doing this until I get one a lot of the money that I'll earn in the gun that will come from an item called crystal shards crystal shards are untradable but I can use them in tandem with other items to make money unfortunately for me I made a huge mistake before I got cleaned I should have invested in some herb low levels because the best way to make money with crystal shards is to use them on super combat potions to make divine super combat potions provided I get a blade of cell door Lou I'm going to be using the cheapy i make from that to get the herb low level so that I can then crush the shards into potions oh my god ok pause the music despite diet gauntlet guys I have times my bank by 3000 yes first corrupted gauntlet Casey since losing my bag let's see what we get come on times 3 6 9 12 18 times 9 my bank guys new PB 11 minutes is that fast no ah I can't doing I just did a blue one because I'm getting a bit frustrated to say the least with the red one I'm gonna now show you a death compilation and how long it took me to learn to do the corrupted gauntlet piece of bollocks bro honestly I can't get my prep times good I'm just gonna log out honestly like what's the point I only have one weapon here which is the bow which is the best weapon you need but I didn't make another weapon because I ran out of time where am I going why am i running I'm dead no [Music] yes let's go okay guys we have a bank value of one mil after doing only one hour of the gauntlet and I didn't even get any unique so this is a very very good money making method considering you need absolutely nothing to start it apart from the quest 400k Bank yeah I'm gonna buy a rune pickaxe and do some late night is okay now ruff all right I don't even remember where this is guys first it's okay no Casey since I got cleaned the chats blurred because we feel people are really toxic and it's okay no okay all right I'm done you ready for this boom 42 Casey did 30 kills bro absolute stunts were made let's do a price check all right let's slam everything in for 1.5 7 mil plus the shards that's pretty much my entire bank value right now I've been keeping a little bit of a secret in my bank I have three dark totems in there which I can use to kill Scottie so which gives me guaranteed clue scroll drop so I'm gonna go use those and kill some Scotties I got a hard clue from our first Scottie so kill Oh mate that's a very nice clue shame pages are down though one major all right we got our second hard clue from Scotty's er 322 cares pretty decent the rebuild has treated me so nice oh five made a Miller Scottie so here in the kills and the hard clues I think I've sunk in about four hours game place since I got cleaned and I've already made three point eight mil all right nine Casey at the gauntlet now I still don't know any of the advanced methods like the whoops walking part and five to one but all in good time and that's a decent drop as you can see by my inventory I have a bazooka necklace and an obsidian sword the reason why I've bought these early on is because I want to do some nightmares own despite wanting to train my combat with Slayer I have to do quite a lot of nightmares own on this account because of the cost of unamusing items whenever I get a pet plus I'm kind of struggling with the goal at the moment because my defense is quite low okay I'm fighting the bullet I'm gonna make divine bastian potions someone has to do that I think they're like I don't know 35% or even 50% less profit they're making to find super combat potions but I'm gonna make them anyway I've got to put this dust to good use if I want to get some good starting capital I think when I'm about 25 to 30 mil where my nightmares own gear is complete I will just stack the shards Bert oh man I'm just a bit desperate for money so we're going to make some divine Bastion potions here and this should raise my bank value to about five or six mill once I sell them okay I just got an elite clue here and my trip was about an hour long I'm still failing but I've just made 800 K in an hour I've lost him already have I already lost him I've had five minutes guys pong leanness is dead III think I lost him at Seoul K no I died is okay no when I went the other day and I think I took I he must have been outside the room I didn't notice that he left I can't afford to get him back he's just gonna have to sit I ensured him luckily but I mean I could go get him at the Chompy lands but that means I have to stake again so I'm just have to wait until I can save up a mil that's gonna take a long time yeah we go ahead and say that rude ice Tonks and nine shots ring alright new upgrade berserkering I'm gonna go in and view it please all right here we go I got my obsidian set now so I have my nightmares on gear pretty much I'm gonna go get some levels up because I'm struggling with defense at the gauntlet I don't get cocky don't get cocky don't get cocky don't get cocky don't get cocky don't get cocky don't get cocky I said bro I have this ego problem when I die I don't want to open the chest especially when there's like some like pure uim that's getting like consistent kills when he sat there by the chest like waiting for me to open it I just log out because I don't want it I don't want him to see my trout a squeaky bum just kill it what do you mean nice - how birds okay my bank value is about 312 mil it's gonna be about 15 after I make these bastion potions this is the last time I make Bastion potions I hope I really don't want to make them again but this will push me up to a 15 mil oh my god that ping was unbearable that ping was so bad oh I actually got something the first one I do off stream are you kidding damn 4.8 mildews are one in 50 along with the the Crystal weapon seats hopefully I get more armor seats than weapon C's because the weapon seats are 250 care I think but 5 mil added to the bank is so good that puts me at like 20 mil own illegally I don't know how many clues this is I think it's around 15 musters maybe 500k for my 14th master clue 500k pogchamp i am making a new investment gonna be buying a dragon pickaxe i will be using this at this ok know for when i want to chill out and not be doing gauntlet all day that's another good excuse to use some shards - oh I need another 1603 mining smoke gave I used this here and click this I have a crystal pickaxe nice Gauntlet chest 56 damn look at that armor seed which is 5 mil and Italy clue that's like my best drop so far I'm well happy with that I had to drop the clue sadly but I am gonna be buying Hydra leather here and making the ferocious gloves blade of salad please Oh got some good / bonus equipment now so I can go back and do things like Hess poor you I thought I had my how bad equipped I'm gonna try it let's go okay here we go oh let's go 70 Casey coming in let's see what we get guys oh it's 9 shards or Armour seed that's my third in there 1 in 50 right awesome in this clip I made a mistake and use my last charge of my crystal teleport seed and I alerted one of my friends and they reminded me that you combine infinite teleport see to proof dinner don't understand Elfland what do you mean you have the require maybe I need to boost my crafting level ok I made the teleport it cost a hundred shards and I get to keep it forever because it's untradable yeah Casey come in let's see what we get I just left the cameras I think I'll do this one later my first crystal weapon seed ooh I'm at one of these yeah I keep getting the armor once which is pretty lucky because they're both one in 50 one in 50 yes retrospectively crystal weapon see bro hey new PPE coming in there 8:31 still not quite zoomy but you know getting consistent kills now and I haven't learnt five-to-one yet that's the next thing I've got to do I always works walking the egg and I hit the door I'm gonna get Crowell aren't I 100k see now with the new pv 820 duke see what we get guys peep the inventory i've been camping here all day and I've been asking my reward so I have 6 mil cash just from about I think I think I think about five to six hours of gauntlet I'm really enjoying this now I feel like I'm just gonna zoom through my bank value is looking good it's about 35 mil and I'm thinking of buying TOB gear on this account and doing some budget here being okay I got the invite from my clan I mean I'm in a small friends clan called scuff unit there's some big gamers in there and we are gonna go launch some TOB okay I'm like 1.5 mil away from being able to afford a BG s and a fury and Dragon boots so I gotta go do a couple hours of gauntlet and then I should be good to go for a budget tear beasts out my last chest boys thank you weapon seed I did get a dragon Hollywood and that's worth a lot so I think I should have the money here for a BG s okay here we go about to do Theatre of blood for the first time on this account I'm very inexperienced in general but at COP I kind of suck but you tend to take void as a loner anyway so my gear setup is looking pretty good consol Things Considered - can you want to do my TOB intro for me hi guys conjugates do we're at the the tea would be if you didn't I'm doing some blood runs on I was doing my main before we've a site but now I want to try and take off with some budget Gilbey's my friends who don't actually like [Music] [Applause] what I do in this like blood everywhere dough it's me Oh God pot hop everybody a put Redemption on it's time to shine are we all alive we made it this was the hardest piece of content for me to learn within the theatre of blood p2 burçak basically you have to keep within Erb I think it's a 4 tick rhythm of going back and forth and hitting her with a whip the tick cycle is very different with a scythe but basically you want to avoid verse 6 bigger booty cheeks clapping you in the face and launching you into the nether realms off the carpet [Music] also avoiding craps helps you got to make sure you avoid craps there we go guys - Casey flying in so swiftly take me take me explode all right flying in with a serious upgrade here guys we just got a warrior ring and Bude I can / sorry - can you don't know that Shepherd it was me who PK do a teef are me coming in I'm still doing papaya tree runs because they're pretty cheap and you make a bit of money back on the papayas themselves pretty good raid from me there I didn't die at all actually no I died at bloat but bloat deaths don't count so I've heard three room balances and eighty seven vials this am I doing this right it was almost perfect for me oh my god it's mine so a bit of context - iron men have been teaching me as well as - can do is a mane scuff myth and scuff on I they've done a lot of raids each and scuff ones has not had a single purple in his name so I felt a little bit guilty going into this he really wants in a verdict all right I've muted discord see you you're stupid iron is mine now all right this was a 67 mill split I am splitting with the iron men they they have max mains so I'm gonna be splitting and they also split their loot too here we go 16.7 mills flit each that is absolutely huge for my account I am so poor this is going a long way huge upgrade happening here amulet of torture it's going to increase my DPS at theater of blood a lot and also means like a probably hop back into Slayer in the near future I'll take Farwest 1k blood sorry again ions all right back to ghana this is kc-1 fort no 139 pretty happy with that so far let's have a look and see what we get here okay a couple hours that gone then I get a new upgrade I'm gonna be buying a ham joint for theatre of blood it's a three tick weapon and it's really good for the 9 locus room which is like the little spiders you basically get to hit them faster with it do not pick up my ham joint fons runaway funds ok 20k see now I'm starting to get a bit more confident at the theatre of blood but I still have much to learn especially I guess the Tzar person saw a stag oh my god what what I didn't even know that was possible man my bank value is now 68 mil so I'm going through my bank here and I've realized I got 686 shards which is about I think 12 mil worth of shards I think the big brain move here would be to spend some of my money on herb law to get myself closer to 93 so that I can boost and turn the shards into super combat potions provided I have more shots I'm gonna be getting the money back from them anyway and I could do with the herb level for the future because I'm going to be losing lots of steaks when I get pets so it'll be very very useful for me to have 93 herb law so last night I learnt a method called five to one where you essentially use your bow for five hits and then you either kick the hon left or you use the magic weapon - why am i trying to con treat during this whatever yeah you'll understand so that you force him to change prayers yeah I think this is a PB I had a really quick prep time I think it was about three and a half minutes oh that was fast holy not gonna lie I've been learning gauntlet now for the past week and a half and I didn't think I'd be able to do fast kills I mean that's not a fast kill by like wouk standards but for me seven minutes twelve I'm really happy with that and we get the one and fifty drop the crystal weapon seed and that my friends will be the end of the video thank you so much for watching we end this video with a huge Bank value of 73 ml thanks to that Vernick defender hill and just constant consistent money at gauntlet my gauntlet kc is now 200 some halfway to the drop rate for the blade of cell door next video I will be doing another two hundred gauntlet to see if I can get that blade and we should be on the road to Chile coin going at moon bound [Music] you
