hello everybody I hope you guys are doing well and welcome back to the daily and weekly adventures here at the Kuna me Paco aces now today we are actually starting off with a very unfortunate situation which is Madiba as you guys can see in his face his face here it is very swollen on this side and this actually happened overnight which means yesterday it wasn't like that and today it all of a sudden appeared here and we believe that it's some sort of abscess I'm not sure if it is because a tooth actually Kiara had something like this before in the lower jaw so she had a very swollen lower jaw it can happen when the tooths grow in a weird direction that it causes that but it could also be a bite from a snake or it could be maybe some sort of sharp bone ended up in the jaw or something like that we don't know it looks very bad I called the vet and he's gonna come out here within an hour now and then we're gonna have it checked and hopefully fix it right all right so let's wait for the vet we also got some other stuff to sort out here on the phone with the vet so it's going to be quite an informative and interesting day and hopefully we'll get Madiba fixed as soon as possible and the very first one of course is Queen Tyler hello my girl [Music] Oh Oh laid out [Music] all right so first we have to separate nyla that's what's gonna happen right now all right let's go my girl so we just separated nyla she's a little bit nervous cuz she just saw the car of the vet and that car never means something good they always get darted or injected with something which is not a cool scenario cool this is why she reacts a little bit you know a little bit stressed now the reason why we had to separate her I'm gonna explain to you guys right now three weeks ago I decided to not sterilize nyla because at very mixed feelings about it I was totally insecure didn't know anymore what's right or wrong but I knew it's a huge decision and I didn't want to make something which I can't reverse afterwards so last minute I decided to not sterilize her I wanna be honest with you guys after making this decision I didn't had a single day where I asked myself if this was really the right or the wrong decision I had sleepless nights and reconsidered my decision hundreds of times until I eventually got myself a second opinion I called my friend Kevin Richardson kevin is also known as the South African lion whisperer and to be honest next to Steve Irvin one of my biggest idols ever I used to follow his journey already 15 years ago and he's one of the reasons why I dedicated my entire life to the mission of bringing animals into people's hearts I specifically called cabin because he has more than 20 years of experience with captive Lions he knows all their stages their behaviors better than no one else and if there is somebody out there who could give me truly an honest opinion out of his own experience regarding my current situation I couldn't think of anyone else than Kevin explained in my situation all my thoughts around it as well as my concerns now long story short during that phone call there came up a few major arguments which really made me change my mind and I would like to share them with you so what if nyla gives birth to a 50/50 litter of four cups this means she would extend the pride for two females and two males after a few years I would have five fully grown dominant males and at a certain stage there's no doubts that Dexter Snow and Leah would have to push out the younger males for them to look for their own pride and at this stage latest I would have to split the pride in two we also have to keep in mind that these are all captive bred lions and the genetic pool within captive bred lines is very small which means inbreeding is a huge issue there is a high risk that due to inbreeding Nyla's Cubs would suffer severe physical problems which will be very sad for nyla and even worse for me because I'm the one who's responsible for their health and for their well-being here at the hakuna Paco aces now keep in mind my responsibilities here at the hakuna Paco aces is to make sure that all the animals here have a beautiful long healthy and happy life allowing nyla to have babies would from a long-term point of view cause severe problems within the line product keep in mind these lines they know each other from a young age they grew into this structure of pride and the chances are very high that this is successfully that they can successfully live in this constellation all together and the last thing I want to do is to risk to lose that harmony which currently exists within that pride just because I extended and changed the structure because they reproduced in the end of the day everything is easier said than done but keep in mind it is my responsibility they live in my care and I just don't want to enter any fields of risks which I don't have under control so after all I decided to sterilize nyla in order to protect her as well as the pride from future problems so as you guys can see I'm only human same as all of you guys and if I feel that I'm on a wrong path I do change my mind again and I'm not too proud to stand up and say I realized that I made a wrong decision and I want to get back onto the right path so if you ever made a commitment and afterwards you felt like you made a wrong decision then don't be scared to change your mind again and get back onto the right path it is better to admit a mistake and walk the road to success then to walk with regrets the road to failure alright so very important for a procedure like this is that we have a quiet and clean environment for the vet to work on the animal so underneath the lapa which is the outside area of the house we are now just preparing everything that's infecting everything and setting up the rear properly so that the vet can work perfectly on the animal and this is what's happening right now [Music] so we're just done with preparing this area here where we're gonna do the procedure on nyla we sterilized this table we did set up some spotlights as you guys can see so that the vet has good light while working on nyla and then we also decided that we can do the procedure on Madiba out there in the shade on the grass because it's gonna be quite a dirty and messy procedure with all that blood and so they just went to Madiba to tranquilize him I'm gonna go there and help them bring him over here and then we're gonna start first off with Madiba and making sure to get rid of this whatever he has in his face wishes good luck all right so I'm here with Kobe and Madiba now as you guys can see Madiba is already sleeping very well so we'll have to split them now and take Madiba into the lapa or close to the lapa where we can do the procedure and make sure to get rid of this thing and find out what it is [Music] we found I think it's just an abscess the two seems to be funny so weird as that comes from from outside Phil is calculating it most likely outside because on that side you know you I put joystick right so we can take a bit cycle period wonderful all right so we just brought Madiba over here into the shade right next to the lapa we're going to do with the procedure now as you guys could hear from the vet before it's not from the teeth it's not from inside it must have been something from outside like a thorn or something like that hitting his face and causing that abscess we're going to get rid of it now and hopefully it won't come back again right [Music] all right so they just shaved that part which they're gonna cut open which is very important to keep it very clean because every time you open the skin and blood is coming out that's where you risk to cause an infection as well [Music] alright guys so now the next challenge will be to bring nyla from over there into this management camp behind me that's a fenced off little corner where it is way way easier for the vet to tranquilize her because she knows the vet she knows that if she sees him okay I got a runaway now this baby camp here as you guys can see it is a baby camp but it's still way too big which makes it almost impossible to dart her properly she's very nervous you can you can hear her breathing she briefs very short and very fast this shows that she knows something not good is happening I just made that decision for you you gotta trust me with that alright let's go over into the management can come let's go oh it's gonna walk with her into that corner and she sees me going into the management camp she might just follow me oh that's hideaway in here come into this you all right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Nayla [ __ ] she was inside alright let's try it another time niylah niylah oh good girl hey she comes again come baby okay come baby [Music] alright I see what a struggle it is she's all the way down there on the other side of the camp again now she lays down on top of the overnight water again alright so this time we didn't manage to bring you into that little management camp here so what we're gonna do is the vet and Jessie they're gonna walk outside of the camp towards an island let's see how she you know moves around and if they got a good opportunity to d'Arthur they'll do so and then and that's why I went out actually because as you know I don't want to be associated with the vet in Nyla's eyes and yeah now we just gotta wait until she's tranquilized and then bring her over and do what needs to be done all right putting some eyedrops in now just for the eyes to not get dry [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we just carried nyla over here onto the table she was incredibly heavy it took I think six went three on one side three on the other side five or six grown men to be able to carry that lioness over here unbelievable that weight alright and now we're going to start with the procedure [Music] it's not easy for me to see her like this [Music] all right so now we had to move her on to her vet and stabilize her in this position so that they can work in the lower part of their body [Music] and the quick updates in the procedure on nyla we are just busy right now shaving the belly part so that they can cut open and start with the procedure here this is actually how it looks like underneath the FIR pretty crazy isn't it but in the end of the day I made this decision for her I see the color [Music] we're timeless we're timeless why I should never sand on I feel time is an ocean and I'm nice to see tomorrow finest but I still searches you so we're just done with the surgery as you can see everything went well we're gonna move her over now into her camp and just let her wake up again all right so the major things are done nyla is busy waking up now she's briefing already quite nicely Madiba on the other side there he's already walking up and down the fence it looks like actually very good there but we're gonna give them a little bit of time now I'm gonna go out now and tomorrow morning I'll check up on them they should have a quiet time now wake up have a drink lay down sleep a little bit recover and then tomorrow I will check up on them alright I hope you guys enjoyed that session could learn a little bit something I found it super interesting and yeah a little bit confused trying to get up you're the best would be you lay down again yeah that's totally normal she's still a little bit wobbly and unsure and a little bit weak but that's because the drug is not out of the system fully yet you know I think she should just chill and when she's alone and she has nothing to do then she's just lay down so for now until she's really awake I'm gonna leave her alone again that's the best um you know that is here you know I'm taking care of you and that's what counts good morning everybody I hope you guys are doing well so it's the day after the surgery we're gonna go and check up on nyla and Madiba now but before we have to start with the course of antibiotics these are the tablets which I have to hide away in those pieces of chicken and hopefully they'll take it in very well and won't spit it out again but yeah let me quickly do that now and then let's head over to the animals all right so this is what I've just done I've got all the pieces with the medicine in here this is nyla and this is for Madiba and I've got some plain chicken pieces right over here on that side because I'm first gonna get them excited with the plain chicken and then hopefully once I throw one of them in between they'll just swallow it straight away and not chew on it because if they chew on it the the tablets.they tastes quite bitter and that that's where when we enter the risk that they just spit it out again so let's see how it goes [Music] good girl so she took all the tablets the main part is done and here we are you're looking much much better look at Madiba his face is not swollen anymore he's doing well he's full of energy everything perfect now we just need to wait for the hair to grow back and then he'll be back to normal again and now he's kind of looking like a true Viking isn't it come get boy alright so this is day number four after the surgery and I've got the antibiotics here with me there's another three days of course left and after that she'll be united with the pride again [Music] was a kid [Music] so as you guys can see our night lights back here we go look at that beautiful face he's actually already growing here all right yeah I just wanted to show you the progress of recovering nyla is recovering very well Madiba is looking great yeah one more time you can see a little bit closer we are very happy no problems at all and yeah so this means it was a huge success I hope you guys my other socials as well thank you so much for watching and see you guys later [Music]
