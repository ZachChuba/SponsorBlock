hi guys this is Wayne with the Tesla way I just wanted to give you guys a quick update on well a quick review of my twenty thousand mile experience so far I have taken this car over 20 thousand miles I am currently sitting at 20 thousand and 85 miles everything has been really good um for the most part I do have some minor issues that I've had I do want to express those to you guys or share those with you guys and let you know how those have gone for me and what I'm planning on doing about situations as you guys can see I have elected for the white seats so I had a cushion that I put a cloth underneath and I would sit on the cushion in my car and it has some black underneath like black little beads and my wife didn't know that I put a cloth and between my seat in the cushion because I wanted to save my white seats although they you know all the videos say that you can do whatever you want to do with the white seats and you can just clean them off I have not had the clean off experience that a lot of the people have had I think I'm gonna have to get my seats professionally cleaned also I had a front scrape on my bumper at the very bottom part of it I went on a road trip I'm not sure what I must have ran over or whatever to get that little scrape I took it to the Tesla shop instead of them painting just at one spot they ended up replacing the front bumper the front bumper since I do have the pearl white was a slight shade off and you couldn't really well you could tell if you were in direct sunlight with it so they had me come back in the color matched it and then they put on the correct bumper for me so that was great I did run over a curb when you're normally when you're wanting to drive this car you want to back into parking spots and I parked next to one of those parking spots that was right on the end where they had a curb I misjudged it and I started turning into the curb a little bit too soon so I have a little ding on the bottom I do plan on getting that fix I've had a couple of estimates cup of them were north of $1000 I did find another place that said that they'll do it for around 350 but I think they're doing doing that because of the coronavirus and they're not getting very much business right now so I'm gonna win on that one but unfortunately the car is very low so I did run into the curb I did hear it immediately so I did stop soon as I heard it it really sounded like i dented the hell out of my car it is a little ding on the bottom which I can live with but you know driving a car this expensive you definitely wanna get that fixed also I have these are all my complaints I'm just ranting so I have this little since I said back as far as the seat can go the seat rocks a little bit I think I mentioned that in a previous video when I first got the car I've had them come out like six times for it so far it's still not fixed so I'm thinking I'm just gonna have to live with it I am gonna ask them to come out one more time to just give it another go and see if they come up with any kind of fix since they've had this car out now for three years so hopefully I mean I noticed him my daughter has a Tesla as well I noticed hers has that same kind of rocking as well and she's also tall so hers rocks a little bit as well so I do want to get that looked at one more time maybe it's just a flaw in the car I hope the new model why with that new riser doesn't affect that for them but maybe they have some lessons learned with that riser maybe they can fix my issues there but overall this car has been truly truly amazing I would definitely buy it again I possibly would buy the why in addition to I definitely loved this car I love this 14s of it is quick I know the Y is quick as well a little bit taller so probably wouldn't fill s 40 but I would like all the extra room because I do want to put on a bike rack on the back of my car my wife doesn't want me to because she doesn't want any holes cut into the bumper area and the model y comes out comes with that little portion that you can pull out of there and put in the bumper rear bumper hitch so that's kind of cool car is definitely still the quickest one on well not the quickest one but quicker than most cars off the line so as I accelerate from every stoplight I feel like everyone else is just getting left in the dust so that's always a cool feeling I've always had slow cars all my life so having a fast car I am definitely enjoying that another thing about the tires I just noticed the other day they are starting to show some wear on them so I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to drive on these tires but I do have the all-wheel drive I have the 18 inch tires so those tires are supposedly going to last a lot longer than the low-profile tires so I'll definitely keep you guys informed of how many miles I get out of this that you've tired before I do have to swap them out I have rotated I also will be coming out with another video with accessories that I purchased for the car and things that I really enjoyed about those things as well but I guess for that was my complaints so the pros are I haven't had to spend any money on gas I work in a location that I can charge for free so I definitely enjoy that I have two jobs I have one where I can charge for free and then the other ones seventy-five cents an hour and it takes four hours or less normally because I don't let it go all the way down I have received a couple of purchases from other people where they purchased the car using my referral code so I have gotten three miles out of that so the only time that I've ever had to pay for a supercharger was once and it was $18 so owning my car for twenty thousand miles and only having to spend eighteen dollars at a supercharger is great I have had to spend more money at charged points like I said my other job said has 75 cents per hour charge there so I have possibly spent about twenty-five dollars owning the car with that as well that's not including the home charging I did go with the Tesla solar so I have solar panels now on my house to help cut that cost this will be my first month when my first bill with the solar so I'll let you guys know it if that has brought it down but it certainly did take my cost up on on my electric bill first with this this car but and now have three electric cars so I can't say that for sure that this one is the one that drove up the price but now I only charge like once a week at home and I charge everywhere else I charge at my job for the other ones that has been a it's been a blessing actually I've definitely enjoyed not going to the gas station I enjoy my contribution to keeping the LA skies blue I understand that we had the best air quality for a little bit while we were having the rains here and then you know not that many cars were going out because of the coronavirus I noticed a lot more cars are back on the road this guy is starting to get a little smarmy again I'm hoping that with how clean the air got that people will notice or will start being inspired to get electric cars or clean energy vehicles such as a hybrid that is really low emissions as well hopefully you know our la people will definitely have noticed and take notice and start making a change and start thinking about future cars I have noticed that late 2020 and early 21 is going to be they're definitely gonna have a lot more cars on the market I noticed BMW is gonna have a new eye for which looks pretty cool as well I'm not sure of the mileage yet they're talking about Oh north of 300 miles per charge but I'm sure they still won't be on the level of Tesla as far as the self driving and all that but it will give other people other options you know kind of Tesla haters I I personally am a fanboy of Tesla so I would definitely be sticking with the Tesla brand for a while at least until other technology can get anywhere close but I think this far right here is going to be my car for the long haul because I really enjoy it and the lack of maintenance that you have to do and it's tried-and-true I mean there's a lot of Tesla's on the road lots of great reviews lots of I mean there's nothing but beautiful stories out there about this car the BMW you know then they haven't had great success with the with the iSeries but they who knows maybe they're taking some lessons learned from Tesla and will improve their product so I definitely hope that other car companies can try to catch up but I appreciate Tesla for being the one that has really pushed it over the edge as far as forcing all the other car companies to try to compete I appreciate you guys for watching the video if I come up with anything else I will definitely add it to the video or make a separate video but thank you guys for watching Wayne with the Tesla Way and please like and subscribe and if you're in the market for a new Tesla please use my referral code so you
