alright let's see how it feels ready 1 2 3 since the release the model why it had some model 3 owners including myself questioning whether or not to trade in the 3 for the y know up until this point I was able to conclude I would rather keep my model 3 without even seeing the Y up close and personal now not too long ago a new model y owner reached out to me an offer to let me take his new ride for a spin and I didn't hesitate in accepting his offer now I arrived at our meeting points seconds before him and he greeted me with this Oh show me what he's done now I already knew it was a beautiful car from what I've seen in pictures and videos and that was all confirmed upon seeing it up close for the first time that is a good looking car and just from my first class seeing this thing for the first time in real life I can see the size difference I can see that it is bigger good-looking car [Music] definitely as I'm looking at my car and then I look at the Y over here it's clear to me that yes they are the same basic body style but when you look at the three it does look just a little bit more sporty right so it is like the sport version and then you've got here obviously a sporty looking car but it's just bigger and not as it's higher profile you've got a higher profile then you've got a lower profile here so they both in their own right are beautiful cars but in different ways it looks like someone took a model three and filled it up with air is what we're looking at exactly so interesting [Music] so I'm opening the door and I open it a little earlier but it definitely feels heavier upon opening it and again it's really hard to tell from video because you have to see it side by side but this door panel and door in general is bigger when I actually kind of just look at it from initially from the inside the only difference that I notice from the three is not necessarily size but everything seems to be sitting up higher and of course you've seen this in other videos it's because of that right down there these seats are sitting up on a platform sitting you giving you a higher perspective so I'll definitely get that feel once I get in the car but the center console the center screen everything looks in from what I'm seeing feels the same as the model 3 the moment everyone's been waiting for and this is something that should be on the three oh there it is the automatic hatch right there there of course is the button right here to make you close this give that a shot so now let's take a look at inside and I mean you look at this and let's just for example say right here it's covered that's essentially what we're looking at here so it just it feels more spacious it looks more spacious so as I look at this I go I want to put a bike back here piece of cake now because I don't have the trunk in the way now here is the space down here it looks a little bigger yeah it does look a little bit deeper definitely is some more space in there as well everybody likes to have extra space so this is just kind of one more thing so that's pretty impressive oh that's pretty neat how it stays up by itself I like that so it looks like you have to kind of maybe lift it yeah there we go and then you've got two compartments right here again these are all things you may or may not have seen but this is just my first overall impression now this is something I was I thought was pretty cool too let's take a look at this look at that that is so cool now of course where is that other yeah open the first one that now you have so there is an extra space in here you forgive the shadows but you know I think the reason there's this space here is gonna be for the seats when you have that third row seating in here now what would really impress me is you know of course they did go down automatically it really impressed me if they went up automatically but you know it's not a perfect world is it alright so again there is the the opening itself right here and noticeably deeper so your going to be able to fit more things in here and I like this they didn't put that little carpet in there of course they don't even do that anymore with the three this is a little bit more rugged and just Hannah has a more that rugged feel so really neat right here I like that I like the size so Mike over here said it may reconvince me to sell my Model 3 for the why how about this this may convince you after you drive my three that you want to trade the why for the three do you think that might happen hey you never know let's see what happens after we drive them from my perspective as I'm sitting here for the first time the main thing that I'm noticing is the steering wheel looks the same so does the the center console the center console and the screen looks then feels the same as I'm sitting here I'm six foot one six foot two as I'm sitting here I definitely feel like there is more room for my legs as I'm sitting up higher than my feet could go down a bit deeper as I'm sitting here looking in front of me I can see and it definitely does feel like I'm higher off the ground that there is a higher perspective from the three I'm not sitting as low but as I look back here I look in the back seat this is kind of neat being able to get more in the back and there's the back seat and of course here's the infamous no center beam right there that really is even from up here really great I love that so there is my overall first impression just sitting in the car now I'm gonna put this on the windshield and we're gonna put this thing in Drive okay here we go we're gonna get ready to put this thing in reverse and see how it goes I see him over there he's uh driving my three I have a feeling that he's full oh I got to use the key he didn't want to give me his phone I don't blame him alright so we put the key in here alright it's going to his settings it looks like alright let's put this in reverse I heard the typical motor that goes that engages it into reverse and yeah I definitely feel like I'm just sitting up higher I feel like I'm just almost feel like I'm king of the road compared to that at the model 3 right as far as it's because I'm sitting up higher it feels bigger so I feel the weight of the car it feels heavier I'm not gonna step on it just yet I'm gonna hold that off I'm gonna kind of build up that anticipation this by the way is the all-wheel drive it's not the performance version but I'm sure it's not going to disappoint me as far as the overall feel of the acceleration all right so he's got it on one pedal drive very nice so it feels the same way there has the same feel as well as of right now it there might be probably a little bit more Headroom but that being said it doesn't feel that much more spacious inside and I may feel a little bit different maybe as I get inside and from the back here I have driven an ex for a day and that obviously feels a lot bigger so it's kind of that in-between right but still it feels just as solid as the three it feels like it it will handle pretty well in some of those sharper turns will kind of test that as well I'm gonna bout to get on the highway and this will be my opportunity to really kind of step on it and see how it does here so let's do that get on the highway here alright here we go we're going to go ahead and yeah oh yeah so it definitely does disappointed feels a lot like my rear wheel drive model 3 so the acceleration now here's a thing and remember this when I was driving the s4 the first time it had that really impressive acceleration but one of the main differences was the fact that you could feel that weight you could feel the heavier weight of the car and hence the the motor was able to do what I needed to do they give you that really good acceleration but the weight itself is I knew that I can feel a little bit more weight being pushed forward so that's kind of one of the things and one of the things that I'm noticing that's a little bit different let's say I don't know if he has I'm a pilot I'm into cheffy he does he does have autopilot very nice well of course you can have autopilot I don't know if he as well self-driving or not and as you have more lanes coming in or you know three lanes turning into two as I'm doing right now it kind of still has a little bit of that wobbly feel it doesn't quite understand know what to do let's go ahead bump this up a little bit red 75 feels good but let's see oh yeah he does have full self-driving because it is stopping at the red light there we go kind of put that to the test let's see how it does as we as the light turns green light yep it's about turn green here so let's see how it does I'm going into this left turn here there you go nice response just like my three kind of has some of the same hesitations especially on these turns yeah that acceleration it's again does not disappoint in any stretch of the imagination but I've always been impressed eating with mine it's just how fast it is off the line and how great it feel that was I just saw another Tesla and it looked like it may have been a model why I live in Redding California yet to see one so kind of interesting I'm driving a why and then to see another one so main course or to see more wise something its way to these podunk towns like reading so overall I would say that this car has pretty much the same feel the main differences in feel are sitting up higher as a result it's not going to feel that as a sporty now I hate to say that because that doesn't mean it's not a sporty car it is it feels very sporty but if you were to say say the model 3 it was a 10 on the sporty side this is like a 9 don't let that fool you this car feels phenomenal it feels great it takes off like it needs to take off it gives you that same instant torque like that at the model 3 at least the long range version that I have ok the rear-wheel drive this this is as I would expect a great car and there's just no denying so what I'm going to do here I am getting off the acid here and I'm going to go ahead and see how it feels from a dead stop off the line and see how it goes so let me we got some people on there little birds there he is he's gonna vice gonna see me do this but he said he says go crazy have some fun alright so I've come to a complete stop alright let's see how it feels ready 1 2 3 [Music] whoo that felt good and I'm gonna have to do it with my three again to compare because that almost felt a little bit faster than my three well I'm gonna I'm gonna do this one more time let's see I've gotta try this one more time okay off the line here we go one two three oh it does get into that like you know you feel like that roller coaster ride that thrill as it really starts to take off but yeah the acceleration I mean there's just no doubt it's it's phenomenal alright so let's see how it feels for me getting out so being higher at the ground you know I'm I'm older I hate to say it but I'm a little bit older and I'm tall so getting out of my three is I wouldn't say a challenge but it's something I have to kind of think about so let me get out of the Y and see how it feels holy cow that is a million times better getting out of this car is so much easier than getting out of the three because you're that much higher off the ground you're sitting higher number one because it's on a platform but number two there is a little bit more ground clearance on the Y but getting out of this thing wow it is there's a big difference getting in and out of this thing okay so I'm sitting here in the back seat now here's the thing that's interesting let me take my sunglasses also get a bit more personal so as I sit here in the back seat number one first and foremost this panoramic view this panoramic shot is wow this this is one of those things where I love going to places like Yosemite and what would be phenomenal if you're sitting in the back seat and you're able to enjoy just what Yosemite has to offer when you get in the valley and just scenic views in general so alright so as I'm sitting here in the back seat coming up first thing notices the panoramic view but another thing that I really like is the fact that the floor is deeper so your knees are sitting lower it's definitely going to be more comfortable for those longer trips for the people sitting in the back Headroom I'm 6 foot 1 you know it's it's certainly there and let's not forget about the reclining seats wow it's all automatic I didn't realize that so it goes back to the position so if I'm sitting back yeah I mean having it reclined like that is I think gonna make the trip a little bit more comfortable for people sitting in the backseat now obviously they have it packed I mean your your pet it might be difficult for these seats to recline but oh it goes back 3i I thought it will only went back to you so 3 3 positions now let's see what happens ok so now I have to put the take the pressure off and it goes up 1 2 3 yeah so there are those three very nice I like that I like the reclining of availability there is you've got the cupholders as you would typically have a little bit wider with the the this sitting here so I don't know if there's if that was just a design difference or what maybe to make sitting in the center seat a little bit more comfortable I'm not sure but this is definitely a little bit wider right here and again sitting in the center definitely not as comfortable without a doubt not as comfortable sitting in the center seat here you sit up a little bit higher and you don't sit his back and you don't have a nice comfortable seat back here but yeah I wouldn't want to sit in this front a long trip so comfortably for people at this at least with this with this car because of course you got the 7 seater coming up here pretty soon but definitely feels a little bit different in the center but again as I look in the back here everything feels the same from the handles to the opening the door the speaker there is a speaker up higher as opposed to the one that said closer to the ground here so that's a little bit different design and as I look back and oh there it is that's what I was wondering about the 12 vaults a hookup in the back there that is pretty cool I like that well as we all know there is always some bad that comes with the good now let's be expected there are some fit and finish issues on the exterior of the car panel gaps and misalignment in him a few on the inside there is some separation of the panel on the backseat and one of the lovers to fold down the backseats sticks one of the coat hangers doesn't fold down after pressing it now the car was delivered touchless meaning Tesla dropped it off in front of his house and he had a brand new model why when he walked out to his driveway now what's interesting is there was dirt and debris in the second hidden storage compartment there was also what looked like dirt or grease smudges on the interior of the car now since it was a touchless delivery all he could do was respond to the requests and via email on his experience with the delivery and has yet to hear back from Tesla regarding his complaints so now that I've seen the car up close and personal and took it for a drive have I changed my mind not to trade in my model 3 nope don't get me wrong it's a beautiful car and as I mentioned in my previous videos fits my personal needs better than that of the model 3 however the differences between the two don't warrant the hit financially to make it happen if I was in the market for a new car and had to decide between the two I'd without a doubt go for the why despite the fact the price tag is $4,000 bigger but that's me you have to look at your particular situation and decide which car fits your needs best do you need the added cargo space do you need an extra few inches of ground clearance and don't get me started on how disappointed I am in the model wise ground clearance do you and your passengers need the added legroom is the Edit towing capacity something you need now range is not an issue because it's quite comparable to that of the three whatever you decide you're going to be happy any way you look at it they both have ridiculous acceleration rates improve over time with software updates and most importantly takes one more fossil fuel-burning car off the road so what are your thoughts on the why are you on the fence between the two cars and which one are you leaning towards I'd love to read what you think in the comments section below well that's it for now thank you all for watching and you know the drill like subscribe and stay positively-charged
