anyone in need of a website glozell green was at one point a huge name on YouTube with many of her uploads gaining tens of millions of views along with her being selected to interview the President of the United States for some reason fast-forward only a few years however and even though she still has almost 5 million subscribers many of her videos only get a few thousand views so what on earth happened to caused such an extreme drop-off before we get to that I think I need to explain how she gained all those subscribers in the first place because it's certainly not from the kind of content she's making nowadays she's been making videos for a decade but most of you will probably remember her from her challenge video she made around 2012 in these she'd eat cinnamon hot peppers Mentos with soda and other things that would lead to an over-the-top reaction I think she'd agree that the pinnacle of her career was in 2015 when the White House made a deal with YouTube for the video sharing site to select three youtubers that the president would interview instead of google choosing youtubers that cover news and politics and have deep understandings of the issues facing the country they instead chose a woman known for this what are you doing to interview the most powerful man in the world ever since her interview with the president however her channel has been going downhill year after year with there being no sign of it stopping in just a few years her channel views have dropped by over 90 percent even though she hasn't stopped making content even for dead channel standards her stats are notably bad when a person has almost 5 million subscribers and they can't crack 10,000 views on some of the content I would be tempted to believe that they're purposely trying to taint their account the most simple reason for the lack of views is that she for the most part doesn't make the kind of content that gained her millions of subscribers in the first place if you sorted her videos by most viewed the pattern is crystal clear channel received attention when she subjected herself to crazy challenges I understand why she doesn't do them anymore since for a middle-aged woman you can view them as demeaning plus the views are no longer as amazing as it used to be but when you don't make what your audience wants the consequence is your views will start to drop on top of that though the content she replaced it with is all over the place tons of random series without much direction do a person that is in a committed fan this channel could come off as kind of confusing to start watching especially if you're only interested in one type of content there's Beauty tutorials food making how to's q and a's child-raising updates weight-loss updates interviews comedy skits and a ton of other random segments the channel just feels like it has no direction which leads right to the next problem she has no a/b testing for content what most youtubers do is when they have a video that gets a lot of views they'll make more content like it and if a video does poorly they'll either tweak the formula or just abandon that series glozell is an exception because she doesn't do this on her channel it seems she'll make a video that performs poorly then just makes another one like it anyway as the saying goes insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results if you don't care about the views and want to make videos no matter if people watch them more power to you but if you're doing this as a job it would be helpful to make the kind of content your audience wants to watch looking at her channel more I was beyond baffled at how poorly it was managed considering how many subscribers she has let's take for example her Keeping Up with the Kardashians parody the videos themselves seemed to be liked by her viewers but she's given all 15 episodes the same exact thumbnail almost any other youtuber knows that this is something you simply do not do because you can't tell the videos apart and they can't survive on their own merit instead you have to watch every single one in order the first one actually did decently but because they all look the same each episode progressively received less and less views I really can't imagine what the reason is behind reusing the same thumbnail in title for all 15 episodes it basically assured us that she'll keep on getting less views I'd say laziness but she clearly puts work into these videos it's like she ran a marathon and decided to sit down right before the finish line I know I'm going to get the usual comments saying I'm being harsh but I really am trying to point out things she can improve on the idea that a channel can't get 1% of their subscribers to watch their content almost always means there's something that needs to be fixed even with these low numbers it appears that close L still get some media attention there's articles written about her to this very day she's invited to offend since she gets some hosting gigs outside of her main account so why has glozell continue to get mainstream attention even though we're following on YouTube has almost completely evaporated well it's because of the fact that she's already built up the contacts needed to get these gigs if she's friends with a person that can get her invited to an event they may let her come even though they know she's not actually popular anymore this happens a lot a person will be propped up by this industry even after their channel dies and people will just continue to pretend that they are still relevant because they like that individual watching your content for this episode glozell seems like a very nice lady and I take no joy in seeing her numbers fall but at the rate she's going I don't know how much more her channel can drop before there's just no more money to be made but up your very own website [Music]
