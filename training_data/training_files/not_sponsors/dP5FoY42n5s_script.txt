Squarespace and you squarespace.com slash cow to get 10% off hey I'm Jordan oh I'm Kelly that's cool yeah this doesn't have to be you today on messy Monday's we're gonna talk about how to talk to new people a shy person's guide a shy guy duh so if you're shy talking to new people is a definite struggle it combines the difficulty of keeping a conversation going with the carer of strangers but there are some things that you can do to make it just a little bit easier so here we go first piece of advice fake it till you make it just pretend that you're actually really good at meeting new people I mean they don't know how shy you really are so just throw out your hand and say hi I'm Jordan except you use your real name but if I act confident that's gonna make it even more awkward in like two seconds when I can't think of anything to say well that's why you take my second piece of advice ask tons of questions okay so your worst fear is a shy person is for people to think that you're boring and not worth talking to and just the overall waste of space right sure okay so avoid talking about yourself at least until you're comfortable in the conversation ask questions like so what do you do where do you go to school where are you from what kind of hobbies do you enjoy most people like talking about themselves if they can tell that the person they're talking to is actually interested well that's all well and good but what do I do when I've run out of questions to ask and things are about to get awkward tip 3 do not panic if you can't think of anything to say we all know that feeling of standing there talking to someone new and realizing that oh no when she finishes this thought I am nothing else to say what am I gonna do please Lord come quickly instead of freaking out think about it objectively for a sec I mean what's the real worst-case scenario here a long awkward silence that ends the conversation or that your social skills are just so bad that they'll think that you're weird and awkward or that like you don't like hate you forever well okay I mean none of those things are actually really that bad I mean you'd be out of the conversation if number one happened if two happens well plenty of quote people are weird and awkward so that's actually not a big deal and three you're just paranoid at this point but really at the end of the day it doesn't really matter what some new person thinks about you anyway Wow really inspiring stuff but you still haven't explained what I'm supposed to do when it's my turn to talk about myself try people have a hard time talking about themselves because they feel like anything that they share could potentially be questioned as if everything that they say needs to have a defense so what kind of books do you like to read oh I really like science fiction oh what rarely does it ever happen this way see it's called projection you're slightly insecure about the things you enjoy and so you think others are constantly slightly judging you about it too but in actuality no one cares and if someone does have a problem with it well that's their problem not yours I find your hobbies named and uninteresting picking out oh look I'm just gonna say it you're a lot more interesting than you realize if someone is talking to you they want to know about you shy people sometimes spend so much time worried about what the other person is going to take away from the conversation that they don't think for a second about what they themselves are getting out of the conversation it was nice to meet you yes it was very nice to meet you too how would you rate this conversation on a scale of one to ten and would you recommend me to your friends solution uh be a little weird have some fun and don't forget that the other person might feel a little nervous and shy too so just find something that you both have in common and run with it it could even be that you both feel nervous okay my final piece of advice is just to simple with exit strategy always have an exit strategy oh hey my name is Josh but hey I'm gonna have to go pretty soon because I'm baking cookies but we're in school right now it's a cookie class all right well it doesn't have to be that extreme or dishonest but if you know how you want to get out of the conversation from the start if you need to it'll make you feel a lot more comfortable in the conversation and it doesn't matter how awkward the exit it you know how you've always wanted to get 10% off your first purchase that's Squarespace comm slash cap oh and one more thing we wanted to let
