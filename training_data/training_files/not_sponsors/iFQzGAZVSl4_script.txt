everyone and welcome back to another episode of Minecraft but all the loot drops are random hi it's it's Oh before floats you go it's check them out thanks to them for sponsoring and so I made a I made a boo-boo I made it yeah yeah that's what tell the people about what you've done yeah so I I went and started a new random series single-player and its random loot drops and crafting let me tell you it's overwhelming okay but I accidentally over wrote the file that was storing all our info as to what block drops went in this series so I'm just kind of hoping that all we need is the blaze rods and you remember what makes enderpearls right yeah this is it's the squid cool cool so we're fine because we have a lot of gear so let's continue our quest to find the blaze rock apples I do yes you are but I well we were pre setting up I'll tell you I'll tell you how to get apples you wanna know how to get apples how to get Apple take your shovel right click some grass okay I said take your trip there you go there ya go that'll give you some apples dude how about them apples right there how about them apples though but I like my horse literally had to tank a creeper like I was just minding my own business and and the creeper came up and just like boom and I was I wasn't even like tabbed into the game I just heard it so it was like the the horse just took like was just just like a champ yeah good good on that horse dude well I've I've gone are you following me I why would I follow you yeah okay yeah I just figured let's well we just need to keep on going and hopefully find new blocks our quest once again is a Mesa biomes would be great well they also haven't dug down and found lapiz ore or gold ore or diamond door or redstone that is true that is true I feel like we in that case it might be worth like splitting in the beam somewhere oh yeah if we see ravine we can drop down into it for sure I mean there yeah but yeah because we have coordinates so it's not it's not like we have to like you know hold each other's hand as we go down this yeah and it's like okay definitely don't ride your horse into that probably I'm going this away so I can avoid the water alright you go that way do not hit my horse you oh there's a lot of skeletons got skele prod there hitting my horse poor horse protect the horse stop horsing around lop hit horse we're gonna need to feed my freaking horse dude um I mean I just did and it was fine hey I see you okay cool cool we have we been kind of canting it's all a mix-up between all the different series I've done have we been into a taiga out out even the bushes don't those are horse onto the onto the bush yeah berry bushes dude you yellow berry bushes yeah because I'd be kind of annoying oh no okay well I mean you know there's not much in there right it's just the the spruce ah there's podzol and the megataiga but I guess that's not what we're doing here so yeah alright we got ourselves a made it you find a ravine rivers a river situation but donde esto I can't esto it's an esper like here that's a story it start I mean I start to gate at star there's an actual conjugation it's all but at negative thirty forty three of five ninety one I thought we were splitting up in thirty to forty three and five ninety one I see okay I see where you're going come on horse you can not do it no no no wrong way you fool well I just I see you so you're just right there it would but I I made it over the over the river like I didn't have congratulations to you mister you fancy pants I just went over the river it was fine where you at I saw you and then you like rode off me to the coordinates I gave you 3100 593 negative thirty one hundred five seventy five seventy other us there you is hello hello hello hello alright I just I feel like let's keep riding until we find like a new biome like a Mesa biome or something and then we'll dig underground there just so we can at least tackle a new situation already and I think we did it on alive some wolves already yeah we done that we done that we've we've unaligned the nice things yeah should we get some more ender pearls in the meantime yes I don't think we grabbed ours out of a chest Oh looks wait what is it what is the squid drop cuz I don't know what the squid just dropped for me if the squid drops a I think it's a slap slap the ate the ancient oak slab writes the petrified slab and then that's that yes and then that goes a full that goes full shulker which then ender chests or not a church as ender pearls that did not get ender pearls they give me books do I remember how to get any pearls I swear to god that's the route no squid goes to library chests oh maybe that was my and what was what was enderpearls then okay I don't have any Pro written dander pros oh the fish the fish the fish Oh God rock cod yes correct yeah yes so we'll need to find an ocean and oh wait you're right here hello yellow rock cod desert salmon that's salmon hello salmon that's a little orange for cod don't you think but yeah whatever dude oh whatever okay well I guess I've got a lot of books now not that we really need them I broke on free to the other side I think I'm following you I don't know if I'm following you though I'm kind of just heading in this direction well this we're going it might be going in that direction though oh my god well I'm exiting out of this to thee I'm out I'm right by a giant waterfall on outside of that near extreme Hills okay yeah extreme Hills I'm entering the extreme Hills I see giant waterfall cool they are come on Mesa biome Mesa biome this is pretty though gosh if only it had new bloggers here if only so we did we do granite or diorite probably pretty sure we've done all that already here no horse no got Frick Frick huh horse horn horse problems your horse is right here where are you in horsing around horse oh there you are I left because my horse was horsing around ah your horse disappeared now it's like it bye frickin dude we need to find Mason what else do we have mesa ice spikes ice spikes we're never gonna find those just don't exist the other myth they're myth yeah well we might be able to find icebergs if we go sailing iceberg well we'd have to find an ocean first and instead we're just finding more oh I love forests looks like this stuff to the north I don't know if this is actually north but this is what I think of as north this is South that's quite literally South but that's okay there's stuff to the south if there's nothing less stuff to the south you mean less obstacles yes plane if you will look at this it opens up into a plane I like I like it when it's plane this is actually the mountains but we're back in do extreme Hills here but you know it's chill it's mountains biome up minecraft mountains hey really know what the heck I didn't realize that it's not going to work I know that Wow dude that's nutty I think it's a different biome that extreme eels I think you shame he'll still exist but I've got a swamp I love swamps is there any swamp on all directions right I know Mesa and Badlands are a thing like now it's a swamp don't more South Asia to the sure don't right there I don't know why I'm leading this train but really I mean it's just kind of going wherever anyways he's got the big head it's easier to follow what you've got the big head it's easier to follow I mean no you literally have a bigger head than I do right now huh this is a resource pack or no it's if you go and f5 you'll see that you have a bigger head than I do okay well what the oh yeah yeah I was like what I you just call me and I get like you know man he is a big took offense to that I you know no I actually couldn't pick up the fence so I left it back in the village poor fence dude poor fence come on it's so hard to do the jump when you're like going down well at least it's it's nice and open going here maybe we'll stumble across a Mesa biome at some point that's what we've talked about we've dreamed did I answer that there's a house thing over here house thing define house thing it might be a village oh yes this is van a village cool that could have some new blocks so we could try I don't think we hit that yellow stuff nope nope that's new that would be an amazing biome nice dude noise very snowy no horse you idiot man you were having a hard time with the horses there aren't you they won't hold hold well that gave me a new recipe for Oh literally I got oak planks but that was a new recipe out of those ok and oak planks goes to a dark of pleasure pressure plates which is dark oak planks which is obsidian dope dope doe if we know goes to nothing um a lot of us ideon what the how much obsidian like 26 wait what out of one block how does that happen I don't know I just I just work here man sorry I'm breaking down you guys door hmm oh yeah they should or this I knew Wow what up it went to granite slab and then dropped a bunch of fancy stuff on me okay but none of which was blaze rod mind you the six-sided might be new ah Salmonella time Salmonella time there we go cartography table no that's a smoker oh yeah there's got to be there's probably some new blocks inside the houses we could check out potentially orange bed might be different than another kind of bet orange bed gets us to I Ron blocks which actually if we we've made the iron blonde melon seeds is there a oh wait never mind in that way hey I got I found a feather birds of a feather flock together that's that's how it goes mmhmm yeah huh that's not gonna be a thing that's so touching I not so for anyone wondering we have already gone to the nether and it was full puffer fish I saw that was your video title yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean you know I'm learning from you you know I'm trying to pick up those expert pro tips it's minecraft but it's different oh yeah with your titling dude yeah that's the meta game right now though so gimme clicks please I mean not that not that it's all about clicks guys it's it's about more than notes about spreads all the way oh man wow wow it's why did you throw out a bunch of swords and stuff because I didn't need it I mean it's just inventory at that point there's a silk touch in there that I should have kept on but I didn't want to go through and figure it out again totally oh it's my goats all these are giving us millions if not just like things but like a lot of things I have not had such luck that you've experienced but you know I picked up like one skeleton skull and it turned out to be like 40 of them oh dang not 40 but there's a lot of skeletons skulls over here as I was like I'll just put this down and then kept having more and more until I was like I'm just done putting this down like there's a lot we've already attempted to do monetize an iron golem so that yeah that's nothing new I've seen both of those that's all the huge we've killed pigs watermelon I did that I did watermelon see it's actually not fully grown watermelon I got orange wool which was a new recipe for me and then raw caught out of that so that's where that dies huh Brown mushroom gives some stuff do we want to sleep perhaps if we can find some beds do we have it I'm not sure if any are easily accessible but everybody does nothing hopefully some of the village hmm I think you broke all the beds didn't you I'd only broke one only broke one mini bed maybe how mini bread doesn't have many breads dude doesn't have any breads all right well I guess no uh no sleepies for us nope brewing stand villager unfortunately does not sell aya vendors or ender pearls for that matter okay no I'm responding to chat making recommendations for things so I guess uh hi ho we ride till dawn did I get that lead Oh banners hold on were there banners I got one lead all right guys I got the brown banner okay yeah that was the Oh there was a house up on the hill but I don't think it had it probably doesn't have anything new hey all right so this means we're going Southwest right now uh I guess so if that's what your f-3 says probably it I see sand oh we've got a desert yeah I think we've done desert though we've had bush why I have shaders on but it's like there's no shadows or anything it's I guess it's a new moon scream time right now but usually the moon soul cast of shadows is just it's being super creepy dude out the moon cast some shadows God can you imagine if you measured and blaze rods were like a mineshaft chest or something where'd you go over here okay sorry you just got out of render distance okay I should say like a minecart chest or I guess diamond door that'd be ridiculous or you know it could be where they are shelter box a shelter drop in which case were were just straight out look we're Sol yeah and they could also be like a mob drop so that we've tried it and it didn't drop that's why I try to do everything a couple times just in case I mean I don't ever remember what I've done so I end up going last stop 47 times hold on order your foods yeah I got the order all queued up so that's that's good oh yeah it's nice do what I can't remember if there was ever a time when you would obliterate your horse trying that yeah you would hit your heart Oh God where'd you get to I fell into a hole ah that's a problem just I'm just outside of the desert in the savanna oh there you are I see you Oh see you and I've got a key okay there you are that's like I gotta keep moving there's a lot of stuff swarming around me right now oh craft all the different mine carts and break them that's a good idea actually do even the iron on us I have 55 ingots oh that's why I've seen nothing cuz it's raining and I have particles turned off with Optifine but it was only raining literally over these small water areas like desert so there's no rain no but it still has the overcast sky to go with it even though it's not a rain umm-hmm yeah we could we could man there's a lot of Savannah guy I know around here we've just forests and forest of acacia we'll find something sometime promise well we though I think we are heading straight West yes okay so I know we're still progressing wild wild west dude and nice like a true warrior firing off your bow now they're hitting me there are hitting me and more desert good God and more desert just a case in more Savannah Savannah and desert is all we get the world is arranged in a logical heat map again we're just we're getting I mean we were doing south and stuff but yeah a hill bye Joe it's a Savannah plateau that's Plateau if you will Omar if you wanted miss whoa what Oh little dippy do it wouldn't have done you too dirty don't go kaboom no kabooms oh my god Bob's desert is there really another desert holy crap it's just desert and some let's go there's a plane over here let's get out of this desert savanna loop you should say that but now we got a got to feel so dark and dreary with this freaking rain no dud rain rain go away toggle down fall another day you know we should toggle down fall today what you say that you only meant well there's village over here okay it's a new village event probably not probably not maybe it has beds that would be good that way we get stopped all right we are the foreign travelers in seek of shelter where are the other two now the villagers add that of course oh god the beds are freaking occupied there are two of them but they are ocupado he'd have to we have to take him out from underneath them well no we can't because then the bed will change into something else oh right there is there's one here though that's unoccupied oh and actually no that one's ocupado well I mean we could kill the owners mean how could you suggest such a thing I'm not saying I did I just said it was an option I can't hit anything off this horse yeah I think the horse actually uh oh wow you hit my horse oh I did yeah I'm sorry that really uh that hurt a little bit sorry oh well I got I did it I did a thing yeah yeah nope okay come let's see let us try to find a place to dock the horse right over here we shall do - doc doc the horse dockets pay ya for not being good at the whole disc IO thing Wow sorry rabbit you kind of got in the way of the arrow there all right no one to blame but your own rabbits let's see is that no that's knock you pied bed yeah this one's still actually you know what you can do leave the server leave the server really quick Wow kicks me off I was next to the bed just kick me off it's still raining because you joined too soon what are you doing you said nice you said nice I was like okay I thought I thought you got it all right here I'm gone bye-bye now we're good now you can get back on hurry I logged off and you're like nice and I was like okay no that's good that's because I was able to get in bed that's all yeah I see oh right mind these things good plan good plan that gets me a scaffolding have we already gotten scaffolding I've done scaffolding once and it went nowhere I see that's accurate didn't really go many places hmm okay whole lotta as if not enough in there you didn't get rid of some stuff from my inventory no age right back into a god dang it man goodbye okay where'd you go huh no no I'm so I was I was going down a route and then the route ended ah gotcha always was lamenting the loss we didn't create a little more desert what we can gray wolf firma sheep bread and 9 helmet I don't know if that was new or not but anyway alright well ah back into the desert I guess huh one of these days man one of these days thank God no no I don't know where you went in the desert I'm right at the edge - oh I just I was heading over to the weather South who the south yeah where did you go wait okay I mean back at the village me back in the village okay I mean you can give me coordinates but the village is in sight for me so yep yep yep I am at the village again behind you turn around Wow okay cool sorry sorry a little turned around boo you're like yeah I'm heading south - and I look I'm like that's North actually so almost completely the opposite well if we run into an ocean we should probably even if we don't know where blaze rods are yet like take a minute boats and go find the coral and oh yeah that's true coral would be a good idea there's a lot of different varieties dead coral but yeah there's a lot of that and there's a lot of different tropical fish - I don't know if they have different loot tables they definitely do one each one definitely do if ever we get out of the desert if we're talking about water when we're just stuck in the desert is it another savanna I want it looks like we got another savanna boys I want to tap it I wanted to have it Holy Mother of God wait it's more savanna does that work what no darn it I've lost you him right behind you okay it was just I was looking at that sand overhang and I wanted I really wanted to make it all fall guys we're not going in circles what is happening what is this it's oh it's a desert temple that's completely berry this is the top of a temple yeah well I have never seen this happen before that's crazy Nate's up we got a Mesa yes yes there's Mesa wait is that Mesa or is that just yeah that is Mesa dude I have never seen a desert temple that's like it's pretty cool actually yeah what the heck people are like we're going in circles yeah babe we're not going in circles if there's a Mesa biome everybody we could check with the shipwreck ludus so this is new was that noise don't know make sure we've already been in a temple by the way for everyone wondering yeah I read some walk out of that we've had double tap doors definitely chocolate wrapped doors are these what we need yep oh there we go there we go all right we've done no blocks there we go okay I'm getting a ender pearls oh yes I could use a respiration helmet that would be nice no yes I do I used to have one but then I definitely got rid of it that seems like it could have been useful to not yeah but it's not like it's really difficult for us to get hold of more valuables if we need it well I got three ender pearls so that's nice looking around looking around okay I see more caught over here nice all right I'm gonna go into the Mesa biome and just check out what we get we can reconvene at the shipwreck if you want there's ice over here whoo is this ice spikes there's a polar bear it's probably just icebergs I would assume frozen ocean and smaller bears are they mad angry no they're not not unless you like get between them in the car nice regular ice whether it has a cop God did yeah it had a cub mmm done this so breaking whatever every get every type packed ice is rabbit killing a rabbit okay I've got I've got plenty of leather and plenty of dead rabbit so that's useful um [Music] yeah there's a lot of of ice situation mmm definitely done drowned that guy's got a trident those new we actually done all these before oh yeah that's dragon head okay um there's got to be like a surface ravine or a surface mineshaft somewhere just the blue ice down here yep that's blue ice and it gives a cyan banner or light blue oh yeah if you wanna live the bear might do something oh gosh I know it has a cub though that's absolutely mean of you I can't believe you'd consider doing that I mean Oh what is that you can have like dungeon areas spawning in nice Berg's there's a dungeon in the iceberg it kind of it's a mineshaft in the iceberg I've never semi unknown yeah yeah it's very small cuz it's just an iceberg but there's a mineshaft in the eye huh I kind of want to see I kind of want to see it's right at negative here and here 602 539 did you make a boat I have not made about how you swam over to it yeah I've got got its depth straighter isn't it ah yeah I have that too so I'm zipping dippity around where hello bear mama bear will be it would almost be worse if this did turn out to be the blaze rod because they find a lot of polar bears yeah it wouldn't be great I don't know what it dropped but it didn't drop anything that triggered off the new recipes for me uh we are oh yeah we've done iron ore right excuse me sir no never mind haven't done iron ore oh hello hello polar bear so you did demonetized polar bear yeah it wasn't I'm killing one right now too but it drops a torch I got a torch from a bear nice I got a button and we have a lot of white banners good are those things which is a new recipe actually okay um I was I was the stripped birch wood you know it's cool I don't wear let's see oh it continues the Mesa biome over there is it alright five so we've are we leaving our horses behind are we going back to them what what are your thoughts here I don't know I haven't been really attached to the horse given that it's been such a pain to get over rivers and stuff I could go on foot for a bit do we want to make a little igloo and stuff I think I kind of see where you are right well let's see two five three nine huh you must be on the other side of this don't see the mineshaft though oh oh here what the heck is your name I'm gonna come make a boat if I have planks that is bizarre yeah a little strange but ahead there it was and I was like oh here it is there we go there we go oh I tried to pick up my workbench that didn't work did you try breaking the cobweb I did yeah I just followed that path and it got me a bottle of enchanting but not a great deal else zombie head guys silk touching doesn't is only impacted by the resultant block not the initial block there's OC lanterns over there actually that we could try I don't at the under underwater dungeon Oh Trident boy I kill the Trident boy but I mean he wouldn't have anything that's just really different right Wow there are a lot of us why can't I find this many Trident boys when I want them holy does you wrap them the detector rail with something new alright let's actually see what that chest contains zilch nada nothing Oh God come hither nice nice nice I need me some frickin respiration honestly Epis seems to be just read out holy cow how they hurt ya try no legis are not nice there's a lot of them and they're gurgling and smuggling you're going to smuggling um I didn't find any mine shafts over the other Mesa I'm sure it could have just kept exploring but we can do it here as well I wish granite ow oh wait have we done the cracked bricks um I did a lot of that stuff oh my lord there's a lot of things going on right now there's many man's I wonder if I can get us right in from this boy though nope I mean the train would drop from something else right I know I think that because it's a held item would actually drop definitely did those before all right so um you're in the Mesa cool cool I up here oh and you can get the boat because that'll drop itself mm-hmm and stone is new yeah I guess we could smelt it potentially in stone doesn't do anything cool yeah at the end of that train um item frame yeah that's something we might be able to crap I think I made an item frame oh did you yeah I'm up on top yeah oh my god this is our life I know each of these they do do different things what the heck is that blog huh Oh dried kelp blog oh yeah no I've been through the blocks in here the only thing I haven't found is the mineshaft what do you expecting the mineshaft mean there's I don't know there's mine there's a chest there's rails which I can't remember who got regular rails but I did detector rails I haven't done regular as I recall let's just let's keep running to the south up on top of the Keitel see if we can find an entrance to a mineshaft perhaps oh yeah item frames would drop themselves or entities good point good point usually there's a whole bunch of mineshaft entrances assuming that there are but there's not yeah in sight I can't handle it I mean I'm here for you yeah nothing well we're now at the Mesa iceberg yeah as is as is commonly found all right well now I'm going to the web that's I've got all the people I am yeah I'm rolling on one I'm just on the edge of the Mesa with the iceberg on my left okay what happened to the horses we crossed ocean they're behind us yeah I didn't want I didn't want to deal with taking them all the way alright I found some gold or not and it drops to something that we've already done the smooth sandstone slab new which then why are you like this spruce planks which then goes to a dead coral and that's where we lie I see you down there shaking it eh you're not doing that oh man first episode we find everything I know it's gray it's yes it's crazy because I have in all my solo things I have never had this much of an issue I guess I've just been really lucky cuz this is certainly a way it can go yeah I just tagged you you get out of here bro nice I got him I got for having my back don't hit my friends yeah oh thanks for having my back where were we just go out here did you not make it into the water no no no I didn't try that hard okay Brock um and their poles alright well I mean how many inter pros do you have uh three okay eight so we still need a few more so I don't really wood on me and five nice I'm gonna go over and listen I have some dark oak logs and some acacia planks okay oh there's a school of cod man there are a lot of ground here where yeah where yeah where yeah oh well it's slightly too icy yeah I saw the trail of drown going after I was like wow ice there is nothing in this chest um yeah I was checking into the round things nada oh oh I hear suffocation yeah I'm good I'm good all right man if it had been polar bears it would have been that bad there's quite a few yeah like I feel like the representation of creditors per square mile and this is is not accurate ah are you calling polar bears endangered no I'm saying that there's not enough life for those polar bears oh oh I'll be able to eat yeah that's pretty accurate you know you can only support so many predators per maybe they are filter feeders yeah yeah yeah I mean I think they will eat whatever but you know actually we try to stuff you try snow block uh I didn't I thought you when you were up on top you tried it it just turns into dark oak slab which I'm pretty sure we've already done yep yep yep yep yep this is a very extensive iceberg biome you know what we could do what you wanna I could hop in there that's what I like I was coming towards you to pick you up and then you like swam away me up dude oh they're mad go go go we don't want to turn into seals okay we won't turn into seals oh we're ama turned into seals yes I promise you this we will not turn into seals hey look more desert huh what other above-ground blocks have we not made contact with yet do you feel like we have I have eight pearls now as well do you feel like that's enough I have eight as yeah so we would have four despair which should up sea turtle sea turtle so sorry so sorry oh don't each of their eggs drop at their own thing - I mean if we if we bred them yeah we meet another getting the grass oh mycelium mushroom island that those never happened I'm so sorry guys I'm so sorry this is so bad can't watch show me it's just it's just turtle soup guys it's fine they drop cobblestone okay so I guess we have although we have all the coral blocks as well yeah try and find coral yeah okay continuing along cut off to the right hmm oh uh underwater monument on your water mono I'm just saying like that so I was like yeah if this series goes like any of my others which it hasn't so far we'll we'll just see a stronghold poking out from under an ocean huh so if everything's just like it was then we will but we might not there's Dean hmm I've got my eyes peeled underwater for any activity okay sometimes you got to peel your eyes yes Woodland mansion but I don't know if we would get bunch of new from that and the only issue with the underwater monument is that we would need to get some milk so that we can mine this stuff before you get mining fatigue or I guess we do want to destroy the Guardians to sell yeah guardians could be a thing they could drop something Oh God can you imagine if it was Elder guardians that dropped it oh no that would be horrible I mean at this point it's got to be something semi rare like regardless obviously so no matter what we're in a bad way unless it's like just diamond door and we're just you know because we haven't gone down to check it out wouldn't that be great it's greatly under drag it's the end of Dragon that drops it obviously the ender dragon drops it Yeah right there if we want to try and go check down-low or if you want like I could go since I have the respiration I could go down and you could continue looking for coral I could split up action mmm okay all right well I'm just gonna set sail I guess you have the spare wooden stuff to be able to catch up maybe I will stumble across underwater monument is possibly alright so I'm at y11 that quick like geez yeah that was real quick it I mean it literally that's where there's Slappy's drop something new I'm getting prismarine crystals from it any blocks so you can think of you can craft stuff from prison Marine but I always forget the crafting recipes for it here's some redstone which doesn't seem to give me any new recipes that's dropping some stairs um yes the wither drops it on top of another star I believe the wither does just drop the nether star it's like a it's coated in in a different way it doesn't use Lube tables it's just set - yeah another star mm-hmm and I could use a dragon eye about now oh that's all and there you are I don't know if you're dying on land or just show me your face tell me what I need to do to get out of this place can I put water down under the thing yeah what'd he mean can you put water down the table affects things weird so I just had that brief moment of wait can I put water down yeah there's we did gold didn't we yeah I found gold yep still have not seen diamond you did a diamond block right I have yes no that definitely doesn't go oh wait does it go back to the ocean and be really cool oh that's pretty cool back to the year just cut through a landmass no diamonds anywhere along there cool no don't dead-end me oh man that's River was gonna be what I needed what Frick thank you I'm just kind of randomly looking around at the moment I'm I'm just randomly looking around as well so far I've not found any new blocks that we haven't hit so all I want is some diamonds have you got redstone mask I did turn in the stairs cool and I was it's pretty sweet all things considered and I got some buttons so okay option again I don't want to be making negative progress but negative progress where is ocean how do I ocean give me ocean a lot of red mushrooms mmm nice ocean over here no terra cotta we've done before yeah everything's done before so is there any way to actually like I don't know how this data pack works is there any way for you to like look at it and figure out what it did not I'm not saying look at you and here here oh well what did look at the the data pack and figure out like what the new recipes are for things I mean you can you can cheat and look it up yeah yeah I mean and I'm not saying let's do that I was just curious like how it works you can but the problem is there's no way to like I guess you could search shulker box and just verify that it's not that at least I don't want to give up that I mean we could we could verify it's not shelters again I was asking more out of a curiosity than a yeah idea let's do that I just wasn't sure how it all works huh the technical aspects eluded me and I wish to know more from your experience and knowledge of course of course makes sense but here's the thing is it'd be really freaking great if there was you know like diamonds somewhere I guess an independent third party could potentially check and verify if it's just to ensure that we are not on a wild goose chase it is not a shelter drop but we'll see where it lands after this episode have we tried lapiz blocks ah I think we have but may as well try it again [Music] man I hate fake sneezes so you Scott Juke buy your sneeze I got I got I got sneeze duped that's never fun it's it's really not like come on man give me that sneeze and it's not where the heck did the ocean go I didn't want to just turn back but man think things you don't expect to lose yeah oh hey lapis gives us a fence cool like it'll appease block cool cool that sounds good it's a good exchange it sounds worthwhile yeah yeah um oh right we have not found a jungle to be able to break cocoa that's very trail okay okay and also you have gotten watermelon block though yes whoa look at this this is no diamond anywhere I thought I found a desert temple that generated in the world's smallest sliver of desert also kind of buried we're just we're just the land of buried desert temples now or I guess it's actually a pretty cool entrance though right on that water bamboo we have gotten I believe uh I don't know about bamboo well then I may be I'm mixing up series but then we also need to find a jungle for that oh wait that was the ocean though I should hop back in you found the ocean mm-hmm no one cares about you and cares about you no one likes you oh if we unlive to Dolphin I know I did not an alive a dolphin well doesn't drop a blaze rod sorry doll standards oh wait wait wait oh shoot I left my lead I could have sued so so freakin fast oh no how do we get leads again like I remember bro ah she I actually think I we literally crafted them out of slime balls from some oh right right oh no slime no oh we got them directly yeah yeah oh there's a I think I found a mineshaft though cool you can see the you can see what the chests have fur that's out out out out meantime I'm trying to see if I can find a coral reef plus perhaps keep close to shore and see if we can find a jungle or something like that currently it's all Mesa we couldn't find it earlier now it's all we find it now we can't get away from it guys we have done that we have broken all the temple blocks definitely I've seen all this before and another iceberg what is it with the mesas going into the icebergs and this is no definitely not questionnaire before I'm like did I just make a big circle nope it's just the exact same biome configurations repeating themselves over and over and over and over and over weird doesn't usually happen that way not normally but sometimes sometimes when you least expect it mossy cobble stairs well this is perhaps the world's most pathetic mineshaft I can hear a skeleton so actually I I could do uh more somewhere oh wait no I can't get CRS that's a big problem I was gonna be like I could get turtle eggs and I'm like oh wait seagrass gonna be problematic yeah that's what I was saying when we were talking about breeding turtles yeah I know I forgot I forgot about the whole the seagrass isn't gonna drop seagrass yeah yeah we'll never give up never surrender we will find well that was a very disappointing mine shaft I hate it when mineshaft and disappoint me this is what I'm saying we also might have to do a teepee to getting each other together potentially we're gonna be very very split apart but yeah now that's fine Trident boy don't break my boat try and put onto it Trident boy don't break my boat Trident belly won't do it try boy don't break my boat let's just go get to it making a little song for you yeah no I hurt very much that was a quality tune hey you know top notch I admit to in part of it live auto-tune pretty cool it's a thing I'm diet it's definitely for a while when I was looking at I reckoned pressors there was one that had auto-tune built in and I was like hey at some point does the hardware compressor do it better than a software uh I don't think so I think that that's what I mean if I recall the reviews weren't great on it mmm but I find with uh with with tuning is up like that the the hardest thing is knowing with each songs key is and you have to adjust it right of course you know and so that gets a little tiresome I don't know how this is working that all we have are maces and I burgers and deserts and Savannah's did we generate some spiky I have no idea it's like we're you know we're in a loop it's a non-stop loop I mean I hope duh giggle a loop it's just it's deserts as far as the eye can see it's deserts all the way down I don't I don't know that I will ever escape this biome loop that's a lot of lava no still a lot of lava Wow it's incredible it's gonna be another this many it's actually weird I've never seen it do this before oh my god what is what is this I'm gonna run out of pickaxe how how are there I don't get it wait all those spiders means there's another mole poison spider have you done poison spider nevi done the spawner I haven't I haven't found him yet okay just here spider sounds so that's why I was like wait a minute let's look around a second because I hear a lot of spider sounds if it were a poison spider that actually would be cow god yeah about it nice do it I guess hit the spider make sure it doesn't drop blaze before waking the spawner it drops oh so close what one drops a brewing stand oh man something that blaze rods make yeah that's just that's just cold right there alright another desert keeping the desert savanna theme rollin doesn't stop doesn't stop actual insanity wow I can't believe like this literally is just an enclosed area or enclosed little spawner like it was in like a two-by-two yeah yeah hey it's it's a plane which is very phantom plane it's not a desert it's true no diamonds your son diamond is open airy I've found a ravine I found an open area swimming through I'm at my eleven no diamonds man oh man it's a bit silly relentless it's a little bit silly many flowers that we haven't you found it no oh I found that my another mineshaft [Music] I think we have done the orchids in the swamp pretty done oh I think we've ran out of time I Kemba oh you find some there's a lot of poisonous potatoes some paper some carrots and wheat in this minecart chest okay that's in this mine shaft so I don't so is that it was a chest that actually like had things in it yes that's a variety of things it's got suspicious stew oh if only that were a block that could be broken Oh an armor stand you know an armor stands an entity so I'm pretty sure than an armor stand would drop itself so wouldn't be anything of interest now I found a jungle nothing would come out of breaking this cart right no the mine the minecart is actually a thing so might it might yield a new block unless it might not also be an entity so I'm not sure yeah that's what I was thinking is it's an entity um cocoa beans have got to be somewhere around here yeah Oh bamboo and cocoa beans it could be you never know could be the Thane of world where you never know it's cod cocoa bean is cod good that's what you like to see you got cocoa bean yeah I just broke it weed tea we ticked one thing off the list a and bamboo is definitely the stripped oak log that was in the village so that's good just to double-check have we done jungle leaves Xena has already done a melon I'm pretty sure so yes and jungle leaves just wait that's funny oh is that actually a that's dark Emily's just wait all they do all right well dang you had done a melon though so ah ah jungle temple maybe oh jungle town Oh God can you imagine if it was a jungle temple lute thing boy but it is it is a possibility yes hmm couple melons here doh those melons though oh well we're out of time and out of options is there anything else you want to do before we wrap up no I would I would like to keep searching but back to the cod um you know you only got the time you got yeah yep this is this is what we're looking for this is where we're at so thanks for small say I'm links in our descriptions you can save a little money have a good time and also in that same description you can find a link to the playlist catch up on any episode you might have missed then finally we do these live I'd love to see out here
