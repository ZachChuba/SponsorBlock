link below for 25% off as days get shorter and shorter in the northern hemisphere we enter the holiday season but on our channels mission of working away through humanity's history we are now a few thousand years before the first celebration of Christmas and many other modern winter holidays so how would you celebrate this time of the year in the Bronze Age cracking the patterns of the seasons of the year was crucial as we enter into this era of agrarian civilizations as planting and harvesting at the right time - the year was fundamental many cultures around the world would celebrate winter solstice when the days are shortest oftentimes the religious events of Sun gods dying and being reborn possibly the earliest recorded winter solstice festival comes from one of the first civilizations Sumer a 12 day festival known as egg mock celebrating the winter solstice and the beginning of the new year did he just rounded aren't super clear in a research tree net I found conflicting sources saying it might have actually been a spring equinox festival but we'll be using it roughly for the inspiration of this episode as it shares a lot of similarities with other winter festivals how many of these holidays have borrowed and influenced each other through history and glean some traditions that continue to today so we're going to be doing a bit of a hybrid of this Bronze Age civilizations holiday and modern Christmas traditions these materials I've sourced from the past as well as some upcoming projects it's gonna be a little weird first up let's cut a tree the first Christmas tree is thought to have been introduced in the 16th century CE II but the tradition of using evergreen trees and plants traces itself back long before and all around the world evergreens like Holly and mistletoe were considered sacred by several cultures for remaining green during the winter and was used as decoration by Romans Greeks Egyptians Chinese Hebrews and Druids in my last video I cast a large axe for cutting wood based off of a Bronze Age axe head recently discovered coincidentally when a Christmas tree farm was being built so to bring up full circle I brought my axe to try it out and cut my own tree I'm here with Walt's it's all you've been doing the Christmas tree business been selling for twenty-five years we have Fraser Fir balsam for white pine Scott pine and buthe what's the perfect tree I suppose the perfect tree is a 8 foot tall Fraser firs what a lot of people want but everybody has their own ideas what some people think is a perfect tree is somebody else wouldn't take home now cut it with my axe I think it's gonna work oh I think that's a great idea yeah it's going to take quite a bit of effort but it will do the job [Music] all right let's go food pretty decent specimen to chop it down give it a shot axe nut shot wall it'll work having easy yet it's got a nice heft see how what actually cuts a little worried about the holes it's also a bit thinner then but one it's based off of there's a chance it could Bend got edge hardened sharpened ready to go give it a whale there's a firm that just doing pretty good and cutting well but whole back end fell off I don't even notice there's a bad part there that have a weak point I don't know that these mics still works it's just a little bit shorter now a little less weight on it [Music] [Music] [Music] next to decorate the tree first with some garland stringing flowers are fruits by string as some form of decoration dates back to many cultures around the world I'll be using a product from a future upcoming video that dates back to at least around the era where in popcorn corn was domesticated ten thousand years ago in Mexico and there's evidence of it being popped as popcorn by at least thirty six hundred BCE to string them on some thread I'll first need to make a needle using some bone that's been soaking in water [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] for a second garland let's use a berry I collected several years ago for Thanksgiving cranberries [Music] in the 18th century adding lights to Christmas trees using candles was first introduced and eventually replaced with electric lights however we are still just before the believed invention of candles so in an upcoming video we'll be a harvesting and pressing olives and making a custom oil lamp so to light our tree it Anneliese constructs miniature lamps to hang on our tree and hopefully not burn everything down by a friend to our Christmas tree we're gonna try these little oil lamps so it's just kind of a little reservoir that will hold oil this little beet in the top fits right here and it holds the wick up straight that way it's feeding up oil but the wicked self can't fall into the oil and light it all on fire so we're trying to reduce the amount of fire hazard this is because it's already a large one and then to sit it in the tree I have these two little tunnels we can run thread through and then we can just kind of sit it on a branch and tie it around the branch and that should hold it in place this little guy on fire that's round enough to start so just start with the indent in the middle and then kind of working and moving the clay up the sides so I thin the base and the balls but I also make it taller at the same time it just looks like a funny little cup and we have to pinch this back in to get the narrow spout that'll hold the beat up pinch once you like pinch all the parts in it just looks like a little like Queen force or something buddy big yeah just trying to smooth this and do a nice rim that's an even thickness all the way around so I don't hold on it's like really thin and liable to break [Music] and I want it more around so I'm kind of taking this stick on the inside and pushing those sides back up yeah that'll do fine for shape so I'm going to make the little bead that is the stopper that'll hold the fuse cold okay really wants to dry out quicker it's a pain in my butt well needed pull back so there's a little bead pop them back out a hole through them so use a bead you look like funny blueberries at this point I'm tiny melon with button didn't work it off where's over things it was tea pot shaped it would help but mostly we've made a mess but it's fine then for some last decoration the round shiny ornaments we often hang on Christmas trees today trace back to a medieval tradition of hanging apples on the tree relating to Adam Eve in the forbidden fruit that eventually got incorporated into the Christmas tree and led to more modern forms of ornaments I've also previously harvested apples a few years ago so let's add them to the tree as well [Music] [Music] [Music] lastly for some Christmas cookies or in our case Zig Muk cookies cookies similar to what we eat today weren't really introduced until the seventh century in per job after sugar became common there over sweet wafers and sweet breads traced back to the origin of baking so let's make some of those and the honor some of the characters and the zeg muck story [Music] all right kids gather round have exact my cookie I'm gonna tell you the true meaning of zag muck they all started many years ago in the Sumerian god Marduk the god of creating things he got sent to the underworld and trapped there and while he was imprisoned chaos was kind of taking over the god of chaos Tiamat was consuming the Sun the days were getting shorter and shorter after 12 on days of battle Marduk and the sacred animal Mu Shu Shu they were able to defeat him and return the son back to the sky that was a reason for the season and that is the true meaning of zeg muc mary's egg Muk everyone thanks again to for 25% off [Music] you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and
