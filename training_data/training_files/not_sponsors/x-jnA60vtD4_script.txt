welcome back to new rockstars I'm Eric Voss in the mandalorian has premiered on Disney Plus with a very promising Star Wars spin-off series that hits the right notes of the used futurism that's actually a long time ago in the violent Western imagery of the original trilogy while introducing some major tie-ins to the Star Wars history we thought we knew we may never see Petra Pascal's face in the show and that might be a good thing I'm sure he wants some protection after what happened to him in Game of Thrones let's break down chapter 1 of the mandalorian to explain what's going on with the series how it connects to these Star Wars universe that bombshell twist ending and some interesting details that you might have overlooked spoiler warning if you have not seen the Mandalorians first episode yet okay the pilot opens with the Mandalorians seeking his bounty a myth role played by Horatio Sanz he's in a bar being harassed by a group of trawlers they speak Huttese the language of Jabba the Hutt the one with stache is former MMA fighter tape Fletcher who also had roles in John wick and Breaking Bad this series is set five years after the Battle of Endor and returned the Jedi or the year nine ABY after the Battle of Yavin it's also four years after the Empire's final military defeat at the battle of jakku so the remnants of the empire are now split into fragments with stormtroopers serving increasingly weakening regional governors as the new republic is forming under the leadership of figures like mon mothma and leia organa now the music throughout this episode is a bold departure from the classic vog marion orchestral swells of john williams if these flute instrumentals sound familiar they were all composed by love the goranson who composed similar music with a full of flute to her black panther the Mandalorian that's a mouthful let's just use the travelers name for him mando takes out these trawlers they asked if his armor is best scar and they scrape it with a knife best scar is the famous precious metal of the planet Mandalore it's a metal known for its powerful durability to things like blaster fire mando tells the myth Rojo I can bring you an alarm or a cold he's saying Dead or Alive but ultimately he does bring him in cold frozen in carbonite there lift back to the shipyard is summoned by hey COO Baz with a flute another member of the kuvasz species showed up as an Imperial spy in the original Star Wars and Mos Eisley mando hates droids it's actually similar to the cantina bartender in a new hope who refused to serve droids who actually learned in literary material that that was because the bartender's parents were killed by droids during the Clone Wars and those reasons are actually pretty similar flashbacks reveal a past attack on Mandalore in which Clone Wars era super battle droids scene in Revenge of the Sith attack his Mandalorian tribe when he was a boy a crappier human-piloted speeder floats up driven by a character played by Brian Posehn I love how peace falls off it this guy ends up getting eaten by a Ravan AK bursting out from under the ice like an orca eating the seal mando escapes and as they depart the planet the myth Rahl snips around the ship saying was hoping to be free for life life BAE is a real deep cut to Star Wars lore it's from the Star Wars TV holiday special in which Chewbacca goes home to his family for life day the Star Wars equivalent to Christmas and life day is now apparently cannon myth Roth sees a row a past family frozen in carbonite including a Rodian when Darth Vader froze han Solo in carbonite and Empire it was considered an experiment years later it appears this practice is caught on with bounty hunters mana returns his bounty to his guild leader grief targa played by Carl Weathers the bounty hunters guild was first mentioned in the 1998 novel the Mandalorian armor and has since been mentioned another Star Wars related materials grief mentions how clients are paying beneath guild rates side-effect of the Empire's collapse since there's no longer a corrupt central government to hire bounty hunters to track people down grief pays them half in Mon Calamari flan the currency of Mon Cala the ocean covered planet of Admiral Ackbar notice all the credits make an extra wat exquisite in the sound are a bunch of Star Wars cameos including a few trend oceans another Rodian outsider some Jawas and a kawaki and monkey lizard roasting on a spit while another one watches grimly of course the species of salacious tea crumb ain't laughing now grief sends mando to a special client played by anna her song is guarded by storm troopers and bears an imperial crest pendant suggesting he's an empire loyalist maybe a former regional governor notice how his stormtroopers are dirty his residence a mess another detail reflecting the Empire's collapse just trying to hold on to what they had he said you were the best into parsing the client is referencing the famously quoted parsec 12 of which the Millennium Falcon famously completed the Kessel run within do not do it speed but to its advanced navigational system we learned in solo it's another reminder that all these guys are aware that it is the unit of distance not time the client says that the target is 50 years old and that he's willing to take it dead or alive though his companion wants it alive he pays mando in the precious medal of best scar it's stamped with the Imperial crest from when it was looted from their home planet semana returns to the residents of other Mandalorians he heads into the forage area marked with this mythos our skull is an important history okay back to this skull the myth of stars used to dominate the planet of Mandalore until in ancient times they were driven to extinction by the Mandalorian tongue warriors led by Mandalore the first later queel reminds mando that his ancestors used to mount these beasts this skull is a symbol of the mend allure the traditional ruler of all Mandalorian clans now since their planet was devastated from past warfare this blacksmith may be the leader of all that is left of the Mandalorian races they try to rebuild their society mando offers his profits over as tribute to the community including the best score brick which the Smith plans to use for the younger foundlings but she makes part of it into a new shoulder pauldron to replace the one that got shot earlier she asks if his signet has been revealed and he says not yet perhaps signet refers to his native plan with these Mandalorian refugees trying to track down which ancestral tribes each of them were part of before the dark times of the diaspora with each strike of the blacksmith hammer mando is triggered with memories of his past exile the flashback ends with hatch closing over him cut to mando now in his helmet as if his armor keeps himself trapped in a trauma that he was locked inside as a boy mando travels and search for his new mysterious bounty and he gets attacked by blurbs these are the writing creatures that were introduced in he walks the Battle of Endor when the blurred bites his arm it triggers the flamethrower function just like the one that the armor of boba and Jango Fett had he's saved by a blurred Wrangler quill an egg not played by Nick Nolte he helps mando mount a blurred and points them to this village where another bounty hunter arrives ahead of him an assassin droid IG 11 played by taiko with TT via motion capture he's a similar model as the ig-88 from Empire and I just love how his bolts form a face when they pivot around and they're cornered his self-destruct feature comes from a thermal detonator in his chest similar to the ones that we saw in past Star Wars films after turning the guards and shooting IG 11 manda looks down at this bounty an infant that is these same species as Yoda whoa okay Yoda was 900 when he died so 50 would still be a very young age for this species until this point the species was completely unknown but there was another a female named gateau who was on the I counsel in the Phantom Menace maybe Yoda and yeah it all had a history or maybe these things grow out of cabbage patches who knows we'll find out and fifty years old and this being set in nine ABY that would make its birth year 41 BBY which is the same year Anakin Skywalker was born perhaps the mythologized chosen one was not Anakin Skywalker even Luke Skywalker but actually this infant from Yoda's species check out the next episode of rogue theory for all of our wild explanations for what baby Yoda could be but by putting this infant in the hands of this gunslinger warrior the Mandalorian series appears to be drawing from the Japanese manga lone wolf and cub about a Shogun executioner accompanying by his three-year-old son would be fitting because the original Star Wars was heavily influenced by samurai mythology with the word Jedi coming from Jedi khaki the term first samurai period soap operas what do you think this ending means comment down below with your thoughts follow me on instagram and twitter at Avis and follow new rock stars and socials and
