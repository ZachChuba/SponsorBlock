of how you can make money online because I think a few people don't believe it's possible it is because if I'm doing it and thousands of other people are doing it so can you so with this video I'm not

ideas dropping like that hard are you the kind of person that likes the idea of having an online Empire articles merchandise an online community the perhaps making a website is the way to go for you because with a website it may be a little bit of a big task but once you succeed you have all of these different online sources of income and it's actually really fun my personal journey of making money online actually started with websites creating an online business and I want to make a very distinct that there is websites and blogs versus online business a lot of people just think that writing a few articles it will be enough you need to if you want to do this online business thing drive traffic to the site so figure out how that works then you need to do affiliate marketing Google Adsense sell ebooks sell digital products develop products physical products if you like build an online community there's so many components to this but if you really want a crash course on how the online world works this is a really good one so you can become an online expert aka teacher as well so with my first business I knew nothing about this world you just need to have ten percent more knowledge than the person you are teaching what I did to the very first portion of me setting up my online business is that I've researched like crazy into this vintage world because my website was called peanut passion and I just started writing articles about it and becoming really engrossed in it so I didn't know anything about this world but I made it work I started positioning myself as an expert in this field I started selling products around all of this so you don't have to know everything about a topic you just need to have good understanding better than the average be able to teach other people in as well sell yourself okay okay sell your skills sell your skills so if you have any if you have any knowledge in photography design writing website management management and general project management there's so many different people looking for this online so they need people working remotely for them to help assist with this and there's lots of different websites you can sign up to in order to sell your skills I am gonna be listing a few websites that I have come across or heard of please it's your job to research if these websites are right for you I am not endorsing any of them I'm just giving you examples starting points so these some of these websites are ones that you can sell your freelance work affiliate marketing is another way Fillie marketing is another profession all on its own so affiliate marketers basically mean that they sell other people's products and they take a portion of the sales to do this efficiently means that you need to know how to set up like squeeze pages and have sales pages to guide people to buy a product so there is a lot of skill set involved in this but it can pay off a lot if you know what you're doing this one can be a little bit harder if you are choosing the wrong products like some people sell products that are like five dollars and then get three percent commission from that if you're gonna be an affiliate marketer you learn how to sell the really really high price points pointage courses so you get two hundred dollars per sale or something like that so affiliate marketing 101 start selling on Amazon this is a highly profitable nation new category if you get it right um it is a little bit harder to get to there's like a lot of steps on how to learn how to create your own products in China and then get shipped into the Amazon warehouses is learning to market your stuff online it can be difficult there's a link in the description for a course that teaches you how to sell completely on Amazon from start to finish and it is a great course I haven't gone through it and that's what I did to sell my own products back in the day when I had my online website it is harder but the results can not promising anything they can be outrageous for influencing knowledge so I help businesses to work with influences I need to have mentorship for people aspiring to be influences right now it is way too many way for me because it's like really dedicated and a lot of work but you can make good a really good catch on this there's online courses whether you're selling a seven dollar course or a two thousand dollar course the possibilities of having passive income make a money when you're sleeping massively with selling on my courses and people are always willing to pay for great advice anything that helps them progress and make their life easier they are willing to pay so if you learn how to drive traffic to these pages you can be making a solid solid income from this if you're wondering if I get questioned quite often if I'm special and if I need some medication the answer is yes and it's my job to be weird you guys keep wanting more I'm just singing it's your fault okay freelance writing so this comes in a lot of forms it can be writing articles for people like Forbes it can be writing online social media posts blog posts newsletter articles whoa hi Wow okay a really really profitable one is sales copywriting because people need things to sell words sell really well it is so important even when people do a sales video for example and I know you've seen a million of these it's like hey let's buy this product but the copy that what they're saying is specifically designed to get you to take action so sales copywriters oh they are in demand always and they can charge a lot I've worked with a lot of copywriters in the past so if you love writing this could be something that is really completely made for you being a public figure I love this one clearly this one is my forte you can choose different routes so for example some people choose education teaching like myself some people choose entertainment music some adjust your regular YouTube buddies next-door and contrary to popular belief you don't need to be as crazy as me or other youtubers out there to make it work for yourself there's people that are public figures like Lois house who is a inspirational motivational does podcast that kind of thing so he doesn't have to be this crazy Tim Ferriss public figure again they have their little niches so you can do that for sure and the value that you have as a public figure is really significant because you're like a TV station essentially when you have a huge audience watching you brands and so forth are willing to pay a lot more because you have such a significant reach and please if you choose this route can we just agree that you'll spread good work and like help uplift the world and not try to like crumble it and make people feel bad and spread drama etc etc because I know we're going now into the age of people wanting substance and that's such an exciting time for me so if you're gonna be a public figure please just go in it with the intention of spreading love because we need it as well to fill your stuff online so whether you're looking to sell like your own jewelry line for example if you're really creative like that or if you love connecting high quality vintage one-off pieces they can sell for a really high price point try not to deal with the small price boring things because that's it's a little bit difficult then you can sell your staff via these websites and just keep in mind that this is obviously going to restrict you because you'll have to post stuff unless you hire someone to sell to post your stuff for you I'm giving you guys a lot I hope your brain is taking over with the possibilities but there's a few more there are a bunch of companies that are looking to hire staff that work from home because having someone come into the office is obviously more expensive than just having someone work from home best of both worlds you get to work from home or wherever in the world and they pay you and they win as well but these are the companies that I found online that you can check out as well become a VA there's a lot of people looking for virtual assistants out there so all you need to do is figure out what skills it is that people need and then pimp yourself out is that okay can I say that am I allowed to say people yourself have if you have still teaching another language for example you can become an online tutor for that you're the couple of pages I found a photo fun huh all of the possibilities online social media manager you would be so surprised by how few people actually know how to use social media well for businesses I'm not just talking posting and writing nice captions I'm talking if you can learn the skills of how to drive traffic and increase sales for a business when it comes to using social media our people are gonna devour you because this is a skill that lots of people need but they just don't understand so submerge yourself in how you can drive traffic I can build businesses through the use of social media this could be your thing it's fun it's enjoyable I've done it myself personally but you need to have that edge of knowing how to increase revenue from the use of social media so these are just some examples a few examples of how you can possibly make money online I'm just trying to get your brain to think outside the square space square face give it good grace face is sponsoring this video because the theme of this video is all about looking outside the square thinking outside the box watch the sponsorship the message plays I'm gonna be showing you guys have I used gear around the house to think outside the box to use it as props for my photo shoot so enjoy this one it's pretty good not gonna lie I'd like to thank save 10% off your first purchase of a domain or website if there was anything that captivated your attention follow that curiosity because that is there is a reason for that and then it could just start off with like a simple google search of how to create an online business using websites learning any new skill is super duper hard and I get it it's frightening palaver legs is too short to be sitting in prison oh my gosh I mean in the cubicle in a job you don't like with no plants with no windows being told exactly you're allowed to eat dinner or lunch or anything that's pretty Rimmer that's pretty bad what are we saying is your life is worth much more than that you are a free person and you need to take control of it you can do so I believe in you well boy a long video but I hope you still with me and getting inspiration my final tip is that if you want to make this work you really have to take this seriously just don't take no for an answer you will become overwhelmed it's gonna be really difficult it might take you 2 5 10 years to make it work the results and the outcome of having freedom that has to be worth it right I would not recommend quitting all your jobs just to focus on this full-time because there's nothing more stressful than running out of money and trying to build an online business at the same time like it's very stressful so keep your side gigs keep your work happening and on the side start learning about making money online and free yourself because you deserve it oh heck yeah how's this artistic AF ah the sunshine just killed my vibe man I'm just gonna say check out my Instagram if you want to see my photos that's all I wanted to say can you not give me like five seconds are you guilty of being
