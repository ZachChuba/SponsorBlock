back for another quick video today gonna see if we find any unique scenarios uh situations with the stop signs and traffic lights okay it's a weird kind of stops and he goes and stops and goes two or three times before it decided where it was actually going to stop where i finally ended up stopping was probably about the best place to stop maybe a little bit closer to that stop line that's one of the things that's going to be the most challenging for i think this new feature to work at intersections is its ability to not only stop the stop line but in like the case coming up here where there is no stop line there's a yield sign but it's stopping at the intersection it needs to stop far enough forward where you can actually see the oncoming traffic and to this date there's many situations many times where it comes up to an intersection and it's actually not where it needs to be this for example okay i'm 20 30 feet from where the intersection is i can't see if the cars are coming so i got to disengage so i can get out here this is where i need to be in order to actually see the oncoming traffic to see if it's safe to proceed i'm assuming that when they do [Music] add left turns and right turns into its ability then it's going to have some sort of feature where it gets to a stop line that it thinks is the stop line but then creeps forward to a safe enough position where it's not in the traffic but also has the ability to see the traffic that it's potentially oncoming so it can make a determination of whether it's safe to proceed or not a lot to see how they implement it could be pretty interesting how it actually does that one thing i have been impressed with is its ability to determine between the three lanes that you might be in which one is actually applicable to you as far as the light is concerned so you see in that situation when the light for my lane turned green that's when it turned green on autopilot display whereas there was a flashing yellow which it also displayed as the lane that's not appropriate to the action that you need to take so it seems to be very good about detecting which lane you're in and which light is applicable for your lane so that's good see so it says it's green now get over as soon as i got over that lane it immediately switched to showing the yellow light which is accurate and in this case it's actually turning red so so it's very good about knowing which lane you're in which is impressive now here's one situation i've seen come up a few times with autopilot it sometimes sees this traffic light that's only engaged when there's a lot of traffic let's see what it does yeah okay yeah see so it popped up and it said slowing for traffic light but that was far past where you would have blown by that light it'll be interesting to see if there's ever heavy traffic again what it actually does for those lights at on-ramps so it kind of slowed down for maybe you know three miles per hour five miles per hour just a little bit as it was accelerating up to 70 miles per hour but it didn't actually interact it didn't actually stop and it didn't actually require me to confirm to go through it it decided that that light was inactive and it was safe to proceed i don't know if that's actually in their data as far as map data to determine that that light is situational or whether it determines its situational based on where it's approaching it i'm i'm not sure about that so i mean honestly those lights are sometimes con confusing especially when there's two lights for two lanes that are alternating to control the traffic on coming into the interstate it'll be interesting to see how tesla interacts with those situations turning left here the left turn is not supported in this software release i do have a lead car so maybe it will follow them let's see what it does most likely gonna have to take over all right [Music] it's got nothing totally disengages take over immediately as expected it used to try left-hand turns before before it was recognizing i think that actually autopilot is now recognizing those intersections and the left hand turns and basically taking the cautious approach of requiring you to take over because it's not yet a supported function or supported feature so whereas before it i don't think it was even recognizing that it was an intersection that you were taking a left turn lane it would just maybe follow the lead car if it happened to uh be okay with what lane it was determining it was in but it wasn't actually supporting a left-hand turn all right so not too many unique scenarios to find but we had a couple there and if you like this video please give this thanks for watching and i'll catch you on the next one [Music]
