hey guys welcome back to another late to the party fsd beta video this time we're going to be looking at beta version 9.2 which dropped a couple nights ago and for the first time ever i think we actually have a little sneak peek of what looks like detailed internal release notes straight from elon's twitter now i'm not going to pretend like i understand all the words here but i do understand some of them so let's try to figure out what's new first up we have a clear to go boost through turns on minor to major roads which is then planned to be expanded to all roads in the next update cannot wait to try this i'm so excited this is here if you've been watching my channel for a while now you'll know that this is by far one of my most requested features and i am super happy it's finally here then we have some improved peak behavior where the car should be a bit smarter about when to go around the lead vehicle by reasoning about the causes of why the lead vehicle might be slow in the first place so if you watched my initial fsd beta 9 video in san francisco you'll definitely understand why this was a problem and that this is good news so looks like they're toning down the mad max a notch or two then version one of the multimodal predictions for where other vehicles are expected to drive i don't i know if i really understand this one fully but i take this as the first steps towards guessing where vehicles will be in the future instead of just reacting to how they are in the present which is very nice and we should see a lot of improved behavior if this is the case new lanes network with almost double the amount of data so it should do a better job of recognizing and staying within the lane lines all right uh no idea what a vru is but there is a 12 improvement in velocity so uh yeah 12 is good i guess if you know what this one's about please feel free to share in the comments and they enabled inter soc synchronous computing schedule between vision and vector you know what i'm starting to understand why they don't release the full release notes to us beta testers and instead just to tell us to drive a bunch and tell them our feedback and okay the last one shadow mode for new crossing and merging targets which will improve the vru control so it looks like there may be some improvements for this running in the background that we will see the results of in future software updates for this fairly quick drive we'll be starting off in the target parking lot in antioch and then we'll be navigating to some of the hardest unprotective left turns that are local to me in oakley autopilot is engaged and gives me a message saying to keep my hands on the steering wheel and to be prepared to take over at any time which i will do already some rather interesting driving behavior coming out of the human neural network in front of us nice to see that their vehicle was highlighted in blue on the visualization as it rolled through the intersection if you've ever wondered if autopilot would give the right of way to somebody backing through a stop sign well there you go our path straight ahead clears and we start to proceed but there is pedestrians ahead and trust me my hands were tight on the wheel here just in case giving a huge amount of room here which was perfect for the situation and exactly what i would have done also think it's worth pointing out just in case you haven't seen some of my previous videos that the ultra wide camera you see up top is mounted in a similar location to the b pillar cameras so that view should be pretty similar to what autopilot is actually able to see in some of these unprotected situations we don't have a stop sign up here but autopilot does break for this car that rolls over his stop line i think it got a little spooked and thought they may not stop now usually i would just make a ride out of this parking lot and then make a u-turn at the light to get to my destination but if you look at the navigation path it actually seems like autopilot wants to avoid it by turning left uh and going through the parking lot yeah that plan is not going particularly well autopilot gives up and almost fails this gracefully but doesn't quite reroute in time which triggers the car to put on the hazards and tells me to take over immediately i would have preferred for the car to continue driving until the new route has been calculated but keep in mind this is early access beta software and not full autonomy so stuff like this is still expected for now after we make this left turn at the stop light we have to get into the left lane fairly quickly to make the next turn and do have some cars to deal with and you are going to see some new behavior for the fsd beta and oh my gosh just look at this acceleration boost to get around the car in the left lane as you might be able to tell i absolutely love this like a little sprinkle of mad max on the fsd beta entirely happy with i want to go ahead and slow down the upcoming section because it shows really nice path planning this is a fairly tricky corner and the beta handles like a pro race driver apexing every corner not slowing down choosing a lane with no problem after it splits right ahead up here and overall just feeling really confident i think the full self-driving beta getting more and more confident is a pattern that we will continue to see and with the rate of improvement that i've personally seen since it was originally released october of last year uh i really don't think it'll be very long now until this thing starts to drive at least as well as the average human i mean i'm fast forwarding through neighborhood drives and stuff because it's just too boring everyone is looking for the corner cases now and the hardest parts of driving the type of stuff that i honestly deal with very rarely in my everyday commute i have to go out looking for difficult stuff that should give you a sense of where we are right now that being said we still do have a ways to go to get to real autonomy but the problems are going to be solved like they have been update after update here we have an unprotected right into fast-moving traffic and also have one speeding car which is going much faster than the others in the right-hand lane autopilot does misjudge this and makes a mistake by pulling out in front of this speeder but then almost makes up for it with this huge boost of acceleration as far as i'm concerned this was a successful failure and exactly what a human would have done in this same scenario i think people still look at how many mistakes the beta makes and judge overall progress like that but i actually think how it deals with the mistakes that it makes is the much bigger factor here mistakes will happen no matter what but when it starts to be able to deal with them in a similar way a human would is when it's really going to bring the beta to the next level and just like the last video what i just saw i think is another big step towards that perfection should not be the goal in an imperfect world i've pulled out in front of cars that i didn't realize were speeding until it's too late as well and i use my right foot to correct that mistake so seeing autopilot do it is something that makes me very happy here's an interesting one we have this unprotected left and the visualizations completely freeze and completely glitch out here and as you can see the car is just continuing to drive itself using its turn signals and doing everything properly i do end up taking over here because this was the end of our navigation path and then just manually turning around to put it into the unprotected left but uh i thought it was pretty interesting to point out the visualization thing this is the first time i think i've seen this after engaging autopilot again the visualization seems to recover and happy to see that it's able to continue to drive even if that display isn't showing everything here is the first unprotected left test across four lanes of traffic we will be doing quite a few and as you might have noticed this is the exact same spot i did my unprotected left testing on beta 8. so if you're looking for a comparison between versions be sure to check out that video doing a really nice job creeping just far enough out that we have a good line of sight to incoming vehicles but not far enough to block their path choosing a good moment to go and also loving the acceleration we also have a right turn ahead and check this out almost in the same maneuver as a left-hand turn it makes the right-hand lane change this is a lot different behavior than we've seen in previous versions where typically you would go one lane at a time kind of robotically it seems like it actually planned for that upcoming turn even before it was through the maneuver which is definitely new and very exciting and speaking of robotic behavior autopilot kind of getting stuck behind this uh parked car here just like the last video the planned path is correct but the steering wheel just does not agree and just like the last video as soon as a car drives by autopilot remembers that it's supposed to be driving and proceeds not sure exactly why this happens but i'll be honest i do find it pretty interesting neural networks can be weird we are sitting in the middle of the lane for this left-hand turn instead of hugging the left um something that doesn't exactly feel natural although it is an unspoken rule i wish it would hug the left and it was making these left-hand turns does a good job creeping for visibility and then proceeding once it can see both uh directions but doesn't go quite as fast this time and again we see a super nice lane change right after it's made the maneuver sections like this are ones i would usually edit out but i've had a fair share of people comment and say that i'm cherry picking these unprotected lefts so i'm letting the entire video play out in its entirety to remove all doubt here comes test number three and uh this time quite a bit more traffic than the first couple attempts really nice job creeping forward and seeing those additional cars there instead of just trying to go for it now this is interesting behind us we have a car turning right that is squeezing in beside us which completely blocks our view of incoming traffic from the right it's good to see the beta wait this out and not proceed in case there was more traffic that it wasn't able to see more traffic isn't coming from the left uh to be honest i would have gone like twice already because i i know i can make it across this intersection really quick with the instant tesla torque but i understand why the beta acted uh pretty cautious here and again quite a nice lane change that was almost like one single maneuver then just gonna be uh fast forwarding through me taking over while i do some questionably legal maneuvers to keep testing these uh unprotected lefts here comes test number four and i think we'll do one more after this one for good measure and then call it a day a fair bit of traffic through this intersection right now so it is tough uh for even me to find a spot to be able to pull out into a gap does appear and autopilot is very slow to proceed so slow in fact that it now has to deal with this incoming car from the right hand side when it otherwise wouldn't have um not sure why it was so slow to proceed on that one it maybe it had something to do with the pedestrians on the side of the yeah really not sure and again nothing to see here just some questionable u-turns and here we go to the final stretch the last attempt autopilot starts creeping for visibility here even though it can still see approaching cars i still find the creeping behavior pretty inconsistent regarding when it actually decides to creep it goes out to a good distance and everything now but sometimes it feels like it won't creep when any cars are visible and other times it does so not really sure if there's a rhyme or reason for that and that's it folks thank you so much for watching and if you're still here and
