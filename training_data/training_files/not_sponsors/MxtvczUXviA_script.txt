ladies gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL craft as always brought to thanks to them for sponsoring and check it out so what have you done since last time other than try to drop me through a hole and fly on your Dragone dude my dragon is awesome so how do I do this how do I do that you you you got I mean you you know a dragon horn first three yeah which it is okay okay okay so and then bring him out here make sure you have a dragon command staff I do not [ __ ] I know I made two there's one submarine that's in a chest I think it's kinda on the right side I believe yeah I do recall this much okay yeah yeah and now we put him down in jar right whoa what is this freaking zephyr blade you're sticking in the ground huh I have no idea I mean it's just one of the items alright why did you feed yours like 50,000 more dragon meals huh how much freakin holy mother of 524 health how many more dragon meals defeat him can I have them I I've been working I'm I don't have any oh my god you use all of them on it I think there is more bones you used all the dragon meals on your guy I can't feed your guy in you weren't on oh my god there's 11 bones left hey you can make two dragon meals I'm upset Wow Wow he just goes and freakin does the whole thing okay so now see is your descend and I was being very very very very cautious to make sure that I tried not to hit shift while I was in the air oh that will drop you I don't know I didn't want to try wait see is descend see a zoom Oh X is maybe X is descend yes yes it is Wow okay shift drops you in the air no he went down and landed that was nice no he doesn't know he doesn't you son of a [ __ ] I didn't even take any God thank goodness I didn't go high up for that Jesus man that's why I was saying about been very careful I warned you it was it's fine and then it turned out it wasn't fine but yeah be careful with the shift and then the command the the dragon staff you want to make sure like with right-clicking on it it's in stay mode not in wander mode because if you go if you click it and it's in wander mode than you are IP everything they go away wander around and he can flap off and but if you have that do you know what mode is gonna be in what the crap why is he jumping and what the I don't your guys just like jumped in sit mode is really weird how do you like when you right-click on the staff doesn't it toggle so if you right click you know yeah no toggle but it'll show you down kind of like at the bottom right but if you click it is he just gonna zoom before you even click again no no no he's not like I'm out oh okay you're taking him off the leash and you sitting there straining it's just you don't want to leave him that way gotcha mmm I probably need to give it a food real quick now there's a few more dragon Emilio's I left you some three compared to the 22:27 that you fed yours I didn't have to leave you any so maybe just a little bit of you know recognition then I was like okay I can't client please wonder if we could dressed we could drowsed mm-hmm my client I think but oh yeah that's true I read I made a bunch and then I gave some to you more than half to you actually to offload him and we've used them all what uh what uh what uh uh so I was what the hell just happened what's what I don't know it what did happen hey I was in dragon over here and I just teleported to back here without rec my dragons over here in the water it's like i teleported back without the dragon okay that was it was weird sorry it happened he did he's he floats the dragons float mm-hmm I do I don't agree I do I don't know how I feel about that that happening I'm just I don't know whether I mean it didn't seem like rubber-banding it seemed like I did something in teleported it oh I see me so what have we got on tap for today oh you know what we could do is we could fight another wither and get ourselves another nether star and then we can all say don't do everything seems fine it it's fine okay we could get ourselves another nether style we could also craft the like anoints a key boss thing yes the diamond sister court what happened it's fine where are you I'm inside of our house Oh crazy no worries no no worries what happened what did you what will you oh my lord uh what do you press for that are but like you can I so I was flying around and I you tried to incinerate baby Yoda no no no baby odo will remember this I looked away but it will absolutely utterly wreck like buildings and stuff like I found like our house yes I found a floating castle and I actually just kind of spent five minutes giggling evilly while I just destroyed the whole thing with the drag and like how you didn't mention that part to me not what I wanted to remember what the button was and I was gonna tell you and is but I was like wait okay why are you here go away Reaper also on you just replace that in the floor with yeah the other one fell down where's where's the Reapers don't don't fear it you are a mess we learn in our kiss know what why oh here look I have a gift for you ah - bones Wow I've never seen such generosity in my life when I just spent for for the greater good of both of us your dragon is stage three so just a little bigger that's fine mm-hmm you know it's not it's it's about how effectively you use it it is indeed and baby Yoda knows the force and yours does not I'm making a wither if you wish to come down otherwise I can just eat it real quick where are you withering underground all right down right the wither you eat mm-hmm oh hey mate how you doing dude ow freaky Dicky balls dude you okay I just had a troll punch me in the face not a problem these things happen so I've learned so what do you need a wither for just more nether stars you can never have enough just a general desire to have with her yeah to kill her with her yeah hey you still a little close there dude ow mother of Frick all right ouchie got him yeah we we could really use that super bezoar yeah no that'd be great but at the moment it be like I would just take a regular bed or you know we need to find a battle tower because those seem to just pop up a little I found a little baby one okay I don't know whether it's a you know like what's in there but it did I saw a spot I would assume that mobs would be inside it that's just my guess I feel like you are being faced issues facetious facetious face laticious yes the man needs bones but just skip oh this is a fast boy you can deal with that guy my god I got him I got a call that XP I wouldn't I didn't you Inc it from you it just kind of happened it just worked out that it's fine but yeah I know that so I found a little baby two towers I also found a pirate ship okay I don't know whether that is something that would be interested like it could go either way it could be really kind of boring and like oh what's the point of this and it could be like oh this is me what's the point of this everything so I like the two extremes there with the same outcome okay yep sounds good to me though I say let's do it let's do it okay well and then I have a dragon flute that I'm not entirely sure what I do with I got to repair my boy what's what's so broken the helmet it has thorns on it which is the issue yeah mm-hmm because were in 1.12 though it's kind of nice I think that the anvil it continuously allows you to repair at the same cost versus it scaling until it gets too expensive so it's nice it is nice I can just keep repairing and it is purely linear the amount of experience it costs as long as we the resources for it so I'll take it I'll take it right we need the other colored ones oh and I got a similar fire dragon blood too so we have Dan but yes flying your dragon around is a fun although I haven't like gotten to a point where it's like I would be doing like dragon versus dragon like I would rather not there's no way there's no way to end well I don't know I mean I don't know whether it's just let him go and have at it have at it Steve or if it's like you know this is this is all bad and sad stuff I just it's I like Steve I don't want to like you know depart he's worried the baby Yoda is gonna eat him into oblivion dude yeah no I that's definitely the concern there mhm definitely definitely the concern I should be in their enchantments to improve your sword immortality as a supreme supreme sharpness ancient sword night we do arc slash upgraded potentials advanced mending and subject mathematics oh we need to get librarians for this stuff I see wait you know but librarians we can't cycle enchantments where non 1.14 you guys are really optimistic about this whoa super I've never even seen supreme supreme version of the most powerful tier of sharpness what the heck bro supreme flame yeah lady isn't just gilaflame but his extra flame Oh My lordy that's a nut Solan yeah I want like that freakin stuff you came cola enchant you can't get that from an enchantment table how do you like these nuts ol enchantments hmm didn't like that alright let's go to the battle tower or the pirate ship okay it's night time do we want a daytime I do you should slap it up CA not rest now the bed is too far away yeah now okay are we going to fly our dragons over I mean let's see make sense to me dude I'm down I'm down I'm down this is gonna be sick let me just remind myself where it's at oh yeah you know the problem is you don't see the particles but he do oh yeah you know you can you can cause a lot of damage real fast uh-huh real fast alright where I died probably lost you I met the dragon Pam now I'm over defiled oh I see where you I see where you live all the fire oh my god dude it's pretty good we're heading this way oh yeah we also have to go to the end at some point I forgot about that oh yeah yeah we have the whole end thing that people do thanks baby Yoda's faster get rekt I'm not holding forward while I check the map that's okay okay whatever he's you know figuring out where to go whatever dude baby Yoda it just crushes out here bro oh it's an underground battle tower that's what it is so you just thought it was a small battle tower it is an underground one all right so we just have them like say I here I you that or you can horn them but I don't I dropped mine horn off so yeah I don't know proper dragon etiquette drinking advocate oh that's a creepy boy right there that's a scary one that's scary oh oh we need beds from them though I don't frickin poisoned I mean that's what we wanted to avoid was the poisons right yep why is there a tree in me battle tower oh god I have no blocks all right just and it quickly getting it wrong I don't see I don't see any chests at the moment oh there's a chest huh I fell down careful yeah there it's it's just like instead of chests there's spawners justice more spawners yeah there's a tree here no no it's good question there's a tree in the middle of the spawner I cannot hit this it refuses to be hit believe I believe oh yeah I don't want to I don't want to get into bad situations that yeah but does anyone remember exactly what we got the beds were from before I think we found it in the purple dungeons mainly but was it a drop it was it in a chest or was a mop I think they were in chests I thought it was a mob drop actually I've never I've never seen it as a mouth I've never seen any of the bubbles come as a mob drop really I mean oh I know but I know what do you know oh you ass Oh No give it back oh I see it it's over that you have it there's a really nice sort right over here thank you you're saying that this is a that we should be farming these and getting all the guys out of them rather than me I feel as a mob drop yeah so Oh keep the Skelly spawners for Bonin it's not a bad idea oh yeah yeah yeah all bubbles are mob drops of his cave spiders okay okay so we hopefully find more cave spiders and don't break respond er I guess that just expired right bad timing while I was looking at it I'm sure they're fine like it seems like they should be able to take care of themselves now fire okay five percent chance from cave spiders so hopefully there will be another one all right we can keep the Skelly ones oh yeah I was like okay let me just delete this spawner and then we can keep the Skelly ones wait a minute I was like that's a good idea I should go that's that's it that'd be it we're there we're at the bottom apparently yeah well Pope there wasn't even a golem or anything no that's weird huh yeah that's I'll go up I think there was still another skilled and spotter somewhere right pretty much dang it yeah there were a couple of uh poisons fighters but we didn't think to keep these sweet whoopsie-daisy we didn't we no I mean particularly it's poisonous because it's like we don't have the beds or so it was like yeah the boys and spiders they're the worst dragons just feeling dude nice I always appreciate chill dragons okay well the arrows sure we're not leaving behind bones there's bones a couple of eggs couple bowls and some coal in the Jessup stop yeah other stairs after god dang it if you work your way around the hard way yeah I didn't realize whoopsie daisies oopsie Daisy hmm did you incinerate this place around it or that was Quinn still know that this was this was a dragon den and that's how I found this oh I understand is I killed a dragon just right where little Yoda what is right now uh-huh all right well that's off the marker then uh you could do pirate ship I guess mm-hmm sounds good to me sounds good too it's so easy to get around it's cool it really is so this is quite a ways north okay we'll get there in no time though I'm sure do they do they try it they don't even bother attack dude they don't even bother bro I think if you get close to nothing they'll start attacking no I do that would be unwise Oh God you've just disappeared from render in front of me oh there you are Oh can you said very far nor thing what's the best way to do this they float I have no idea we'll do the do the Dragons float or we're gonna let go I have no idea alrighty seems like a safe way to do this all right baby Yoda is chilling on the ship [ __ ] alright we have invaded okay there are spawners here's a lot of zombies spawn a lot of those are five zombies Bonners oh no no no not like this did you just want to drink no no I there was some gravel and I just like let me just get rid of this gravel real quick no problem and then it turns out there's water right about that gravel for reasons I'm not totally sure there we go they don't they don't seem to spawn really I guess it's well it's too late I guess like yeah here we can I mean do we care about the zombies we could just break the spawner oh now they're in there oh now they here watch me get my crap stolen just a moment say more about there's not much I hear other things hmm oh oh hello oh there's the thing up there yes oh oh and hey wait alright breaking the zombie spawners uh I don't know probably maybe probably maybe sure I guess so Wow alright they're out what what I look just like a skeleton there was a skeleton ice killed it and and then you stepped forward mm-hmm you're like I will replace this skeleton with me I do I do want to grind the skeletons Oh for bones babies or so maybe darkness would be better though it's just yeah getting closed with this skeleton let's get into MIT Wow hello skeleton my old friend I've got 18 bones I have that's good oh and that's it for sports we're gonna get you some dragon treats come great well that was the pirate ship it was you know what it was it was what it was we didn't know now we know all right I don't know where to go wave whine figure out no I'm I'm still you should start flying it okay you start flying all right now I'm flying or you're gonna you're okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about dude that's what I'm talking about yeah it doesn't even use up like it doesn't even use like dry like food or anything like that no effect it just do what it is do it there's also supposed to be a regular attack but I don't know what it is um a regular attack like where you can just like melee attack or something like that okay dragon melee so yeah being over the being over the ocean isn't quite as scary as it used to be no it isn't actually this is oh there's no app regen like this is one giant pretend sec area what the heck what does that mean it's like all so why does it go below sea level II that's kind of weird because that's what I'm saying it's a pre jet like it's loaded that in as a structure this is all a giant structure whoa that's area and windmills and stuff and like a [ __ ] yeah oh do let's check this out node is it not cool now I don't I've been on it's fine it's fine but uh I guess that's why it cuts in oh no no but it's below sea level you would have think they'd I don't know at least make sea level line up you know yeah oh that was important what that was so important I don't know I'm like I don't think I hit shift but I just fell off my dragon like I hit shift but I had someone had me make a dragon bone flute which is supposed to like summon dragons and try to like oh this isn't doing anything but it my dragon was flying and as soon as I did that it came down to me and I loved it oh so that prevents them from flying away whoa we got of indicators huh yeah I don't I don't wanna do it for you I mean I'm in this house thing wait what yeah there's a house and stuff what I was drowning while on my dragons so I'm reloading in to figure out what's going on because I don't really want to drown and I agree that wouldn't be fun where's my dragon it's Steve gone forever doubt it oh there he is doubt it I appreciate your optimism man yeah I think the dragons make it pretty easy to desync or else I'm just having Internet issues because you haven't seen enderchest huh whoa it's a full enchantment setup Wow that would have been nice earlier there's an evoker spawner with it the heck bro that's a stray spawner huh oh we can get totems here we can farm totems it's fun please spawn evoker please please please spawn evoker what bah oh it's a siren no help what is their assignment we're it's I'm in the house what is going on are you just stuck I'm just stuck yet okay I can I can come help you in a second I have it your poet I'm okay I'm no you asked dick what I don't up at the top of the house the top floor of the house I'm having problems I'm very attracted oh I'm very attracted to something I can't see right now it's fine everything's fine I'm getting pulled by sirens as well but I don't know where they are yet yeah I don't either that's the problem we got 13 iron ingots I jump booth I think they might be like inside they get inside something yeah what they're not even like at the coast it's bizarre dude anyway why are evoker x' not spawn er arre knowing spawn don't you do it don't you what I don't know you are but don't touch me it's not that bright I don't think alright oh hey hey nice old Oh AHA that's what I like to see other than the freaking vexes are vexing freakin vexes are vexing they are okay so top of the house no I'm fine now I'm fine okay I just want to get my dragon and not die why am I not able to do this I know not the answer is what you seek I feel like the the way this is going right now it seems highly likely that I'm going to end up losing my dragon yes because I keep thee sinking off of it he's in a weird spot and I don't know where he is hmm and I can't see my frickin client would stay connected I feel like he's over here he usually ends up where no he got vexes off oh there's another one there he is oh you Fricker's oh you oh oh here they come here they frickin come back the Frick off back the Frick off are you good Steve we good hey dude I got some good news what's up we're never gonna die again that's nice yeah oh it's nice fan of that yeah big fan of that where did you

then you just do have your offhand now what wouldn't you yeah but like the offhand I guess is good for shield and I never use shields cuz I'm an idiot like that so it all works and also there's an enderchest up here which I guess I kind of need silk touch for but we can make another under chest put it at home I just wanted to save some space because I don't know what this is but I love it and hate it at the same time what it what is what is some block that's like a what I don't know it's looking at me I want to see it where it does that not look weird to you you know what this is right I have no idea dragon head it was just facing into the wall is this weird block of it like of the eye and I'm just like I don't know what that is but I like it so okay well I don't know where the the mythical ladies are but I've got if you grab some planks then you can make yourself some ear plugs as necessary alright wood to stick in my head yeah that's why I asked if you had wood wood sticking

aided in my water oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh my god can you imagine if can you imagine if we like updated the the blocks oh boy look at this look at this view into an aquarium now just like imagine if we updated the water how much lag that would make oh there's a villager over here ooh what is he be he has zipper pole he's a cleric he will take your rotten flesh and turn into emeralds out whenever that the pirate ship over here though what about the what now the pirate ship I'm gonna check it out cool my god I'm so fast Holy Mother of God dude are you flying I am so fast in the water who needs

crazy stuff with fishing here or in the mod pack to like that's a thing oh you mean like there's good loot from vision yeah at least different loot than what the normal tables like right at some modded loot and stuff but I haven't I haven't just sad and fished okay let's see there's bound to be some other stuff around here there's bound to be oh my god him so fast in the water Michael Phelps ain't got nothing on me cuz because you just run and run on water Michael Phelps can't even run on water dude Michael Phelps wishes he could run on water no I like this no no no I don't I don't know where even are you I don't know where they are I think that they're like I think there's like a cave or something like I think they're in the island Wow it makes no sense is I can't find him either I just got Dean from the front of the island mmm steak oh okay what is it to make this crap again your plug what to make what crap again earplugs are two buttons to buffa is very expensive if that has to go on your head helmets all right yeah all right so they're definitely over kind of towards this center area oh there's like four of them wherever it is there's a lot of balls I need actual points for it frickin Frick oh I see hello ladies oh you found him yes ones even named special whatever like why didn't I she's not blinded but it's this bet it's the special now oh oh were the villagers you were talking about the ones who were in the windmill yeah there's some loud lightning on a very clear day Jesus what is that okay I fall a lot it's all right man it's not about whether or not you fall it's about whether or not you get back up I get knocked down but I get up again you're never gonna get me down all right I took out two sirens I don't know if there's all of them but I have rid this world of two of the vixens thank you thank you yes my temptation is no longer here yeah you're one of the temptations mmm so what shall we do next was there anything more to this area I don't know I don't know I was here originally so I don't think so oh I thought you said you'd seen it before you like oh yeah this place has a weird indentation it's like a pre-bid seen it like I knew what it was like okay this is what is what's going on but I had oh no no no I think the same thing just happened to me that happened to you what I was flying and then just ended up back where it took off and there's no dragon so the dragon usually ends up or for me I was able to always find it where I last like wait where I was when it yep yep there there is so it's like the the servers on point the the and all the entities but your clients falling behind for some reason huh and and so I that's why I ended up just sticking mine in the horn for a second like I'll come back to you in a minute because I don't want to lose Steve yeah I wanna be able to you I want to be able to use steam but I don't want to lose blood this disa a mushroom biome yeah there was I saw that the mycelium that's rare AF we we discovered that a super rare well I didn't intend to like that's not a it's it's outside of this pre gen stuff you got Krabby Patties are what are you alright well I guess it's time to break the dragon out and go but I don't have other than fighting other dragons there's no other interest all there is the ant yeah there's the end I did find a village that we haven't been to oh I mean we could check out see if there's any library boys if they have any good stuff library boys yeah a sure hernia all right where you at I am just leaving the the pre gen area did you there's more sirens I'm on the I'm on a corner of the Prejean area just right behind the windmill like behind the windmill okay are you is all right so this is back towards base see lots of sirens down below us oh yeah we could make an indie man farm oh it's dragon boy dragon boy can i fire that oh I think I did damn damn to the dragon wow I hope I'm fighting the right one this seems like a dangerous prospect when I we keep Dee sinking perhaps I mean you wanna you want to go down I'm sure I do have this dragon marked wait is this another battle tower it is what the heck okay we know it looks similar but it's Aaron dude this is working well this is this is a lutzky doodle of a day well shall we what should we do wait we want to do this definitely these cave spiders that are up here Oh are they're nice it's nice oh that's a slight problem that is a slight problem the fact that I cannot really offhand stuff with my two-handed weapon yeah a slight problem yeah I overlooked that ah we can't open this chest Hey it was noticing that myself alright I figured out how to open it that was that's one way to open it I overcame and adapted okay very well very well good job hey Spidey so I'm like what's really weird is I'm Auto picking stuff up and that's freaking me out right now really yeah okay whoo there's another case fighters for oh my god there's cave spiders everywhere this place this place that's or oh nice bats are don't pick well no you get a second yeah boy Oh ash destroyer Oh subject mathematics is good one I guess I'm sure that there will be one soon enough given up those cave spiders four days down here yep another one another one just dropped down to the one below here next level down excellent oh wow Jesus let's see if I can snag guru Santa stuff here alright bezel or bauble equipped bring it on nice dude nice Oh God give me no no don't make me miss drop my stuff don't like that oh man another bezel I mean should we get that oh we got it yeah yeah absolutely was let's go light them up okay let's see if I can do it oh yeah I need to get the balance happen at any time true dat true though so being prepared for the worst is the best you can have my string you're gonna run the flush my lap ease my spider eyes I'm keeping the bones you know the redstone a hard dust wow there's some big boy skeletons down here my goodness all right well my just pull snag these bones huh yeah bones are part of the play I've always liked green water mmm delicious careful how many bones you have to uh 37 thanks 43 but I just found a magic mirror what is dude teleports you to your spawn points what the Bible should teleport you to your spawn how do you activated is it a bound bauble no more ah that's like that's that's too good how are you allowed that for being awesome and I also found their just extra inventory slots actually a mystery slicer yeah nice is that a bobble as well yes I do not have room for all these baubles to be but I also like all the bought a lot of these like the magic mirror and stuff like they're all based off terraria so it's and a lot of them you can combine together into it like me combo was like like the bezel right you know I'm liking the part where we just are much more solid yeah yeah not being not being afraid of everything is nice mm-hmm and I don't know what make me is it is it much more solid or is it just the you know with the the vampire we're just like whatever and we you ask I keep getting the steely guys yeah blazing converts fired blasting fruit into blazing variants okay that doesn't seem that useful XP tone with oh there's a in the bloop box there was a full XP tone oh there's an emerald amulet which I don't know what we do but it's a bauble so that could be handy if the parent we don't need the book so he's the boss at the bottom in this one there is another bed or down here if you feel like grabbing a narrative - ah what oh wow I hear the like oh see up top no oh it's my guess anyway yeah oh wait but this means if he dies what blows up where does does everything collapse like do you know that's a lot of stuff in there yeah that's a lot of stuff in there potion rings and stuff what else do you eat three blocks of diamonds yeesh what else oh the remorseful essence is good I think recall potion right there one whole potion wormhole potion takes you to other players oh that's nice and I like these because if they don't collapse on you and oh they don't are we sure about that it remember the other one like did all the shaking and the move X and stuff a lot of diamond down here this isn't doing all the shaking miners ring where did you go is this top WA not the level oh okay um don't care so didn't say anything about collapsing we're sure about that okay sure is is a strong word but we seem alive okay okay hmm I think I I don't really have room for anything else so yes I'm pretty full as well a lot of this stuff is like stuff that um I could probably put other place I'm a dorm okay just don't care about too much anymore I don't think well that was profitable yeah was I'll take star bezoar problem that we did and got some bones all right now roaring I hear roaring and now we can take out that draw God did you do that you ass you absolute ass [Applause] [Laughter] fine I take 30 bottles of enchanting for myself okay it was so simple you can have it all because remember I found the fully that the full tome of XPe uh-huh so you know but it was fine I just sort of my delivery driver just teased me he sent me a text message I think accidentally me instead of the person who's getting their order delivered first and he says I just picked up the order I bought your way to you I look at the app and it says your order is on its way to someone else like oh how dare you blue ball me like that Wow wait so where are we okay I think erase this dragon what the hell just made that noise something just look at you get you good over here hookah cubed so um shall we do we do we know where that other dragon is I know where the other dragon like right around here that we landed because we didn't kill him I forget well I mean I was just dragon he was slightly north of us as where his base a roundish was okay but I don't know if that would be this way do you want to bring your dragon you can now it looks like you're going I'll run back if you know how to get back there oh they're even right here Harry be there he blows watch the ravine nightshade whoa what's nightshades there boss okay here's his base I don't know what that is it's gone now yeah he solved that problem oh he seems to have noticed us it's it's fire it's Wow he's like blowing the ground up dude does this work what you doing whoa I summoned him to me wait you summoned the enemy dragon to you yeah I mean that actually does the thing it certainly came right down oh well he's almost dead do you wanna kill him there you go you gotta do it wow that was fast ya know like he was you came down and we we had obviously done a lot of damage with our dragons cuz he was like barely alive right Oh red red armor my inventory is quite full right now what shall I remove if you have any baubles you could put on I can double beds or wait this doesn't fit anywhere how do I use this I can't put the belt pouch on like literally anywhere so apparently that's something else if you wish to acquire items and help to Cairo fire dragon hearts what that oh we have lots of those mmm there's a skull over here where be the school next week oh I see it I see it we probably can replace Robbie's I think so alright brilliant so apparently it's level 2 and level 3 or level 1 and level 2 like you can find their skeletons and deserts but you've never really encountered them alive is oh I'm they've gotten rekt by like the other dragons I guess so you're the runt of the litter farewell the Frick is that freaking day that's the Night Shade that's the Night Shade oh I don't think that's the Night Shade okay I'm level 50 I want to get baby Yoda and head home and put some of that to use hey I like this invisible tree this is a cool invisible tree right here sometimes the the the trees and then the the burning down doesn't work too well together okay so where are you at can I meet you at the dragon place and you guide me back to baby Oda yeah Oh back to baby Yoda yeah I am at the dragon no it was just where we where we ran from what the what is happening right now okay hey just where we came from over at the battle tower he's at the battle tower yeah that's this way I must get home I have bad memories of the last time I got to over 50 there's the mushrooms there's the battle tower Wow okay cool and here's your dragon hi-ho hi-ho then we continue in that same direction to get home which is about what we've got time to do ye know there's another aquatic dungeon right near us how's things going for you I'm trying to mount my dragon it's going well mm-hmm can see that you did it okay the aquatic drunk dungeon might be worth taking note yeah I feel free to take note okay aquatic dungeon Hey and then they see poo is basically these way you follow huh disappeared right in front of me but it's fine oh oh oh oh oh this isn't good this isn't good stop cease your location you do you think I am over I am just in in void and nothingness just disconnect and reconnect in your Dragon will be where you have went went out and you will come back where are you where's oh dear this could be a problem it's over the ocean I think they just sit on top of the ocean mm-hmm I'm just trying to see which way this was oh hey what's up dawg what up dog oh do you need foods I just was thinking about that okay see Steve okay I see you alright alright all right you good yep I'm with you and with you as I can't it's doing the thing I owe it's like not loading it refuses to load more chunks this is really weird it's yeah the client desync whatever it causes that is really annoying oh so I'm just screwed again I that would be my guess see you Oh God uh yeah could I borrow your dragon horn and I'll teleport back since it seems to be working for you well then if it doesn't work for you yeah ah hey are you well I mean oh you don't even see where I'm at no I'm right by you you if you can't see me then you know I I do see you I do see you I just didn't know could you not see me no I can see you okay so here is the dragon horn okay here let me give you something in return because my inventory is filled up in less yeah that's actually a torch who cares okay and I just have to really hope that mine works right if it doesn't then I will come back with a horn like some hell all right oh boy it's time to sort some inventory ah yeah okay we do we could easily make the AIA vendors that we need in order to get to the end because we have so many ender pearls so yeah many many options when it comes to that that's good times all around good job Steve how's he doing how is he doing I'm back at base he's landed he's nice hey Echo one is down all right let's make some dragon meals there we go that's what I like to see how much it would cost to apply subject mathematics to my sword I am not allowed to do that unfortunately it seems what's up is the door closed for you yeah I can see a little your little teeth poking through there huh [Applause] I can't open and close the door was just like I I'm telling you we're just always just having some issues yeah yeah so it was like you know close the door and it wasn't it wasn't opening closing the door so but it was fun oh god I'm like kind of like everything on me hurts right now oh that's fine and you plowed through that beef hey bud hey what's up yeah baby Yoda getting more swole coming more of a big boy not so baby Yoda anymore not so baby Yoda alright here is a dragon horn back to you thank you and I also feel like he should make an enderchest could be useful hmm could be useful I tell you indeed and then I pulled out potions there's your potions we had bobbles so now that my dragon is in stay mode I don't necessarily need the staff on me right as far as I can tell no I've kept mine on just just as in cases but I haven't hit a
