dividing the world into two spheres with monopolies granted to a Portuguese half and the Spanish half while the Spanish said about conquering the new world and the Portuguese established a trade empire in the Indian and South Atlantic oceans neither side were aware of the small piece of the American continent which lay in Portugal's half of the globe [Music] [Music] before European discovery South America was inhabited by numerous Native Americans who had migrated from the north either by land or by shallow coastal sailing we aren't entirely sure these early migrants lived in harsh conditions in the most diverse bio ecosystem in the world these native groups subsisted mostly on agriculture but there were some hunter-gatherer communities as well and before you ask in the comments yes there were some cannibals most of these tribes lived on the coast and were broadly categorized into two pianned Tupperware although the diversity did not make too much of an impression on the Europeans here to help me out with early brazil is joe from the channel jabbsi pond Vasco da Gama's successful returned from rounding the African continent in 1499 the Portuguese decided to begin trade in the Indian Ocean pedro Ã¡lvares cabral left the following EF at India yet he blown wildly off course juniors southward voyage he sighted land on the 22nd of April 1500 and a few days later landed at port of Segura the name the locals they met as Indians just like the inhabitants of the West Indies but although nearly 95 times its size Brazil's population was just short of Portugal's at just under 3 million this land was east of the tordesillas line and so was declared for Portugal the locals traded with the Portuguese for power Brazil a word with the red dye used in Europe but the trade post was seen as largely inferior to the colonies in Africa and India however when the French began importing Brazil would themselves Portugal made a more concerted effort to settle in the area and for the second part of this collaboration visit my channel at jazzy with the link on screen or in the description box below early Brazil was divided into 15 colonies and granted to wealthy Portuguese elites there any successful one however was south incensed Island which made a moderate profit by native slaves so the failing colonies were returned to the Portuguese crown in 1549 and a governor was appointed merchants and missionaries were the first to settle they built a capital city Salvador and began trading in the todos santos bay mostly in the new cash crop sugar to help promote the economy a group called Bundy ranch s was sent to explore the land for minerals and slaves which increased settlement for the export economy slaves became more valuable as natives died from European diseases in large numbers missionaries were also very active at this time mostly Catholic Jesuits who founded the city of Sao Paulo as a missionary school just a few kilometers inland for himself and Cinch another bay port January was established as a French colony called fill Canyon Island before the Portuguese kicked them out and we named it San Sebastiano hyo-jin yarrow when Portugal got busy during a succession crisis in Europe the newly independent Dutch Republic very briefly swooped in and took over large parts of the colony it didn't last long but it did inspire them to put more resources into settling Dutch Guiana the Atlantic slave trade was kicked off by the Portuguese buying them on the coast of Africa and importing them to Brazil where they were sold to plantation owners more than 40% of all African slaves were imported to Brazil for comparison just under 5% were imported to the United States Brazil grew rapidly during the 1600s creating new export markets for native plants as well as new plantation commodities like tobacco the system was held together by the Royal fifth when 20% of all minerals crops and other products went directly to the Portuguese crown accelerating the establishing of public offices like tax collectors accountants and governors when gold was discovered in the 1700s the slavery economy boomed an exploration of the interior was accelerated to look for new minerals they opened up new markets to trade with the Spanish Empire in the he--oh de la Plata but when this area became overrun with pirates and smugglers the Spanish and the Portuguese met to establish a shared border control in 1750 brazilian culture was becoming increasingly more diverse Europeans Indians and slaves met to form mixed-race groups called Pardo's such as the mulatos Cavazos and mestizos with countless numbers of Creoles and ethnic identities Brazil was to become much more important to the Portuguese crown in the 1800s thanks in large part to Napoleon when the Iberian Peninsula was invaded and occupied the royal family leg did to Rio where they set up the government during the war after returning to Lisbon the king's son Prince Regent all declared Brazil independent and crowned himself Emperor a brief independence war ensued where the Portuguese found themselves battling not only the Brazilian army but also thousands of civilian militia sounding familiar the Empire of Brazil however failed to enact the changes that the wealthy landowners and the liberal elites had overthrown the Portuguese for in the first place and so the nation was plagued by socialist insurgencies slave rebellions and even a republican movement in the Rio Grande do Sul supported by the Italian nationalists Giuseppe Garibaldi they spent thousands on wars with the newly independent South American nations as well investment in Brazil showed no signs of slowing down coffee which grew extremely well in the Brazilian climate became the new cash crop as well as markets in timber in rabaa eventually the rate of immigration to Brazil was so high that it obviated the need for slaves and the practice was ended in 1888 the Empire came to an end inspired by the ideals of republicanism and the Enlightenment and soon a military coup replaced the adora da fonseca as the country's first president the United States of Brazil Jeb's II whom I
