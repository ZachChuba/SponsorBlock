I was in a production meeting forget up on Monday morning and this was directly after the Riva Sherman's situation happened and one of the ESPN executives said Rivas should not talk Sherman's a Hall of Famer he cannot say that and in my eyes I didn't say anything this person because I have no pool but I it became another conversation Rivas I think is at that status where he can say anything about anybody Kenny I mean Rivas is one of those guys who's allowed to talk about anybody is he or am I wrong with that I mean this is just bad to CD B's talk about DBS but at the same time you know Rivas he that's exactly what he did he played man-to-man so you can say what you can say whatever you want saying and not knocking Sherman like Sherman is good and cover three and he's great at what he do like Sherman is a I'm gonna sit back I'm gonna sit on one side I'm gonna read routes I'm gonna see what the offense is trying to do to the defense and when the time is right I'm gonna take this calculated risk and I'm gonna go make my plate that's how Richard Sherman plays football that's how he causes interceptions you give beats me he picks off deep balls he reached intermediate routes route combinations and you can only do that by sitting on one side and just getting a feel for what the offense is trying to do to you Revis Island has just been Revis Island a Revis you get him other ten guys here go out game playing this is what we're gonna do okay it's two different it's two different kind of corners so I couldn't ask what your charm to do were Reid was dead but I can ask Revis to do a Richard Sherman it's doing it's just Revis is just so used to playing man coach when I come in on Wednesday you just tell me who I got okay why have a question why did Revis get so upset about this like that's my whole I don't why do you got a same kind of question like why do you think that's shot out of nowhere it came out of nowhere I feel like like maybe there was a conversation at one point where they're talking about Sherman being the greatest corner of all it may be Rivas could have took offense to that because by all accounts Revis is one of the best businessmen in the history of the NFL and one of the best corners of all time if not the best corner of all time because Revis Island was a real thing this feels like it came out of nowhere and I don't know if during the game somebody was like hey there's Richard Sherman the greatest corner of all time and Revis was like wait a damn minute I don't know if that's why did it happen you think Y was really so upset I don't know I don't know I just know you know were you sitting at home and yeah a lot to think about well hello there get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic right now you know Revis Island man he you know everybody been coming to the island for a long time it's been empty for a while so he's just sitting at the crib and just seeing Richard Sherman continue to just do it on a high level you know is the sermon is still playing at a high level like Sherman ain't never been fast resigned I've been fast Regis has always been patient Regis always had always have had hands like the guy for it for like a technician when it comes down a bump and run coverage and not panicking when the ball is in the air that's why he's going to the Hall of Fame Revis out that's that's the guy I'm talking about Richie sure sure plays covered three and they planes oh it's our own coverage but in his own coverage Pete Mac if you just have one receiver to that side you basically plan man so for you know for extend amount of time depending on how the offense is lined up and usually he's gonna have two receivers or receiver or tight in because usually your quarterback or right hand dominant so you reap and Sherman is sitting on the left side of the defenses which is the strong side of office when you want to talk about passing tendencies so that's what makes Sherman so special because he's able to figure out and reroute combinations between whether it's one two or three receivers to his side you best believe if you throw in his way he's gonna pick the ball off alright so there's gonna be parts of that that are gonna get plucked out and out of context I just want your answer there people are gonna do that but I think you explained that perfectly and I think we all feel the same exact way as you do by the way people with a brain I'm hoping Darrelle Revis you know maybe somebody would go say hello to him or give him a little bit of love so he doesn't have this feeling because he's a goat in my eyes and I bribed him I just don't like the negative relationship that's happening right now with the road
