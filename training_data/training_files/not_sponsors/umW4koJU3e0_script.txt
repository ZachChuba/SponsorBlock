I accidentally became a meme and this is that story it's weird to be famous as a baby there were there wasn't really a before really my whole life has been me being success kid this all started in 2000 we went to the beach because I had just gotten a new camera and they wanted to take some pictures of my baby and my family Sam was 11 months old he was about to eat the handful of sand like babies do and I just not the shot just the right moment I thought it was a really cute picture I had no idea how profoundly it would impact our lives I posted the picture to my Flickr account the same day I took it it was immediately popular and got about 300 likes the first day but then after that I kind of forgot about it within a year I started to see it online there's a Photoshop child in the background with a destroyed sandcastle and it had the caption I hate sandcastles and there was another version with the caption I'm a we really had no idea what memes were because they were so new but the ones that did exist usually we're either making fun of somebody or had negative connotations we didn't want that to be associated with our baby my picture was just out there for anyone to taken manipulate I realized at that point there was no getting this picture back the internet had it and then about a year after that what's the first time I saw it used with the green blue little background my baby there was a title success kid and when I saw that I thought please let this person take off it was so positive and sweet the great thing about the success kid mean is that not only is it about success but it's about unlikely success achieving and that was really special because Sam was born prematurely then had to have brain surgery at six weeks old so seeing it called success kid just like for my heart you know it's just I felt like that was the most appropriate title for him and it was given to him by the internet before long we saw the picture everywhere so all of the internet advertising a Super Bowl commercial Obama's White House around the world it was something positive that was out there that people really responded to it's kind of hard to comprehend it's weird being a famous baby because I had no idea what was happening you know that's a I do have a lot of mixed feelings with it I would go back and forth with being like I wish I was a normal kid oh this is like you know this is super awesome and so to have fans come up to me we'd be like hey do the pose or you know like what it's a imitates like or whatever I'm like I know and I I would say like candy or something you know because like in my mind I'm just a normal lazy teenager usually just doing art and listening music I've been doing art for I mean my whole life really my dad has been a big part of why I started got that interest from him and you know I would look at his art and you know constantly copy it and stuff and then I would gain a certain style you know interest change and your mindset in your body you know changes a lot and you don't just want to be known as success kid but then I found out that my dad was sick I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease I had about 20% kidney function when they caught it I was on dialysis for six years really needed a kidney transplant but I couldn't qualify because the cost of the D rejection drugs are so enormous you know for so many people it's almost impossible we just had the idea to do a fundraiser I didn't want to mention success kid I mean I wasn't even thinking about that initially then I posted it on my Twitter account some publications who retweeted it and within the first week of the GoFundMe being posted we surpassed our goal we got so many messages saying how much the mean is meant to them and how much it brightens our day to see his face or how they're going through a dark time and so the best part of the campaign really is just feeling like we're getting this you know giant hug from the world am very thankful for everybody who has you know helped us and everybody who uses the picture a lot of nurses and doctors use it to get through the day I'm very happy that you know people who save others lives is using my picture when I was doing nothing but eating sand you know like it's a good thought you know it's it helps me I'm at an edge right now to where I don't really know what fully I do hope one day that I'll be able to create something that inspires people just as much as success kid does
