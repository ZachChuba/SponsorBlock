Marcus Mariota going to the Bears hmm well the Bears will go thirteen and three all right Mario's natural-born winner who's not actually isn't like that's why the Titans had to bench oh yeah that's literally why I love Marcus Mariota as a person I like that they still haven't had the play or two in a game I mean having them come in at a freezing-cold game like a quarter in half into it - making him do a sprint to the left and having him outrun Peter body that's I think that is very impressive for Marcus Mariota but I mean Ryan Tannehill by all accounts is not like this earth-shattering quarterback now I might be wrong I think we will talk about the tamriel situation here directly after this comment I don't know if Marcus Mariota is a guy that you want if you're the Chicago Bears instead of Mitchell true Biscay I mean both quarterbacks are quarterbacks that have showed promise but I have lacked the ability to win games that's that's exactly what they both have in common now will a new place just like Tannehill give Marcus Mariota restart maybe I don't know I'm not sure I just don't know if that's the answer if I was just goggle bears how'd be trying to get Cam Newton I honestly think I'd be trying to get Cam Newton because what's the worst that could happen he stinks yes think anyways have you heard the rumors no mr. Nick bulls oh really big Richard oh yeah you know what what are you gotta pick up that contract - it's a massive contract I don't know why I don't know why you doing what's Camden 21 million or 19 million X 19 19 million next year I assume that smaller than what Nick Foles is getting Nick Foles Brian yeah yep so you could save a little money but his nick foles was he not given a fair shake down in Jacksonville he was ballin yesterday threw a touchdown on the game that he separated his shoulder or something like that so maybe he didn't get a fair shake down there with that team maybe or maybe he just wasn't that great outside of Philadelphia I just had a good run so I wouldn't mind that I'm happy that the Bears are thinking about making a move though that's a third largest city about to be fourth largest I saw some students continuing to to fornicate with each other and recreate but Chicago third largest city in America great fans their team hasn't been relevant forever honestly the double doinks the most relevant thing they've been a part of the nets and missing that's them not making it I'm Michelle I like the Bears a lot I hope they get killed I need to take advantage of how good their defense is so I'm saying and in their defense like stop trying they seen they're like come on get $20 off your first order from CK now back to the magic now I don't think they should've done that the Niners proved that you can win just strictly off the defense I think a couple games this year in the Steelers and Steelers wants me by the way the fact that Diggs did not say the Pittsburgh Steelers are the potential 49ers of next year makes me question everything I know about this well they're not gonna be the number two overall pick I mean there's they still finished eight and eight nine seven but they have a great defense you get Big Ben back he looks then all of a sudden somehow know how he lost 70 pounds in like a week and they're just not in the same category as the 49ers were who were the number two of the overall pick last year so you just don't believe in them or what no no they're better than the 49ers were last year so you'd rather have Bosa than TJ watt Wow I really do that's a big deal you just said that I can't believe you said that Pittsburgh Steelers are winning games this year when they shouldn't one game correct we were out of game there when Josh Allen in the bills just handcuffed a duck I know our friend dodges that goes defense just eight maybe the builds of the team by the way maybe the Bills of the team that come out of nowhere and really really do some things especially with the Patriots seeming like they don't even have a football team yeah Oh Patriots I don't even think I have a football are they gonna play next year people are saying the Patriots might be in the XFL next year that's right as well we got to get to Tannehill though I want to talk about this the Tennessee Titans have 28 free agents okay that's a lot of free agents Ryan Tannehill Derek Henry are two of them are they gonna be able to take care of everybody and still have the core of that team back I'm not sure I have no idea how you do that when business gets involved things get a little dicey sometimes I think Ryan Tannehill who already has 45 million in the bank from his Dolphins contract that was 45 million in guarantees 77 total let's assume he didn't reach his incentives with dolphins because they stunk so he already has 45 million guaranteed in his life if you're the Tennessee Titans why don't you offer from two-year 35 or two-year 40 million-dollar guarantee contract here two years thirty five million dollars guaranteed now you'll have 80 million dollars in your life is that enough money for you to continue to play football in this good team and we can still keep one of the best running backs to potentially ever come into the game if he keeps going the way he's for the conversation with Eddie George but having run better between the tackles we can still be the the offensive line we can get a little bit better on the defense we can still have weapons if you take the 17 and a half to 20 million dollar deal instead of expecting the thirty to forty million dollar deals which Patrick mahomes dak Prescott and the boys are expecting Ryan Tannehill numbers this year with the Titans would definitely give him a fair shot of saying I want this number this number will he have enough self-awareness to be the first quarterback in history that has the ability to take all that money and just say you know what build the team around me give me this money thirty five forty million dollars I got eighty million dollars in the bank at my lifetime let's keep winning and enjoying this right
