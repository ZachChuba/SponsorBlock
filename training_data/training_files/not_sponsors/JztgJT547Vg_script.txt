[Music] hey what's up guys I'm capisci here and the next generation of gaming consoles is finally almost upon us we got the PS 5 reveal not too long ago when we got that event with all the exclusive games and the teasers and a hardware reveal and everything we saw the two different versions everything's very dramatic now I was going to wait typically I wait until I have a device in my hands before I can at least give my first impressions of it let alone a review but pretty much non-stop since that event people have been asking me about it talking about it and there's just so much conversation to be had from that reveal so maybe let's have that conversation now the one main thing sony did not reveal at that event was the price of the PS 5 I have some some guesses and if some rumors floating around and we'll get to that for sure in this video but generally yeah they didn't reveal the price officially or the release date bummer but there is still a lot to say about what we did see and what did get revealed now I'm a ps4 user myself some of you might not know that but that was it's actually my first gaming console ever and my current gaming console of choice so I've been looking forward to PS 5 and seeing what it would bring seven years later I've also been keeping my eye on Xbox Series X but that's a whole separate video so for ps5 first of all the design the controversial design I'm not gonna lie I kind of do like it and I'm sure you guys will have your own thoughts in the comments it seems like people either love it or hate it kind of like the cyber truck but there is a lot to actually think about that goes into the design of a new console number one is how big is it because it's got to fit underneath a TV or somewhere where the previous box would have fit and there's no scale here in the announcement but you know there's a lot of educated guesses being made based on the size of the disk drive and those guesses peg it as basically the biggest console ever it's really tall so that naturally question number two is can it go sideways and yes officially it can go sideways and this is the only way will fit under my TV but then just subjectively I think it kind of looks like a futuristic version of what you might expect a next-gen console to look like from some alien planet whoever but they really leaned into this aesthetic and it trickles down to the controller and the headphones and everything else I actually think the Xbox Series X looks better I think it looks more modern and minimal even though it's more boring if that makes sense though then again maybe there's been some mock-ups if Sony made a black version of the PS 5 I think it would change a lot more Minds get more people on board especially because white plastic doesn't have the best reputation for aging well and people keep their consoles for several years so that could be interesting to see down the road I'm sure deep bran will have a field day with this one though okay so there's two versions the regular PS 5 and then the PlayStation 5 digital edition that's just missing the optical drive I thought it was kind of funny that so many people were caught off guard by there being these two different versions but it actually makes perfect sense for several reasons first of all I and then people like me will be getting the digital only version I have a good enough internet connection that I download all my games I've never bought a physical game and I don't need the blu-ray player so I'll get the digital version that's fine but there are definitely people who will buy this console who one don't have amazing internet connections and can't download every single game and so they have a physical games collection and two people who literally use this console as their only blu-ray player my ps4 is my only blu-ray player right now now I don't have any blu-rays and I don't use them but ps5 is a 4k blu-ray player and for a lot of people that's also pretty useful so the digital version that I'll be getting it looks a bit more elegant you know it doesn't look like they finished the design and then remembered oh right forgot we have to put an optical drive on there somewhere we'll just stick it over to the side here but then with that missing part it'll also most definitely be a bit cheaper matter fact let's just get to the price let's just talk about the price for a second the rumours are all over the place so the ps3 launched for $5.99 then the ps4 for $3.99 back in 2013 and so now people are saying with all these new incredible capabilities and all these expectations Sony didn't announce the price because it's gonna be super expensive probably like a thousand bucks or something but that I don't know I don't think so I think and there's some rumors of course to back this up and potentially leaks as well I think but I think it'll cost $4.99 for the PS 5 and possibly 399 for the digital-only Edition something like that and I don't even think just removing the optical drive has to be a hundred dollar difference so it might be something like $4.99 and for 49 for the digital only versus the the main PS 5 somewhere like that like just with the history of pricing for these consoles if Sony wants a hundred million people to impulse buy and upgrade from their ps4s they can't really charge seven hundred eight hundred bucks or more for this console I could see it being in the five hundred something ballpark but anything higher than that seems unlikely so then again all this is TBD they didn't yet announce that press the actual tech inside of the PS 5 is also of course a big upgrade from the seven-year-old ps4 as you'd expect it's all solid state storage now instead of a hard drive I think that's the biggest difference but it's also an AMD eight core CPU and a ten point two eight teraflop variable-frequency GPU and there's 16 gigs of ram in there some people including some youtubers even my friend Austin Evans are comparing the the power of the PS 5 to that of a modern-day like straight up tower desktop gaming PC and I don't quite see it there yet I think obviously something with a smaller body like that doesn't quite have the thermal envelope it can't really match the raw power of a gaming PC but the thing about the games here's the thing about the games these games can develop and optimize for every little detail every maximum of the PS 5 because everyone playing these games has the same PS 5 whereas if you're developing a PC game for example optimization is a bit harder there's so many various different parts and compat anywhere from a 200 to a $2,000 tower could be playing your game that's much harder so you can expect these new PS 5 games to have much better lighting ray-tracing better textures and just overall bigger better maps and more realism we saw a ton of this in that teaser livestream I think the games look pretty good for the most part not all dramatically like next-gen real or anything mind-blowing to the point where I feel like I need it now but you know they look like next-gen games better than ps4 games honestly there were only two games in that huge teaser trailer event that I really cared about and they're very different NBA 2k 21 and Gran Turismo 7 so the NBA 2k 21 trailer it was a bit cringy if I'm being honest it's like to me it's pretty obvious that they're nowhere near done with the game they didn't show any real gameplay it was just a teaser of Zion Williamson potential future face of the NBA and a really dramatically lit gym staring down absolutely no one sweating profusely and then dunking and that's pretty much it like when you're playing the gameplay itself you'll never see all this dramatic lighting and sweat but for the teaser they're like oh we got to add as much glistening sweat as possible the Gran Turismo I think looked really good this looks like a game that's a lot closer done first of all but it looks like a game that's gonna take full advantage of the PS 5 in a lot of ways and they showed much more of what looked like you know typical gameplay and this is a game where you want it to be as realistic as possible so you go all out with lighting and reflections and detail all over the map and of course now the SSD and the new hardware can handle all that ps5 also supports 120 Hertz 4k or 8k output so the future proofing is definitely real here now I don't have 128 Hertz or 8k TV at home like most people don't but Gran Turismo 7 seems like the kind of game that would do great at high refresh rate I would love to play it at 120 yes for better reaction times in just a more responsive feel looks super good also I just thought of this just as a side note I hope the PS 5 is quieter than the ps4 I don't know how many of you guys have a ps4 but if you'll notice after like half an hour of playing 2k or really anything the fans are spending a hundred percent like it sounds like a jet-engine about to take off and obviously with these games taking full advantage of the PS 5 again it's probably pushing it to the limits I just hope it doesn't have the same acoustic problem as the ps4 but also just for fun I looked at another game that wasn't in the trailer the golf game PGA 2k 21 and it looks nowhere near as good as the ones that were teased there's some some some teaser gameplay on their YouTube channel I'll link it below that like button but look at the golfer look at the crowds I mean that that just to me that doesn't scream Wow next-gen gaming really enabled this to happen like you do have better textures and shading of the grass and and everything's clearly a bit better than last year but yeah there's gonna be a wide range of games and how they take advantage of all this new hardware overall though from what's been revealed I'm excited I'm excited for better looking more realistic games generally and the franchise's that I'm used to playing getting better and also from all the other titles they've committed to just maybe trying out one or two other games that look really fun just because I guess we have more time on our hands now but hey let me know what you guys think in the comments section below and now we're kind of stepping out of the usual element here given impressions of something before we actually get it this is probably what Sony wants but trust me when we do get it in here there will be and impressions there will be a full review make sure to subscribe to see that if you haven't already when it comes out either way I'll leave it at that thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one taste
