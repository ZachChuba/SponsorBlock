don't know when they performed this song the Dead Kennedys came out with big asses on their shirt and then pulled ties over them to turn them into dollar signs the song's chorus is a parody of the hit my Sharona except they criticize paola the practice of paying radio DJs to air specific music the masterwork of the dead kennedys satire might be holiday in Cambodia the song is a parody of yuppie college students unaware of their privilege it draws stark contrast between the lives of these people and the situation in Cambodia which was under the brutal rule of Pol Pot's totalitarian dictatorship the song starts out with a frame of these college kids that claim they know the plight of the poor and then it suggests that they take a holiday in Cambodia where a dictatorship was in the middle of putting the educated city living people of the country into forced labor [Music] the song takes on societal elites who the dead kennedys have a distaste for while also condemning the US government for lack of action in Cambodia holiday in Cambodia shows how powerful satire can be as a tool of social commentary the Dead Kennedys had it down to a science and thanks to their witty lyrics they were able to separate themselves from the punk pack and leave a legacy as one of the funniest most powerful and most important bands in punk history I'd [Music]
