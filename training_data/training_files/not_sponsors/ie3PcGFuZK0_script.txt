[Music] let's play a game I'm going to show you a few movie clips and I want you to tell me whether that particular scene qualifies as a Mexican standoff or not ready here we go I suppose you got a gun out there yep what we're gonna do we can't stand here all night why don't you both put your guns down go home I'd be stupid all right you have your answers well you might be surprised to find out that actually none of these are technically Mexican standoffs now wait wait wait wait I can already hear you out there smashing your keyboards and yelling at your screen but just give me a minute to explain before researching for this essay I too had a vague idea of what a Mexican standoff is I thought it was any life-or-death confrontation with three or more people and while there are half-truths in that thought there's nuance and certain elements that must be present in order to technically qualify as a Mexican standoff first let's explain what a Mexican standoff isn't a Mexican standoff isn't a game of chicken and chicken it's rarely a person's life that's at stake it's usually a person's reputation or a material good that's at stake a Mexican standoff isn't a stalemate a stalemate implies that both sides are out of moves and because of that neither side has any way of winning or losing the Mexican standoff isn't a shootout a shootout or a firefight contains little to no strategy or deliberation it's pure action carnage with bullets flying everywhere last and perhaps most obvious a Mexican standoff isn't a regular standoff similar to a shootout a regular standoff doesn't contain much strategy or deliberation it's a deadlock between multiple parties where one party has the possibility of walking away alive because of that a standoff basically boils down to a match of skill who is faster who has better aim it's basically 99% of westerns one winner and one loser so now that we know what it isn't what exactly is a Mexican standoff in simplest terms a Mexican standoff is any confrontation where neither opponent has an advantage or a clear means of achieving victory over the other a vast majority of Mexican standoffs in film involve guns but these standoffs can also include swords bombs and basically any weapon there are two possible results that can come from any Mexican standoff de-escalation or destruction all parties must back down and defuse the situation or else all parties will suffer great loss no one wants to back down either due to pride or fear but if no one backs down the final outcome will be bad for everyone involved a Mexican standoff is always a lose-lose situation but the severity of the loss varies it's either a shot to their pride or a shot to their head because the main factor of a Mexican standoff is that no one has advantage or a clear means of victory a Mexican standoff can take the form of merely two opponents with guns and each other's faces at point-blank range oh how could it be a Mexican standoff everybody knows you need three sides for that you know many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm either they both back down or they both die the problem with two opponents is that once the guns are drawn and aimed it's almost impossible to find a peaceful resolution at that point which is why a third party in some form or fashion usually intervenes to break it up or shift the balance of power the stakes and drama go up when more people are involved in the standoff because it becomes even more difficult to de-escalate a situation with so many egos and conflicting agendas that's why the three-person Mexican standoff has become so iconic it reinforces this heightened drama in a visual way what was once a line between two opponents now becomes a vicious circle a Mexican standoff can consist of three four five ten just as long as it's apparent that there can be no clear winner that walks away completely unscathed a Mexican standoff can even technically consist of army against army though when nations do this in real life it's often referred to as mutual assured destruction a military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker defender it's basically the theory of nuclear deterrence which holds that the threat of using powerful weapons will prevent the enemy from using the same powerful weapons in my opinion the best characteristic of a Mexican standoff is the tense conversations this isn't a quick mindless shooting with a predetermined outcome there's a strategy at play between the opposing characters there's deliberation as the characters attempt to bargain defuse the situation argue reason or threaten their opponent and these moments are heightened because the characters weapons aren't simply holstered they're aimed right at each other there's the suspense that a gun could go off at any moment and once the first bullet is fired all hell breaks loose Hong Kong director John Woo is credited with popularizing the Mexican standoff in film but I don't think anyone has utilized the plot device more frequently and effectively across their career then writer director Quentin Tarantino let's examine some scenes across Tarantino's filmography and see if they technically qualify as a Mexican standoff or not this scene from Reservoir Dogs qualifies as a Mexican standoff because all parties are tied together with their guns drawn without any clear advantage they know that once a single bullet goes off it will trigger a chain reaction of destruction and it's while they're all paused with their guns pointed at each other that they each try to argue their own agendas without success this scene from pulp fiction also qualifies as Mexican standoff for all the same reasons as Reservoir Dogs in both examples there isn't a perfect circle of destruction where everyone has a gun pointed at them but there's still a clear chain of linked parties that would result in casualties on both sides if a single gun were to go off as their guns are all pointed at each other and the tension builds Jules is actually able to successfully deescalate the situation by calmly discussing his agenda in the end no one comes out triumphant over the other which still technically makes it a lose-lose situation but both parties do walk away with their lives which is a victory in itself Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 exudes the same tone in style as classic American and spaghetti westerns from the past and because of that a majority of the fights come off more like shootouts with their complete chaos or regular standoffs that are more about the match of skills with a clear winner and loser because of that this scene with the crazy 88 doesn't qualify as a Mexican standoff but this scene in the hotel room between two equally skilled assassins does inglorious basterds has two fantastic Mexican standoffs and they're both within minutes of each other the first happens when the good guys disguised as Nazi officers accidentally give their true identities away with the subtle tell quickly and quietly guns are pointed at each other and everyone realizes that no one will be walking away from the table with their lives in the aftermath of the bloodshed Willie Bridget and Aldo find themselves in another Mexican standoff as aldo explains you decide shoot we're dead up top they got grenades they drop them down here you're dead that's a Mexican standoff and that was not the deal they each have their own agendas Aldo and the bastards won Bridget and Willie wants to see his newborn child at first it seems like the standoff is going to have a peaceful resolution before Bridget takes matters into her own hands these are films that Tarantino directed but at the beginning of his career he also liked putting Mexican standoffs into scripts he wasn't directing both true romance and natural-born killers also have Mexican standoffs at the end of their respective films just from looking at Tarantino's filmography you're able to see the different forms that Mexican standoffs are able to take they can consist of a roomful of people yelling at each other with their guns pointed in all directions or it can simply be two people in two guns all you technically need is a lose-lose situation where neither opponent has advantage or a clear way of winning over the other that's what makes a Mexican standoff and Mexican standoff this video is brought the elk and to help me make more content thanks everyone for watching and I will see you all in the next video
