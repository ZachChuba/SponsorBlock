have you ever been sitting at your laptop thinking there's screams too far oh I can't see you again hey what if I told you a sir has a solution that's pretty neat I guess but it doesn't really answer the question of who out there was asking for this so we'll be spending the next few minutes figuring out what makes this laptop truly special speaking of special awesome check out the link below to get your new favorite shirt today [Music] let's start by figuring out just who the heck the Tritan 900 was made for my first thought honestly game designers it's a super powerful machine with a party trick that's right up their alley this surprisingly robust feeling hinged screen gives you three positions to work with all the way back all the way forward and even check that out a drawing position with the last one being especially important since there are two things that game designers need somewhere to design you know like ideally with a pen on a nice large display and then somewhere to be able to play their game making a roided-out surface book look like the perfect solution except for one small hiccup even though this is a touchscreen when we tried using various pens from Dell HP Microsoft welcome and Samsung none of them worked but just because the display doesn't feature pen support doesn't mean that it's bad we just need to take a little deeper here and in fairness it's not just not bad this is one of the most crisp gaming displays that we've ever feasted our eyes on we're talking 4k resolution 400 nits peak brightness that's pretty darn good for a mobile device a hundred percent Adobe RGB colour space coverage and support for HDR video playback coupled with the improved ergonomics a screen like this could make the Triton 900 a killer content consumption laptop but we've got another problem I mean if you want to buy a thirty-eight hundred US dollar machine to watch YouTube videos be my guest but it's probably not the wisest move ever plus the speakers which of course brings us to the most obvious conclusion I mean it's part of their predator lineup is the Triton 900 for gamers then packing an Nvidia r-tx 20/80 this thing chews through games I mean you can expect to be able to run basically anything at 4k 60fps even on high details making it fantastic for simulation games like City skylines or an O 1800 as well as third person or sightseeing games like The Witcher 3 or the Tomb Raider series where you can like really crank up the details because even if you do dip a little bit below 60 FPS because you turn to RTX on or whatever g-sync is gonna step in and make sure that your game still looks its best we even don't mind it for streaming because while the webcam isn't anything special at least it has one unfortunately anything without a high refresh rate display feels like a compromise to us in 2019 especially for anything first-person and especially for anything competitive and the thing is there are lots of other laptops on the market that can deliver way more frames on their panels and that still look really good for a lot less the Zephyrus GX 701 is one that stands out it's nearly as powerful as this machine while and I never thought I'd be saying these two things about this Sepphoris being a lot easier to use as a laptop and a lot cheaper alright then so let's say maybe you only occasionally game but you also need lots of power and a really sharp display for other things that I like I don't know number crunching or 3d modeling well here the Triton 900 really shines it sports up to an 8 core core I $9.99 a thk that in our case regularly turbo to up to four point eight gigahertz and lighter loads and maintain 3.6 gigahertz so well above intel's advertised base clock in heavier multi-threaded ones this actually puts it on the podium with the fastest laptops we've ever tested where it gets beaten only by the Alienware area 51 M which in fairness to Acer has a freaking desktop CPU in it and this incredible CPU power is augmented by excellent i/o including three USB type-a ports a Type C Thunderbolt 3 Gigabit Ethernet and two full size display connectors one quick aside one of the USB ports is inside this little flippy outy thing that kind of weirdest out at first and then we were like oh wow you can hide your wireless mouse dongle in there with worrying about it getting broken or lost sick of course features like hidden compartments are normally found on pretty bulky machines and this is no exception even ignoring its monstrous nine pound weight the treyton 900 is hardly a lap top in the traditional sense I mean we understand that firmly it makes a lot of sense to lay it out like this you've got nice easy access to fresh air for your fans but using this thing in your lap is uncomfortable at best and as for working away from the wall I mean maybe the silver lining here is that you won't have time to get uncomfortable actually I lied about that last bit the typing experience is pretty good overall but only if you remember your wrist rest otherwise it's a pretty bad time the good news is that while acer is low profile mechanical keyboard did take me a little while to get used to once I did I began to really like it aside from some oddities the spacebar needs better stabilisation this is unacceptable and as for the right shift who puts that here it takes so much mental effort on this machine to type a question mark and every single time I tried to use the right shift at best I ended up with the cursor up a line and at worst I'm an entire page above where I intended to be while I'm talking about things on the lower right side of the laptop let's address the touchpad now a lot of people hate this layout but after using it more it's actually not that bad this one tracks well and I'm always surprised to see how quickly I get used to track pads in this location I only find it truly annoying when I'm trying to go all the way from one side of the screen to the other while we're down here by the way let's pry up the keyboard which gives us access to the only upgradable components on the Triton 900 the 2 m2 SSD slots and the to sodium memory slots so not much expansion here so then let's take stock we've got a desktop replacement that's not too upgradable but is damn powerful out of the box with a pretty good LBA kind of annoying keyboard and an outstanding display have we perhaps found the perfect machine for our video editors it actually looks great on paper but does this panel have the color accuracy that they would require well after testing it turns out that while it manages over 99% of the Adobe RGB color space which is great when we look at the accuracy of the colors within that space it's not particularly amazing with an average delta e of 4.2 and a max of 7.3 this display yeah it's gonna look great to the eye while you're gaming we really felt that but it simply isn't good enough for color critical work like video or photo editing for those you're generally looking for Delta ease of less than 2 so this is where a sirs concept the 9 starts to look really appealing it's basically the same laptop but it includes a Wacom digitizer for professional level stylus support and its color calibrated on the box so that you can trust that what you see is what others are going to see only problem is the concept D is projected to be about a thousand dollars more than the Triton 900 so if you don't need stylus support and you want an incredible machine for video editing or content creation on the go we really like the Triton 900 just make sure you grab a display calibrator as well speaking of grabbing things why tips just enter Linus tech tips in the how did you hear about us section so thanks for watching guys
