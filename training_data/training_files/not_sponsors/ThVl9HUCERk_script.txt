[Music] father give me the remote I want to watch TV I'm not giving you anything that's mine in this house there will be no socialism come on you fascist I just want to watch a show that's about to come on what do you want to watch say yes to the dress no I want to watch Jimmy Kimmel [Music] I am physically triggered what's up everybody it's your favorite gay looking straight boy with your favorite peach fuzz face hunter Avalon here back with another spicy video today we are talking about everyone's least favorite late night TV more importantly late night TVs biggest loser Jimmy Kimmel I'm sure many of you are familiar with him but I'm guessing not a lot of you actually watch him my guess is the only time you've actually ever seen Jimmy Kimmel is on your grandparents 2001 Panasonic or on YouTube's trash trending page let's be real here for just a second everyone no one really watches Jimmy Kimmel he just gets on the trending page because he's safe and corporate every now and then I make the tragic mistake of scrolling through the trending page went boom I'm like a 1940's soldier running into a mine Kimmel has been around for a very long time for as long as many of us can remember however since the election of Donald Trump mr. Kimmel has really enjoyed stroking his little Jimmy about what a good woke progressive he is this is Jimmy Kimmel the worst of late night me at Hunter Ave alone day so let's begin with a quick peek into the past of our good old friend Jimbo Jimmy Kimmel was born in Brooklyn New York and started his career by working in radio while he was in high school his radio show became pretty popular and by 1989 Kimmel received a paid job as a co-host for the me and him show in Seattle Washington it wasn't until 1997 that he began his TV career first appearing on a Comedy Central Game Show win Ben Stein's money finally by the year 2003 Jimmy Kimmel left his Comedy Central gig and began his own late night show on ABC Jimmy Kimmel Live despite the name the show hasn't aired live since 2004 due to a mishap when sensors failed to bleep a barrage of swearing from one of the interviewees in 2007 Kimmel was named the biggest battle on TV a title Kimmel said was an honor but a mistake so how did we go from Jimmy Kimmel being dubbed the biggest bad app on TV to what we have today a bland monologue with weak jokes and easy jabs at Republican politics this ladies and gentlemen brings me to my first point Jimmy Kimmel Live sucks I'm not sure Kimmel was ever actually funny but if he was well it wasn't in my lifetime Kimmel show is increasingly bland unfunny and predictable I've taken one of his more recent clips posted on his 16 million subscriber YouTube channel to break down why his show is so bad stage presence I don't know how Kimmel gains so much popularity because his stage presence is not very good I spent a lot of my time thinking about who to vote for you know a week from tomorrow it's Super Tuesday 14 states including ours California vote and if you're voting for a Democrat you have to pick a candid you have to pick one unfortunately most people I talk to about this still don't know which one he comes off as unprepared bored and almost sleepy he isn't really saying anything of interest and even his attempt at jokes just fall flat caramel what did you look do last week during the vacation I spend a lot of time with my family a lot of time with your family doing what taking my son to school pick up take him to the park different places so nothing really is the answer nothing exactly me too even the audience laughs for only a second and then it just trails off it's almost like the audience knows it's what they're supposed to do rather than genuine laughter I mean do you go with the candidate who has the best chance to beat Donald Trump do you go with the one you like the most or the candidate with the strongest teeth and bones it's a tough spot to be in how does this guy talk with such minimal facial expressions he doesn't even look like he's into what he's talking about take the poor stage presence and the lack of enthusiasm and mix it with terrible bland jokes and you're halfway there to a Hollywood superstar jokes obviously I'm no comedian but when you're hosting one of the biggest late-night shows in America I expect some decent jokes nothing great but at least mediocre Bernie Sanders won big in Nevada on Saturday and is now considered to be the frontrunner that's right there's a 78 year old man running in front it's instead at Kimmel revert still really boring really safe and really corny jokes to appeal to his boomer audience next you have Joe Biden another old white man whose biggest problem is that he's not progressive enough so who do we pair him with Flo woman only person in the world with more commercials than Mike Bloomberg she's got name recognition she's literally progressive she works for the company ha ha ha ha ha ha ha get it it's funny because Flo works for a company called progressive and progressive also means really liberal something Joe Biden is not pleased laughs audience it's what you're paid to do of course technically speaking any joke can be reduced to make it sound less funny but this is not only the funniest that he gets this is Jimmy Kimmel Live this is Jimmy Kimmel with a script imagine what he'd be like without a group of list writers to pump out some good old-fashioned humor TM unfortunately for us we don't have to imagine it because as Jimmy's show is temporarily off air he decided to post an unscripted monologue on his massive YouTube channel to broadcast just how unfunny and bland he really is I'm gonna shoot a mini monologue every day until we get back from my house where I am currently incarcerated I mean camping out with my family I'm actually hiding in my office right now from my children we've run out of snacks we've run out of craps to do we made macaroni necklaces yesterday today I ate them for lunch I've seen tick tocks more entertaining than this get to the point Jimmy did you know that you can make coffee at home for yourself okay so the only funny thing with this is how he completely fails to relate to the average American he's so corporatized he's forgotten what it's like to live like a regular person this is a wonderful example of another major flaw with Jimmy Kimmel he's become the perfect picture of a Hollywood elitist a snide liberal who thinks he knows better than everyone else which brings me to my next point Jimmy Kimmel sucks Jimmy's show isn't only bad Jimmy Kimmel himself is bad he represents everything wrong with modern day elite liberal Hollywood Hollywood has always been full of arrogant losers but since Trump selection Jimmy Kimmel has jumped on the bandwagon setting up his brand as a trump bashing machine I'm not gonna start whining when someone makes fun of Trump all right he's the president he's relevant and it is our right as American citizens to make fun of government officials if we choose to do so I am however going to whine that Jimmy Kimmel isn't doing anything unique his mockery of Trump has become repetitive and stale and virtually all his material relies on Trump bashing even in the boring clip we just saw after Jimmy fails to crack a few jokes he quickly reverts back to Trump in a way that doesn't even make sense and then Trump told people us to stop hoarding unnecessary amounts of food that's right this man this individual would like you to take it easy with the food so please by order of the president can't your jokes at least make sense Trump had that large amount of food because he was hosting a meal with the Clemson Tigers football team see this doesn't come across as a valid criticism of Trump which can be refreshing it comes across as a desperate attempt at a gotcha because your job is to make fun of Donald Trump is that because of his tiny tiny hands even a travel sized bottle of Purell is like a lifetime supply Hey look everybody a joke that wasn't funny in 2016 and it's not funny now the only people who actually find these types of jokes funny are people who already don't like Trump I mean come on they're the type of people to an ironic ly vote for Biden and I understand it's your job to talk about the news in a humorous way but this isn't humorous and it isn't news I don't really think that Kimmel cares all that much that he's an arrogant elitist I mean the guy's worth like thirty five million dollars so I guess he's doing something right a recent poll published in Hollywood Reporter revealed that Jimmy Kimmel is seen as one of the most liberal late night hosts don't like it well too bad it's probably just because you're dumb Pepperidge Farm remembers when Kimmel said in 2018 that late night hosts are liberal because it requires a measure of intelligence finally Kimmel is not only an unfunny bland predictable liberal elitist he's also a massive hypocrites falling perfectly in line with Kimmel's predictability one of his constant criticisms of Trump is that Donald Trump is a racist racist when he finds out who's been posting all this racist stuff on his Twitter account he's gonna be pissed but Trump is a racist president yes yes please stop clutching your pearls we get it Trump tweets racist crap something all of Hollywood is completely shocked by however some of you may have seen the now-infamous clip of our woke boy mr. Jimmy Kimmel himself wearing blackface not only is he wearing blackface but he's mocking an African American accent as well take a look sometime at night Hall below look up in sky and say what the hell going on up there the UFO live on another planet phone and whole like et , no read on TV about white people getting deducted by alien sticking all kind of hell up they but that's a damn thing there it is the only time his wife has ever found him attractive for such a perfect little progressive angel this is certainly not a good look for Jimmy Kimmel I'm not into canceling people I don't even really care that much but when it's mr. Jimmy frickin Kimmel doing this kind of thing well it makes him look like the massive hypocrite that he is he's fine lecturing Americans about politics cracking boring jokes only other boring Hollywood hacks find funny and calling Trump a racist win in many ways Kimmel is guilty of the same exact thing it makes me think that Kimmel's constant claims that Trump is a racist is a little more along the lines of projection Jimmy Kimmel is everything wrong with modern-day late-night TV from his hypocrisy to his terrible stage presence how this guy managed to get so popular is completely beyond me all I know is that Jimmy Kimmel will go down in history as the worst of late-night TV [Music]
