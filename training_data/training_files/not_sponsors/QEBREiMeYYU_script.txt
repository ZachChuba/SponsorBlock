platform to build a beautiful online presence look I know I know I have a lot to explain with the title less provocative and edgy as the one that this video has you're probably cursing to yourself inwardly it's still a sin why did I click on this video you're asking it's just clickbait the friendzone is obviously not a good thing we all know that it's because I find myself in the friend zone I was suckered into clicking this relatable content thing it's I have good news of great joy my friend this is not clickbait this is real the friendzone is good for you now don't get me wrong in the short term it's awful there are a few things worse in the first world than when someone you are attached to romantically only sees you as a mere friend it hurts for several reasons which I will outline now so as to prove I understand the gravity of the friends and I am NOT saying this lightly one it hurts because you just feel embarrassed for caring in the first place when clearly you care more than the other person Carinae and by the way before we go to this skit and when you explain sarah's sick this week okay she has probably the flu so Kelly is playing the girl in this skit but Kelly is obviously very pregnant at this point so just pretend she's not pregnant use your imagination although actually that's a surefire way to get out of the friendzone how can you call me just a friend when I will care for this child as if he were my own okay anyway sorry number one you feel embarrassed for caring Renee I'm gonna put it all on the line just this once I have real feelings for you Renee Oh James that's so brave of you to admit and I can tell you really care about me but at the same time just me just just number two it hurts because you're annoyed with yourself for obsessing over something you can't really control it said she was typing and then it stopped and nothing was sent this was five minutes ago maybe she accidentally hit one of the keys before she closed out the chat or or maybe she was thinking about our friendship we had a really good talk yesterday she even said I was funny she said I was funny I will pray for you and three it hurts because you feel like you're not good enough maybe if you were cooler ah oh hey Jordan what have you done to yourself do you like my hair just Jesus called he said that that's the worst thing he's ever seen I'm right here hotter luke warmer this person would like you but apparently you're not enough and that goes deeper than just this relationship okay this is your identity your insecurities your vulnerabilities so don't you dare tell me I'm click baiting you okay I know what it's like to be friend zone ain't quite frankly I know what it's like to friendzone too but look it's these deeper emotional issues that I really want to focus on here because here's the thing guys do you really think romance is going to carry a relationship long term no I hope I'm not any long-term relationship needs a solid friendship at the foundation romance makes you feel good friendship builds you character that's not to say romance is a bad thing okay I love romanticism a zhing but you're not building character when you know when you're making out with somebody else be honest hey you want to build some character no thanks I've built enough character for a while but the point is it's easy to see friendship as a punishment instead of a reward but friendship is great it's the foundation of all good relationships and guess what one day you want the right person to recognize what a great friend you are and you can only be a great friend if a few people you know friendzone you along the way when someone does that to you it's a great opportunity to put their needs ahead of your own because maybe you are madly in love with this person but you know how you prove it by making your peace with the fact that they don't like you back talk about character building I mean imagine if every person you ever liked just automatically like you back you'd still be acting like a child you would have no reason to ever grow up this is why child actors look I just came up with it this is why I actually Josh did he wrote the script this is why child actors are so messed up when they get older so when I say that the friendzone is the best thing that could happen to you I don't mean it's fun or enjoyable I'm just saying it's good for you not clickbait stay tuned for purchase of a website or domain that squarespace.com slash cow Rene I'm gonna put it all on the line just this once Rene I'm gonna put it all on the line just this once I have feelings for you Rene I believe in you and your limp arm and then let go okay Brene I'm gonna
