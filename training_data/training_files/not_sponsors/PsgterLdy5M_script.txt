welcome back everybody to tears a driver I hope you're doing very well I just want to apologize that I didn't upload in the last day or two the reasons for our actually a couple of reasons firstly we sold the Model X yesterday which means we only have one car now so it's one car between two of us which is the first time we've ever been through this so we're gonna talk about it in a second but also secondly my eyes I've had real bad issues with my eyes look away if you don't like little gross things three-two-one that's what my eye look like and it's taken a couple of days for it to heal so Holly's doing the driving today but this is actually your first ever drive of the model 3 hmm you excited I am I'm also a little bit nervous first things first is Holly setting up her driver profile I just apologize for my shaking hands by the way you guys know I've got the essential tremors and problems so I am a little bit shaky I don't know if I should do my seat fastly first first C always first before mirror because obviously if you set the mirror up for that seat it's not gonna be then set up for when you set your seat up now watch how far forward this is going to go well that's not me by the way that was the future C pop in for a new whip just popped in nice right so you're a lot closer but that feeling good going out my driving time so much pressure new car is exciting as I know it slowly over pumped like that before no I know but just remember this has very stiff suspension it's very low down now compared to the Model X I will say I don't feel like the cherries as comfy as the ex chair that sounds weird it feels like we've got flat just drive a little bit faster there might be stone stuck in the wheel know that that's bumping like with a flat so we have this new tire put on just yesterday and I found out what the issue is all of these stones here actually stuck on the glue of the wheel and it's making it do that horrible lumping sound actually I going to talk to you about this in a minute because it was such a good job but I think that should solve the issue yeah this feels really tiny to feel small if you're low down yeah nimble though like nice and tight yeah I feel like I'm driving a sports car yeah good that's exactly why you have an old Audi TT in yeah it feels like that kind of no it's okay it feels quite like bouncy now but what I liked about the X's we were quite high up and I didn't ever have to worry about really bumping along yeah but yeah it's quite smooth even though slow down yeah you're gonna you're gonna feel a lot more of the potholes and stuff so you're gonna have to be more careful on those kind of things but in general the dog oh that's awesome while Holly's getting used to the model 3 I thought I would take this time to announce a couple of things some really good news actually we've hit a hundred that's right a hundred referrals through the Tesla driver YouTube channel thank you everyone who has bought a Tesla through our channel because of the videos from this point on I'm gonna ask people not to use my referral code because we don't need any more free supercharger miles like we could just hold them but we really don't need anymore so instead you guys comment down below your supercharger links and can you guys use other people's so we can start a little community up thank you sweetheart which would be really cool so thank you all for using that we've hit the milestone and that is a job complete also we had the new time put on this car yesterday and it was such a good job it was done by Kwik Fit who I've never used before I don't know why but I would never have used them before I used their mobile phone service and the person came and had installed the tire within what 20 minutes and then finally the big sad news is of course that the Model X Doom has sold and we're going to talk about that more a minute but let's have a little bit of an update doll how you feeling good I'm it's just like driving a new car I'm obviously just trying to get used to where I'll feel much more comfortable and a lot more natural I think when I've had like a good hour in that yeah but like little things are different like the indicators are all very obviously different I mean it's in the same place but your indicator doesn't have to be pushed down yeah yeah I just need to practice with it to you know get used to it make it much more like fluid rather moving like air so far you're enjoying it and you're thinking okay brilliant that's great news so back to the Model X so I put the Model X on auto trader for around fifty four thousand pounds or something and actually sold within two days I got a message from a guy called William over evey hero who messaged with a really fair price for the Model X and I said look this is what I would happily go down to and it was pretty close to what it was and we came to an agreement and he came two days later and picked it up paid for it there and then they were over for what an hour and a half two hours we obviously had the issues with the bank's just being like can you confirm this is you and you can see the car and the guys not trying to rob you all of that kind of stuff and it was lovely to chat to him so what I want you guys to know if you're like me if you were worried about selling maybe you've got an expensive car or an electric car and it can be tough to sell in a marketplace because I got a lot of calls from people who have never had an electric car before asking me can we go out can you show me it you know like this kind of stuff and really I just didn't have time to do that so William messaging me and saying I can come collect it straightaway pay for it and just take it away from you was absolutely brilliant an absolutely awesome guy check out their Trustpilot too so yeah the X is gone we're pretty sad about it but no I thought we I thought I would cried yeah but you nearly nearly did you actually teared up before with me though yeah it's because we've had him for so long we've had maybe three years I mean often I've been together for four years we had it three years in its probably the longest I've ever had a car and they were Jessica I know it sounds silly but he was very much like part of our family we did everything in him he really was and also you've got to remember things like Raven was born and I slept in that car as Raven as Raven was being born and then I ran in so our first drive home she was in there it's just like it's got so many memories doesn't it to us both yeah but her shares Safari being in there for Ravenna like having our friends and stuff in there and do it might live so it's just it's got so much history so something you haven't tested yet in this car is the autopilot do you want to give it a quick test now I've done this road many many times and it's never had a problem so all you need to do is with your right stick push it down twice and let go of the wheel that's it job done I didn't even really autopilot in the ex though to be fair did I very much a control freak did you use it on the motorway at all yeah like oh do all the boats away but I wouldn't do on roads like this so this road like 'obviously I've done this road loads on my on my videos before and I know that it's pretty flawless at it so at the moment you go 40 you see the 50 speed limit on the screen yeah if you just touch that with your finger that will then bring you up to the speed about 50 [Music] that's it now it's just it's it's in full control if you want to turn off just tap the brake pedal yeah that's it you don't that's it simple as that so if you tap the brake pedal or if you nudge the the steering wheel so that you take control then you take back yeah so you ping it back on quickly and they take it off just test there you go how are you finding it not having of course a screen up at the front there at all do you know I don't miss it do you feel like go-karting or does it feel you know it does that I know it's the other way around and it's up higher but it really I'm not paying attention to it doesn't feel different yeah you know you know the speed that you go in roughly you know what you do is like I mean everybody also basically knows how fast they're going anywhere yeah just always slightly over it just feels it feels very similar I mean it's the same size screen as that its well obviously as its landscape rather being portrait and you don't have the instrument cluster up in front of you over there so in nighttime it is a little bit different because you don't have a screen there and it's just dark but in the day it's not too different [Music] the universal nono square song coming up [Music] are you finding that the one foot operation in the model three so this has a lot more regenerative braking than the Model X and you noticing that you probably not having to use the brake I you not really what do you think like it I like it again it doesn't feel too different I'm not I don't really breaking the egg okay like baby you know when you come to a complete stop in the eggs yeah you have to use the break room a little bit right of this you don't at all it just doesn't work for you yeah but are you instantly just comfortable with that because you've drover the X you think I think so if I had had a a Tesla before it would be very like oh yeah a little bit different yeah that is quite natural I think journey we decided to test this all with of course is our first journey to McDonald's since its opened we used to go a lot more to McDonald's then obviously well we go to and lockdown but we're planning now not to go very often maybe once a month as a treat but we'd like to do this I mean is it it's quite a fun trip out really she loves it she loves being in the car she likes to like jump out the seat as well while we and kind of fly around and whatnot and have some fun so it is all kind of I don't know it's just it's just a nice trip out and here we are let's see how absolutely disgusting the drive-through is please don't be as long as I'm expecting it's actually normally it would be down this road we saw about [Music] okay okay yeah yeah chicken nugget yeah the curve it's coming Oh actually went over it's okay can I have my chicken nugget thanks baby I love sharing with you oh I really didn't mean for this to be a test but I just said open the glove box and she's about two minutes in and she's going through all the menus there we go I was ooming in slowly to it but what you could have done as well just so you know is if you press if you press if you press the write that in press it in open glove box there you go cops max you kind of feel defeated and annoy don't you buy that can you turn on the racy heaters for me these ones yeah the backseat here's is she goes through the menus you think this is what its gonna make you do while you're driving that's your C heater subji do I try some voice commands just say them say what you would want to say right raise seat heater on front seat heaters and rear seat heaters set on you did it right we fill up on McDonald's and we are now ready to do a naught to 60 test with Holly driving you ready go on behind us stop completely stop brake put it in park fully stop and now fully accelerate ready go right we're gonna pull out here and Holly's gonna give it her all you ready Holly yes straighten up [Music] [Music] why she's actually flew back and smacked me but how was that that was all right I felt much more comfortable being down like a little way that's on a single track as we come to the end of the first drive come on for review out of ten what are you going to give the model three I think I'm gonna give it a nine nice okay solid there's only like a couple of things because I've driven the ax right okay I prefer the seats and the axe cuz it's comfy and it does feel a bit more luxury as you said yeah and I like this space of the axe and like of how big it is so do you feel cramped in here or no I don't feel cramped I just feel like the X is more of a family car yeah sure but everything else I actually really do like this car it's just gonna take me a while to get used to how kind of sporty and quick it is is there anything you prefer from this from the drive that you didn't like about the X or I like the brake the automatic braking okay yeah the reader and the one pedal yeah really really like that I like that I can see a lot more clear clearly out this car yeah that's probably as well because we have no tints on this car yet whereas the Model X was tinted like all around yeah yeah don't mean the darkness I mean like oh yeah okay there we have it everybody I hope that has answered anyone's questions on Holly's thoughts on first drives what we're doing with the space now on our driveway obviously waiting for the side the truck how I sold my car hundred referrals and we got the Thai fix and hopefully by tomorrow I should be able to drive again and also pilot videos will resume I'm actually gonna go and try and run over some cones tomorrow and see if he lawns tweet about water pilot you're running over cones oh did you know oh I thought you run over one of my beautiful cones they're literally just down there you can see them down there daelin squashing cones so yeah so videos like that will resume from tomorrow thank you so much for watching don't forget drive safe and Raven final last words now okay not from Raven Holly and drive safe
