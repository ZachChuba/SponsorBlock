[Music] right now welcome to audit the audit where we sort out the who and what and the right and wrong of police interactions this episode covers public buildings the First Amendment and trespassing and is brought to us by record America's channel be sure to check out the description below and give them the credit that they deserve let's dive right in and audit the audit on January 2nd 2020 youtuber record America was conducting a first amendment audit at the Seattle City Lights north service center in Seattle Washington where she was contacted by Officer white of the Phoenix protective Corp which is a contracted security agency for the building why yeah why why do you want to know I'm security so people are allowed to video or record this site unless you have insides of the ocean no well what whether there's some your prisons what security security reasons for our site where do I get permission then I wouldn't be able to tell you well if I need permission you should know where their permission then no you need to you need to call somebody okay look on the website you need to get in contact with somebody from media something but I mean your media then what are you where are you from I'm person a member of the public members of the public are not allowed to video record or take images of our property without expressed permission what's her name my name is officer white so officer white what is saying that here because that is nothing saying that I cannot record inside there's nothing baby you can't either again you have to have expressed permission here officer wide admits that there are no signs which prohibit recording inside the building but also asserts the notion that because there are no visible signs which authorized recording in the public areas it should be assumed that recording is prohibited officer White's logic is counter to the fundamental principles of the First Amendment and freedom of the press and is not supported by any legal precedent a major design element of the First Amendment is to craft a society where the public is free to exercise their right to free speech and freedom of the press and not require the permission of a government entity to reasonably exercise those rights in public and you guys need to call security if I cannot no we did not deny that property its private parties is private but its face see ATO City FC ATO yes this is private property for the seattle city light and who owns the seattle city seattle city light has a deep history stretching back to the dawn of mass electricity in the late 1800s but the Seattle City Council officially founded seattle City Light on April 1st 1910 since its inception the publicly owned utility provider has grown into a multi-million dollar organization which provides power to the greater Seattle area seattle City Light is owned by the municipality of Seattle and is open to the public policies which restrict recording in publicly accessible areas must be supported by a court order or local state or federal statutes I was unable to locate any statutes from either the Seattle Municipal Code or the revised code of Washington that would allow seattle City Light to restrict recording within their public areas however considering that this interaction took place at a counter where citizens conduct private business with the City Washington Code 9.7 3.0 to zero states that it is unlawful to record or intercept a private communication it is possible the seattle City Light could use that code to establish an according policy in that specific area of the north service center building but according to the seattle City Light website there is no specific policy regarding recording within the publicly accessible areas of their facilities no it's a private property saying that I cannot stay here no well you cannot video recording on this property this is private property initially I'll all saying that if you show me a lot I believe you know you need to leave I am asking you nicely to leave it you don't leave were trespassing on private property but why thank you according to the original video this unidentified man is a public official who works at the Seattle City Light Building in the cities on it by the public we the people no property ok I am asking you nicely ok i am i have made you aware nicely i am asking you to leave so if i don't need more not allah sir I need you to go to your job please you don't need to tell me what to do yeah he's right I am asking you nicely to leave our property so recording taking images of this property that is not allowed on our property and if I don't need what's going to happen I will call the police ok and I will have them come and remove you from our property ok good call the police ok I will do so ok thank you officer white precedes to call the Seattle Police Department as record America wanders the building and eventually encounters officer McElroy and officer pardon of the Seattle Police Department's North Precinct patrol we'll again to Nord VPN for sponsoring this video which if you're out here on the sidewalk that's your right but as long as you're not inside the business that's okay but it's a public business right right it's a public business but if you're not there to conduct any chocolate it was and then it should call the cops okay because I need to run to get your side of the story I'm gonna get their side of the story so just understands make sure I understand everything so you were here to conduct business yeah and then you began recording yeah then she interrupted me before I even started business and caught you guys yeah according to Seattle Municipal Code section 12 a dot zero eight dot zero four zero a person is guilty of trespassing if they knowingly enter or remain unlawfully in a building under subsection C an affirmative defense against this code is that the premises were open to members of the public at the time and the actor complied with all lawful conditions imposed upon the premises considering that nothing that record America did inside the Seattle City Light Building was illegal and that the building was open to the public at the time there is no legal basis for issuing a trespass against her officer McElroy repeatedly states that official business is required to enter the public building but I was unable to locate any statute policy or code which can confirm that so nothing else happened that's all that happened well I came I wanted to do my stuff and she saw me she started getting upset about it so she called you guys and you guys are here okay so she started you started recording before she called me oh yeah yeah I've also recording already okay you don't mind hanging out with her I'm going inside speak with him real quick am i under arrest it might be entertained no no okay so it does be walking around them okay do you mind if I have your name yeah I might I don't wanna give my name okay all right well as long as you're not on their property then that's fine okay okay all right the City of Seattle property yes City of Seattle prophecy I cannot be on the set of set up if you're not yeah even though I had business you had business but you no longer had this yeah so okay marker I'm asking yeah no I I did how I did what I needed to do okay I just asked far I just think it's weird that she will ask me to leave when I'm doing stuff you know in a public building for public business that should be serving the public and not kicking them out but nothing okay but you did do the business yeah I did what I needed to do yeah all right Thank You officer McElroy goes into the building to speak with officer white and after waiting around for several minutes officer Parton offers her card to record America and allows her to leave the scene without further incident record America was not trespassed from the property during the interaction and none of her personal information was collected by the officers record America returned to the north service center the following day accompanied by two other artists and encountered officer white for a second time with different results my review of that interaction will debut on my patreon channel very soon you can find a link to my patreon channel in the description below overall officer white gets an F for displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of the rights protected under the First Amendment and the concept of a publicly owned entity as well as attempting to enforce legally baseless likely non-existent policies officer White's misunderstanding of basic legal concepts highlights the importance of rigorous legal training within the police academy curriculum the extent of officer White's legal background and police training remain unknown but anyone charged with the authority to protect others maintain the peace and enforce laws should be well-versed in the public liberties associated with that authority ultimately officer white initiated a fruitless interaction with no discernible legal basis for doing so record America gets an A for remaining calm peacefully exercising her rights and not allowing officer white to intimidate her into submission record America was very informed articulate and collected throughout the entire interaction and wielded her rights effectively and responsibly record America's many documentary style of auditing is refreshing within the auditing community and I highly recommend checking out her channel also be sure to check out cameras everywhere who joins record America in part to record America did a fantastic job during this encounter and I commend her for her composed demeanor and unique style officer McElroy an officer pardoned given a minus because although they both seemed somewhat unclear on the right to film in public both of the officers were polite attentive and professional the officers did not compel record America to surrender her identification attempt to detain her or issue her a trespass from the property I commend both officer McElroy and officer pardoned for their courtesy and professionalism the unidentified public official who corrected officer white gets an a-plus for being an outstanding citizen let us know if there's an interaction or legal topic you would like us to cover in the comments below be sure to
