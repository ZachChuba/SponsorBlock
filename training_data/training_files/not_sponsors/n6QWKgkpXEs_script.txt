what's up Greg welcome back to my channel I hope you're having a great day this is another episode of bad ads or bad ads it's bad ads I've talked about bad Instagram ads specifically for mobile games a couple times before in videos and I never really expected it to become a series but they just keep getting weirder and weirder and people keep sending you them and obviously I saved them cuz they're so weird and now I've got enough to make another video so here it is I swear whatever company or like marketing agency makes these ads on Instagram like watches my videos and they're making them progressively more and more weird so that I make videos about them and guess what it's working cuz I Here I am making a video about them they just keep getting weirder and weirder like they're evolving okay this has got to be one of the weirdest ones I've seen it's a little game it looks like you just go around and eat people's paint and make your pile of paint bigger pretty normal looking game and the caption for it is only 1844 kids will get this there's two possible ways that this could be interpreted and I'm not really sure which one they meant but both of them makes zero sense the first interpretation is only 1844 kids will get this as in like only this very specific number of kids will understand what this game is all about and if that's what it means then why would that be true why would only 1844 kids understand this game it looks pretty simple to me and how could they possibly claim to be able to guess how many kids would get it it's so specific and then the other interpretation obviously is only 1844 kids will get this as in like only kids from the 1840s will understand this game which definitely isn't true it's like one of those 90s kids memes like only 90s kids will get this game but instead it's targeted towards kids from the 1840s who don't have any concept of what mobile games are they don't even know what phones are I feel like of the two interpretations this is the one they probably meant but I can't even begin to understand why in god's name they would do this kids in 1844 would be utterly confused by this game you went back to 1844 and showed this to a child they would think that you were a witch and they would run away maybe the people who developed this game are witches and iOS developers only kids from 1844 will understand that we are witches and we develop mobile games I don't know that just seems like a bit of a stretch I just don't think kids from 1844 would want anything to do with this game not to mention the fact that they're all dead so even if only kids from 1844 did get this game congratulations you've designed a game for dead people and dead people can't play mobile games what a horrible business strategy that would be to design a game that's target demographic or I guess only demographic is people who have been dead for well over 60 years do you see what I mean when I say these have gotten weirder I guess the formula of if you do this then you're legally this has gotten too predictable and now they've got to switch it up even more make you question your whole existence even more by trying to tell you that kids from the 1840s will enjoy this mobile game more than you maybe it's like reverse psychology it's like oh you don't want to download this game you won't get it only kids from the 1840s will get this game and you were born in the 1990s you've got no chance of getting this game oh I think I just understood what it is I just turned on the sound of this ad I didn't realize it had sound and it's playing something in Morse code what the [ __ ] okay if anybody understands Morse code please tell me what this means if there's any kids out there from the 1840s please help you decipher what this means so I can make sense of this ad I can't believe they put Morse code in the ad how would that make anybody want to download this game real men don't get wet okay this is another one of the weirdest ones I've seen so up here you've just got a screenshot of the game it looks like a brain teasers game it's it's trying to test your mental skills it's just a bunch of wine glasses and it says whose glass will fill first the weird part about this one is the caption of the actual Instagram picture which is the only app on Selena Gomez's phone what this is the only app on Selena Gomez's phone she doesn't have like the texting app or the phone app the only app on Selena Gomez's phone is this brainteasers app I've always wondered how Selena Gomez stayed so sharp I mean she's smart it is weird though you'd think if she was so obsessed with this game to the point where she deleted every other app off her phone she would talk about this game and like all of her interviews or something but maybe she wants to keep it a secret the most relaxing game ever what I'm confused is this a game for a phone why is she using a paintbrush for an iPhone game would that even work on a phone I doubt it looking at the page for this game on the App Store doesn't answer any of my questions it looks like a completely different game it's just like a coloring book game but it doesn't have any of like the sequins or rainbow effects that are in this ad and it doesn't mention anything about a paintbrush this must be like a legal right to advertise a game like this she's not even playing it on a phone she's playing it with a paintbrush on a piece of paper in this game it looks like you've got this romantic interest this love interest and she goes from just being your classmate at level one to being your girlfriend in level five to being your wife in level twenty I can't believe she goes from just your classmate to being your pregnant girlfriend to being your wife over the course of however many years she matures and nevertheless she's still at elementary school judging by the fact that she's wearing the same schoolgirl outfit in every picture I guess some things never change like our undying love for each other and the fact that you never graduated fifth grade best a CG game I don't know what an a CG game is cute girls exquisite graphic just one exquisite graphic I wonder which one it is I guess most of the graphics in the game are pretty good but this one is just what exquisite vivid interactive experience time to play all right you're done reading the ad now it's time to download the game I saw the exact same ad again somewhere else but this time the girls blonde and the caption for this one just says over 200 cute girls come on in dude there's no there's over 200 cute girls in here waiting for you I don't know why but the number 200 doesn't sound that impressive to me especially if they're all just the same girl with different colored hair like these two because then I don't even have to download the game to know what they're gonna look like they're all just gonna look like this girl but what different colored hair this is an ad for a game called healing waltz it looks like a romance game where you've got a bunch of different guys hitting on you and you have options for what to do when they start flirting with you except the options are the same every time you're the apples of my eyes slap his face or kiss him you're guilty of your beauty slap his face or kiss him you're the special one and you want to slap his face or kiss him stay with me tonight and for this one you can either slap his face or kiss him you're the special one ooh oh so you're the special one I've been looking for the special one and it turns out it's you what a vague yet charming thing to say to somebody imagine being approached by this dude at like the club he walks up to you with his long orange hair floating in the wind he comes right up to you it grabs you by the arm and says you're the special one I mean what would you do would you slap him in the face or kiss him okay this one looks interesting it's for an app called matching Tintin let's check it out what what is this what's going on I can barely even look at the game because of what's happening next to it this isn't part of the game it's just this sobbing bear getting spanked by another bear who's leaving bright red handprints on this crying bear's ass and the spanking bear is just like staring at knee deep into my soul like he knows what's going on in my head he's like you have no [ __ ] clue what's going on do you you like this you like me spanking this little bears ass how about you download the game [ __ ] download the game er I'm gonna keep spanking this crying bear confused pathetic little [ __ ] why are you doing this sound of the game download it now video ad that's new this is for a game called coin master official did you just attack my village no it wasn't me I swear I swear it wasn't me oh I get it because he did attack her village my Able's me I did it you are gonna pay for this an attack JC spinach Wow that didn't make me want to play this game at all I mean for one it didn't really tell me what you do in this game or what it's about at all but also it kind of makes me feel like I'm gonna go to jail if I play this game like if I attack the wrong persons village I'm gonna end up in an interrogation room that doesn't make me want to play this game coin Master attack your enemies steal their coins and go to jail I think recently the game that I've been sent the most ads for is episode I've been seeing these ads everywhere I've been getting ads for them and people have been sending me ads for it like crazy if you don't know what it is it's basically like a storytelling app where you go through these little stories that are almost like graphic novels except you get choices for what you want to do at each point in the story so you can decide what to say at certain times and what to do at certain times I've actually considered making a video about this game because users can submit stories to this game and like make their own little stories that you play through and some of them are super [ __ ] weird so a small side note if you know of any weird episode stories please send them to me but for now let's just take a look at the ads because they're equally strange I got a P oh boy a classic scenario looks like this guy's got a P but his wife has just knocked the [ __ ] out on the toilet whatever happened here just really wore her out and she just had to call it right then and there this is a situation we've all faced at some point you have to go to the bathroom you only have one bathroom and your wife is just unconscious on the toilet so what do you do well let's check out the two options that this person is considering and let's see if it lines up with what us normal people would do pee in her mouth no I don't know if that is the first thing that I would consider come to think of it I think that's actually probably the last thing I would think of in this situation would be to pee in my unconscious wife's mouth I think I'll be the first thing I would think to do would be to try to wake her up you know so she would move and then I would get to use the toilet or maybe use a different bathroom I'm a guy so I can pee outside I could pee in my own mouth or maybe call 911 because she might be dead people don't just fall asleep on the toilet that often but people die on the toilet a lot okay well not not like a lot that makes it sound like going to the bathroom is really dangerous because you never you never know when you're just gonna die but it does happen people do die on the toilet but he still got one more option so maybe after he came up with that first one got that out of his system he'll come up with something more reasonable that'll make it so he can go to the bathroom you know as soon as possible divorce oh so no how would that even solve this problem you know the problem of him having to pee really bad and his wife being on the toilet I don't know how long this dude thinks divorces take but I don't think that's the most effective approach here I think he's going to be having to hold this pee for a very long time if this is the option he chooses overall I feel like both of these options don't really make sense I feel like you should be able to do both of them pee in her mouth and then get a divorce it's a win-win oh cool it's the exact same ad again but with different options this time I got a pee well the first option is different instead of peeing in his mouth he's gonna find a cup which I guess makes a little bit more sense but the second option is still divorce so if we've learned anything from these ads it said if your spouse falls asleep on the toilet you always want to at least consider divorce that's grounds for divorce I think infidelity and it's falling asleep on the toilet are the two big ones that most states recognize there's always probably gonna be other options like peeing in their mouths or peeing in a cup but those are just temporary solutions to a permanent problem the permanent problem being your spouse is asleep on the toilet you know peeing in their mouths not gonna get them off the toilet but you know what will a divorce choose how your story ends on the number 1 interactive storytelling app winner of Google play's 2018 best community building game why is he eating my face so it looks like this girl's making out with this guy and he just starts chomping on her chin what would you do would you either go with the flow or would you is this real-life what does that mean you can choose to is this real life mean say it out loud while he's sucking on your chin just what is this real life yeah oh can you stop yeah the last one I want to talk about is another ad for the game game of sultans which you might remember I talked about in my last video about Instagram mobile game ads the ads looked very [ __ ] up they were all just pictures but this one is a video so let's take a look I finally found you but what have you been doing I've been busy Sultan painting my one true love wow it's so realistic it's almost like they're saying the words that they recorded but they're not I wonder who that is oh it looks like the Sultan's in another one of his sticky situations looks like his queen is in love with a woman but don't worry the Sultan's got a pretty quick fix for this one boom problem solved you're not in love with a woman anymore you're straight now and you love me who wrote this you're in big trouble Sultan download game of Sultan's on the App Store now you're in big trouble Sultan trying to turn me straight not gonna happen putty you know that weird think about all those game of Sultan ads is that I've looked at what the game is cuz I thought about playing it for a video and it's just like a regular army building like fighting game just like you build up armies and fight other castles it's like it has nothing to do with the ads I think a lot of the games that are advertised on Instagram or like that and I have no idea how that's legal I feel like it shouldn't be clicking the link in the description alright guys thank you for watching this video if you're not subscribed to my channel
