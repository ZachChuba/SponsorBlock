[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] not sure a Lamborghini door should sound like that hey guys so if you're new to this channel feel free to subscribe and if you're not new then this car should be no stranger to you but let me introduce it anyway this is my 2003 Lamborghini murci√©lago and yes that is the correct way to say Murcielago Lamborghini Murcielago now this car had a sordid history it was very very rough when I got it you can check out all the videos in my playlist down below but today is gonna be the moment of truth can this car actually drive down the road without exploding or well exploding that's probably the worst one so some of you have asked why I didn't just buy a cheap used example of a Lamborghini to kind of make it in my own image I didn't have to make the movie car I didn't have to make a good example of the movie car I could have just made something that I liked for myself well I didn't exactly want to do that one because I couldn't afford a cheap used example even the cheapest of the cheap was twice as expensive as what I got this for and the second reason is because I loved the story of this car I loved the fact that it was a cheap used example and then the movie studio bought it and became world famous and it became really really used and abused and then I saved it from it's used and abused fate so I think story is very very important when it comes to projects and builds like this actually that's a pretty good segue because no one knows more about stories and today's sponsor audible so one of the things I've learned over the years of working on cars and getting myself and my garage very very dirty wow that's way dirtier than I thought is the 30-day free trial go check it out right now so let's begin this is gonna be awesome except for the fact that we already have a problem and some of you may have spotted it take a look at these tires now the tires look very meaty they are awesome they are great compound tires they are michelin ps4s --is however they leave very very little in terms of space in the wheel well if you take a look right here there is I can't get even my pinky finger I can't get in there and this introduces some rubbing because even the small amount of driving I've done I haven't actually taken it on the street I've just done a once around the parking lot just to make sure that there's nothing literally falling off the car this does rub just a bit and I don't want anything rubbing on the paintwork so these tires are very expensive but I can't really drive on them just because the fitment is not what I wanted now this is completely my fault because I wanted the widest wheels that I can get these are 235 40:19 in the front and 345 3020 in the rear and I think these are a little bit more than what I needed especially because Michelin's they do tend to run a little bit girthy they are a little bit bigger than the Nadeau's that were on here so since this is a SEMA build after all and SEMA crunch time is very very real I'm actually having this car picked up tomorrow I need to get a test drive in I need to make sure that this car is good to go on the road and doesn't have any major flaws so what I had to do was I had to overnight new tires and I have to thank Michelin for this because they knocked it out of the park I said guys I have an emergency will you help and they said yeah definitely so what they did is they sent over in the back we have 325 25 20 and in the front we have 2 25 35 19 and these are gonna be a lot thinner not only in profile but also in width it's only about a 10 millimeter difference and a 20 millimeter difference there but like I said they're a little bit girthy so there's gonna be a very slight stretch and I think the stretch is gonna help with this fitment right here and also when the suspension compresses it's gonna go into the wheel arch instead of into the fender what I have to do now is take those wheels and tires off dismount the wheels put those on balance them put them back on the car make sure everything is torque right and then we can go on our first test drive [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right the car is ready to go I can't believe I'm saying that now it did skip a few steps on camera I didn't show you absolutely everything I did but I just want you to take a look at the difference between the profile right here you can see now I can stick one maybe you want to have fingers in between that's higher in the fender and on the front it's basically the same thing right here you can see that it's a different story all together this tucks in neatly inside the fender and they look pretty good I like the meaty look but this looks spectacular I can't thank Michelin enough they did an awesome job but the reason why I didn't show you everything that went on camera is because I did some wiring work right here by the way this car is registered and insured and it's ready to go on the road I don't know why they gave me an envier plate I'm not a basketball player and when I get out of this car that'll be very very apparent right here is a little rear-view camera and that is connected to this so this is an auto box x1 that is a rear-view camera I can also change it for a front view camera it's always recording it has an SD card in there and when I turn it off there is a lane departure display so it'll beep if I go out of the lane or something like that I haven't tried this out yet but it's pretty cool also this is a a regular mirror when you just turn this off so I can see back there you can see the engine and whatnot time and date and GPS is okay this thing is really cool especially because it looks almost om and it really wasn't that hard to install just three wires but now that I have the tires on I have the rear view camera in and the car is basically buttoned up and ready to go I have no other excuses I need to go on a ride I've worked on this for a year and it's a famous movie car it's also the most expensive car I've ever owned or driven no pressure [Music] break pedal pressure is good clutch pedal pressure is good AC is very good one fact this car doesn't have a traction control system anymore because of rear-wheel drive if I give it any sort of throttle it just cuts the engine completely because apparently the ECU thinks that the front wheels aren't spinning and I'm just doing a massive massive burnout yeah that's that's currently a thing so I talked to mark gutter snake about it and he was again I just drive with the trash control off so okay yeah it's a 600 horsepower naturally aspirated v12 driving the traction control off that would be fun power steering works the batwings came up the clutch engage is pretty good Wow that is so loud goes in the second just mine sounds so good third is okay it tracks pretty straight no nasty clunks no scraping this almost almost feels like a car tell you what driving at low speeds it's not actually that bad I've heard horror stories about these cars not wanting to do anything low-speed like lurching and stuff like that this is this is totally fine totally manageable just feels like feels like a regular car except for the fact that it's super wide and orange and gets 2 miles to the gallon don't blow up don't blow up don't blow up don't blow up that'll get me about 3 miles so since this is a car I actually want to drive like drive drive not just down the street I want to make sure that it it can handle stuff like traffic and going around town oh boy now a good way to see if the clutch is actually holding you put it into sixth gear not around the 2,000 rpm and you've mat it the clutch holds fine the clutch is totally fine that bit sorry defeats weld that Lambo has had since 1963 in one form or another this is one of the last iterations the 6.2 liter and it makes almost 600 horsepower now so no horsepower might not feel like a lot right now if you're on the internet and your venture racing but back in the day I mean just think about it the McLaren f1 had around 600 horsepower and that was a fastest car in the world for almost 20 years let me see what I can open this up just a little bit oh my gosh that is incredible [Music] I'm sorry if I'm getting a little long from getting a little emotional I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you a story so in the early 90s my parents came to the u.s. from the Soviet Union I was born in Russia and they came to this country with like 200 dollars in their pocket and no money and for us to get to the point where I can afford one of these cars and drive it and build it and share it with all of you it really means a lot it really does I never thought this would be possible I want to thank all of you for for supporting me and just making making this a dream come true this is absolutely a dream come true and I don't know how I wants to say it I'm sorry getting along it's also starting to rain so that's gonna that's gonna give me a little more work to do to wipe this car down guys thank you so much for everything that you've done for me for this channel he just this couldn't have gone better this could not have gone better speaking of it not not being able to get better so a Lamborghini with no trash control in the rain probably not the best thing to to give it the beads and now I'm learning that my which a wiper ain't exactly the best that's one thing I didn't change this car is absolutely insane this is insanity so if I lower the window you can hear the answer reverberating off the trees sorry I'm laughing like a complete one thing you don't get in terrible cars is that instant Porsche when you hit the throttle it is intoxicating so since we turned around we're probably going right back into that rainstorm what I don't care Anna Carol yeah it literally sings this car that right pedal is your best friend it is impossible to not have a smile on your face what are you driving this thing Oh [Music] guys this is this is a dream this car is an absolute dream and I owe it all to you guys I owe it all to the success of the channel and just the amount of hard work that's gone into this car so I don't want to gush any further hopefully you guys like the episode if you like this car you can see it at SEMA booth five zero five one nine that is the rag company booth come and say hi I'm gonna be there too so right now I'm just gonna wait on the shipper that's gonna come and get this car the problem now is I got this car real dirty going through the rain and it doesn't leak anything there's no weird rattles nothing's falling off it seems like seems like it's an actual car so I'm super super pumped about that we're definitely gonna need to do a last-minute detail but this car is just just amazing I mean if you ever get the chance to drive one of these do it so I'd like to give a big shout-out to our sponsor audible thank you so much you can check them out in the link in the video description but until next time it's me reminding you guys that on cars like this this finished SEMA million dollar show car million dollar show car guys by the way check these out in a link in the video description below you guys need to wrench every day [Music] you [Music]
