welcome to how to Tyler the Creator a comprehensive guide to artistic realization with your host hands aka little touch aka the creators aka but once you put the beat in okay so please put your hands together for okay stop so we all know Tyler some would say he's a creator others would say he's a provocators I would say they're haters but to me Tyler is an individual who definitely continuously seeks to unapologetically and truthfully and definitely develop endlessly the end of mediocrity through his art and you see that's something that I utterly appreciated about the art and the act of artistic realization it is within our best self-interest to understand the intricate typography within the aspects of the inner world as it reflects our utmost temporal selves through the structure of contemporary impromptu space as it develops layman terms I know but timeless nonetheless [Applause] alright everyone let's get to the meat and potatoes of the Tyler episode show begin by writing down your motif on a piece of paper good question what's motif a motif is simply a recurring musical or literary idea that helps us establish a story's mood theme now the mark of a great artist is one that can say something new using the same old some things such as in Tyler's 2017 hit album the flower man where the motif is the flowers and man so pick a motif that touches you and start questioning why it did that and then tell it to ask for consent next time preferably on 4/4 time and 80 bpm hit it little touch [Music] we drop some bars we need to talk about chords and to help we've got Tyler the creator himself as our guest tonight give it up for Tyler everybody dude tell her I've always wanted to ask where would you look whenever you listen to beautiful chord progressions and would you cry I would just look at the sky and I won't cry because the chords would just do something to me mmm yes interesting well today we're gonna write some chords in honor of those who cry so come on come on down to the old to the old piano everybody so I've heard rumors that a lot of people don't like chords and what I have to say to those people is you don't like yourself you see much like yourself chords are the backdrop to life so let's show a little appreciation for you and your chords first pick a key let's go with C sharp that note is your new home now let's say you went on a stroll up to G sharp Street and now you're trying to get back home in the shortest amount of steps possible or whatever there are no rules so you just go down the scale in home you are I'll start adding more notes and then you have more notes and you sneak in a little bit of sevens and I have a progression now what's progressed to baseline that has notes within the chords and just [Music] lastly we're gonna need a synthesizer because it's not Tyler the Creator unless you have a synthesizer in the mix so we're gonna go ahead and ask a member from the audience to give us a hand with this and make it a little bit more interactive for us whenever you get the chance [Music] so now that all of the instrumentation is in place and we have something resembling a four bar loop it's time to bring the beat back in and get into the state of mind we're dropping some proper bars so now you hurt me how could you do this to me expect you thought we were friends I'm in pain just cut some boards boards we've got some pants man we've got some bodies body you've got demands you see used to bearing leeches and never lands or is accustomed to deflecting times again [Music] this video sponsored by Skillshare if your creativity [Music]
