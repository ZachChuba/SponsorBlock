hey how's it going welcome back to another episode of the ultimate iron man we spent last video at tob with the goal to be getting the averna kilt and as you can see we got it and we also got 99 farming last video as well from all the seeds that we got from tob we've made quite a few upgrades over the last few videos um specifically it was mainly four chambers and now today we're finally gonna be getting back into chambers of zurich it's been almost a year now i think it's been like maybe nine months or something since my last time at chambers of zurich i guess we could quickly take a look at the collection log to see what we have in here so here's the raids one collection log we have dex arcane and twisted buckler my main goal last time at raids one was to get the decks and we got the arcane and the buckler like within the first 60 kc and then the dex was at 320. i went about 5.6 million points without any drops at all in my name which is like i think it's like six times the drop rate or something so needless to say i don't have the best track record at raids one but you know what i was actually building up my rng because that's exactly how it works so why are we doing chambers that's a very good question that i don't really have a direct answer to um i just want to have fun with friends honestly like i've been missing chambers since i left there pretty much especially because i got rigor like right when i left and like i did one raid after that going for the bats back and it was pretty nice with rigor so that'll be nice to actually have for raids this time until the blowpipe nerf which as of the time of recording this they don't have a date they just postponed it but speaking of the sponsoring this video if i could choose to get any items from raids besides tebow of course i think ancestral would be my top pick because it's storable on the poh so it'd be really nice to be able to finish this set and then we could take it out and put it back in whenever i want and then also there's a lot of herbs that you get from chambers here's what the loot table for raids one looks like so there's all these gems and ores but then here's all the herbs that you get i think i will save every single herb from raids one because when i say i want to camp here i mean i want to camp at raise one for a long time like at least a month like only do raids all day every day for like a month straight at least i mean if i don't enjoy it i'll leave but i have a feeling it's gonna be a lot of fun like it was last time all right with that said though i guess we can uh start getting ready for chambers dude this all just happened so fast like i just started t.o.b again a few days ago and we already got the avernick i'm going to revert the crystal halberd back into the crystal weapon scene and then drop that over to the main because i don't care about it we don't need the dragon's medallion anymore chambers is safe meaning when you die in there you don't lose a hardcore status you don't lose any items that you had in the death stores like espori or zora for example um so i'm gonna grab my dragon pick out of the stash unit for guardians and then when i die to hyspori i'll leave the nezi and the rune boots in there so that way i don't have to worry about like alchemies now and getting them back later i'm about to fill up the trident i'm gonna have to hop worlds to buy runes the verdict message is about to go away so sad now that i think about because i have the lance i'll be doing the melee hand for om so i won't have to mage as much as i was before like not even close to as much as i was before possibly most likely i don't know i've never done mailing hand before but i'll be learning so we shouldn't hopefully have to go through as many runes and hopefully not as many scales because my scale stack is going to be in history and if i want to grab my scale stack out i'd have to grab everything out and then die again to put it back in there maybe i could start fishing steak reels in my down time or something we'll see okay i've been standing here for a while just trying to figure out like what my inventory is going to look like i'm going to put the money into the coffer so i won't actually have that in my inventory here's what hispory currently looks like at the moment here's the thing i've been worried about for a while i really don't want to have to use brews and restores especially the brews because it's really annoying gang bird's nest like i have to kill mole which i normally wouldn't mind killing mold but because i have the pet i really don't want to have to kill more than i need to and the fact i just want to get into raids as soon as possible and not leave for a long long time and if i were to use bruiser stores with what i have right now i would have to leave prematurely so instead i'll be trying to raid using prayer pots and sharks i was looking back through my old videos to see what i used to bring into raids and apparently here's my old inventory setup apparently i went in with 5 brews which is 320 hit points with sharks and the amount of inventory space i have right now i think i have enough space for 10 sharks which would be 200 hit points uh versus 320 i used to have before i don't even know if i went through that many brews though to be fair um but what i'm thinking because i plan to melee i don't think the god cape's even worth it because i think the only place i'd even be using the trident would be at olm i don't think we're really gonna be doing vanguards i think i'll value the one food for the raid and the one extra brew at home more than i'd value that two percent magic damage bonus i'm gonna be raiding with all the people i was raiding with before uh my buddy zach he's uh he's really trying to get us back into the the spirits of chambers good one zach all right so after every raid i'm going to teleport over to the myth skill using the mounted myth cape and the poh and then uh make my potions cook my sharks and then yeah this will be the first raid back i'm very excited oh looks like we're gonna have 12 sharks in the inventory nice oh iconic moment here we'll configure the xeric talisman to be xeric's honor okay we left off with 321 kc i have no idea what the goal is going to be for this video whether it's getting a purple or getting to a certain kc milestone i don't know we'll just go to uh a cut-off point seems reasonable oh oh wait pets wait after you have to grab a pet god we're so cute because i have sharks and not bruised i don't have to worry about eating and then you know like bruise lower your stats but if i eat the food i'll still be range potted up that'll be nice good luck ah here we go literally always unlucky oh god that's actually awful oh before i forget to show this our rank for raids one is rank 67 dark relic preserve oh my god look at all the herbal works for you we're gonna get what did we get from this 13.8k nice you may have noticed i don't have the rune pouch on me i may end up taking it out later on but for now if i get something i want to alk which there isn't too many things that i would be alking um but like for example with the torn prayer scroll here i'm gonna come to lumbridge grab the explorers ring and then alkit and then with the gp i get i just go back to the poh and put it in the servants money bag i saw there's a guy here named trico so i'm taking my main over here and we're gonna put mudkip next to i think he's afk he's been staying there for a while but i just think that's funny i wish salt was here right now to roast you for your name i should have put that in like the friends intro thing like this is my friend zach that's not his real name though it's actually andrew aka audrey because andrew was taken because it's andrew gower's name okay oh actually yeah that's rough i drew this is the next best thing unless i did andrew with the three as the e my name's not drew why don't you sit the  down let me just get stacked [Music] oh my god how many points do you have uh 9k very well deserved audrey rose been wood cutting the last couple hours got a couple clues to show for it never mind one of the things i had to learn to do my melee hand is how to skip old special attacks if you already have raid experience it's really easy to learn i got down there for just a couple raids you do three hits on the thumb tank a hit from ohm and then run to the other side to turn olm's head however if the first hit on the thumb doesn't hit then you have to run to the ring finger to turn olm's head properly that's it pretty easy i try to deal with the acid here i don't think i'm doing a very good job with it an update that was added since i've last been to raids is that when multiple ironmen attack a scav now any of them can pick up the loot instead of before where none of them could get any of the loot if anyone else attacked the same one i hate this so much we made it to the om room and then because uh core got dc'ed and then because no one else was ranked high enough we just we lost the raid and i lost my concave which was on the ground too which is quite unfortunate but now i have a plan to get back i'll just come here to nightmare zone take out money and then buy the concave and stuff back we got an elite done from raids one i went to go check the high scores for elite clues and i just realized that we were actually on the front page now for elite clues at rank 25 for uim oh i just got a virtual attack level there oh gz 108 let's go something i did last time i was doing raids and i figured maybe i should do again is mine here at motherlode mine because it's very very rare that i actually have the dragon pick on me in fact i think doing raid is the only situation i'd ever have my dpick on me so i figure i may as well take advantage of that and just afk mind the painter here i just drop it because i just like sitting in the corner here i want to like go back and forth and worry about dropping even more or like you do get xp for like cleaning it but i mean that kind of defeats the purpose of afk what oh my gosh that's it all right are you ready oh dude i got the overload message like in the chat box right when uh i'm not gonna oh my god all right hey on another though i got ancient tablet after like 38. congrats to both of you earlier in the video i showed you what i'm gonna be doing with my afk downtime which is what we're doing right now just afk mining and this is for when i actually have to afk but there's times when i don't have to afk but i also just don't have teammates on and i think i just thought of something that i could do in between raids that's gonna be perfect for like well in between raids so you know if my friends are like oh we're gonna go take a break and eat lunch see you back in like half an hour or an hour or even just like 10 minutes i know something we can do in between and it's going to be pretty easy to set up for you're going to grab the graceful out of the poh and we'll go to like any of the random er patches because we're going to go to a tool leprechaun and out of the tool leprechaun we're going to grab the magic secateurs probably can maybe see where we're going with this i think i pointed out at the start of raids that i'm going to be saving every single herb that i get from raids there's 10 different kinds i'm going to be saving all them and irby drops nine different kinds of herbs all of which also happen to be dropped by raids which i'm going to be saving all of them if you're curious toadflex is the one i get from rage that you don't get from herbivore so this kind of works out like really perfectly i don't think there's really any other situation in the game where i'm gonna be saving every single type in my bag um so this is really the only time that i'll be able to hunt a reborn um during trailblazer league i actually hunted 1 000 of them that was my first time hunting them in a very long time because i as you can see i've never hunted them on this account in total across all my accounts like trailblazer my normie account my hardcore i think i've hunted like four to five thousand of them and i've never gotten the pet before and the pet is one out of 6.5 k and this is the account i would like to get pets on the most out of any other account i love the uim so much and this is the first herbivore of probably many more to come i'll just show you real quick um since we're here uh because i don't have the herb sac what i'm gonna do with the herbs as we get them i'm not gonna clean them because everything i'm saving from raids i'm not cleaning those either so i just want them to be able to stack up with what we have in the bag so i'm gonna hopefully remember to not clean any of them and just note them on the tool leprechaun and after we're done with each session whether it's like 10 minutes half hour an hour or whatever i'll just bag them up you can see i'm not going to be very serious with this like i don't have staminas i definitely don't have an ideal inventory i don't have an urb sack it's just gonna be something really casual to do in between raids because like it's so easy to set up for this i can just easily come over here hunt a few and then go straight back to raids yeah guam is the only herb that you always get from herbies no matter what your herbal level is um i'll just clean and drop those but all the other ones i'm going to save you know what instead of calling this a raids video i should just call it your herbivore harvest count is one this is where the real contents at when i have all nine of the herbs in my inventory this is what it looks like and this is not very fun to work with so i think to save two inventory spots i'll wear my concave and my prim boots and then just put these back in the poh each piece of the graceful set does give you a percent bonus and when you have the full set there's a 10 increase run bonus when you're standing still but i don't care i think i value the a couple extra inventory spaces more i won't have to run to the tool leprechaun as often this way i'm not going to keep the neemy light either of course but i just get so often it's not worth constantly dropping it and even without the boots and the cape we still do have negative weight bonus we just don't get as much run restoration when walking or standing still as you can see by the xp tracker up here it's been about an hour and we've hunted a little bit over 30 of them which is actually really bad if you're like on their regular accounts and you have like the herb sac and staminas and you know like a full inventory when you're not in the uim uh it's like 50 or 55 or even more herbies per hour so this is definitely not what you would expect to do but i guess over the long term i'd probably like get 30 per hour from doing this math like if i actually just want to do herbivores i'd of course set up my inventory with staminas and everything you know for me kind of just doing hunter half ass in between raids i don't think it's too bad and the fact that i have to make sure to stop by the two leprechaun every like three freaking herbies doesn't really help either oh boy are you ready for this 87 hunter dude this has been bothering me for a while the fact that i can't catch crystal implings bare hand or anything dms as well and definitely not lucky implants either yeah i need a 90 for crystal 93 for dragon and 99 for lucky every time i see one of those implings fly by i just fly out of view i just cry internally every time maybe a bit externally as well i'm about to go back to raids but before we go i just quickly want to show you this plug-in the banked xp plug-in i have it set to just show the xp in my inventory at the moment for herblore and it looks like from 178 herbivores that gave us about a little bit under 60k xp and if that's right that comes out to on average 333 xp per herbibore plus you also get herbal or xp when you harvest them too so that's not taken into account here oh another plugin i've been using is the raids data tracker you can see the personal points we've got so far is 541k since going back to chambers and i think i figured out a good end point for this video will be the drop rate for purple which would be 867k points so we'll end the video either once we get a drop from raids or once we get to the drop rate oh it's 350 kc that's the youtube clip oh please i love you so much babe good luck i got another don't tell me that's knocking i heard keep going  680 teddy what are you gonna split bro back-to-back oh wow yes dude nice scratch oh damn dude that's so sick for yourself oh we got something that's so freaking sick i didn't think that was for me wait i just realized we kind of finished the full ancestral set zoell got the hat zach got the top i got the bottom i was honestly expecting like arcane or dex or something if i were to get dropped okay so here's the points i've got since so far 760k since coming back to raid so that's a little bit lucky overall for reads i'm not lucky but since we've been back i have been lucky with those uh ancestral bottoms i'm not sure what to do with it yet i do have space right now because all my stuff's in history so for now i'll keep it in the looping bag but after i'm done with raids in like a month or two we'll see what i'll do then go back to quarterback right no oh i got pb though different pbs for each team size i hate it here my best mage armor before was infinity so i'll just show a side-by-side comparison of the infinity bottoms compared to the ancestral road bottom so you can see the difference ancestral has more magic attack bonus has a lot more defense all across the board and most importantly it has a magic damage bonus two percent magic damage now as most of you probably already know once you put something to the poh that's part of a set you cannot take it out until you have the full set uh that's why i put it in the looting bag instead of putting it in the poh i did a couple more raids you can see we're up to 800k points now here's all the items we've got well the one item we got and the other items that we've seen look at that dude it's all magic stuff arcane full ancestral who knows maybe it's gonna be kodai next and you know how before raiding i left all my stuff in hispory here's all the stuff that we've accumulated so far since coming back to raids there's a bunch of like skilling supplies really i could show this bag like at the end of every raids video just like see where we're at with all the resolute but dude getting that ancestral robe bottom really makes me want to actually get full ancestral like that'd be so nice to have stored in the poh because you could just take out whatever pieces you want once you have it stored especially because i have the arcane spirit shield so like it fits together you know we could use it for like zora or bandos or more raids there's so many places to use that but we are going to be calling it here for today thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed and i hope you have a great day and i will see you again next time
