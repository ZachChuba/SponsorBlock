I'm all trades and this is my friend Joel hi I'm Joel Joel telling is the 3d printing nerd before we get started I easy-to-use platform to host my website on for the last five years Joel you're just going to help me fix a problem that I have I've been collecting Playmobil toys since I was 5 years old I have my childhood Playmobil set and it has a broken piece and my friend Joel offered to printed joint trained boy must be happy to get his trained car back I know he's not been able to ride for so many years I don't know if you can get but like just this little click is all that needs to happen and because that has that little spring in it that's what gives it that that flex that it needs and now it's fully on there so Joel's offered to give us a quick introduction about these printers what they can do and bonus we are going to print some stuff together and hopefully you can learn along with me about all the amazing things that these things can do but one can help fingers crossed let's get started so if someone wants to learn more about 3d printing do you have some information about this on your channel I do you can find me on youtube if you look up 3d printing nerd that's where you'll find me outs of a website the 3d printing nerd comm and if you go on the Twitter's or the instagrams I am at Joel telling perfect okay so we actually originally were talking about doing something else together for this video but as usual I got distracted she got really distracted in our extreme distract extremely distracted state I actually came up with the real reason that I really want to learn how to do 3d printing because my truck the 53 Chevy you may have seen in the background of some of my videos intent it's missing some of its decals and I was looking online and it turns out you can 3d print these decals and absolutely have another mutual friend who can make them look extremely metallic that's right so can you tell me like how this works 3d printer is essentially a robot with a glue gun on the end of an arm so is it like a CNC router it's exactly like a CNC router except it's more more height to it okay 3d printing is a layering technology and the thing is built upon layers yep one of the reasons why people like 3d printing is because if you're doing it layer by layer you can build things that other manufacturing methods can't build tell me for someone like me who doesn't know anything about technology and who is very good at getting cat prints all over your toys what kind of doors is this machine open for me but 3d printing is going to allow someone such as yourself to do is to quickly prototype a design before committing it to a more expensive or time-consuming medium sure so as an example what you could you could use 3d printing to make a bracket not just something to something else maybe you'll eventually make it out of a wood or or a metal for strength or rigidity but being able to take a model created in a few hours in this and then decide if you want to invest the time in a more expensive or more time-consuming material you get to do that that's one of the that is one of the main reasons that people such as yourself who are gonna have 3d printing Tara you know typically when you look at a wood shop a 3d printer isn't a tool that you would see here a long time ago a CNC router was also not a tool you would see in a typical workshop totally and now they're all over the place what's really great about these new digital fabrication methods is they are tools just like anything else and if you can find a way to use it in your workflow to improve your workflow it's a really good idea and you'll be well supported by a wonderful community suite I see that there is no computer present that's right how does it know what to do there's a couple different ways you can do this yeah sometimes if a computer is present you can plug a USB cord into it okay print via what we call tethered meaning it's we know this from camera work which I've also just learned this year thanks YouTube there's also wireless ways of doing it a control board can be added to this that allows it to connect to your Wi-Fi network oh then through a web browser you would be able to send it files to print and start the print okay but typically what we do is we print with an SD card Oh where'd that even come from a little slot on the side amazing if I have this correctly we're going to print an alpaca shaped cookie cutter absolutely that's the plan so is the file already in the SD card yes it is okay so first what you want to do is you want to power it on that little power button on the side flip that up and you should see the screen light up this is the firmware starting up on the little Arduino that's in this little box here boop boop this is a dial that turns one way or the other clockwise or anti-clockwise for what well there's this hope you're there buttons if you turn it clockwise it goes through oh I'm turning it anti-clockwise yeah there's a bunch of things so this info screen this very thing it tells you the temperature of the hot end and it tells you the temperature of the bed certain materials require certain temperatures okay they require the bed to be of certain temperatures as well to hold it in place so what I want you to do right now click in on that button Boop twist it down until you get to print from SD meaning print from the SD card and click it Boop and then go to where it says PLA because that's the material we have loaded and hit that gonna be the alpaca cookie cutter oh yeah couple different I'll pack of things on here oh so there we go so you can see right here everything is in centigrade and 3d printers use metric so millimeters and centigrade is the way to go so if I'm using weed whacker filament what what settings do I want to use typically weed whackers use nylon yeah nylon usually melts between 250 and 275 you made something using a weed whacker yet no it is possible though because you just need filament that's the same oh sure yeah yeah obviously our next project will be incorporating weed whack I think it's a good idea we're finding out that my shop is very very poorly heated I obviously didn't get in here early enough to start the fire so this is the bed's gonna get to 60 see the nozzle right here that's gonna melt the plastic is gonna get to 215 C so we're dealing with very hot temperatures don't touch that when it's that hot you will burn yourself like I have many times is it like there's like a little string coming down is it leaking no the little string is is just an oozy so as this is heating up the filament that's existed in this little nozzle right here yep it's gotta go somewhere if it's melted and here a pole it's going to slowly lose out we can hear you go ahead and pull it up I go oh wow look at that yep is the I mean this whole machine it seems like I mean not the whole thing but like a lot of the parts are made out of plastic how does the plastic not melt if that if there's so much heat also are these things flammable like has there been house fires caused by these yes poor quality printers have been the cause of houses catching on fire huh probably significantly less of an issue than my not Joe burning though equitable hmm what it's doing now is it home because there's x and y and z is the axis that goes up and down so it home x and y it home to z and now it's doing a procedure where it checks the level of the bed oh sure so at once add the x and y plane to be on the same level as the bed right so does it have like self leveling feet or something or it has a little induction probe and it knows how far away it is from the metal of whoa so it's basically like saving all that information it saves it off and it creates what's called a mesh grid huh now it's gonna come down and it's gonna start spitting out filament to prime the nozzle okay then it moves over and now it's printing have you ever looked into potential ill effects of breathing these plasticky fumes that is crazy enough a controversial sub because some people like to spread fear and scattering it's only this is terrible it's a now pack guys sorry to interrupt I'm so excited oh they say it's a terrible because you're melting plastic and it's gonna off gas right like ABS plastics the same they make Lego from if you're if you're turning that up to a certain temperature and melting it it's gonna off gas sure was it micro particles that you could breathe in but at the same time you know cooking bacon means you're going to breathe in certain things more so than what a printer is gonna do for you in general if you print with typical hobby use plastics like PLA which is what we're printing with here right the chance of breathing in contaminants is very low plus we're in a large shop I would say it's well-ventilated because there's a lot of air moving around yeah I'm not so I would be more worried about what your fireplace produces than what this printer would produce this is incredible so basically they're just gonna do this now this exact thing for about two hours you know they take three hours to print a cookie cutter well this says 34 minutes left so we're printing each layer it's gonna lay down is point two millimeters that's crazy and it's quiet too isn't it I mean it's silent my whining dog and my cat okay hello one of the biggest noise complaints that people get is to span on the side oh the fan the fan itself is gonna be the loudest part of the machine so this is a fan by a company called Noctua that does baffles on the fans in a very specific way and it eliminates the noise well a lot of people who build home use computers fans because the computers need to provide a lot of airflow and be somewhat quiet scalable could I put that like asthma I got one Heidi I've got one of my computer about that big how much air does it move what's the CFM I don't know the answer to that oh so it's a little louder now you know this how this works it this is an extruder it's a motor with a year that pulls the filament down and it pulls it into a heat break mm-hmm and so it's tough there's a small little throat there's a heater block and a nozzle and then between that and some fins is what's called a heat break that allows the heat to stay down here and it to stay nice and cool up above so this fan is blowing air across fins to keep it cool and the reason we need a heat break is because we don't want filament to melt up the path we want it to melt I'm sure that's it mm-hmm and then once it's out the nozzle this fan blows air through this and it cools down the area as the nozzles laying it down so you want to melt the plastic and then you want to cool it down right away so does how much filament is this gonna use for our cookie cutter our cookie cutter this school was originally 2.2 pounds okay it's one kilogram yep and out of that we can get a few hundred full-size chess pieces and know you can make chess pieces oh yeah that's one of my next projects that's what my next projects is a 3d printed chess set how about my chess board that I have inside I didn't know you had one I should just leave this here for you to play with oh no no no my cats would come in there would be filament all over the floor this usually cost peeling plastics will cost anywhere between $10 for a kilogram up to 30 40 50 depending about the additives that are in it sure because when we talk about something like weight how much I already forgot ten dollars ten to 40 or 50 okay for a kilogram so when we talk about something like this this is metal yep and it would go on the outside of a truck yeah a nice truck so if you're gonna print this out of plastic you'd have to use plastics that have enough additives to combat the UV of the Sun oh sure to exist outside where the temperatures vary a lot colder and a lot hotter hmm they make plastics that are heat treatable and you can uh kneel them in an oven so you bake it for 20 minutes it realigns the crystalline structure the same way that you'd an eel like a blade the same way actually Joel I just have to let you know that you made my mom's weak because why is that she I was telling her yesterday what we were gonna be doing today and she was nearly brought to tears out of happiness because she said that she's been looking for an alpaca Christmas cookie cutter for me for a very long time and we kind of like my family which you may know by now shortly this was silhouette of an alpaca and I brought it into modeling software and I just extruded certain heights and that was it that's what it takes to make a cookie cutter oh you really are a nerd it's amazing so for example if I were to provide you with some photos of my donkeys could they become cookie cutters as well absolutely oh my the possibilities are endless well this is really exciting this is kind of cool and it looks like the timing is right so it'll be about 29 minutes before this is done do you want to go pet some alpacas well we wait several bad puns later oh there we go oh just like that and now it's done oh my god that's it pretty cool right I mean you're probably a slightly desensitized to this just a little coolness of making something out of nothing it is cool but you get to see so there's the Prime a little spit out right and so what it does this it starts extruding here and it just goes to here to make sure that there's plastic flowing through the nozzle at a regular rate and then it moves over so this is still hot but if you want we can take it off the build plate this is removable it's hot but we can still remove it so you can lift up from either corner and take it off the whole plate won't play oh oh oh oh it's magnetic it is so it's really cool about a magnetic removable build plate you have something that's large and ultra flat and it's stuck down you have to get some sort of you know pancake flipper straight under that to release it so with this when you have a big part you just flex it because it's flex seal oh wow I just saw it like dis I mean I just saw it detach yeah keep going though there we go oh my gosh there it is that is a very quickly made alpaca cookie cutter now you pronounce all paka differently then I say differently every time okay all right cool boy I sailed PACA I'll say I'll pack that right now do you say alpaca you say to me you know and I say all Paco there you go this is so cool so I think we should probably go make some cookies I'd love to have some alpaca cookies however maybe we could do that on my channel I'll pack up my bags go over to Joel's Channel and see us make these cookies I'll see you over there as I mentioned at the beginning of this I am also selling fluffy calendars on my website I will also link that below
