[Music] hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today and before we get into this video I just want to say that ironside PC the company that has sponsored the channel will be giving away a brand new PC on the 15th of August so if you want to head over to that video the link is in the description below or you can simply click the annotation to the top right but the PC they're giving away is an iron side nemesis desktop its processors intel core i7 8700 graphics is a gtx 1060 the same thing that I have the memory 16 gigabytes g.skill trident c series and SSD is 120 GB and the HDD is 2 TB so I hope you guys win that giveaway because I gotta say the PC is absolutely insane and speaking of giveaways before we get into the stakes and all the exciting things later on I just wanted to say if you want to comment below your runescape username followed by your favorite movie of all time I will be choosing a random comment and my next upload live so you guys will see who wins and the winner of that will receive a full third age which is about 160 mils so good luck on that and throughout this video you guys are gonna be seeing multiple chopped parties multiple giveaways and a lot of staking and obviously the giveaways and the drop parties were pretty much funded by the staking last video I had about a 1.2 bill bank and let's just say throughout the making this video that bank went up about 10 times in price so we had a lot of luck and this was one of those moments that I just couldn't believe wanted to put this clip in the beginning of the video and give a special shout out to a guy named bean farmer Dave I did my first ever twisted bow giveaway on Twitch once my bank hit a really significant amount and the guy who won that twisted bow giveaway which is like a 1 in 700 opportunity to win actually declined it and I was stunned that he declined it and instead of taking the twisted bow he said mister no-sleep goes stake it and if you win give away too and unfortunately we lost but a big shout outs of being a farmer Dave I've never seen anyone decline a twisted bow giveaway before but yeah that was actually incredible and to follow that unfortunate twisted bow loss I decided to put 40 different Third Age items on this account and giveaway them individually through a 1 through 28 goodie bag system kind of like what spark mag does if you've ever seen that essentially you just kind of cover the screen up on stream and no one can see the inventory so they choose a random number one through 28 and whatever number it is they get that third each item I did put a few chickens in there but luckily nobody did win a chicken unluckily for me though everyone was winning the top items so yeah as you can see we gave away third age plate bodies rope tops nobody did win the Wando so that was nice and this was all during one stream which was about a week and a half ago two weeks ago something like that I have a really bad problem with remembering dates time things like that because probably just sleep deprivation honestly this was during a 40 hour livestream and just two weeks later which was yesterday I finished a 60 hour livestream so during that 60 hour stream we actually did the same exact thing we gave away a twisted bow and we did the 1 through 28 goody bag giveaway and if I recall we actually staked an elijan last night we won that and we gave away that as well so yeah I mean it gets to a point where you have every item in the game and then you just say to yourself okay well I'm not trying to make a hundred bill I'm not trying to get to like you know multiple sites or anything so let's just give away a lot and until the RNG runs out or until the money runs out we will just keep on givin so yeah hopefully it lasts a long time and as you can see in these clips here people are just winning Third Age like I said I chose a lot of people so there's decent amount of clips of that but yeah as it goes for the new Rev update I know a lot of people were expecting me to make a Rev video of that update and I do have one plan but it's going to be a massive compliation of kills I'm talking right now there's already 10 thousand kills into this video and there's already one unique obtained still three more to get or two main ones the other ones just an amulet and some of you who follow my live streams do know that I've been putting in a lot of hours in revs and I don't see myself slowing down anytime soon especially since they put new best in slot weapons to the game really really a lot more motivation for me which is great because I was that weirdo kind of post max camping Rebs for seven months straight and no one really knew why well now there's actually new updates and the wilderness is just so active over there that it's just great I mean it sometimes it can be toxic admittedly speaking of toxic you know speaking of the wilderness this is a clip of a bunch of clan members from my pee-can clan shoutout to brutal awakening they decided to chuck about 500 mil total for no reason at all just the fact they wanted to give away a lot of GP into another giveaway which was you know god knows what we what we were during this stream but yeah we were just giving away multiple items and it was amazing so yeah as it goes for this steak like I said I did a 320 ml and I told the guy right beforehand if I win I'm dropping it all and I won so we dropped it all and it was just days like that that we're all off stream and just insane days for the clan shot so getting into the staking section of the video now as you can see with this guy Rawls we started with about 550 mil on him and DDS Singh is all about streaks you know with whipping I always go on losing streaks and it seems with DD essing I always go on win streaks so we started with a small amount of about half a bill and we ended up just getting on a pretty good luck streak and we walked with about 1.15 bill so like I said you don't need to win bills upon bills to be happy in the duel arena you just got to know when to walk so you don't stay there too long my method was always just kind of going there every couple hours rather than staying there for a couple hours and yeah it worked out pretty well so this girl was advertising 25 mil DD s's and she beat me for an arcane randomly just chucked it against there so after she beat me for the arcane I staked for it back and then I ended up streaking her pretty hard did this random 200 mil in the midst of staking her we ended up winning that as well and I don't know this girl's whip was not on her side and this is a big part of why I only do DD s takes his moments like that where you're to each P you should have died by poison you should have died by the hit and it just doesn't hit you no and like I said it's all about the whip man so these winds are just really intense 15 HP again we tanked it and if that happened to me I would be very very upset but yeah we were doing two hundreds at this point the next steak we won again that hit us pretty much max cash as well as the archein so then we switched to platinum tokens took another 200 and this was all streaking so she just decided to do the cash stack at this point and I didn't you know I'm not gonna ever walk from someone who's you know going balls deep like that I can only respect that so we did actually win that another close steak and yeah we tanked two hits that we shouldn't have tanked and I died and luckily I had the timing so we ended up walking huge up on her so of course all those wins did lead me to chuck even larger is what this twisted boasts they came from and this is actually where the giveaway for it came from as well so he just got really lucky with this hit here all about that 200 XP drop when your DDS saying there's nothing like seeing that and actually just notice this guy's username is in this video twice because we end up sticking another twisted bow against him later so yeah shout out to him now as it goes for this guy ohms head we did have a session with him he did pretty well on us at first and then we ended up going on a win streak pretty hard on him later on we were just doing one 100 to 200 and yeah we ended up making about if I recall around 600 to 700 ml from this guy so again the streaks do come and clutch when they need to and it's always nice to see so this was the last one I think I did and then I teleported out I was plenty happy with that profit and as always got to have a big old drop party when you're finished and yeah if you ever want to feel free to join my clan chat uh feel free to in-game there's not draw parties in there all the time but there are some randomly if the day's going good so yeah now we get into the big boys stakes of the video this was against the guy named bud which he did want to do one bill DDS and I rarely see one bill DDS take so I decided to call it and it was a pretty close steak but the whip did come and clutch there and we did win the one bill so that was awesome now this guy again I wanted to do up to bill I didn't want to do it but he wanted to so I figured alright let's just go for it and this to date is the biggest steak that I've ever done I don't know I was just feeling it I wanted to make a lot of money and yeah he got paid on us again but the dds as you could see here the next two specs were pretty insane and I even put this on my snapchat story that's that's how you know you're loser even for the for pill steak gonna on a snapchat story but anyway we did win the to bill and there you go we walked with four and I was probably gonna stake him again but I saw him run north so I just decided not to no I'm just getting high no balls I just walked at that point and moving on to this guy this guy's pretty unique so he would always win the small stakes you know 100 mil 150 200 mil and then at once he would beat me two or three times in a row I would just get pretty angry and I would just go for the le on him and he would always call it so I think we ended up doing about four elijan stakes against this guy and we won every single one of them so that was pretty awesome the only downside was we always had to lose like or three in a row to win so the profit would always be like just about a hundred mil to mil on the Le stakes and yeah I think we ended up I don't know if we clean this guy but we got pretty close to it anyway we did pretty big stake on him towards the end he wanted the chucks so I just went with it and I did hit pretty consistent on this is probably one of my longest dds things I've ever had to date my whip was not hitting anything and his DBS and his whip wasn't hitting anything I don't know if I was this guy man I would be really upset like that that took way too long that clip was sped up by three times and it took that long so I don't know but this next steak was the big one against him we had a lot of wind streaks going towards the end of the session with him so he did want to chuck eight hundred mill and luckily for me I did call it and we won by a close margin so we did walk with a massive profit and of course we had a massive drop party at the end of that and also we managed to give away about 100 bonds in the past couple weeks - I forgot to mention that but I think there's one last clip in this video where the bonds are shown but yeah we just gave those away to random people for the most part and just to Ironman there's always like one or two iron men who come to my drop for tea so you got to give the I got to give the iron men some appeal - so that was pretty fun to do and it's nice just to give people membership because that's one thing that you know everybody appreciates I feel like I don't think I did any free to play get ways maybe if you draw parties but yeah no money for free to players no ice cream feels bad man but as he goes for this steak we did win the elijan we walked on that guy I think it was just one le steak and last but not least my favorite steak er of the ball mr. default we did streak him pretty well always a closed steak with this guy and yeah he just he's a nice guy he actually joined my stream a couple days ago and he actually lives like 20 minutes away from me so small world but yeah we did a streak him pretty well he won a lot on me but I won a pretty good amount on him we would stake each other every day and every single day I think I would be up on him so just certain people in the duel arena you win a lot against than certain people you lose a lot against least that's just what it seems like to me or maybe it's just truly all random but with that being said guys that is going to wrap up this one I hope you all enjoyed the staking and the giveaways and my next video should be Rev related and then there's probably going to be one more staking video after that as of today my bank is currently about around 8 bill plus I'm proud to say that I've given away over 4 and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon thank you very much for watching and I will see you next time mister no sleep out
