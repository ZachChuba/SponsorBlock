depictions of colonial warfare were often reduced to a conflict between civilized and uncivilized it was a common belief that the states of Africa were simply nations of savages incapable of withstanding the West and in dire need of the civilizing force but this was not always the case a dismissive attitude such as this one distorted reality and led to the destruction of the cultural heritage of countless groups across the African continent imperialism in places such as Africa provide an important lesson warning us of generalizing entire groups of people furthermore in most Wars there were no definitive good guys or bad guys each individual soldier had his own reason for fighting whether it was compulsory or not and while it's very important to recognize the driving political forces behind a war the genuine acts of heroism and bravery of the men who fought them should never be conflated with the motives of the men who start them I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian in this video we'll be discussing the anglers of the war but first I'd like to more on that later the years 1806 the start of the war of the fourth coalition in response to Holland's entry into the war on the French side the British seized the Cape Colony from that point on the United Kingdom would retain control of South Africa meaning the Dutch colonists who resided there were now under the jurisdiction of the British Britain would preside over the colony in a rather less a fair manner as it proved to be a vital trading route to India but as far as they knew the region didn't contain any valuable trading resources one decade later saw the rise of the infamous Shaka Zulu who made a career out of conquest against his tribal neighbors he would carve out a powerful in southeastern Africa but as rain wouldn't last for too long as in 1828 his half-brother to Ghana murdered him and seized the throne unlike Shaka Dingaan II wasn't well respected by his people on this floor would eventually lead to his demise his policy towards the neighboring British was by and large one of neutrality still any settlers trespassing in his land medic grim fate let's jump forward to 1835 and take another glance at the British Cape Colony the relations between the British administration and Dutch settlers called the Boers were by this time of bismal the main point of contention came from the abolition of slavery the Cape Colony this would affect many British citizens but to the Boers who relied off of cheap slave labor it was crippling all of this would lead to a mass emigration called the Great Trek a key figure in this emigration movement was Peter atif and his group of Dutch settlers who were called the four trekkers unlike some other more migrants he took his group of followers to the far eastern coast known as natal Retief went on to ask the leader of the Zulu Dingaan II for permission to settle in the land of drakensberg in 1838 Dingaan they agreed but under one condition Retief would need to recapture some Zulu cattle that were stolen by other local tribes Retief agreed and successfully returned them but upon returning to Dingaan ii he found an entire Zulu army or impede waiting for him they slaughtered him and all of the settlers that were with him indiscriminately this was the first major clash between the Zulu and European settlers because of the incident a British Expeditionary Force was sent to the port of natal to intervene in the case of any future border conflicts but when they arrived they found Boer settlers occupying the city the Boers had heard about the massacre and wanted revenge so under leadership of andreas Pretorius the Boers prepared to strike back against the Zulu using the port of natal as a staging point on the 16th of December 1838 12,000 Zulu warriors attacked Pretorius as wagon lager in the Battle of Blood River the battle culminated in exactly what the name suggested the Zulu sustained around the 3,000 casualties with the Boers sustaining only three this humiliating defeat would lead to a near Civil War in Zulu land more Boer immigrants poured into the region of natal and in 1839 the Boers officially cease to port natal from the British and founded a city called Pietermaritzburg officially establishing the Natalia Republic with the support of the Netherlands after the zuly defeat at Blood River there was much clamor from ten ghani's political rivals whom he would promptly have executed but one got away map on day upon day had roughly 17,000 followers the Boers told me Pandey to return to Zululand and they would help him seize the throne if he agreed to recognize an Italian sovereignty but Pandey agreed and asked did King Dingaan a with the help of the Boers with the border secured the Boers began to overstep their boundary they pressed thousands of zulu into domestic service by using their newly acquired influence in the region as one could imagine the British were outraged the Boers were shaking up the social and political landscape in the region the Boers kept battling local tribes in the east as they migrated and the British just couldn't let this go on they sent a regiment to reoccupy port natal in 1842 and Pretorius who is now prime minister of the Nathalia republic retaliated by confronting the British in the Battle of Canela facing defeat as more British forces arrived from Cape Town just a year after the battle the British officially annexed natal and with that nearly all of the Boers living in the region fled far northward eventually they carved out their own republic in 1852 called the Transvaal Republic and later the Orange Free State in 1854 border conflicts continued to raise tension all over the region as time went on another succession war was fought in Zululand ESMA pandey grew old his two sons Cetshwayo and Mombasa fought for control after the Battle of ined on Takasugi in 1856 sets yo1 the succession from that point on he was the de facto ruler and his father mem Pandey would remain a figurehead until his death chess whale went on to stress a policy of non-aggression and cooperation with British as neither side sought armed conflict he eventually met with the British secretary for Native Affairs Sir Theophilus chef stone who officially recognized suits Wales legitimacy in 1861 unlike some of his predecessors Jets way-o was very clever he recognized the threat of the ever encroaching ores and so he sought to raise a large standing armies to that of shock he also enforced strict military discipline and rule and enforced celibacy for all young soldiers in his army until they proved themselves in battle as you can imagine this provided Zulu warriors with quite a compelling reason to fight there was one problem the Zulu had with their military policy a large conscripted army and the stated non-aggression with Britain were ostensibly at odds this resulted in an even more precarious situation in the region which would only worsen with time in 1867 everything changed diamonds were discovered in South Africa and the British became very interested a surge of immigrants from all over Europe flooded into South Africa and began colonizing the interior of the region as the borders between the Boers British and Zulu began to blur conflict became unavoidable the British went so far as to seize West Creek will and because of the diamond rush and because of the increase of European influence in South Africa the Boers gained even more confidence and began picking another fight with the Zulu a dispute arose over an area around Blood River the Boers claimed that it was given to them by the previous king upon day but Jets way-o recognized the ploy we'll get back to that later seven years after diamonds were discovered Lord Carnarvon the Colonial Secretary for Great Britain who is also the man responsible for forming the Confederation of Canada began his project of Confederated South Africa in 1874 but he wasn't going to micromanage this enterprise so he asked Sir Henry Bartow frere a famed governor in British India to unite South Africa for him and if he could do it frere could become governor of the South African Confederation fast forward a few years later in 1877 when a fight broke out between trans fall and their neighbours this time it was out of hand and Lord Carnarvon told chef stone to annex the region of Trance fall and because the British took the region they were now in charge of the border dispute over Blood River between the Zulu and Boers that I mentioned earlier fer knew that the only real threat left were the Zulu who were recruiting tens of thousands of soldiers fur also knew that relations had to be improved with the Boers because of the annexation so he ditched the non-aggression idea with Shep's way oh and supported the Boers claims at Blood River but before he could do that officially he was convinced by Shep stone to put together a Boundary Commission in 1878 to really determine who had the valid claim there the Commission ended up reporting that the Boers had no justification to reside there at all Frere was furious if he released this information the Zulu would charge in and slaughter anyone there sir Fran would turn his attention to his military he asked Lord Chelmsford to prepare an army in case of Zulu or Boer retaliation thank you for watching this video is in collaboration with history with Hobart on YouTube he's actually covering the history of South Africa up until the angle of Zulu War so please go check that out he's
