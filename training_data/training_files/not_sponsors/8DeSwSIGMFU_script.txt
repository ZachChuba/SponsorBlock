our new patron you're a noob hello everyone my name is andrew ajt thank you for joining us again this week i had a pretty weird week because the internet was down for quite a bit of it we had the tropical storm and a few hours after the storm had gone the internet went out and it was out for several days so that was kind of annoying but it happens you know with the storm and everything i don't know why it happened afterwards but oh well it's back now so nothing really to worry about and today i want to talk about the five things jagex has done really well now of course i'm critical of jagex at times when they screw things up but occasionally they really do get things right and they don't get enough credit for them so i do want to discuss a few of them today of course there's more than five maybe if this video does well i'll make a part two and these will be in no particular order i just want to talk about some things that people don't really point out or they just take for granted that jagex did which have all really benefited runescape as a whole so the first one is simply the release of old school runescape itself which was never really a sure thing i mean if we go back to 2012 we have the evolution of combat being released which i think most people would say was a mistake it was not a very popular update even though it has been improved since because it even drove me away from the game for the first time i mean i had taken breaks but i had never really just stopped playing runescape for that long and eoc pretty much did that for me and then i came back for old school of course but there had been calls for an older version of the game to be released long before 2013 and eoc in 2012 and it never really seemed like it was going to happen so when it actually did happen it was really quite amazing and i was very surprised and i don't know i guess it takes some guts to release an older version of your game because to me that's almost saying like yeah we're working so hard on this new game but people don't like it as much and we're just gonna put an old version out and swallow our pride i don't know that's just how i see it maybe they thought about it totally differently but it really worked out and probably worked out better than just not doing eoc because i think i like old school runescape better than i would like runescape 3 if eoc never happened so it really was a good decision on their end so the second thing may seem obvious but really isn't quite the case for all games and that is jagex's decision to support content creators as much as they have jagex has done a pretty good job of this and we might take that for granted but if you look at other gaming communities that is not something that is for sure i mean there are gaming developers where they don't really do much to support their community for the game they don't really host events or anything and maybe they'll even give creators issues with content id claims or copyright or stuff like that and really just be annoying for those communities rather than supportive and to me that's really dumb because it means less content creators are going to play that game for their viewers and when youtubers or streamers play a game for their audience then that just makes more people want to play that game for example i've seen let's plays or speed runs of games and it made me think wow i want to go play that game so that's what i do and that's how i find out about the game but if that type of stuff is being discouraged then that wouldn't happen this all seems very obvious to me but if you look around it's not always the case with every video game developer or community you could argue that jagex focuses too much on content creators sometimes or cares too much about what they think but that's a much better problem to have than the alternative number three is the old school runescape polling system which is very unique most games don't have anything like this so for new content to be added to the game we know it needs 75 percent approval in the polls which is quite a high number that means that really a very strong majority has to want something i mean you would think it would just be over half but three quarters is a very solid number that you can feel good about something being added to the game if it passes that and they also do developer blogs or even just surveys to get people's opinions before the official poll is released so you can feel pretty good about the final product being what people actually want if they had to answer in a yes or no question they have made it pretty convenient to vote in the polls as well and you can't just make new accounts and vote right away so there is some integrity to it as well the only improvement i could think of is maybe some incentive to vote maybe like 5 000 runecrafting experience for every poll you vote in i would vote every single time if that was the case number four is the great quality of life and user interface updates we have gotten over the years people forget that back in 2013 when old school came out it was a very clunky game to navigate especially with the interfaces and how some little game features here and there would work for example you couldn't even use the middle mouse key to operate the camera you couldn't right click and immediately teleport with the glory in the bank there was no deposit all or deposit worn items or even bank tabs you had to go to your options menu to turn on your run energy you couldn't see the remaining xp to the next level in a skill you couldn't have loot broadcasting these things don't really provide an advantage to have them now but they're just really making the game more convenient and the menu is much more easy to operate and the reason this is also great is because a lot of this is toggleable if that's even a word people even say togglescape for how the game is now so for example if you don't want to play with the mini map orbs like your hp and your prayer which were not around when the game came out you can actually still disable those and that is true for quite a lot of these features so you can really customize your gameplay experience to be as new school or old school as you want there are some things i would still like to see for example the ability to resize the ui itself like the tabs and the mini map and everything you can kind of do this already with the rune light stretch feature or adjusting your screen dpi or resolution but if we had a customizable ui where you could just resize any aspect of it that would be so amazing and last but not least one thing i like that jagex has done in certain circumstances is to know when to bypass the pulse system for integrity changes so the pulse system is very good but there are some flaws with it for example for pking updates you can't really expect 75 percent support for really anything because 75 percent of the community are not pkers so in some circumstances they've actually gone around this for example fixing the entangle spell to make it freeze for 15 seconds regardless of prayer that was a great change it took a while for them to get around to doing it but it was still very much worth it and really improved pking in that aspect i like how they're pretty selective about this they don't just do this for anything in fact sometimes i even think they're pulling too many things like some things are so obvious that it feels like who would even vote no to this anyway and they pass by quite a bit but i'd rather them pull too many things rather than resort to too many integrity changes around the polling system i think it's important for them to be selective about it so there you go those are five things that i think jagex has done very well do you agree with my list would you take anything off this list that i mentioned or would you add anything that they've done well that i didn't mention let me know in the comments also let me know if you want to see a part two to this video i'm sure there's a lot more i could think of these were just the five that really stood out to me that i wanted to talk about
