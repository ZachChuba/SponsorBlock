you block origin kill that's on desktop advanced on mobile and now sponsor block is making me an aspiring content creator shiver as it lets you skip integrated sponsorships subscription bagging and screens you name it hi my name's alex tand i make short reviews so the main problem with youtube sponsorships is that they mostly lack variety how many times have you heard about shadow legends and the worldly long messages that they force creators to recite like the bible what's even worse it won't stop even if you already purchased their shaving goods or vpn service same with the intros no matter how much i love a channel it doesn't really make me want to rewatch it for 100 times so a sponsor block just like netflix gives you the option to skip those and this gets even more handy when you just want to watch the game without any lengthy additions you can use it in home firefox opera and even edge browser plus there's third party support making it available on both android and ios so how does it work unfortunately no magic user submissions but don't worry it's not complicated at the beginning of the ad press the sponsor block button search for the and preferably with some level of precision and press the end button a new upload button appears obviously you press it adjusting the playback speed greatly helps with precision choose an appropriate category use the inspect and preview buttons to see if you missed something or went overboard you can fine tune the start or end of the submission on the playhead or enter in the time manually sometimes it's easier to change the seconds than to scroll and when you're fully satisfied hit submit there are guidelines that you should absolutely read if you find someone submission to be violating these guidelines reported by putting the thumbs down putting the thumbs down on your own submission will outright delete it each category has its own settings behavior color that you can also adjust i feel that many things could get improved say tags for fun and interesting sponsors maybe only skip certain ads that you decide on have individual time and whitelist settings for each category yes youtube is filled with ads sponsors but then we about clickbait and content focus on small kids while cutting all creators lifelines you too can aspire to make minimum wage one day as a youtuber or focus on kids that don't install adblocks sponsor blogs and buy shitty effortless merch actually like share and leave comments under your videos or i guess pump out reviews on day one with little or no testing or honesty because the manufacturer not the viewer is paying your rent so why am i even trying to do this right away
