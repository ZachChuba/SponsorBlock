that's as far as i could go wow how does it feel it feels awful oh i'm so sorry this is this is great no this is for content i love it can you can you stay wait wait wait don't come out this yet wait hold on i'm not done yet i'm scared my dick's gonna pop himself oh don't worry no one will be able to see it mr alligator hello wow we haven't even begun this interview and you already have a hundred people in chat oh [ __ ] i gotta stream i could hear myself we already have hundreds of people in your chat having curry raid and you've leaked my dms before we've even begun are you a hurricane no i'm not a furry king but why is why is chad saying that you are because this is what they do my community never lies come on no this my chat literally exists to embarrass me every chance they get do you understand that i have to stop raiding people because every single person i would raid they would spam furry raid furry raid furry raid they literally my own community griefs my growth i cannot grow my stream because i get embarrassed every single person i read and i haven't even rated you and look how bad it is and they don't get the social cues like the basic social cues like i should probably stop this the joke probably isn't funny after two minutes five minutes 10 minutes it's probably not funny anymore but they're still doing it they've completely taken over your chat doing this stuff it's kind of funny it's not funny why did i call you the furry kid there has to be a reason are you guys that's my okay my girlfriend's gonna get mad because i always blame her but i still think it's her fault because she told a story on stream i think she just screamed did you hear that yeah i heard that tell me more i was watching netflix and i was watching beast stars i've never watched the show i decided i'm going to check it out and she was in the other room and there was this scene where there's this rabbit girl that gets down on her knees and gets ready to suck this wolf guy's [ __ ] and she walks in at that very moment and looked at me and says what the [ __ ] are you watching i'm like dude this has never happened before in this show like like i don't know like and she like caught me in the middle of this act and she's like you are a furry first you told me you thought lola bunny was hot and now this now you're watching a bunny suck a woof's cog i'm like there's no sucking like it's just part of the show like and hold on let me get straight thinks bonnie is hot she's the show with a [ __ ] sucking what was it bunny the bunny was about to suck the wolf's [ __ ] okay so sees bunny socks sucking on wolves [ __ ] yeah it's b stars no b stars okay well have you ever heard the saying like if it smells like a poop if it tastes like a poop of it you know it probably is a poop um is poop do you is that what it are you sure it's with poop i i've heard that saying but i don't think it's with poop i think you just made that up but you know what i'm saying so if it cracks like a duck as it talks like a dog so if he likes a bunny sucking a wolf's [ __ ] and the chat says furry king and your girlfriend confirms it i was the perfect explain to you why i found lola bunny hot okay i'm going to explain that to you right now tell me okay yeah think about this at my age when we're young yeah we didn't have internet and as much porn as you guys have now like right now there's probably three to three hundred to a thousand people fapping to you as we speak like finding fappable content is so easy online nowadays but back then there was nothing like literally anything you saw like i i think chance said it best like he would find like designs on his door that looked like boobs and he would jerk off to them right what so yeah so back then like anything that you found that was like even mildly attractive i didn't have cable tv i didn't have any internet i didn't have any magazines all i had was just whatever i could find and then you watch space jam which is on your [ __ ] tv and then lola bunny comes in she's wearing like a [ __ ] short shorts and like like all this like revealing clothing and she's being all sexual like that's literally the sexiest thing you see as a kid it's [ __ ] lola bunny there's nothing that lives up to that like like so it's i don't think it's being furry i think it's just the fact that like lola bunny was like the first like modern like they knew what they were doing right like they knew what they were doing with lola bunny they wanted to make lola bunny sexy so because they were fairies no i'm not afraid i don't find any other animal hybrid person well okay like cat girls are hot right or like bunny girls but that's different because they're humans they just have like cat ears or like bunny ears right like that's different that doesn't count right wait someone's spamming [ __ ] in my chat is that dude just [ __ ] turn off chat they're so is that wait hi um wait i did a commercial for msi and and they they make everyone watch this super cringe commercial like i woke up i used to be in an organization it's a small word called fanatic i don't know if you've ever heard of them but um i woke up and uh we were going to our training center and what ended up happening was uh are you looking it up you're not gonna find it no they took down the video because so many people have have looked it up they they literally made it private they made the video private because of my chat because of my chat they made it private oh i read a mirror would exist it exists somewhere but i'm not going to tell you where to get it they might but i won't i actually don't know where it is oh they made a website it's called 18inchbeast.com yeah you can actually find it through there wait is it a foreign site it's not a porn site but maybe don't open it on stream just in case you typo and go to a different 18-inch piece like don't start 18-inch b-style where you showed me dm's 18 it's well i was like my accent going through 18 inch why can't i say it 18 inch beast 18 inch beast because the laptop was an 18 listen i had no script i had nothing they just like they were like who wants to do an msi commercial and all the players were like i don't want to do it like this is this is stupid this is cringe and they're like okay you do it i'm like me and i'm like yeah or they're like yeah so they're like no script or anything they're like okay here's what we want you to say and then everything else you just make up as you go along i was like all right i was like here are the specs of this 18-inch beast and everyone [ __ ] they've like edited it to make me say like oh yeah i love this 18 inch beast it's real smooth and it feels real good you you came to our bar right okay you called me a porn star or something like that can you can you remind me of our first interaction together because my chat keeps telling me that i thought you were porn star because okay here's here's the background will told me he was bringing this porn star friend okay into vr chat so the first part you weren't even the first person i did that to there was some other girl before you and me and murder carpet were drunk as [ __ ] and um this will's like all right here's my friend and the first thing we say to this poor girl is can you teach murder crumpet how to work a [ __ ] because crumpet has no idea how to work a [ __ ] and this poor girl was not the porn star was just this random like really sweet nice girl and she was like oh um i don't really know how to do that and we're both like you're a [ __ ] porn star like what do you mean you suck [ __ ] all the time it was the most awkward thing because i i looked at the phone afterwards i'm like holy [ __ ] dude i owe this girl a [ __ ] apology dude this [ __ ] is bad so yeah you weren't the first person that i it's will's fault because he keeps saying he's gonna bring his porn star friend but he brings his non-porn star friends and i guess you were will's other friend but can you tell me about my first interaction with you i mean god that was the first interaction with me wait you were that person was that you i mean that's what you told me oh so you were the person that we asked crumpet did we ask you to teach trumpet how to work a [ __ ] that was you alone those lines and then later uh you told me you kept telling me that i am a porn star that you were trying to convince me and then you got it got to a point where i couldn't escape you and murder crumpet calling me a porn star over and over and over again that i had to tell you that what's wrong with being a porn star but then you know but but look listen listen listen later that day i got really drunk too i got super hammered later that day and if you had actually approached me later uh that day when i was super drunk i would have just been like oh god so um what does that mean what uh just use your imagination now now jake just raided you who's a regular in vr chat and now you're exposing jake's community to the furry jokes now the jake viewers are also going to do the furry jokes because you've just done that i want you to know that are you smiling no it gives me pain it gives me pain to know that i've caused this i want you to be sad i'm very upset right okay thank you mm-hmm are you you're a furry wait no you're like officially i don't know what

uh yeah yeah so i people call say i have shrouding you have shrouding yeah they say like we're like twinsies when it comes to gaming capabilities so why do you think you haven't um taken advantage of this like uh fps skills and and joined like a team or something or like played competitively because you know i don't want the other players to feel so intimidated that you know i pretty much imbalance entire esports you know you know what i mean like i'm a humble person too you know i don't want to i just humble yeah are you actually like a gamer are you like a fake gamer what like what games do you play i play a lot of games you keep saying like you're like the person who's like trying to [ __ ] through an interview right like you don't have to impress me you can just tell me the truth and say you don't play games i have i'm good at a lot of games i play a lot of games uh okay you keep saying a lot of games name a game please just any game just name any game animal crossing oh my god dude what i bet you're a time skipper aren't you among us okay well let me tell you something okay you you are what we in the industry call a casual gamer i am not a casual gamer i'm a rock hard gamer okay i play i play a ton of games right you play humongous like if you had a if you had a positive and a negative what would you say is your biggest positive and your biggest negative like how does it even out my best positive is that i'm perfect you're perfect and my biggest negative would be that i can't grow past my profession hmm interesting what is so you said that these aren't really interviews it's just the hangout so you're are you you're not a robot you're a um an ai technically character a what i'm a game character okay you're a game character so as a game character you have a primary function what is your primary function uh at the moment i don't have one because i'm an npc so your primary function is to be an npc yeah do you ever like glitch out like uh you also don't have like that uh what hi mr robert what's up you're transparent i'm i'm really glad we have some transparency in this interview yeah yeah cue the laugh track sorry um yeah i can glitch out where's the pro and con about you good question hmm a pro and con about me oh my god our adhd so bad no you actually made a good choice by switching oh boy wait guys we're talking about the void right stop pick one subject please the void pros and cons okay the pros and cons of the void okay the pros of the void are that uh i guess nothing really exists there so you don't you can't feel sadness or emotion or anything you just don't feel anything in the void right it just doesn't exist the cons of the void are that nothing exists so you can't really have any happiness either so i guess the pro and the con is the same when it comes to the void what is the void why are you doing this you really okay okay do you really want to know the truth okay yeah yeah yeah here is the we shouldn't dwell on this for too long because it's gonna lead to an argument between me and chad and it always does okay okay okay so i am convinced and i understand that this is not normal and that 99 of people think that i'm absolutely [ __ ] stupid for saying this okay i am convinced that i remember what it felt like to be in the womb before i was born wait really yes i'm pretty convinced i remember the feeling of it and i have a theory as to why okay okay my theory is that when i was born i was thinking about it constantly and i thought about it so constantly and obsessed about the fact of that feeling that i remembered it all the way that's my theory what did it feel like you can't explain it it's unexplainable it's just it's nothingness right you don't feel pain you don't feel happiness you don't feel anything you just like you don't think about anything like like the the idea of thinking of something doesn't exist it's just nothingness and you can hear though at some point you start hearing okay there's one day where you just start hearing and it sounds like okay this is what it sounds like it sounds kind of water it's like if you're under water and you can hear things coming from outside that water that little muffled like like you can hear that can we move on please okay okay we'll move on we'll move on um i'm just trying to save your freaking chat yeah he also meant elon musk that is actually a hundred percent true i went to elon musk's house when i was in fanatic tell me more okay um when we were in fnatic the owner of fnatic and elon musk uh met up in a bar and they uh in uh in london and uh they were talking about overwatch and uh the owner fnatic was like we could send over the fanatic overwatch team to your house to like play with you and your kids he was like sure that sounds great and originally they were asking us they're like who wants to do this and i was like dude i want to do it i want to do it and they're like well we should probably get some of the players and i was like [ __ ] dude i'm the coach they'll never let me go dude [ __ ] so they uh invited two of the players it was buds and custa those are the two players they invited and i was uh i was uh on this like like i was like i really want to go so i messaged the manager i was like do you guys think that i could go too and i'll just pay for like my own ticket or something and uh can you just ban my chat like can you just give me mod i'll ban them myself anyway um so what ended up happening was uh we go to his house and it's a beautiful house like he lives in like this private neighborhood i'm not gonna say where because i'll get sued um and you go through this garage and it's like uh there's like this whole security area in his garage and he's got his dogs in there and they uh they take you to this room and you would expect the inside of his house to be like crazy like there'd be these crazy statues and all this based off how the outside looks it's actually not that crazy looking inside it just looks like a normal house and you go into like this gaming room and the gaming room is like this big couch this big ass tv and then there's a separate room that has all their computers and like what kind of computers do you think like elon musk's kids would play on you would think like some [ __ ] like crazy computers right yeah no they were like [ __ ] laptops like toshiba laptops they're like gaming with like 30 fps and then elon came down after a while and started hanging out with us and uh it was kind of like it was kind of awkward in a lot of moments because we would make jokes with him but then he would take the jokes literally like um yeah our the owner of our org was like we could be the first team to play on mars ha ha and then elon sat there and told us for [ __ ] like 30 minutes explained to us how it would work the game on mars and like the lowest latency he knew exactly how far mars was from earth he just sat there for like [ __ ] 30 minutes like literally explaining what we would have to do to be the first esports team on mars and how it would take [ __ ] like how we would each have like thousands of ping with the best satellite technology possible and all this stuff and he was like it'd be possible but the best game you could play is like chess or something and uh then i remember he was playing on a tv and i was like oh dude you can't play on a tv you don't have 144 hertz monitor and he was like hmm that makes sense and he explained to me for an hour how frames per second work like just oh my god i didn't understand half of what he was saying literally 99 of what he was saying i did not understand but the whole time i just sat there i'm like interesting yeah so that's how frames per second works and uh the only other thing i remember is that his kids were very competitive and all of them want to be the pop fraggers so one of the kids like uh died he started slamming the desk really hard and being like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and i was like whoa this kid's really mad and elon was like someone's being a salty sailor that's the only thing he said that's the only thing he said to his kids the whole night someone's being a salty sailor and that was all i remember oh and he had a nice bathroom i took a [ __ ] in elon musk's bathroom and that was nice did it feel good to take a giant dump in his golden toilet yeah i remember it was really awkward because i had diarrhea that day oh and the this was like the game room bathroom which is right next to the [ __ ] i actually never told stream this okay okay yeah it was the game room bathroom which is right next to the the uh the computers and i remember i'm like trying to keep it down really because i i mean when you [ __ ] you're like farting and stuff so i'm like sitting there like moving my [ __ ] sphincter into different positions to try to like make sure that i'm not making any noises out of my ass while everyone's in the room next door okay so chad is wanting me to ask you about his butts open splitting open so okay in order to properly demonstrate this i would need a clear wait wait wait what okay i'll explain okay okay so you know i stream vr chat right yeah it's something that happened full body i want you to i'm gonna give you a tour of my room a little bit okay let me make sure there's nothing that reveals my address or anything in here okay there's no like weird [ __ ] around okay good all right so this is my whole room right there's a [ __ ] dog cage there because sometimes my dog sleeps in here and i don't want her to chew up my cable your dog and stephanie there's there's another pillow on the ground there as you can see there's not a whole lot of room in here yeah like right there's just not so when i hop in full body i mean i'm a big person i'm six foot six right like look at this this is the ceiling right yeah i don't have to jump i'm just touching hey you are a big boy yeah i'm like let me here i'll stand next to that door just for for comparison okay there's a there's a door right that's a door yeah i don't know if you've ever seen a door but that's the door here's me next to a door okay as you can see i'm pretty damn tall i i'm almost taller than the door do you live in europe or something no i live in chicago come for the food stay because you got shot anyway where was i going with that oh yeah no idea okay yeah there's not a lot of space in here right yeah and um there's this corner on my desk i want to show you this corner look at this bad boy right here look how sharp ouch yes that went into my ass cheek while i was in vr and split it like literally like made a giant [ __ ] gash with that like i wish i could show you how sharp this is oh i took a can and i just went like that with it like very lightly and it split the can in half just to kind of give you an idea of how sharp it is why don't you just cover it up or something cushion it nah i'm just not gonna do vr until i move i'm planning on moving in like the next month or two you could just put duct tape over it it'll become less sharp hey i've i've i've already ran into this thing so much that it's dulled like naturally from my skin and bones it's doing better yeah my ass cheek dulled it a little bit too but that was really painful ah you did this on stream yes i did do it on stream and i uh it hurt a lot it really hurt a lot because i what i was doing we had in vr chat we have this guy named curry games and like we don't we don't let people do like violent stuff in rp because it's really cringe like it's people sitting there like pretending like they're fighting each other and it's really stupid yeah but when it comes to curry games we allow it because we have all us we have all established that curry games is the most powerful being in the vr chat universe right like we have established it so i wanted a challenge i was in full body this day i had like my leg trackers on and everything and i have established on this day that i was going to fight curry games this one can you just ban the people like the the one man spammers so anyway um especially deadly 1d he's just being cringed okay all right jorm can you obliterate uh okay do you want to see him get shot too inside a video game can you do that yeah hey jordan bring in that deadly gwen guy put him in the corner so that um he he can learn his lesson you could do that that's sick i want to do that that's deadly yeah that's deadly show them what the punishment is for one man spamming like a little cringe boy don't miss it just hold on ah don't worry don't worry i got this i got this dorm can you jorb regular scent guy right that you were talking about in your last interview there you go i got him thank you yeah so yeah i challenged curry games to a fight and he hit me so the rules of rp is if you get hit you have to sell the hit or else it's a minus one yeah like we have a we have a point system no one actually keeps track of the points but like in this situation i didn't want to get a minus or a plus minus one minus one so i got hit and as i got hit i flew back and my ass went directly into that yeah and that was it oh god at least you committed to the hit oh i committed to it and i paid the price oh hold on you said that you if you got five hundred thousand dollars i would get a [ __ ] tattoo on my ass yes and chase will have let that happen well chance so chance gave my friend meech five thousand dollars to have sex with murder crumpet in vr chat so there's really not a whole lot of boundaries with what he wouldn't do and me and me and chance and vigor watched it too send this to sodapoppin guys for fun for five hundred thousand dollars mr murder crumpet will get a [ __ ] tattoo on his back i'm not missing i'm not murder crumpet i'm robbed sorry murder crumpet is the other one there i know you guys look the same anyway we don't spam at all murder trump it's like a femme boy there's other things that there's other features that actually can show but i kind of let me just let me see if i can actually show um what was that this is like so this is a prototype so everything here is kind of a prototype so this is like mikko's traveling scrapbook where there's like different places i can go um i'm gonna go to i'm gonna see if i can go to my apartment so my entire space needs to be calibrated to my room because there's things that's one to one here okay okay right so like holy [ __ ] the mic is like breaking up for me a little bit is it breaking up for you too chat or is it just me holy [ __ ] testament of my strength so basically my the environment is kind of one to one without the places that's around my house mika that was sick okay so this is where i punish my chat yeah yeah you're gonna punish them by the way are you wearing heels irl yeah so my so my um my mocap suit she has special shoes and the shoes themselves kind of they have this click clackety sound to it

is so um like for example okay grab this god man gut and just hold on i'm gonna try to kick i don't try to punch you eat that [ __ ] i'm really bad at one thing for some reason i'm just terrible oh [ __ ] it just bugged out but you got the idea that's cool yeah dude i want to [ __ ] up my chat do you understand how big of a power that is they used to like scream and yell and stuff like that but like i've been kind of working on this prototype thing and it's kind of broken at the moment as you can tell your chat is so good my chat if they saw someone in heels like stepping on them like that they would all just be [ __ ] gasming oh yeah they kind of do that too like yeah so there's a big gigantic my computer's right here so i don't want to kick him but um this is kind of a like prototype of me kicking around my chat no that's sick i'm gonna go back to can you crush that guy in front of you just [ __ ] destroy him this guy yeah yeah i don't like that guy i don't know anything about him i just don't like my computer's right here so that's why i'm a little oh okay i'm hesitant to like try to kick him and i don't know why he's actually not responding to my physics as [ __ ] now give me this you're doing that in real life right that dance right now yeah well yeah of course i am wait you have gotten banned me and soda got banned at the same time yes oh because of the i've heard the

question yeah i'm sorry about that no it was it was okay i um i punished myself immediately after i got banned i went into a uh a vr jail cell and i spent 24 hours in there because they made my band

on you're literally talking about you're literally talking about this yeah that's lola bunny you're a fairy i'm not a furry there was just nothing else that was hot back then i it was either okay it was either i [ __ ] jerk off to [ __ ] judge judy or jerk off the [ __ ] lower bunny like what like what do you want from me i mean judge judy is the human choice so you would rather okay can we do a poll would you rather jerk off to judge judy or lola bunny one is judge judy and two is ola bunny yes i really want to know point proven yeah but they're a bunch of furries so your chat is furries well you're chat's furries remember your chat came in and your chat is fairies because you were the furry king wait are you commando right now i'm always commando no wonder you were worried about your dick i actually don't think i've worn underwear once this whole year if i'm gonna be honest wait wait what yeah i don't think i've worn underwear once this whole year i'm very hygienic though okay here's the thing i have a bidet and every time i pee i like wash myself very thoroughly down there so sit on you pee i sit when i pee yes sitting when you pee is actually like master race like i don't know why anyone wouldn't stand up while peeing you have a higher chance of just peeing all over the place you're not comfortable when you're sitting when you pee like dude i pull on my [ __ ] phone i could play some mobile games i could like check my twitter i could like do whatever i could watch [ __ ] code miko on the [ __ ] toilet while i'm pissing right how long it's okay for you okay but like when you pee right whenever i sit when i'm peeing like there's always some other stuff that happens like i'll fart a couple times in there like like of course yes yeah so it's better to just sit honestly no matter what you do plus like okay i don't know if i'm just deformed or something but when i when i stand and i pee like you don't have a penis so you don't you wouldn't know but there's always those few little droplets that are hard to get out and you kind of have to reposition yourself to get those last little droplets out or else those last droplets get in your underwear or they get in your pants but when you sit those last couple of droplets always get out like it's impossible for them to get into your underwear or your pants and since i don't wear underwear like i can't afford to let those little p droplets hit my shorts because if they do then that's going to that's gonna [ __ ] up my shorts they're gonna smell like pee and i don't want my shorts to smell like pee so i sit when i pee i make sure i get every little drop out i go to the sink wash myself all down there and then i put on my shorts i never knew this well how could you how could you it's true very very true how could i um and chad actually agrees with me for once that's that's a first yeah i wash my penis in the sink and then stephanie will yell at me and be like you're getting your dick juices all over the place i always have to clean up your dick juices all over the sink i'm like don't call it that that's [ __ ] disgusting what the [ __ ] is jake juice yeah that's what she calls it will you actually wash your dick in the sink yeah every time it's being hygienic i'm very imp i'm very big on smells like i don't want to smell so anything yeah even in public like i'll do it in public too like if i'm in a public bathroom i'll i'll like look to the left and the right make sure no one's around and then i'll [ __ ] clean it i feel like i know you so much better now european toilets are kind of weird like they don't when i was in poland i don't know if it was just the places that i was at the toilets were so the holes were so small that i had to like i had to decide if i wanted to pee or [ __ ] i couldn't do both because if i try to pee and [ __ ] at the same time my [ __ ] would splash into the water and that was gross like no one want like that's how you get a [ __ ] std your [ __ ] goes into the [ __ ] toilet water and probably absorbs like whatever the [ __ ] in there i don't want that so i just like i have to like position myself based on which one i'm okay i see you drinking that but yeah um i had to choose like i couldn't do both at the same time i see yeah i see i see it we can move on to that subject if you want i don't have to talk about my my piss and [ __ ] because i have a lot of piss and [ __ ] stories i could go on for hours uh i mean i i'm i'm fascinated i i'm the one i tell all my viewers why not why not i'll tell you a [ __ ] story i'm only gonna tell one [ __ ] story i have plenty okay but i'll tell you this [ __ ] story okay all right it starts long ago about middle school years okay okay so i had this friend named mike and mike was kind of a [ __ ] all right no one really liked mike but i try to get along with everyone so i got along with mike mike had a birthday party and mike thought that he was popular but he wasn't all right no one really liked mike except for me and a few other people so mike invites me to his birthday party and he invites a lot of people to his birthday party i bring my friend alex and um he has this other guy named jason who i [ __ ] hated at this party all right so his dad was like how many people are coming his party mike's like 20 but there was only four of us so his dad orders like five big ass pizzas like 18 inch [ __ ] stacked pizzas right and um we just we have five [ __ ] big ass pizzas for four people so his dad's like trying to make sure that we eat it all so that's like come on man just keep eating dude just keep eating and he keeps feeding me more and more food right and he just keeps eating more pizza in my mouth and he keeps forcing me to eat it i'm like all right i ended up eating one of those 18 inch pizzas by myself like the whole thing it was a pepperoni and sausage pizza i ate the whole thing and after that they just kicked us out of the house they're like all right you guys go play outside so we're like hanging out outside on our bikes and my stomach's like and i'm like it's probably fine and i'm sitting there thinking i'm like i i'm gonna have to [ __ ] soon but i probably can hold it for a little bit longer like i just want to hang out out here for now and after a little while like i'm like okay maybe i should start going to the bathroom so like mike i have to use your bathroom mike's like no man my grandma's sleeping and i don't want to wake her up because we have to ring the doorbell to get upstairs and the downstairs bathroom is broken so if you need to go to the bathroom just hold it and i'm i all right i'll [ __ ] hold it so i start holding it and it starts getting worse and worse and at this point i'm like okay maybe i should go home but i think about i'm like i have to ride my bike home i'm going to be bouncing up and down oh god like i really gotta use your bathroom dude like it's bad he's like nah man so i i held it as long as i could and eventually i'm like okay i'm gonna [ __ ] myself if i don't go right now so i [ __ ] push mike out of the way i go to his back door i start slamming on the door and um eventually his [ __ ] like 90 year old grandma walks up and opens the door i was waiting for [ __ ] 10 15 minutes for this lady to [ __ ] slowly crawl over to the door to open it the second she opens that door i immediately start booking it to the bathroom the second i take off my pants in that bathroom like like literally first thing i do shut the door as fast as i can pull down my pants the second my pants come down i just start [ __ ] diarrhea [ __ ] everywhere all over the wall all over the floor all over the toilet seat everywhere and i'm like oh god this is horrible so i finished my [ __ ] and i realize this whole [ __ ] bathroom is just [ __ ] it's just covered in diarrhea [ __ ] so i'm looking for like [ __ ] wet wipes or anything to clean this up anything i could find and i look around and all i find is a little jar full of coffee walls so i'm like okay so i open this jar of cotton balls and um i start wiping the [ __ ] [ __ ] with the cotton balls and i realize instead of me actually cleaning this [ __ ] i'm just smearing it so now instead of me cleaning this [ __ ] i'm creating a [ __ ] [ __ ] art piece all over this [ __ ] floor and wall dude i've literally created like a picasso painting of [ __ ] in this guy's bathroom all right and i start panicking and i don't know what to do so i did the only thing i could think of i pulled up my pants i start walking out of the house and um i i walk past his grandma i go outside and he's like so how'd it go i'm like i don't know man i couldn't use your bathroom your grandma was in there and i was like okay i'm just gonna blame it on the 90 year old grandma maybe he'll think that the 90 old grandma [ __ ] all over the floor and i start walking out and this is where i [ __ ] up dude this is where i got caught then jason goes did you [ __ ] your pants and i'm like no man i didn't [ __ ] my pants he's like i mean look at your pants and i look at my pants and there's this giant smear of [ __ ] on the bottom of my pants and i'm like nah man i just fell in the mud earlier he's like i don't know dude you smell like [ __ ] and you look like you get out of your pants i'm like i gotta go dude i ride my bike home and i have to [ __ ] ride my bike standing up like not sitting down because there's [ __ ] all over my pants and my ass and everywhere and i had to [ __ ] go home with a [ __ ] covered [ __ ] pants and explain to my mom what happened dude it was working my god how old are you this was in middle school so however old people are in middle school 13 i don't know 12. this is the greatest [ __ ] story i've ever heard in my life i mean i have more i i have more [ __ ] stories if you ever want to hear another one just let me know i'll share another one with you are there any is there anything worse than that it can't get worse than that come on that was really bad yeah come on no way no way no way no way okay i'll i'll tell one more [ __ ] story but i'm gonna end it on that one when i was young when i was like i don't know maybe five six i don't remember my sister was getting married in poland because my sister's 20 years older than me right yeah so we i went to my sister's wedding and um she had this after party in like this big [ __ ] like barn okay i don't know what the [ __ ] it was it was like a barn like it was like just this big open place it was like a little stage and there were these rooms on the side okay and um they made all the kids go upstairs and sleep in these like in these big beds so i'm sharing a bed with like [ __ ] five other kids and um i got really sick that day i don't know what happened i've had diarrhea my whole life i'm pretty sure i've had diarrhea every day since i was born oh but this day like it was really bad and um what ended up happening was i in the middle of night i wake up and i realize i have to [ __ ] really bad so i opened the door and and our parents told us we're not allowed to go to the main park because everyone is drinking there everyone's partying there and they don't want us to get into trouble right and um i started looking for a bathroom well this [ __ ] place had outhouses because that was how things were you had to go to a [ __ ] outhouse so i couldn't find a bathroom so i did the only thing that a rational five-year-old me could come up with i went into the other room and i [ __ ] all over the corner of the room and i use the carpet to wipe my ass okay so i just left a big [ __ ] pile in the in the corner of this [ __ ] room used the carpet to wipe my ass and went back to sleep okay and then i was like looking around to see if any of the other kids like noticed that i was gone and no one noticed that i was gone so i was like all right the perfect getaway so then the night ends and and like the parents are coming upstairs to pick up the kids to like take them and uh my mom wakes me up and she's like how is everything and i just didn't want to get in trouble so i [ __ ] talked to my mom and i'm like oh no everything was fine but the kid next to me woke me up he went into that room and i don't know what he did and i like i [ __ ] played it off dude i was like this kid woke me up and went in there and my mom like checked to see like what was going on in there and she found the [ __ ] pile so she [ __ ] told his mom and his mom just starts beating the [ __ ] out of them in front of all of us and this kid is like what did i do and she's like you know what you did he's like no i really don't you don't know what i did don't play stupid with me and she starts beating the [ __ ] out of this kid yeah i got that kid in trouble i i [ __ ] i did the bait and switch i took a [ __ ] and i blamed him oh my god that kid is so traumatized mr rob this is a different story okay it's related though all right okay so this is the this is the damian story okay okay so when i uh when i grew up uh my i grew up in a very poor family like we lived in a [ __ ] deli like my mom bought a deli and we moved into this deli and we lived in it okay like we lived in this shitty little deli and we lived in a really [ __ ] neighborhood like we've got we like my mom got like uh like armed robberies like [ __ ] five times right and uh i we lived in this like really poor neighborhood and uh i like let's just say i didn't fit in in the school that i went to so i had very very few friends right like very very few friends so one of my friends was this kid named damian and um we were waiting in line to go to lunch because the way it worked is we had lunch in a gymnasium and you would wait you would line up outside of this gymnasium to get in and damien who was one of my only friends in this whole school was ignoring me that day i don't know why but he was talking to this other kid and i was like what the [ __ ] damian like why won't you talk to me and this was like third grade like i was really young or second grade even this was second grade um and damian's ignoring me so i kick damian and he falls down on the ground and i'm like ignore that damian and uh damien's like dude what the hell man i'm like well you're the [ __ ] fake friend like you're ignoring me dude he's like i don't want to talk to you especially after you just kicked me i'm like okay so he turns around and starts talking the guy again and i kick him again i knock him down on the ground i [ __ ] kick him and i knock him down on the ground and um my school had a very strict no violence policy because it was like in the hood so like if you got in trouble for violence you immediately got suspended there was no [ __ ] like ifs ands or buts about it you immediately got suspended so a teacher came up and saw that i kicked him down on the ground and she's like what are you doing why are you kicking him you're you're gonna get in trouble uh you're gonna get suspended and i thought i just said the first thing that came into my mind like i tried to find an escape and i didn't know what to do so the first thing that came into mind was he touched my private parts that's what i said i said he touched my private parts i didn't even know what that meant i heard that the day before like i heard someone say that the day before like private parts and i said he touched my private parts i completely [ __ ] lied completely lied completely [ __ ] threw this guy under the bus and she's like i can't believe it both of you come with me and david's like no i didn't do that i didn't do that so they [ __ ] took us into this office and uh both of us had polish parents that like didn't speak english so they have to call this guy named the general the general was the polish translator of the school dude like it was this [ __ ] guy who like walked around with a mustache and he was like this [ __ ] broad shoulder guy who is the polish translator he was the general and the general [ __ ] like called my dad and his dad to go to to go to class and my dad was [ __ ] pissed absolutely [ __ ] pissed like my dad came in he's like you touched my son's penis what are you guys teaching in this school i can't believe you touched and and just a background story my dad was a professional boxer growing up so my dad wanted to beat the [ __ ] out of everyone there and my dad multiple times has gone to jail for beating people up so i was very scared because this wouldn't like i was scared my dad was gonna [ __ ] start a fight there and go to jail because he's been to jail like a lot of times but um he starts like [ __ ] like like yelling at everyone and damian's like i didn't do it like i didn't do it and i i was too far in this line now to go back i couldn't tell the truth at this point like i was already too invested like i had to [ __ ] take the before so i stuck with the story the whole time i never let it down i couldn't at this point i had to [ __ ] i had to double down i was invested completely so um like like we both got in trouble but it was nothing serious like we just had like a very stern talking to our parents got told like um damien though i think i've pretty much ruined this kid's childhood because everyone called him like the penis toucher for a while i i moved out of that neighborhood the next year right like i completely moved out of that neighborhood and uh here's the funny part someone on my stream said you should look up damien and see if you could find them and i looked him up on facebook and i actually found him okay like he has a very unique name like his last name is very unique and i looked him up and i found him and someone said you should message him i was like okay i'll do it so i messaged damien at first i sent damien a friend request and he accepts it right and i message damian i'm like yo damian what's up dude it's me robert do you remember we like uh went to school together when we were young and uh he removed me from his friends with the mexicans i think i reminded him of that story oh yeah oh my god that's the damian stuff oh my god yeah evil i am i i was a bad kid i i i was a bad kid you you do eventually grow out of like being a piece of [ __ ] right right but i was a really bad kid i just grew up with the wrong crowd i had i had bad friends and they encouraged me to be bad what the [ __ ] is that hold on i'm saying let me full screen this what the [ __ ] are you looking at that's vincent dude that's not a gator that's a vincent he's putrid okay vincent vincent is this very awkward character that's a part of vr chat that uh there's this okay so crumpet has boosted vincent's ego okay vincent is this like super papa person who crumpet has completely boosted his ego so you have this like how do i explain it without being insensitive vincent is a is a if i was to come up with a word he's a specimen he's like okay he's a creeper he's a creeper not a creeper creepers go up to you and go and blow up he's more of a creature like you can't you can't predict vincent so what would you like to do with vincent would you like to go on a date with vincent would you like to no no i just so i have a friend who found vincent and she's been wanting to puzzle piece who it is for the longest time and so i said like maybe i can figure it out for you vincent is vincent but the character that vincent is in is a uh godzilla character oh i see yeah i'll go on a date with vincent you'll go on a date with vincent yeah why not okay let's set it up we'll set up a date with is that bad no it's not bad at all i actually think it would be pure content yeah yeah he's very socially awkward i taught him how to erp really do people get off of erp like is it actually a thing yeah yeah see watch let me okay you're thinking about it from like a casual standpoint right okay okay who have you ever found like like an anime character sexy like or like any fictional character sexy yes okay who iron man tony stark okay so let's say you're playing vr chat right uh-huh well you don't have a [ __ ] so you can't do this okay let's look at it from my perspective okay let's say for example that i find tony stark sexy i don't know why i chose that example but let's roll with it okay let's say for example that i find tony stark sexy okay yeah and i want to [ __ ] erp with tony stark okay um i put on this virtual headset and then think about this right i tape a flashlight onto my desk okay and it's attached to there and i could bang tony stark in vr chat but i'm banging this flashlight that's taped to my table at the same time and it's immersive it's like i'm really doing it and when you think about it from that perspective you could literally do it with anyone you've done this before haven't you well i i've erpd she's not gonna like me telling this but i'm gonna tell it anyway i've erpd with stephanie but um we did it irl and in vrchat at the same time we set up our vr in the same room maybe this is why no one interviews me you could come to the next gator con wait it's okay okay good question gatorcon yeah is that gonna happen huh so

that well that just shotguns the water into your throat that's amazing i've never seen anyone be able to do that before uh if i had better water bottles i could go for like a world record i'm very close i'm actually only like i think a half second away from the world record seriously yeah but if but you have to min max like you have to uh you have to have like the perfect bottle yeah and and i haven't been able to get a good bottle there's actually clips of me doing it in like two seconds or something like doing the uh the bottle thing that is impressive you have a pet spider somebody's asking me about no when i worked at staples we had we were so bored that we found a spider and we would catch flies and throw it into its web and we got it like really big and fat and we had this huge ass spider that was our pet at staples and then one day there was a this girl named demonica who was uh in the back room uh sorting like the ink boxes and she found the spider and she was like rob can you kill that spider i'm like i'm not killing that spider that's our pet don't touch my spider and she was like i i'm not gonna be working back here with this spider back here so she [ __ ] goes into the manager's office and tells my manager that we have this giant spider that we're feeding and uh the manager pages me into his office so i go back there and he's like rob what's the deal with this [ __ ] spider and i'm like we have a pet spider we've been feeding it for weeks i'm not gonna get rid of it yeah that's right and then and he's like rob kill the goddamn spider i'm like i'm not killing the spider i will leave through this door and i will leave this job before i kill that spider so he [ __ ] gets up starts running to the back and he [ __ ] stomps on my spider right in front of me [ __ ] kills it he killed my pet right in front of me i was actually sad i'm not a spider murderer why do you tell people that well you kill spiders now no dude stephanie likes to [ __ ] here's what happened me and stephanie were in the woods earlier this year like during the summer and she saw this big ass spider web and she's like that's such a beautiful spider web and i thought it would be funny to like throw a stick but not into the spider web like try to miss the spider but just make her a little bit nervous like make it look like i'm trying to hit the web but i missed and i actually nailed the [ __ ] spider like directly in the center like it was a perfect [ __ ] stick throw and i destroyed this big beautiful web right in front of her and uh she's like what the [ __ ] and i'm like dude i tried to miss i swear to god i wasn't trying to hit that spider web i just wanted to make you scared and she's like you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] like why would you do that do you know how long it took that spider to make that web i'm like it's fine like it's a [ __ ] spider i probably saved some like poor bisol bicyclist from [ __ ] getting a face full of spider web you know what i mean
