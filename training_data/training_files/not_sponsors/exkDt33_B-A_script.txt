hey groupies welcome back to former therapy this is the culture study I'm the shadows video producer you can call me PD and the culture study is where we check out kpop music videos coming out of the East I myself am an aspiring filmmaker and I'm korean-american so I try to provide any kind of analysis and context and breakdown of both any cultural stuff and production stuff but anything we don't know we try to learn together now today we are going to be checking out who dis by secret number secret number is a new five-member girl group debuting under vine entertainment I'm not familiar with fine entertainment but I assume that they are a I assume that they are a smaller label something because I feel like maybe I have heard of another group debuting out of vine let me actually double check for you guys but I assume it's not a huge label fine entertainment kpop let's see you've got secret number and I'm not familiar with anybody else all right so this might actually be this might actually be a brand new label like at least it was founded in 2016 they have one so Louis Seong Yeol trainee named pectin and a former artist by sha flan not familiar with any of these so it is a smaller label it is a it is a new world I wouldn't say newer label given that it's been around for 2016 about four years so it's somewhere in the mid range now before we get into this music video optional if you don't want to or you can't we understand let's just get into this video this is who it is by secret number and this is your form of therapy alright let's get started [Music] Wow okay [Music] oh boy your job [Music] [Music] okay hopefully I'm I'm interested [Music] [Music] get out and then a tiger [Music] oh boy [Music] easy boy jumping no get good next educator Corrado negative attitude now [Music] oh okay hmm I'm a fan all right so who dis by secret number the song has a largely I feel like a mid-2000s girl group kpop influence too it does not sound modern but at the same time it doesn't sound retro but it does sound very nostalgic of something between like the 2010s and the 2014 era of kpop girl group style the heavily brass driven track it's been a hot minute since we've heard that there was actually a very prominent period in kpop when brass was just like it was all the rage that was probably when that was probably when like that whole sacks number was popular in the US as well so probably like somewhere between 2 to 2 to 4 years ago somewhere around there so yeah that does sound a little bit refreshing what I actually really like is the vocal melody the the vocal melody is actually slower it's actually it's actually and it's part of what makes this sound more like a mid-2000 song the song like the melody actually sounds really it's slower cuz then like they're taking their time with the chorus where as I feel like most k-pop songs nowadays it's it's not as slow there's more tempo there's more rhythm in fact the song especially with the brass it feels more like an anthem it feels more like a March like it feels more like they're kind of proclaiming something through the song rather than just singing a girl group song I also like the various different vocals if we go back and actually check out some of the different voices here the opening vocalists here she's got a really really nice lower register I really like there I assumed you'd call this the rapper right [Music] actually she's doing a little bit of singing here but let's get into the chorus I really love the two vocalists in the court [Music] I think this girl I think this girl is a really really good singer in fact I think I think this song actually does a really good job of kind of pulling from our vocals and kind of pushing her to do something a little bit more different than the others like you can really hear like like like like it almost sounds like her voice is gonna break but it's not it's like that control I really like the chorus parts but yeah this part this part with the with the rapper this kind of rapping is also very late 2000s era I would say like it kind of reminds me of like the rapper I forget her name such as II the rapper from secret if anybody remembers that k-pop group but yeah I think overall they've got a great diverse set of vocals like all the members have very different set of vocals that I think keep the song fresh and interesting I think the vocal is that do carry the chorus have really strong voices like let's listen to that chorus again one more time like it should be around [Music] yeah I like the sound of it now does the group have a distinct style I'm not sure this is just a debut after all and I would say that the music video doesn't do anything necessarily to put them in a particular box or to sort of define their style so right now that's kind of up in the air so we do have to wait a couple comebacks to see really what their style is about and what their style of music is as well the title track is really good here just because I do think that that mid 2000s late 2000s era or the early 2010's era was kind of like a very interesting different style of kpop music than it is now but are they going to carry on with that style I mean that's just because their title track is like that does not mean they're gonna be continuing down that path so we're gonna be we're gonna we're gonna have to see based on the next few comebacks but we will be paying attention here on this channel because I like them they're new they're fresh I think going I think having that sort of late 2010 sound kind of does set them apart from these different girl groups and I think whoever they're ANR was it was a good direction to go for that brassy sound because it does sound powerful it has a lot of impact it pops and you know right now there isn't that trend of that sax so it also doesn't sound overdone either in fact you know music is slick cyclical like it just goes in trends so this sounds very refreshing anyways guys thank you for watching this video with me let me know what do you think of secret numbers debut with who dis in the comments down below also remember if you guys want to
