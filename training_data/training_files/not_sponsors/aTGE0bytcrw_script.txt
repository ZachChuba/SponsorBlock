it's happening just really huh I'll get fired on me it is like a Tom Pemberton YouTube video test it Jarek injected testing so is this the moment of truth and Friday on the odd occasion we do the sundays videos sometimes it was a bit quiet because loads of people in the shop and going into the shop and you look silly going to the camera you're gonna go down today is a big day I am so excited today so if anyone follows me on snapchat Instagram which is yeah and yes you'll know that I got well excited I think your end of November December time and my mate said you got you got a bit too excited about that I got well excited it's not something that's coming to the farm I may ask me and I told him what it was and he said you picked that up a little bit even Heidi says you picked that up a little bit but they do not understand they did not understand I've been waiting for this for so long so long so a joke and Joe's that since I've known her I've wanted this any livestock farmer will know how big this is this huge I've got the camera her on this is massive well excited so I got approached by someone and said can we give this to you because you we know how much you want one and I was like yes yes I am so excited it's coming I don't if I'm good let you know you probably know already because of what I've done before now on the way it text me but yes this is the best day ever I don't even want to know what we're gonna title this video might be clickbait if I'd just be straight up with it who knows I'm just excited well wavelets come and then we'll have a real good chat I will see it all well hopefully Kitty cows you so excited so excited I need you excited IDs excited good day okay the good day it's gonna be great I'm great hey girls just that just finish off the excitement of how good it is look how bad the day is and I'm this happy so this is definitely a big day in penton's farm shop dairies everything going on it's huge this is huge the weather by the way still awful still wet still horrible a little bit depressing no this guy should smash it this is a Wednesday as always because the Wednesday so we do the dry cows three times a week and Heidi's on that job bought the Bulls in there so I just moved them for a tractor here it's here honey guess what it is yeah can you get stopped might not my shut down so less is the best in about we are with Mayo Cal comfort and we are with easy swing are a Cal Brush Company you know we are with Marco Haney and Chris who's going to install it I'm so excited it's easy swing contacted me and said we heard that you've really want a cow brush and we have a cow brush we would like to donate a cow brush - Pemberton's Bob and obviously you guys know me 100% we're going to have a look at it we're going to put it together and I'm going to talk more about this Marco Haines you're going to tell me everything about it I'm going to give it make it look cool and then we'll chat by separate ones because if you have some of these change so in case say this one broke the end one broke instead of having to buy a whole new brush all you have to do is take these off swap that one and then you can trade it in so it is less costly than buying a brand crush which is about 250 quid I think just for the brushes alone so that's why we didn't separate and also that peace process which are on the end of cut for us we are easily you can change the places so you can take this on the center oh so you're saying the cows use the end ones more than these these ones see the end ones you more than the close ones what you can do is just swap them round so all last longest so you don't have to buy brand new brush so that's pretty cool all these the middle ones more what you can do is mute the middle ones out and they're all the same they're just going into linked and the bristles are very adorable farms that they have your Zrii yes same bristles without changing that were nearly to the end any time soon so bit more as a big bro sixty kilos with fifty kilos because the customers can rake 1500 kilos yeah I give you as a video of a hara football playing with this brush and he's absolutely destroying it that's why i'm a little bit worried about our shed with cows destroying it but we fine be fine we didn't do shed anyway we're on spearing when your remember to put some grease there it will last like forever fired on me it is like a Tom Pemberton YouTube video people just say them economy it's great fancy meeting you here look look look the cows are here he and Marco and fin its fin isn't it yeah from Finland that works been from Finland this year we had a good look round before and we had a look round where we want this cow brush there is a really really good place in the Lowe's building the building that's a little bit tight there's a really really good place for it there a strong solid piece of wood telegraph pole of old put that's in the lows I'd really like it in hides so we're gonna try and put it on here if it doesn't work we'll move it over to there and the other thing is the shed valve so hopefully they don't knock it down maybe I get another one and put it see how these are I'm obviously can say I'm bit excited here for a week or a couple of days and we think cows are beating about the shed and it's a little bit weary we will not put it in we'll move it to the other one the other thing as well on this side you said this side we've got the lights for the shared in the electric and stuff so my blights on might help the viewing a little bit maybe something did happen it's not got all the electric service yeah yeah feels you gonna be so happy your faces and we're gonna be cleaning hundred eighty centimeters yeah yeah nice and easily when it's down it's a low enough that they can brush the sides yeah okay so keeps all the flame height is very important thank you there we go before I put it in my pocket I will give you back so the middle bar that's where the brush is gonna be wants to be about 180 centimeters high that's for perfect cow height or them to rub the sides and then when the brush is to the to the to here if that makes sense it goes on the box which will go to see if it's too high too high we can always saw out no problem this is very simple to do obviously you guys want to be here you want to be show me how it gets used which is great even I can do this myself standard is six millimeter big steel yeah it will hold in any case any issue say I did want to move this I could move this whole thing gonna over to the ones that we said before easier if you have one extra of these yeah so can you can put this on the other place and only remove the process test it 100 kilos right I was gonna say a modest 85 so is this the moment of truth this the time this is it's finally going in the bit that we are most looking forward to have you ever heard a sound so sweet look how good it's meant to be locked in so I don't want to move it too much to a fallout but how do we lock it in yes about that quite a bolt there then they leave up and put the other ball I've grease nipple just there outlaw Charles and then when Keenan's magnitudes and all that we'll just yeah but only one grease nipple easy we like easy it's finished let's shut the gates and let the cows see their brush yes come on single girls resilience l if you know the program are we gonna have our first customer the tent is just some believed age fright if any cows in the world shouldn't be stage fright it should be these ones we gotta do it we have it number nine which Heidi's knife named after a cell is playing with it the only thing that's wrong is it's kind of moving the shed a little bit so I've done is wrong my welder and he's gonna come and just strengthen it up as much as we can at this corner so we don't have that issue because we want to come back to a shed in the morning Marco the pros of this brush why is this brush so good easy swearing wiser the best if it's the strongest price on the market yeah it doesn't get broken it's mechanical no electricity needed to no electricity which is huge which is like amazing this is great and it's easy to awesome I simply it's it updates like a 20 minutes awesome yeah it's simple obviously we could have done this but you guys wanted to come and install itself I've got I've got cow licking the tripod the brushes the different brushes so these brushes are from actual road sweepers on me they're not cattle brushes so that's your brush itself sorry look and I'm taking off here is a harder brush so it should last longer now they are polypropylene recyclable and it will last like two or three years before you need to change the change even after that you can change the places of the disc so you can manage one disc set maybe three four years turn so you'll see that the only turning bit there is where it goes up and down but it doesn't turn so it's rigid for the cows to itch on so it's and it's less moving part the less moving part you have the less issues you have so all I'm going to do three sit on this bit there in this bearing and then that's all we have to do what every couple of weeks you'd say month every month maybe every month once a long just give it great so number nine seems to really be enjoying it already she's the only one been on it at the moment because she's hogging it the bullet Cal get used to it they'll be using it more our issue is these gates come across to here and my gate comes to here but all I can do is just move that put my gate into its hole this will be out the way and then I can feed no problem I forward a little bit of an issue with the feeder coming through to here but I don't think it's going to be an issue at all that's going to be easy to get in easy to get out yeah I'm really really excited I'd like to say a big huge thank you to marco from easy swing thank you very much really appreciate you guys coming over as well fin came over to come over today to install this which is fantastic also big thank you to Mayo cow comfort who came install that christed no problem easy showed me how to do it and it's very very simple to put up so even for someone like me for these cow brushes wild markers here at the start around eight hundred quid and then if you buy them in bulk what will happen is the price goes down and it goes down dramatically I think they are great no power which is fantastic so I could put them in any shed which is the one good thing as well you were saying is because we graze for six month year it's just gonna be stood here not doing a lot I can move this easily con of course I can get another bracket here take this off and then put it outside so when the cows are waiting to come in they can have a good itch as well which I'm probably gonna do in April we're gonna do that and we're gonna put one out there it's great the proof will be in the pudding we'll see how the cows do it in a couple of days like I say we're gonna we're gonna get this place strengthened off of it I think that's a good idea happy with it yeah it looks looks very nice and cos looks very internists the cows are interested start with gonna be a lot cleaner very soon look at number 9 which is Heidi is definitely loving the brush marker again thank you very much for coming thank you if you want to inquire about a cow brush we'll put the link in
