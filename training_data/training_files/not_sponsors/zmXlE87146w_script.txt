[Music] hey there it's adam here from tesla australia welcome back to another video well it is quite early it is now just before 6 a.m and i am heading into the office which i haven't done in a long long time actually it's been months since i've since i've been in the office obviously due to covert and all that sort of good stuff uh which isn't so good but uh yeah so i'm gonna head into the office today for just the day uh probably won't go in for a little while after this i need to pick up a few things and drop a couple of monitors back um from home working so i thought i would do something a little bit different i thought i would do a bit of an autopilot test i'll try and see if we can do the whole freeway entrance to freeway exit type scenario that tesla keep talking about i have done that once before uh heading in the opposite direction so heading sort of from the city back home but i thought i'd try one in the opposite direction and two kind of at dawn still night time so uh to be honest i haven't done a huge amount of autopilot night driving uh the driving that i have done has been has been fine uh so i thought i'd try something a little bit different today and uh see if we can go all the way to sydney on navigate on autopilot uh obviously trying not to jump in and take over uh at all if possible and then lastly trying to see if we can uh take the relatively complicated exit at the end uh to head onwards to work so uh stay tuned with me on this video and we're about to get started right here we are on the freeway entrance i'm going to put navigate on autopilot on right now i'm going to flip the speed up to 110 which is the legal speed limit i'll probably set it a few kilometers higher just as we as we kind of go along but we'll see how we go traffic's relatively light not too much going on it is still quite quite early car wanting to enter the freeway which is great i would expect the car to probably move across once more just because it is quite slow in this lane and that is really good no issues at all i'm not sure if it's a if you can tell it is a little bit hard to see because it is still relatively dark and apologies if you can't see me at all uh might be a better sight actually on this video i might actually get more videos uh but uh it is uh sort of slightly raining and the road is kind of wet as well so it'll be a pretty good test but i'm just happy kind of cruising along as we go i'm going to leave the video going i am going to speed it up obviously so you're not sitting here watching a a 45-50 minute video but obviously i will jump in when i see something that i need to uh jump in and talk about so stay tuned [Music] [Music] the reason why i shine you're the reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] one thing that was interesting there is that we ended up dropping down to about 104 or 103 kilometers per hour which uh i've got the car set to 110 kilometers an hour and normally i probably would have seen the car decide to indicate that it wanted to move over to overtake that car uh for some reason it didn't do it now i didn't jump in because i wanted to let the car do everything but the car then decided to move over to the left lane himself so a little bit odd uh the car is set to average in terms of its uh frequency of lane changes and i just found it a little bit interesting that the car didn't decide to move over just then and it was happy just holding this lane so we're back up to the right speed limit now so not uh not terrible but we'll keep an eye on uh the rest of the trip and see how we [Music] go [Music] [Music] all right we've got our first lane change and for some reason uh autopilot actually disengaged now i'm not sure if i uh if maybe i held the wheel a little bit too tight there just as the lane change happened or not but that was that was quite odd now i was mid sip of coffee as the uh as the lane change happened so perhaps that was it maybe i just can't multitask but uh there was an auto part disengaged there but it wasn't no part of the of the car itself like i said i think i was just holding the wheel uh a little bit too tight when the lane change occurred but we're now moving back out of the passing lane now which is fine which we've done at the same time as another car which is also okay but the car slowed down actually really quite nicely to let uh to let them in at the same time as i was pulling into the same lane so uh all good there let's continue just as i say that another lane change nope being cancelled there's a car coming up quite fast in the fast lane and it's indicated to move across a little bit early one thing i was about to jump in and say was that i i was finding that autopilot was a little bit more patient in terms of uh waiting for i guess the passing lane to be clear before it actually uh indicated to move along which i'd seen pretty frequently i've done a couple of fairly long drives over the last few weeks and uh kind of noticed on quite a few occasions that even though the car decided to slow down because of a car in front it wouldn't indicate to to move into the passing lane until that lane was kind of clear so um a little bit interesting that uh you know on that occasion it sort of waited to do it uh sort of until the until there was a car cutter right next to me you know he slowed down to let me in i'm just gonna bump the speed up just a little bit because i have i have jumped into the fast lane uh in front of him so i do want to kind of overtake to get up this hill and then i'll uh i'll kind of move it back down but unfortunately with speed changes i do have to make them manually the car whilst it uses the map data to get the relevant speed zones for that particular area it's not always fully accurate but the car doesn't slow down for those areas so on this area of road there is a stretch where the speed does drop to 90 uh or 100 kilometers an hour depending on the the time of day and the weather and things like that so um i will need to make those changes uh myself to slow the car down or speed it back up afterwards so they're the only real changes that i i do want to make is slight adjustments to the the speed of the car otherwise i'm going to let the car do what it needs to do to get me safely to work now i'm not sure if you can see out the front windscreen very well but it is quite foggy uh in this section so it has been raining for the last kind of couple of days and the temperature has dropped quite a bit as well so um it'll be very interesting to see how the car goes in handling this fog but so far lane positioning is is really really good um and so far i've seen no issues with the way the car is handling the fog so pretty cool [Music] okay we're moving over to move out of the passing lane which is good because this area also drops in speed so this is one of the areas i was talking about that drops down to 90. unfortunately it is a high accident zone so the speed has been has been dropped in this section just because it's uh fairly downhill and quite windy so uh not a terrible move so i'll just drop my speed down to 90 and just cruise along i will have probably quite a few cars kind of overtaking me i would guess at this time of the morning the left lane generally has quite a lot of trucks in it so i know i have seen a lot of comments on videos saying the car doesn't necessarily choose the the left-hand lane technically i guess you should be in the left lane unless you're unless you're overtaking however the the right-hand lane here in australia is used for for overtaking so you are allowed to use the the left and middle lanes [Music] okay we are back up to the 110 kilometer speed limit so that area uh that we've just passed through like i said was 90 so we're kind of back on the normal speed limit and this will this will continue all the way through to the end of the freeway so get a bit more traffic starting to appear now so a little bit more congestion as we as we sort of head into the sydney area so we'll just uh keep watching and seeing how the car handles uh handles all of this [Music] cars deciding to take the left lane which to be honest i really kind of don't like it doing um otherwise termed as undertaking uh yeah technically not illegal but kind of not a cool thing to do in my opinion so i'm really not quite sure why tesla do use this lane for overtaking but in instances where you are going probably slower than the rest of the the cars it doesn't use this lane to kind of just sit in and kind of plot along at the speed limit so again really not sure why it does this it doesn't do it very often it's probably seen that the fact that the car the lane sorry is uh sort of completely open uh and decided to use it but the problem's going to be is now we're going up a hill we're probably going to get into a position where we've got some slower cars or slower trucks struggling to get up the hill and a bit of a phantom break there and we're gonna get into a position where we're gonna fairly quickly sort of need to move over so um yeah we'll keep an eye on how things are going but yeah i really don't like how the car chooses the left lane to overtake him yep exactly as i was just saying i can see up ahead there is a truck that is uh fairly decent sized truck actually that is that's kind of just plodding along in the left-hand lane just because he's fairly heavy now i'm gonna be in a position in a second where i'm gonna have to kind of move across into the into the middle lane to pass him and it's gonna break pretty heavily here i would suspect we haven't seen him now and it's moving over but now i'm down to now i'm down to 65 k's an hour to to overtake him so yeah it wasn't an overly smart move and and i think the other annoyance there was i moved across to overtake and now i'm going in the right lane um but i moved across into the middle lane but when i started overtaking i was only going 65 kilometers an hour so quite slow so i was i did have my foot over the accelerator in case i did need to to jump in and speed up there wasn't anyone behind me uh thankfully um but again not not a not a great move and to be honest the car probably should have been a little bit more patient in terms of the initial uh switch to that left lane and either hung around in the middle lane until it was safe to to move across into the right lane like it's done now so again car handled it without a problem but again probably just not the best decisions it made to get itself in that situation [Music] [Applause] okay moving back out of the passing lane into the middle lane which is a good decision plenty of room around i did not need to be in that lane anymore so uh good decision by the car then to get me out of that fast lane into the into the middle lane [Music] is [Music] so that was another great example of again where i've found that the car is being a little bit more patient to wait now obviously we had the example a little earlier where the car wasn't and it wanted to indicate when a car was sort of right next to me um but in that instance the car kind of got right down to about 103 kilometers an hour uh was sort of patiently just sitting behind and i've got the car set to two uh stopping distance right now um just due to being kind of winter and a bit wetter on the roads uh and yeah the car kind of just patiently sat there and waited until uh until the right-hand lane had sufficient space to to kind of move over and then even then the car decided to move out of the the passing lane pretty quickly actually and again i'm not sure if that's because it knew that there was a car behind me that was kind of coming up on on sort of my rear to to continue driving so that was a little bit odd that one like i said it moved across into the uh moved across out of the passing lane a little bit quicker than i probably would have seen before so again nice little improvements there i i quite like the fact that the car is being more patient and i think i've definitely seen that on on this drive bar one time uh and like i said even just moving out of the passing lane right then right then was uh was really good as well [Music] okay moving back over to the overtaking wagon again yeah the car in front was going quite slow i'm a bit surprised the car didn't do that a little bit earlier but that's okay it made the decision in the end um we're now about four kilometers away from my exit now this area does get pretty built up uh so it is going to be interesting to see how the car handles uh i guess two kind of lane changes to move across now into what will be the the far left lane to exit off uh this kind of freeway exit before the the freeway eggs exits uh or ends slightly further around so the cars indicating now that it does have an upcoming lane change now it'll be interesting to see where it decides to to do the first one thinking maybe in front of this truck might be a good spot depending on there being enough distance between the two i obviously don't want to cut a truck off it's not the not the smartest move to do and it's carrying a whole load of pieces of wood that's going to be quite heavy uh but yeah i think it's probably going to be a good spot it's moving across but there's not a great deal of room the car the truck is letting me come across he slowed down for me give him a thanks for that i probably could have kept going a little bit longer in this lane before uh i'm just going to slow down now just because it is a [Music] it is an 80 zone we do want to move across into the left lane now which that's good that's that's uh within kind of around that two kilometer mark which i which i quite like uh the car doing but just on that previous lane change before um he probably the car probably could have gone a little bit longer in that lane before uh it uh why are you moving away that's changing lanes away from the cones which isn't great i'm actually going to jump in and cancel that because uh one the traffic is really heavy uh and two i'd actually need to be in this lane so that probably wouldn't have been a smart move now we have also lost lane markings here as well on the road so not a great deal of visibility in terms of the car tracking the lanes uh but overall it's it's holding the lane position pretty well i'm assuming it's getting most of its bearings from the from the car in front so uh the reason why like i said it did want to change lanes just then as a car does generally want to move away from cones when it does see them on the road shout out to nash there i know you like your cone visibility on your car so not a terrible thing to do like i said it does want to move away from them because it does think it's a roadwork area um but in my instance i i wanted to cancel that just because i did i didn't need to be in this lane so ah nice little exit there off the motorway navigate on autopilot is going to end in 200 meters 100 meters it's an unsupported exit this particular one uh but it has actually taken me off the exit which is which is all i really needed so now it's going to take me to the stoplight uh the traffic light at the end which i'm going to confirm which we can see that's gone red but this isn't going to be able to take that it's too sharp a turn and not very well marked in terms of lane markings all right well that's going to be it for today's video apologies you've probably noticed a slight change in audio my front camera that i normally use with the mic attached unfortunately has a full sd card so it literally stopped recording as i finished the autopilot test which was relatively good timing not perfect timing but uh okay enough that i i got the part of that shoot done um so apologies if the audio is a little bit more faint in this section but just to close out the video i think the uh the car did really really well on that autopilot test uh the traffic was getting a little bit heavier um just due to kind of covert situations sort of freeing up here in new south wales uh but i think overall i think the car did did really really well uh there was only one instance where i had to jump in and all that was for was just to cancel a lane change just to move away from uh from some uh cones that were on the road just to indicate some road work that's been going on for a couple of years so um not terrible uh the only other instance where autopilot disengaged was when i held the wheel too tight on the lane change so um overall i'm super impressed with how that worked in terms of uh just overall lane changes keeping the lanes uh keeping up with the cars in front uh it worked little uh loss of lane markings there confused the car but um yeah really really impressed in terms of how all of that went so autopilot is definitely getting better and better with each software release um my level of confidence with with it is very very high and i think it will just continue to get better as we use it more on our journey so i really really enjoyed doing that test and i hope you enjoyed that video so as always if
