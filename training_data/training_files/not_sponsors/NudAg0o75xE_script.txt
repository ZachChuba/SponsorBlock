i recently moved house and found myself with some new office space this is the second bedroom in our property which is let's say um modest in size from this space i need to do my job of mostly being a youtuber but also streaming on twitch working on commission for other people and now unbelievably also being an author which means that i need to use this space very efficiently especially seeing as it also has to double up as storage for some other stuff so in this video i thought i'd take you through the setup that i've landed on after a bunch of iteration and experimentation which i think is really quite efficient and practical there's a lot to talk about back here on this side of the camera but i think we'll start behind the camera where i do most of my work looking this way there are several big things you'll notice straight away perhaps most obviously the acoustic panels these do an amazing job of killing the room noise in here before it was quite echoey [Music] next to the panels though we do have the most important thing in the room which is of course jasmine i put this place stand next to my desk so she can climb up it and uh sit next to me and judge me while i work which she does seem to enjoy doing all of my work of course takes place on the pc which uh the actual computer itself is down here in the corner it's quite difficult to film sorry definitely why the cable management looks bad it actually is good you just it looks bad from this angle all right this is a pc that my friend built for me we actually built it together on stream and uh here are the specs i'm not really a hardware kind of guy so there you go that's what the computer is the desk itself is a basic standing desk from ikea there's a little handle just under here and the reason i got this desk is that i need this workstation to do a couple of different things first of all it's obviously a place where i can do work i can have for example editing open on this screen and then the script or research open on this screen but with this pole mount here in the middle of the desk that culminates in a camera mount i can put the desk into a couple of different configurations normally of course i'd have a dslr mounted on here but uh i'm using that right now to film this video so that's why um that's why it's not on there with the desk in its lower position and we sat down it's in streaming mode so this is how i stream on twitch which looks like this although this is a dslr so obviously you can change the view and you can go right the way in hello i stream on twitch multiple times a week by the way sometimes it's science-based stuff such as going through past papers in science and maths but sometimes it's painting warhammer sometimes it's playing games and once a week it's the rp geek stream which is a dungeons and dragons campaign played by professional science communicators where we one week we'll have our adventures and the next week we talk about the sites that we've run into that mode is further facilitated by one of my favorite pieces of kit this is a stream deck which allows me to interact with my streaming software so i can change uh which scene i'm presenting to the viewers but i can also do things like play music [Music] obviously i don't need to use that one very often these panels behind the computer are called nanoleaf panels and i use them for my principal light when i'm streaming the reason i use them is because they're completely customizable so you can turn them on and off at the touch of a button or if you want you could change them to be different colors or you know you can even make them react to sound however if i unhook the handle and start raising the desk up then i can put the desk into filming mode and this is what it looks like in filming mode okay well i cheated slightly there's a hair light i've added up here and there's a big key light over here but you get the idea this is how i film my videos with the camera in exactly the same position as when i'm streaming just with the desk elevated this is trying to eliminate any barriers between making content in one form or the other because i stream and film several times a week the difference being that you're now at eye level which means you have a proper view of the set my personal hypothesis is that audience members subconsciously view youtubers as manifestations or avatars of a particular interest or a particular subject so when i was constructing the set i wanted it to be practical and somewhere that i could actually store stuff but also to represent some of those interests some of those subjects so you have plenty of books plenty of science books in particular you also have science in other ways like the use of energy and the light bulb and i guess the globe it's a bit on the nose there's references to my online community in the form of claude the capybara and of course some warhammer in fact almost all of the bottom 40 the bottom two tiers of the set is actually off camera and just storage to do with my hobby and painting warhammer every kind of thing here from basing materials to paints there's a drawer here which is just for oil paints and inks this one is for my airbrushing stuff just to try and keep it organized the black cladding behind the set isn't painted on because we live in a rental property and this is actually one of pixel girl's ideas black fabric that you use normally in gardens to prevent weeds from sprouting up through the soil two layers of that hung up on some command strip hooks and jobs are good and it even gives a really nice texture i think the lights illuminating the backdrop are philips hue lights which means they're also controllable via an app completely customizable and i like to vary the backdrop in different videos or even in one video if there's lots of different sections changing the background color to represent the different sections as i mentioned earlier the set is intended to be aesthetic but also practical so whilst it's full of books these are books that i actively refer to quite regularly somewhat disappointingly there's also a bunch of fake books which i've put in them that very few people seem to have noticed they're very roughly categorized by sections including one section that is literally just my two read next pile and suppressingly large on average i'd say i take something from this set and use it once or twice a day so it's constantly in use it's actually worked out really nicely there's also some other stuff down here like i think my youtube plaques here and my degrees and there's other stuff like some spare notebooks but it's mostly to do with painting stuff that has been painted goes here in the minish cabinet in the corner this is just a debt off from ikea with some led strips i won't spend much more time on this in the video because i know not everyone's interested but if you would like to see some close-ups of these models then you can check out 50 shades of space wolfgray on instagram i also have a youtube channel which simon clark errata where i upload painting recaps and you can see some close-ups of for example the hawaiian orcs my high fleet nostromo tyranids my original chapter space marines and also a couple of other things like for example this mandalorian haven't loaded there for a while because i hadn't had much time to paint but that's changed now because i've finished the book and i can actually get my evenings back that then just leaves this one wall which you don't see when i'm streaming or making videos and this is pretty much just storage it's where i keep camera equipment audio equipment and also lots of gubbins which i meant to have found a new home for by now but in the house move they've just sort of accumulated where they are there's also bins full of stuff here which i don't use very frequently like particular camera mounts and charges and things like that i do then have these two prints up on the walls this is a poster that i actually made along with the amazing artist lizzy fiekovsky basically no one's bought one but you can buy one if you want it's all about the different layers and structure of the atmosphere and then this is a print by mark rothko most of rothko stuff i find quite depressing and blue literally whereas this is obviously very energetic and bright and happy and i like that and i like how it fits in with the rest of his work so that's why it's on the wall in a way all the physical stuff in this office is really supplementary to the computer and the data that's on it that's fundamentally what my job is based on over the past decade or so i've generated about 10 terabytes worth of data which is partly stored on the computer's hard disk but then i also have an external hard drive and some of it's obviously in the cloud in the past keeping me a happy customer for the past several years i hope you'll agree that this setup i've landed on is really quite practical it allows me to stream and make videos and work at the desk and research and paint incredibly easily that said if you have any thoughts on the setup or perhaps some ideas about how to improve it then do let me know down there in the comments i'd be really interested to get your thoughts if you'd like to see some other videos from me then do check out the recommended viewing here and that just leads me to say thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed it if you did please do pop the video a like and i'll see you in the next video
