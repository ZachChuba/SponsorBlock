[Music] [Music] so I was just putting my ducks to bed for the night and you know doing kind of wrap-up chores and all the usual stuff I do and I noticed these two ducks here hanging out there two wild ducks I've actually noticed these two specific ducks at least several times this year if not more when I was out here actually doing some other work I actually noticed they're several wild ducks hanging out now it's really only down to these two but yeah these two have been hanging out for a while and like I said I'm actually pretty sure I saw them here last year as well it really makes me happy that these Ducks are trying to make my home their home the idea that I'm potentially intermingling my Ducks with wild ducks kind of cool some of you guys might know my agricultural hero Eduardo Sousa his geese that he raises out in Spain they actually crossed with the wild geese and so the idea that I'm setting up my farm here in a way that it's attractive to both the wild ducks as well as my farm ducks that's that's awesome I think that's actually what I'm really aspiring to do here you know sometimes I think people have this dream of making agriculture so that it just produces food or that it just produces profit and that's not exactly what I'm all about you know I talk a lot about this where I want to have a farm that's sustainable from an economic perspective that's sustainable from like an emotional perspective and it's not burning me out and I want to farm though that's sustainable from an environmental perspective too and that everything I'm doing here is in harmony with the natural surroundings and it's not to say that I don't waste and it doesn't mean that I don't create enough garbage because I do plenty of that but it's really all about the fact that what I'm aspiring to do here is create a habitat where the food system and the food production in the economic engine that I have in here also does a positive impact to the animal to the land that's in this area as well you know things are like in harmony and stuff and and I know some people out there are gonna say that that's a pretty hippie dippie aspiration and it's kind of silly to think like that but to me just the proof of having these wild ducks hanging out here in my manmade pond that I dug last year with a friend so flippin gratifying was having a moment here as I was doing my nighttime chores wrapping up and I saw this little display in it made me kind of happy and felt like a little bit of a milestone so I figured I'd share it with you guys the YouTube audience and show you what's going on here if you guys aren't familiar with our farm we do ducks and geese for meat and eggs here we also have a a large permaculture orchard which is an inter planting of chestnuts apple black locust mulberry butternut we've even got a couple walnut trees scattered in there I'm doing a few more things elderberry I got a lot of elderberry and yeah so it's been a project that I've been working on we bought our farm in 2016 planted the permaculture orchard or at least the first wave of it in 2017 I moved up here full-time finally from Washington DC in 2018 we got our first Ducks in 2018 and really got our first geese in 2019 and turned our first profit in 2019 who's a tiny profit like a little baby profit we've got let's see 40 Gosling showing up at the farm that I bought from a hatchery I've got twenty four eggs in that in the brooder right now I also have some work going on right now where I've got some geese trying to hatch out naturally too so really all told I'm hoping to have I don't know maybe 60 ish if I'm really lucky maybe 60 or so goslings on the farm this year raised most of those birds up for meat I also plan to hatch I don't know maybe 100 hundred and twenty ducklings raise a lot of those up for me have another share of those just for eggs and for future stock I got my livestock Guardian dog Toby hey Toby come here come say hi to everybody so we come this is Toby the trainee livestock Guardian dog that we have on our farm so Toby is actually learning to be a guard dog he's not fully a guard dog just yet he is a Maremma is the breed that he is he lives actually out in that shed full-time he's in this little paddock here right now I don't give him completely unsupervised access to the ducks and geese but it's starting to get to be a point where it's mostly unsupervised and he's doing really well with them we have Toby here because we have a predator problems and so we're often contending with that sort of stuff on the regular and so in the name of having some security we got Toby I also have this big grand plan to actually fence in most of this pasture maybe give you an aerial shot so you can get a sense of how far and how extensive I'm talking about with the fencing it's going to be a five foot high welded wire fence we're gonna run electrical hot wires along the top layer as well all in the name of keeping predators out and my goal is that by the end of the summer season I'm able to fully free-range ducks and geese out here in this pasture amongst the permaculture orchard with Toby and maybe another addition of another livestock Guardian dog guarding the premises is sort of the long-term plan we are a small-scale farm and we are starting tiny and slowly if the farm really consists of myself and my wife we've got a couple of friends here and there that we hire to help out with some things but it's really just the two of us we live in this big old farmhouse just the two of us we've been working on fixing that up as well I still work a day job I work remotely which is kind of nice right now so I'm here on the farm full-time but I can't just dedicate all my time to working on the farm so it's a little bit of a trade-off there and for those of you guys who were one and I'm not the type of guy who's like a 10th generation farmer or even a second-generation farmer I grew up in suburbia and Connecticut spent most of my adult life living in East Coast cities like Boston or New York or Washington DC and it really was me getting to this point where I was fed up with city life and ultimately opted to move up here and live a little bit more rural existence in northern Vermont were actually in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom and a tiny little town called Peacham it's about 700 people and it's pretty awesome and so yeah we've been here we're working hard to try to make something of this farm I hope to someday farm full time but it's probably a little ways off I'm learning the skills that I need and getting the practice that I need and screwin up what I need to screw up but doing it on a small scale so that when it comes time to get bigger and really grow the farming enterprise I've got the skills that I need to go at that scale and I guess I also do make regular YouTube videos I'm just the type of person who loves telling a good story and I find that the YouTube videos about the farm are a great way to tell the stories of the farm tell my own personal point of view and it really also try to market the stuff that we're doing here at the farm and show people what we're doing my thinking is that by giving people transparency in sort of the struggle and the lessons learned that we've had with the farm I can hopefully number one inspire more people to try to become small farmers because I think the world does need more small farmers and then number two I can try to build a brand for my farm so that as we have farm products to sell whether they're hatching eggs or goose birds for meat or charcuterie from geese or ducks we have a market for it and you guys if you want to support the YouTube channel you you actually support us by buying our farm products that's kind of what we're all about here at Gould Shaw farm and it's funny I've been talking here right in that bread about ten minutes or so and if I look out there those ducks they're still hanging out which is a good sign that means that they're getting more and more used to me like they keep a little bit of a distance but actually I don't know if you can really see it but that Drake over there the one in the foreground he's sleeping right now he's that comfortable around us so I guess we're doing something right here at Gould Shaw farm we make videos every Monday and Thursday so if you guys want to check this out be sure to subscribe and I'll see you guys in that next video Thanks
