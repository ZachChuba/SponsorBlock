welcome to the Wynn show everyone we've got a fantastic show for you guys this week and I have to apologize in advance this show is in fact live b0 Berrien this qw oh look that's my proof that we are live but beyond that I am cutting off the chat because I have not seen the new Star Wars movie oh and I cannot risk you pieces of human garbage out there who thinks boilers are funny ruining it for do you care that much ah you know what that would be a great topic add it to the wind so document we'll talk about it later in the meantime I need to fill you guys in on what's gonna be on the show today I fix it has done their teardown of the new Mac Pro gives it a 9 out of 10 for repairability fantastic it okay is it safe to assume that Apple has turned over a new leaf no okay of course not we'll talk about that more later Apple Google Microsoft Dell and Tesla have been sued for using child labor yikes the New York Times has done a location-tracking expose basically telling us what we all knew but try not to think about and it's pretty uncomfortable yeah and what else we got here and Apple Amazon and Google unite to create a universal smart home standard we're gonna we're gonna tie that in with the discussion about location tracking yeah it'll be grand you'll love it yeah roll that intro all right went over today I went to look at the chat and I was like oh it's good I Jack a gun no you dad like my scream beat saber tonight I was thinking I might stream tonight I'm just gonna like normally I have the chaton because I take songwriting time just me like yeah whatever Gorillaz lean to mind me I'm doing exactly no QA and our sponsors so Canada supply dot CA got that Ridge well that displayed all right so why don't we jump into this right away now our Mac Pro actually just arrived and spending over twenty thousand Canadian rubles on a computer sorry Mac people that's all it is it's just a computer makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable so I am trying really really hard to get all of our content made so that we can return it within the 14-day window that sounds very important so unfortunately I haven't managed to do like I haven't managed to like tear it down or anything like that because the second it arrived it went on to Anthony's desk and he started running benchmarks although we do have a bit of a problem one of the cool things about the Mac Pro is how highly upgradable it is so we actually went and made our decision making process about the hardware that we were putting in it based on that we knew that it was going to be highly upgradable now Intel did manage to pull some strings and they've gotten me the 20 core 32 15 X or whatever it is okay the top-end 28 core that dice a 24 core before doesn't these are 20 whatever the 28 core processors that the top-end one that Apple ships with the Mac Pro they got me one of those but it's taken a long time and they're only loaner units and they actually haven't shipped to us yet so we're gonna have a span of like between the Christmas holidays and how soon we're gonna need to return the Mac Pro and how late the chips are gonna reach us we're gonna have a span of like two days if we're lucky to actually make all the Mac Pro again to do it because that's that computers more expensive than my car actually no my car is more expensive but like it's more expensive than two of Michael not buy that much yeah and I don't you and I just bought a car a year code yeah there you go that's a bit better like it's not an old car it's more expensive than my car when I bought it in 2013 that's amazing and it was even like a decent used car yeah like what are you driving at ei L Acura TL Acura TL yeah yeah so that's crazy anyway it's also okay I have a little bit of a bone to pick sure not much of one because I don't know how many people are like member on Twitch so you can't touch it on stream nine okay it's a desktop I keep trying to look at the chat right yeah it's a desktop well just because it's a desktop doesn't mean it's repairable repairable technically the garbage can was a desktop did it sit okay but it's like a standard at that format did it go on top of the desk off yes or no we're on the phone often we don't florence okay like a garbage can oh that's a tire on the floor yeah okay was a desk it was a test okay and even previous Mac's have not necessarily been particularly upgradable like we tried to do a teardown of a Power Mac g5 a little while ago and it was a nightmare like the number of special screwdrivers and stuff that you needed and oh well no you can't take that one out until you've done that one right the fact that they actually put enough thought into it - open the case you just twist the handle and pull the whole thing off comes right off the case buttons and LEDs are not attached by cables they're just they're just contact points which is pretty sick and removing the housing cuts power to the machine which is also super sick oh no why are you here it's not live right now yeah we know we know yeah I didn't know that I do oh why are they not live dad I'm not sure but Oh AJ's on it and multiple other people are on it we're working on it okay we have already addressed that to the chat everything is fine okay cool ah neat well I gotta get this out of here before I accidentally read something cool okay um so yeah that is super sick I have actually pitched that design to case manufacturers before like why exactly is it that we have to have these stupid wires like why isn't this just like like contacts because the funny thing is we've seen it before what's their face is it NZXT that was doing it for a little bit with their case fans Oh was it yeah yeah I think so I thought it was them yeah the idea teacher like your fans connect to these little modules oh really short wires and then it just goes together and you know it's got a spring-loaded contact point that's awesome it's a great idea so you would like you would take out like a fan module basically and install your fan in it and the wire for your fan would wire into the fan module so it's all nicely together then you click it into your case and that would run out past it was it was really nice so inside the Mac Pro there's a switch to pop open the open the cover that hides the RAM which is also user replaceable which is a good thing now okay I did see the expose that Apple is using the cheapest memory but I'll give you guys a little knowledge bomb here everyone uses the cheapest memory in commodity desktop systems and once again I'm sorry Mac people it's just a computer this doesn't surprise me at all and it also doesn't particularly matter now the cast latency of those modules was not particularly good but to my knowledge load reduced dims are not known for their exceptional latency they're actually architected significantly differently from normal ECC registered DIMMs so I have a video coming about this where I load up a single motherboard with 2 terabytes of RAM which by the way is a half a terabyte more than the Mac Pro can handle at this time just saying so I load up a motherboard with 2 terabytes of RAM and I go through what makes a load reduced dim different from a regular registered ECC dim because the cold hard truth is you cannot put one and a half terabytes of regular regice memory into a single socket machine the memory controller just cannot handle it so a load reduced to dim allows you to have what is effectively multiple dims sandwiched into a single slot at a greater density than you can do normally so that you know the chips that are on your actual memory module they can have what is effectively sort of multiple like chunks so you can have ones that are like four times essentially four of those chips but like just in one and normally having a bunch of those puts a bunch of extra load on the memory controller with a load reduced dim instead of your memory controller communicating directly with every single one of those chips there's a buffer chip that handles it that's kind of right in the middle of the module and that they all communicate with so it just reduces the load it's I want to say kind of similar to the concept of fully buffered dims from back in the day but without a bunch of the extra heat and power consumption and other issues that fully buffer dims dealt with so there you go there's really no getting around that I don't think but we'll investigate it more once we actually pop ours open and see if even all of them are shipping with the same round because it's quite common for memory to be multiple multiple source look at GPUs yeah GPUs how that all the time the mining community became very aware of that one thing I want to ask you is what do you think about this getting a nine out of ten and having a non user replaceable SSD that is you know what I didn't even think of that but now that you mention it that kind of bugs me cuz like think about yams that are gonna fail on the computer like it's a nine that attend by Apple standards for sure sir for sure yep but not having a way to replace the SSD by yourself because there is a thing over top of it that is bound to a t2 chip blower fans if you remove that you trip the t2 chip it's a no-go yeah and the fact that if your motherboard dies the only ones who can repair it are Apple without you suffering their loss like to me a drive failure is like I mean it should be one of the most user fixable things ever I mean that's a big enough deal personally that that should drive purchasing decisions basically do you think the main motivation behind that behind the TTIP because to be clear unencrypted drive is a great idea it's it's a great way to ensure better security better data security for your customers but the way that Apple does it is entirely unnecessary it doesn't have to be bound to the motherboard by hardware like that do you think the ultimate motivation here is to kill the hackintosh oh because I actually do if there is no way for anyone outside of Apple to change the boot drive of a Mac then there's no reason why anyone should have to download mac OS the only way to get mac OS and now it's going to be on a pre-installed drive all of their Mac OS devices have non-music because their laptops are non user replaceable so I give the hackintosh community like three more years maybe move big goof biggies that's that's sort of my that's my take on this I think that is ultimately what Apple's after here because there is no other reason for them to lock it down like that the the encryption could easily be handled on the drive itself and just just to fully confirm the laptops also have t2 bound SSDs right yes so the one recent machine if I recall correctly that didn't have a t2 chip was a refreshed version of an iMac or something was it shoot I don't remember it might have been it might have been a refreshed iMac non-pro or something like that don't don't don't quote me on that but as soon as Apple has the entire lineup refreshed my assumption is that they are going to start phasing out the ability to install nock OS on your own and they are basically going to be the gatekeepers of Mac OS being installed on how it would be surprised if they had some pretty major update and then remove downloads so like you can't get the major update now yep and just like create separation almost immediately and then push from there yep and the thing is like for a time and hackintosh ORS are used to this for a time you'll be able to run your hack on the older version of Mac OS because even a lot of people with legit Mac's will run an older version of Mac OS like Justine of all people was telling me she's like yeah yeah I know I like never update right away forget forget it yeah o Mac users Windows users we aren't so different are we yeah no that's not a bad idea delaying updates often very good all right so I actually totally agree with you now I hadn't thought of it at all but that is a hundred percent like I would knock two points off for that not being able in the middle of the night not being able to pop a new drive in and reformat my machine and get up and running is a huge problem to me and if it was as simple as Apple having like like hardware DRM built into there compatible drives like I said I've got no problem with drive encryption schemes that that that's good that is that could actually be a user friendly thing so if there was a way to take like a validated Apple approved SSD and pop that thing in there and get my system back up and running yep fine I don't I don't have to like it I don't have to like that it's gonna cost me extra for the special magical Apple one but at least I can i I can accept that that is still user serviceable whereas this is not user serviceable in a way that is a huge problem and I think I think something that you said there was was pretty good and where you were like if you're comparing this apples to apples that was not originally intentional but then I did recognize it before I said it if you're comparing this Apple to Apple maybe the Nano ten okay yeah cuz the case has some really nice features there's some really like single screw removable devices that are safe to be done that way etc held in place by thumb screws frickin there's a lot of cool stuff single switch for the PCIe card so it's a little rail with hooks that secures anything in its path the supply Wow the i/o board video card and power supply all come out from the same side of the case the power supply is held in by a single screw it's freaking awesome very easy to work on gains a lot of points because of that but I think it almost becomes like capped in how high it can go because of the intensity of the negativity around the non user replaceable SSD which is in my opinion one of the most important pieces to be able to replace his laser now the rest of the storage is upgradable can you give them back half a point or a point for that it's better than nothing no is what you get with a macbook yeah but then we're trying not to put the Apple yeah it's a belter on because a normal tower that would just sound even that that would be a feature that's just yank like your car has wheels like I don't know it's $400 for the wheels you know about this right was that the reference no it costs $400 for the wheels for the Mac Pro good yeah that's probably now that's a user upgradeable feature you could go get some wheels yeah put them on some rims on there what's a really big wheels yeah so the good stuff you can remove the cooler and the CPU so the good stuff a fair number of the modules can be swapped without tools uses mostly standard screws and connectors they like I personally think this is a big deal you know Apple created their new magical PCI Express slot with more power pins at the back but then they also have a place to just plug in modular cables and provide power to other cards like there there actually there are certain parts of the computer that it seems like they're inviting you to upgrade and work on like yeah and not just that but it's it's not even like an invitation necessarily an Apple might never intend for any first party card to ever use like a standard you ugly oh wow it's a cable yack you know connector they might never intend for that to happen but at least they're accounting for that it might whereas with the trash can it was like it is so perfectly beautifully engineered all one thing will never you'll never need to touch it again you know unless we provide upgrades all we never provided an upgrade now what so at least they're leaving the door open for you know if Apple gets bored of professional users Jews desktops again at least AMD might have the option of going Oh Apple can we please make a new graphics card for your customers who would really like a new graphics card please Apple can we can we make one and they might be able to say yeah sure go for it and then AMD if they don't feel like it might just be like you know what we're not gonna use the value slot we're just gonna reuse one of our normal designs and put make it output a BIOS on it that makes it Apple yeah yeah the bad weight free public repair manuals and videos that's good okay good okay the bad apple still keeps the keys to certain repairs like proprietary as this deep yeah like we just spent a long time talking about and some of Apple's repairs manuals include or entirely compromised a dis price comprised reading is hard a disclaimer insisting that you contact an Apple authorized service provider when in reality the repair could easily be done you guys I don't blame them for that I don't think that's that bad I think the entirely comprised of is a bit of it you know but they also didn't need to give you that yeah they didn't have to give you that at all that's right so I will retract my my thing I don't actually mind that to be honest if you needed to look in the Apple specific manual about how to do this maybe you should bring it to a repair person maybe you should if you're not comfortable maybe you should there's nothing comfortable working on your twenty five thousand potentially plus dollar computer maybe you should or maybe if your boss isn't comfortable with you working on your absurd fifty thousand dollar machine sure which hopefully they didn't spend fifty thousand because the upgrade prices are terrible so what I was talking about with the SS new thing where like it should maybe drive person purchasing decisions is you could buy a decent one but with like a beast SSD so you don't have to upgrade that in the future but you have upgrade avenues for other parts yep so that's like it's interesting that they did the problem though is that the entry level machine just makes absolutely no sense it's like we paid 20 grand for a computer with an 8 core processor right but you could like do a single GPU or like there's there's a few things you could do yeah I mean or a single card I mean the single card though it's like basically a glorified rx 580 like it's like it'd be nice of your order with no card yeah I've got a crappy video card kicking around yeah Rome I'd like oh by some previous bit I just like nothing yeah I upgraded to RTX I'm just oh yeah l TT stealth hoody is now back in stock in every size and this could be it ladies and gentlemen I am not sure if we are going to keep stalking this one it's been a great mover for us yeah but all good things must come to an end we've had quite a number of people last messaging us saying hey what happened to the swagat when you guys restock in the SWAC and I still don't have a swag and I'm like you ain't getting one because I did time item yeah so it's like there you go ltd stealth hoodie if you guys want one make sure you are getting on top of that also stealth water bottle is back in stock we blew through basically all of these back when we did the stealth bundle so that's why they've been out of stock for a while there you go we've also got of oh wait is the golden black landstalker should I not be talking about that oops sorry that's not in stock ignore it okay [Applause] [Music] early next year black and gold to come back alright oh yeah oh yeah we're gonna do a big one yeah so that'll be cool alright got another great topic for you guys a sort of Apple Google Microsoft Dell and Tesla sued for using child labor so in the first lawsuit of its kind they are being sued on behalf of 14 Congolese families whose children were killed or permanently injured while illegally mining cobalt for electronics made by these companies filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by human rights group international rights advocates the federal class-action lawsuit alleges that the companies aided and abetted a system of forced child labor and had specific knowledge of the conditions these children were working in but did not act in order to protect their profit margins that is not great nope each of these companies has specific policies claiming to prohibit child labor in their supply chains that does in fact make it worse their failure to actually implement these policies to stop forced child labor in cobalt mining is an intentional act to avoid ending the windfall of getting cheap cobalt alleges the international rights advocates in their complaint so cobalt ax is an important component of lithium-ion batteries that get used in many modern electronics in the lawsuit the families argue that their children were illegally working at cobalt mines owned by Gen core the world's largest cobalt producer they then supplied the cobalt to Yuma core a Belgian mining company and metals trader and then Yuma core then provided the cobalt to Apple Google Tesla and Dell they also implicated oh boy I hate it when I have to do this chi-ching oh wow you cobalt a Chinese cobalt producers orange works with Apple Dell and Microsoft wow that's rough so last year the Democratic Republic of Congo produced somewhere between 60 and 70% of the world's cobalt and a third of that was artisanal or subsisted subsistence mining independently done outside of formal employment with a mining company so I guess that's where you might run into yeah trouble there so in the complaint the congolese families go into vivid detail explaining how abject poverty made them desperate enough to work in the mines paying as little as two dollars a day for this dangerous and demanding work in one instance a child went into a gen core owned mine after his family could no longer afford his school fees a tunnel collapsed on him and his body was never recovered according to the lawsuit others have been paralyzed I mean what even is the dollar amount that's right for something like that you know how do you sue for children dying there's there's okay I don't know if this is the right applicable point in time I don't know legal stuff way too much but there's a certain point and I was talking to someone about this the other day when it comes to government construction you know how so this is completely off topic but you know how very often any government construction project goes like way over budget and way over time yeah it blows my mind that at a certain point you don't just go like you don't get that company anymore that's that's ours goodbye gross misuse you're not allowed to be a company hmm I don't know if this is the right guy to do that I don't know if the government construction thing is the right case I don't know if that's a good idea ever but there's at a certain point what if it's like yeah you effectively murdered children you don't get to make large decisions about people's lives anymore oh I see what you mean well I mean that the idea is supposed to be that you go to jail I mean that's suppose what I think the corporation model makes that very difficult yeah so that's true so I see what you're saying so you're saying okay you just wasted you know fourteen million dollars of taxpayer funds you need to be accountable for this in some way instead of us just being like okay well whatever it's taxpayer money anyway and just paying you like you've always I don't know what the answer is right but I've always felt like something more drastic should happen because of how intensely consistent it is right yeah but it happens every time so you feel like if you go millions and millions of dollars over budget on like a public job that it's effectively like stealing from the public yeah cuz is it really different so if we're gonna if we talk about you know and honestly I'm just this is very stream-of-consciousness guys don't think yeah don't hold this against me and I'm very I don't know anything about that industry I'm very likely glossing over things we're just discussing yeah so anyway so so you're basically saying okay well what's the difference between tax fraud or tax evasion where you don't pay taxes or tax wasting taxes that we're already paid if the idea is just that the public purse is the resources that belong to all of us and this should apply not to just to construction that was just a very easy in your face because it's always over budget yeah but I'm sure there are other things that happen government level that are massively over budget they're just not as in-your-face you don't drive by it well yeah like what's-his-face the recently disgraced a head of the Canadian Conservative Party what's his name again can't remember yeah Andrew Shearer had something like this so he was it was first found out that he was using public money to pay for his kids private school okay so that certainly had stole money so well okay but not just that stole money to put his kids to keep his kids from the education system but as a government worker he's supposed to be making oh my god yeah okay just a little bit of like general hypocrisy in there now they're investigating him for somewhere between 700 and 900 thousand dollars of just like personal use of I forget if it was like campaign or donor funds or like just public public money so it's just like really really bad look yeah you step down now they're in trouble they're such a leadership vacuum there it's like between the Canadian Conservative Party and the American democratic party just like yeah you got to find a yeah half of North American politics just has no idea who they should be see yeah yeah anyways I just I've always just felt like and like I've seen software projects going on the same line I'm not trying to pick on the instruction I've seen software projects go down the same we have the okay the difference here it's very fair the difference here is if if we were proposing like a government project I would expect you didn't give me a quote no you would I had no idea you were smart enough to not give me a quote and you did say that you didn't know yeah and you did tell me that the scope of the project was unreasonable and I said well let's give it the old college and you know what if that's the agreement years later yeah finally in beta hey and doing pretty okay we've had some some some stumbles some of which were not our fault yeah you're probably watching this C word I am mad again yeah I'm mad at the Seaview again the only angry emails I have ever sent in the entire time of working on floatplane I've been to only them and I just I think this whole time I'm like they probably think I'm just a jerk I don't think they do because every time you've been mad it's been for a very reasonable thing I hope so like never replying to eat not performing like core functions of their job yeah you had one job come on and if you can't do that job your second fallback job was to notify you you couldn't do that job or respond like I just anyways they know you're mad right now right like they're not gonna find out while they're watching because you know people from there and watch this show right yeah if it's not pretty clear I'm Way too Canadian one of the two because I like tried to make it pretty clear and anyways moving on but like when you are massive massive many hundreds if not thousands of employees company having your last course do this thing yeah for like this is everyday stuff yeah you build bridges you construct massive things like that's what you do and you've been doing it for possibly generations yeah you should probably be a little bit more accurate now stuff can happen sure you can be excavating and it's like we just found t-rex fossils and they're in the way archeologists are gonna be up in this biz for 36 months we can't build a thing and you should have had all this stuff flood we had all these equipment brought in already what are we what are we gonna do and you should have insurance for that oh I see that should be on you and if that increases the cost sure because you know what maybe all this stuff should be more expensive it just shouldn't go over budget I see what you mean okay all right we just derailed yeah we should do spots we were talking about apple girl if the allegations are true that's terrible at this point I can't say that it would surprise me that much for a number of reasons I mean number one is oil that Congo is basically where cobalt comes from and Congo is not known for sorry the Democratic Republic of Congo whatever they call themselves these days they're not known for having stringent labor laws and I don't want to say that if you want Cobalt and the only one producing cobalt is doing it incorrectly that's the only way to get it like you can have policies and you can stick by your policies that you need to be auditing your supply chain on a very regular basis but I will say that it's possible that in a place that is poorly regulated as that that they could clean everything up when the auditor is coming in and you could feasibly not know but if you're following your policies and they are well-conceived ones I would say that there's not really much excuse for not knowing I mean even at our size and with our resources we did manage to track down that one of our employer one of our employees one of our factories that was producing ltte merch was not up to our standards there oh no child labor involved as far as we can tell but the working conditions were not considered acceptable for us so we are currently in the process there there's there's an item that's probably going to be in shortage over the next little bit while we're sourcing a new factory to work with so like if we can do it I think Microsoft and Google can do it better I am technically detached and not even just technically I am detached but I mean I'm wearing the merchant stuff one thing I I think that is super cool as like a customer person we're trying but I'm not gonna say that we're perfect no I could have caught it earlier if we'd been more diligent quite sure perfectly transparent but I still think it's cool it at the very least it was cut off because that almost feels like the remember when we were doing the Sennheiser and armor on tours yeah and we were like no no really you guys got a show that like failure bins right and neither of them wanted to show the failure bins yeah yeah I think just like dealing with that at all I think a lot of companies wouldn't right and the fact that you're letting it go into shortage on the site and doing the work to change the thing I can tell right now that you feel bad because you're refusing to look at me but but at least something was done and I think that's cool maybe it could have been done a little bit faster that was also the first time it's happened I'm assuming uh yeah this is the first time that we've caught anyone so maybe things will be done a little bit more routine like in the future we're gonna try I mean I've talked about this before the reality of it is we are a one-person department right now Lloyd well one in our and and change Lloyd and sort of Lloyd and sort of Nick are the only ones working there and Lloyd has only managed to make one trip back to China we do have some concerns as a media outlet with sending people to China we are working on sourcing not in China in fact not all of our stuff even now is forced in China but getting overseas and having basically you know a week's worth of productivity lost in travel and time zone shifts and stuff like never when you are when you are majority of the team we have it's tough but we are adding another person soon and so what we are hoping is that as we go on we can be more more diligent I think my big thing is I and I can I can feel the feels bad but I think my big thing is most people wouldn't feel bad because they would have never tried I guess yeah I guess that's and like even if you look at like some of those shops online where you can just like design a logo put it on something yeah I guarantee you tons of that stuff is made in shops that would be below most people's shirts yeah and no one checks yeah that's that's fair I think the vast majority of groups would not check I mean especially at that size I think with these guys though especially because they have these policies in place I mean does that to you yes it's a critical personally yes it does make it worse also the size of the companies the amount of people working on the logistics and stuff like that is also a lot more substantial than yeah a one-person crew I do also sympathize with the point that you brought up which is and I have no ydx I don't know anything about the logistics where else you're gonna get cobalt III don't know yeah maybe there is other places maybe there isn't I genuinely have no idea if that's the only place then like I would hope that they would be trying to do something about improving that situation but I also understand that the wheel he needs to keep turning so they're they're the largest producer where's cobalt found in the world usually not mined alone Koba light whatever Democratic Republic of the Congo is listed first mainland China great Zambia friggin great Russia good luck and Australia okay but last I lost really has a lot of mining they also have a I don't know what he's titled over there I'm gonna assume prime minister who's like super away on a vacation in Hawaii while their country burns which is fantastic it's really really cool alright we should probably link in the video description let's read moving on on the show here and take a break from major topics and talk about Star Wars all right let's do it have you seen it no wait no we talked about this already I'm an idiot all right okay have you seen anything about it do you know anything don't if you know anything you could even know if it's like you could supposed to be good I I don't know I haven't watched a trailer I know how you do I don't even know who's in the movie okay io kid I know one person who's in the movie because I could not avoid the headlines about shoes I forget his name I'm not gonna assume the one who lost the script I have not I have seen the headline that they figured out who it was but I didn't click on excited okay yeah well then good I didn't give you any hints that you didn't already have okay so what was your question again do you actually really want to go see it if I actually really wanted to go see it I would have seen it already or I'd be seeing it tonight I don't even have a ticket yeah I don't either now I don't want it spoiled yeah when I get around to seeing it I would like to have the full experience I would like any plot twist have you liked any of the movies that have come out since Disney purchased remind me what they are again yeah the last one awakens is the last one that I bought the blu-ray of that should give you some idea and I only bought it for force awakens because I like wanted to own the whole sequel trilogy and then just didn't end up gave up on that lying yeah I don't even remember what the second one was called to be perfect the last Jedi yeah sure okay and there was Row one I would say rogue one was the best of them but critically flawed yes okay I like that I agree with that to be honest then solo didn't even see solo I eventually watched solo on my phone on a plane and that was all it deserved okay so are you even gonna go see this one yeah I'm gonna go see it okay because my wife will want to go see it even though like she's the that's the funny thing too is she's not okay how do I put this nicely she likes the prequel trilogy more than the original trilogy so to call her like a good Star Wars fan you know like like that like you know what made me appreciate the prequels a lot more yeah the sequels oh yeah okay that's fair with these books really which books for Episode one two and three actually helped a lot really as they go over like what's going in the characters head and stuff and it adds a lot better context and reason so the acting had been better maybe they would have been better more ease right in directing or directing right anything yeah honestly it's the movie wasn't until force awakens that I really gained a proper appreciation for the people's eyes that can rewatch them and I was like at least they were super super imaginative in the 2010s the prequels are a lot stronger than they were when they first came out I don't know necessarily what that means now I'm not gonna dive into that too hard the effects in the VFX in Phantom Menace was not good enough yet Phantom Menace was rough the two and three were a lot better two and three were a lot better okay the dual of fates though was like I did yes and there were pores there were terrible there were terrible bits an attack I actually completely forgot that that Anakin love story crap was an attack of the clones until I asked someone I was like what's that in that one yeah it's well that makes sense it would have to be that's horrendous oh okay so that that sucked but another thing too is at least there was sort of a cohesive story yeah I have no idea what's going on and I shouldn't have to read books to know what's going on in a movie and I'm not afraid of reading books but I think the Marvel movies do an amazing job of this if you want to read the Supplemental or the supplementary literature cool additional information you can not required but you don't have to you don't need to go read a novel about Pym particles in order to you know have any idea what's going on in the movie yeah yeah I excited but not so actually excited is the am I actually excited but I'm afraid to be excited okay I want it to be good but I don't understand how it can possibly be good what is really everything that's happened in the previous two movies has kind of been nothing it's like watching Arrested Development so here's an additional question yeah do you want to go see it or do you feel obligated I want to want to go see it I was the kid so you feel obligated am i my copy of the essential guide to vehicles and vessels the essential guide to weapons and technology the essential guide to characters my copies of those books like literally Star Wars encyclopedia volumes were so dog-eared that like they didn't like you know when but the two corners fan out to like almost double the thickness of the actual book from having the pages slipped so many times like I was such a Star Wars kid I read so many of the books I I remember this one time my sister creased one of the pages in one of my caught one of my pristine books in my full series of copies of the young Jedi Knights collection have you read those by any chance not the young Jedi Knights I have since read a lot of Star Wars books and like I'm usually constantly having one they're written for adolescents so the writing level is not particularly high but I would say they did a way better job of character development and some kind of plausible ongoing story arc for Han Leia and Luke and like the their offspring and all that so you know Luke never ends up finding the right person and settling down he he he just opens a Jedi School I think it's on Yavin 4 so where the old rebel base was Leia and Han are like off doing whatever it is that they do in government and whatever the crap you know Hans kind of uncomfortable with being settled like it's it's written by a Kevin Anderson and who's the other one Rebecca something I can't remember but they've done a bunch of Star Wars literature so it ties in really nicely with the old EU that's now dead more than one EU that's dying as I said it and and at anyway the kids are attending Luke's school and you know they actually have to train to be Jedi they're not just magically Jedi overnight like yeah you know you know it was really really sad I watched the interview with Mark Hamill when he's reading the script for the force awakens yeah and he'd the whole time he's like this is this is exciting I'm really excited for my big entrance basically and you can understand like that's not even a pretentious thing really Haizlip freaking Skywalker sky work yeah we're all excited for his big entrance him included that's great and he's reading through and he gets to the the fight I was gonna say duel but the fight between Finn Rey and I've heard his name because I don't even care kylo and when the win the lightsabers like stuck in the snow and it starts to shake it's like he's like this is it this is when I come in and then he's like I read that Rey caught it I was just like what she didn't train on Dagobah and like the thing that drives me nuts about that is that was like his signature thing sorry I don't want to get into this too much um my next fallout question is have you watched Mandalorian I don't have Disney Plus so so no I totally have Disney Plus Bry my own subscription and I'm not using someone else's subscription for Disney Plus okay go ahead it's great is it okay it's not perfect there's parts where you're like that are kind of funny there's also a few parts that you're like lore wise that makes no sense at all but they're not that bad okay though those parts of it are really not that bad there's parts of the show that are just freakin adorable right there are parts of the show that are epic some of the fight scenes are fantastic some of them not quite as much but like understanding that it's a TV show it's great so it is the first piece of content from Disney Star Wars related yeah that I've been like yeah this is sick and I have now watched not all of the episodes but the vast majority of them yeah and I'm like really excited to finish off what is currently available and then watch the last episode when it comes out okay alright alright I will consider watching it I have a harder time picking up TV shows they are such a big time commitment they are like it's this one is this one is I think only ten episodes like I decided to watch Dark Crystal and then it was like you know a week's worth of not going to bed on time and being tired it just it kind of sucks like it kills my productivity good night Nick well are you out all of next week yeah most we're gonna Friday you're what we're in on Friday okay okay bye yeah so so back to oh shoot where was I gonna go with that have you seen the like 45 minute thing of all the times Mark Hamill talked about Star Wars what I'm talking about Star Wars it's so great I didn't watch the whole thing that's great I did watch some of it yeah I watched almost the entire thing and it's just like it's his his opinions on a lot of this stuff is so in my fans fan yeah and it's not often that you can say that like there's a lot of Hollywood phonies out there oh yeah I do not get that vibe from Mark Hamill at all no at all because I really he has respect for people who are great at their jobs he calls out people who he thinks are not great at their jobs he just seems to be actually an honest guy and as a kid who loved Luke Skywalker being able to grow up and be an adult who loves Mark Hamill is sort of like you can't expect that to happen more than a couple times a generation it really just doesn't happen that often where people in person are asked as worthy of being looked up to as they are on screen when they're playing a character and something I'll say too is about cuz I've been watching the Mandalorian with my with my girlfriend yeah and it's been fun cuz she we pause it a lot and she asked a lot of things about like the lore behind different stuff that that isn't pushed in your face in the show there's a lot of I don't want to spoil too much I'm not gonna say any actual events there's a lot of fanservice that isn't shoved in your face right okay there's a lot of stuff where you can like recognize what that thing is but they don't like address it and go super far into it but right they lead you enough down the path that there's enough context clues that you're like oh yeah right that's that thing from whatever that's super cool right um so it's been fun to like answer those things for but my favorite thing about the show so far go ahead find those things kind of bother me though cuz it's like a gigantic it's a galaxy like if it's like an object the odds of it like showing up there okay I don't want to get too far into it because usually like a category that we haven't necessarily seen in the movies much sure there might be in the games or the EU um I've really really enjoyed how they've handled characters right all that and not just like there's a ton of characters that I do not like in the new Star Wars movies one of the ones that I find most egregious is the stormtrooper Captain phasma yeah they could have done so many cooler things with her she's a super badass in Game of Thrones and then she's just like barely there and then gets beat in a super lame fight I think it's a fan I'm not trying to ruin Game of Thrones she's the actress Oh like she can clearly do amazing things and then they relegate her some boring stuff anyways the captain what is it kept in Huck's I don't remember his pre name thing but Huck's I have only I only watched the second one once I only saw it in the theater that was it this guy oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah the first mover like socks yes because he's so incompetent yeah the Empire was really scary at no point time I've ever been like oh no the first order just doesn't make any sense and like one thing that I really like in Mandalorian is the enemies are like there's times where you're genuinely concerned and you not like it's obviously good but whatever you're like okay ow yeah all right that one is scary I'm worried too now and like that's cool yeah and the good characters there's like reasons yeah you know and like it's just I think the writing just seems so much stronger yeah same guy that did the animated series oh ok which I know you liked a lot yeah so it's not too surprising that I liked it I have no idea how much people do or don't like this topic because I have no way of checking the chat so if you guys hated it sorry about that and if you liked it sorry about this cuz we're gonna move on to the New York Times location-tracking expose the New York Times has published an expose on the personal location tracking industry after spending months reviewing a tranche of data comprising a billion data points from 12 million Americans in several cities so this file represents just a small slice of what's collected and sold every day by the location tracking industry they can see the places you go every moment of the day who you meet with or spend the night with where you pray whether you visit a methadone clinic a psychiatrist office a massage parlor or a massage parlor and right now it is perfectly legal to collect and sell this information in the United States with no federal law limiting the vast and lucrative trade of human tracking so only internal company policies and the decency of individual employees prevent those with access to the data from stalking in a strange spouse or selling the evening commute of an intelligence officer to a hostile foreign power no I mean you could probably make a treason argument there when the time comes but I mean it's been I don't remember the last time someone actually got convicted of treason like isn't the penalty for it still technically being put to death I'm not actually sure about don't know anyway companies that collect this information justify their business on the basis of three claims people consent to be tracked the data is anonymous yeah sure and the data is secure let's walk through that shall we consent usually you allow location data because you think it's integral to the function of an app like a weather app for example but the seduction of these consumer products is so powerful this is a quote from the article is so powerful that it sort of blinds us to the possibility that there's another way to get the benefits of the technology without the invasion of privacy anonymity yes the location data contains billions of data points with no identifiable information like a name or a social security number or an email address but it's once you have so much data it's really easy after the fact to connect real names to the dots that appear on the maps like who else would sleep at your house every day I mean all right maybe I shouldn't mass and then lie to your exact job yeah every day etc etc etc like you're gonna narrow it down to like a tiny handful of people immediately yes and then with a very minimal like I'm talking half our max amount of work beyond that you can probably figure out the exact person yeah how do we how do we stop this I don't know I don't know this is beyond me because there are services that legitimately I would be disappointed to not have anymore that do rely on would notably negatively impact your life and reduce your competitiveness against other humans yes that makes sense yep yep because you'd be less efficient yep like I just I'd be more likely to get into an accident if I had to key in the address in my GPS instead of Google Maps just being like hey you usually go here on Monday night you're more likely to one button not get the contract or a job or deal or whatever if you're late because you're you didn't know that there was traffic too bad buddy tell me there's good news Antony sure is there to the hack Pro oh no okay okay yeah anything else Christmas have a great holiday bye so a location data is also collected and shared alongside a mobile advertising ID an anonymous identifier about 30 digits long that allows businesses to combine location traits with other information like your name home address email phone number or even an identifier tied to your Wi-Fi network data companies say users consent to tracking when they agree to share their location but those consent screens rarely make clear how the data is being packaged and sold so current law by law companies need only describe their practices in their privacy policies which tend to be dense legal documents that few people read and even fewer can truly understand the truly understand parts quite important the California Consumer Protection Act goes into effect next year and adds new protections for residents they're like allowing them to ask companies to delete their data or prevent its sale buyers are typically data brokers and advertising companies and also include financial institutions geospatial analysis companies and real estate investment firms I would be surprised if insurance companies aren't in there as well they might pay more than a million dollars for a tranche of data absolutely fascinating so tell me something Luke how much location data does floatplane collect from its users technically IP logging would have some amount of location data built into it but do we log it I don't think so keep it yeah let's make sure we don't we get longer than like we yeah we log IP data for a certain amount of time because we're trying to detect attacks and various other thing this stuff is brutal man like how can we accept this but then how do we go back to not having it I don't know the answer like I don't actually want legislators to come in and like make it illegal to collect it I just wish they couldn't sell it but then okay if they couldn't sell it there's would they would I have to pay for every app on my phone again do we go back to I'm okay with a $2.00 app do you want go back to do me out let me pay for apps interesting I'm actually tired of this I like very tired of this I sort when I every once in a blue moon when I'm like oh what are what's going on the App Store I'd which doesn't happen that I was gonna say not only not nearly as often as it used to happen yeah I the gills no paid store interesting I don't want more free apps I don't want more junk on my phone I don't wanna figure out in six months they're doing something terrible I don't want to do with the ads I don't want to deal with micro transactions I don't wanna deal with all this stuff so basically let me pay for your thing you're a grown up with a job now sure because Luke I met nine years ago or whenever the heck it was he would have wanted the free app he'd have been like he'd been like I'm gonna root my phone and I'm gonna I'm gonna turn on but I would have a tree data that way see ya rob them of their location data what I'm gonna take root of the out and then I would have gotten the page that's right baby yeah that's the loop that's the loop that I fell in love with okay but I would have gotten me paid app oh okay so okay what if you couldn't what if you could get the free app but you could just tack out all the adverts and I'm I'm not I might still there might be a reason why I don't have to hunt for new apps all time and I don't pay for Disney Plus know the time has changed I mean I know that you're on my google play music [Laughter] family Jake asked me like last night I think if I wanted to join him on like a title subscription or something and I was like no and he's like why I was like well I technically have it for free right now through Linus and he's like what and I'm like yeah I don't worry about it he's like well this one's higher quality stuff to me one that I was like but it's free right now I'm gonna go with that one I'm gonna have to kick you off it eventually okay so we don't we don't currently do IP logging KJ says that we should but we would be Auto cleansing the logs after a certain minutes okay just not sure but we do partner with CloudFlare who does okay and then but we don't have that data it's accessible to us through the CloudFlare dashboard I see okay but I'm pretty sure that's important allow us to do anything with it no we don't sell it we don't do any that kind of stuff but we do use it for very important things that's exactly the problem that we're running into here is that there are very important things that as a consumer and as a business owner I value that make it important to collect this personal information then there's also a consumer I don't want people just doing whatever they want with it it's Wild West right now there's also issues with me like you can't sell it thing yeah because like if you look at something like discord don't like oh we don't sell that kind of stuff but you look at who owns them yeah and if they use it internally and with their partners which is I think how they worded I remember exactly it's been a long time but they do say like we share it internally within our company it's like okay so you're sharing it with 10 cent also known as a wild amount of companies yeah like okay so where does the like linking of companies thing stop the selling of data yeah because you're not selling it you might not sell the data but you might sell the whole company sure that - yeah spooky in other news we've got I think one more thing that we promised to get through with you guys Apple Amazon and Google unite to create a universal smart home standard IKEA is involved - so is signified which is Philips hue and Samsung you know what there you go whatever if you want to hear more about this you can go watch it on Flo point now is cover the app store that you read our work it's it's not yet but it's coming on monster that took way too much work oh my goodness if your word on my team this was not my idea I don't think I'd like you as much I approved it but I'm complicit yeah so the app will be on the App Store that's all I'm saying [Laughter] yeah it'll be great what is it 24 hours I don't know I don't have an iOS device on me right now I'm gonna take my iphone home this week it can take up to 24 hours before your app becomes available on the App Store unreal okay so one one thing that we will say is your login on iOS has to be a floatplane official login connected accounts will not work on the App Store yet they will come later that's because Apple didn't want us to have external login methods if we didn't or also have login I doubt that they'll sign with Apple there's no problem we will support that eventually it's just gonna take some work to get there and they were not okay with the app being on the store if it didn't have that so once we support signing with Apple which is going to take some work again we will add in the other connected account sign in options that being said if you have a connected account sign in you do also have a floatplane sign it what you're going to need to do is log in on the main site on a different device or on your computer and request a password reset because it's garbled look right now because you're using a connected account right set your password and then you can log in with the connected account or your native floatplane account so you're totally fine just use your native floatplane login and then we'll add that functionality later but yeah that's that's the only thing that's missing from the iOS version is the connected account login you know what's cool a lot of people have hated on the floatplane name but for better or for worse it's pretty good folks are not taken yep I searched for floatplane on the App Store where if I search for like flashlight app there's literally thousands thousands of results there's any results so this is flight plan which I think will have no problem taking over once you know something that actually called floatplane is up yeah there's fit track and aviation app that lets you track your flights and my plane seaplane experience the thrill of flying your own seaplane as you take off and land on water fleet plan fleet plan edocs dhc-2 beaver sticker app what even is that and fit logic so you know what there you go the advantage to picking something that everyone else thinks is kind of meaningless and stupid is that nobody else has done it yet yeah there's a there's a YouTube there's a guy that works on a YouTube channel that I've been talking to for a little while now about some various things and he was talking about how they they were performing a lot stronger than they are now and a notable part of the reason is that a really big musician released a song with the same name as their channel and now on youtube if you ever search it it's just the song every time and then all the remixes and covers of the song and like with lyrics and everything else yeah so like that sucks that sucks real bad yeah what do you do at that point they're in a really tough spot like it's pretty rough oh wow and like that's probably not the only reason no there's other reason but that's definitely contributed that's not helping yeah I mean when people can't find your channel by searching for the name of the channel that's rough yeah yeah yeah so that that hurts speaking of channels the the response to floatplane going into beta was huge this week's been not everyone hoping it's done a great job that there was some crazy stuff that need to be handled and it was handled very well I think internally good job everybody yeah fantastic we definitely did have some outages but they're for good we figured it out yeah we yeah we figured it out not not necessarily like I didn't who should have oh I didn't mean that oh that you mean the c-word come yeah yeah yeah yep and look I'm not saying it's like a swear word no no no C word just is like you know a word yeah got a C in it yeah it was it was a it was a crazy week for a lot of very good reasons one thing that was kind of fun got in it [Laughter] one thing that was kind of fun was a lot of users thought that they needed to apply to join the site as a user yeah so we got a lot of like dating app style applications and because the creator application form has a tell me about yourself section which is more like tell me about the content you may get cetera but when it's a user signing up it becomes like long walks out like cetera that's adorable yeah that was those kind of key we could have messaged that better probably guys probably there was you know we're new to this stuff still learning so I had to send a lot of emails being like thanks a ton but here's where I think you're probably trying to get to so yeah sorry about the navigational issues there but yeah it's been great we have a actually a very large amount of really awesome creators have died that's like kind of overwhelming like we thought when we started this that we were gonna have to lean on like you know me building personal relationships with creators and then like being like hey by the way we like do this thing do you want to help us sort of get it kick-started by joining but actually the amount of positive buzz aside from the handful of very vocal haters on the project the amount of positive buzz that's going on behind the scenes like the number of multi-billion dollar companies that are aware of what Luke and the team are doing and are like hey what's going on over there aside yeah interesting it's cool yeah do you have any idea when that interview we did is gonna go up no me neither I should have asked no idea yeah are you interesting yeah I'll be fun hopefully we don't look like idiots hopefully we do and then we catch everyone by surprise their pants down anyway pants down I've got to go home and take my pants off because I'm on vacation for a week don't worry they'll still be videos and I'm not really on vacation I have like I have to go visit all of my like four families because my family is a fractured divided mess but that's neither here nor there he's a cleaning your garage was vacation I think that still means that's a vacation no cleaning my garage is pre therapeutic I'm not gonna dive into that anymore thanks for watching the show everybody yeah I did that once on vacation I was pretty Wow that's house terror I actually like why would you do that so that I'm looking for a red piece I can find one [Music] yeah those brought to you by old Canada supply display original wallet
