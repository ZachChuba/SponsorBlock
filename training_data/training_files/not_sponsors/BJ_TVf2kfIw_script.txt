sponsored by brilliant now I'm not a minimalist I try not to buy too many things but I often buy the wrong version of a thing once or twice before finding the right one and that piles up but it does mean that come Black Friday and Cyber Monday or the long turkey weekend or just what I call it now November I have a pretty good tried-and-tested idea about what I want to give and get going into the holidays and then I just have to stick to my list look for the best prices possible and hit the Buy button for the best prices part I keep it locked to my friends and colleagues over at thrift or calm I work with them every day so I get to see firsthand just how hard they work especially this time of year like around the clock hard and no this isn't paid endorsement it's ah so I'm just gonna link up all their 24/7 round ups in the description you're welcome as to the list I'm Rene Richie and this is vector the latest air pause might have just gone pro but the standard second generation air pods have also been going on sale regularly priced at 159 for the regular case if you were yours don't need interchangeable tips water resistance or noise cancellation you should be able to find some pretty good deals on the air pods - like 129 dollars good and if you were yours do need all the air pod bells and whistles canceled you might just be able to find a few bucks off the pros as well back in September Apple dropped the price on the series three watch to make it the most affordable entry-level wearable they'd ever offered $199 coming up though it looks like it's gonna be dropping even lower much lower around one hundred and twenty nine dollars and that just makes it the perfect gift for anyone who just wants to try out and start off with a SmartWatch if you or someone you love really needs all the potentially life-saving features like fall detection international emergency calling and the ECG app then the latest series 5 watch models have already started seeing some small discounts as well just over a month ago Apple took the entry-level iPad 2 well less than an inch shy of 11 and added smart keyboard support as well that made it both a bigger canvas for touch and drawing but also a better tool for typing all for the same starting price of 329 come the sales though you should be able to get it for a bit less quite a bit less around 249 put the savings towards an Apple pencil or keyboard seriously for faster processors and better displays you can move up to the smaller iPad Mini 5 or the slightly bigger iPad air 3 for much better processors and bigger displays as well as USBC you can move all the way up to the iPad pro the deals will probably be a little thinner but the smiles will be ever so much wider sure go ahead dunk on Siri all day long but the home pot is legit one of the few audio devices in the world that you can drop into any room and immediately start enjoying amazing sound no matter where you drop it or where you're located relative to it typically $2.99 we've already seen it for $1.99 and it isn't even Black Friday yet sure a home pot of many would be nice but a maxi at this price is nice enough for now you may be able to find some discounted similar unlocked iPhones out there but let's be real the big deals have and will continue to come from the carriers we've been seeing those already as well so if you've got a fresh phone coming up pay extra close attention to which carrier is offering what exactly both to stay and to switch and grab the best deal for you if you or your loved ones have your heart set on a new Mac you'll be able to find some turkey time deals on those as well we've already seen some thin thin savings on the brand new 16 inch macbook pro and there might just be better deals on other macs as well just make sure you know what specs you need going in so you don't sell yourself short just to buy quick there are a ton of great accessories out there as well including the distance smart battery cases for the iPhones 11 they're a great way to increase the already astounding battery life for the special iphone user in your life they may not go on sale so quickly but keep an eye open and move fast if you do see them i've also just updated my personal everyday carry list the one with all of my favorites i'll link to that in the description below as well i'm sure a bunch of that stuff like the blisteringly fast samsung x5 SSD will go on sale if it has already gifts are not the Providence of Apple alone so Nintendo switch is absolutely also on my list especially now that pokemon sword and shield are out I prefer the just updated classic switch to the gist release which light though because the light doesn't actually switch fingers cross will be able to save enough to make the difference negligible anyway your best bet might be to look for bundles even just games either way you're the one who's gonna come out as a winner or if and thanks all of you for supporting the show there are many lists out there others will have their own lists this one is mine that's everything I'm gonna be keeping it locked to from my pals at drifter to find the best deals on through Black Friday into the holidays and onward now I want to hear your list what you're giving and hoping to get so we can crowdsource and even bigger better list together hit like if you do share a few care subscribe if you haven't already then door crash that Bell gizmo so you never miss a show and hit up the comments and let me know what are you giving and what are you looking to get thanks for watching and see you next video
