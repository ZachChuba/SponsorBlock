it out there's a link in the description Dungeon Master player characters I think these can be sometimes the plague of really bad D&D games I read an RPG Horror Story a little while ago called all aboard the Dragon Age railroad and it's hilarious and a really great example of games I personally really don't like to play oftentimes in D&D games we can organize the NPC's into four five four categories patrons allies villains and neutral patrons are people that give things to the party so they're willing to give up certain things to help them so for example a shopkeeper or a town guard with information something like that an ally is somebody that travel at the party to accomplish a similar goal or to help them or for their party to help them accomplish something a villain is somebody who actively opposes the party and neutral NPCs are the random wandering old man who seeks to give wisdom to wandering adventurers who don't know where the nearest dungeon entrance is but there's one of these that you really shouldn't put in your game and a lot of people end up putting in their game or unintentionally do and they're called I like to call them heroes or D NPC's this is basically a party member disguised as an NPC the DM likely has a character sheet for them and they act of their own volition and travel with the party I call them heroes because that's what they are these hero and PC pretty much take everything away from your players and shouldn't be included in your games at least that's what this little sick boy has to say let's create an example so in cursive Strada the players can encounter an NPC by the name of esmeralda she is a vampire hunter lady that lives in crest she also wants to defeat straughn and her backstory kind of revolves around straw and burrow via and she can join the party and help them defeat straw would this not make her a hero or a DMP see ah no first of all she's completely optional the players don't even have to encounter her she's actually in a very specific part of one dungeon and if they find her then she's in the game and even then they have to convince her to join them quote from the book if the characters seem committed to fighting straud she abandons her plans and offers to join forces with them the problem with the NPC's is that they don't need the party they could do this adventure all on their own and are only helping the party because they are just such a good guy sure allies the NVC type can be more powerful than the player characters but that doesn't mean they have to share the same motivations if you have an NPC in your game that makes the players heroic accomplishments completely meaningless you've got a problem think for a second if you're a DM and your players do not exist in your world what would happen if your answer is that the world would be completely screwed then good job you did it okay plus you get a gold sticker from me it is realistic to have another group of people accomplishing the same exact goal that the players trying to accomplish but it isn't fun at all imagine imagine the Lord of the Rings and Frodo and Sam are taking the ring to Mordor to destroy it and unite middle-earth and then they find out that there are two other hobbits who are also delivering a ring to Mordor that if thrown into the fires of Mount Doom will also unite all the kingdoms of middle-earth then what the [ __ ] are photo and Sam even doing unless your party is completely evil and their whole plan is that they want to screw over everything and even then I don't think that's a very fun campaign to play in villains especially can have the DM PC complex where they are effectively heroes in the DM z-- mind but are painted to be bad guys so that they can oppose the players this is a really big problem - basically the villains are the dm's baby so they never die they have a god complex and they always outsmart the players and the players can never defeat them and they feel useless morning Canaan morning Canaan himself he's in cursive Strada he's there and the players can find him and even then all-powerful Morden Canaan is like mmm can't kill Strad he's way too powerful and we'll all die they have to convince him to join them and even then he's kind of reluctant about it the NPC can be a super powerful epic cool guy but it doesn't matter if they just go don't worry I'll join you because I'm going to do the right thing no that's the players job the players job is to be the heroes and to defeat the bad guy and do all the cool stuff there isn't some other random guy who joins them in good news from the DM the that's the players job the cool part about curse of strata in particular and why I'm using it is such an example is it does a really good job at making the heroes feel like heroes because there are tons of people in the past who have died from killing straud and what's great is that the players are the only ones who actually make progress so anyways this video is just about basically making your players feel like heroes and not making them feel like they're just big dumb idiots who are walking around doing nothing whatsoever and there's these other cool guys who are doing all the stuff that's the biggest thing I think you should apply this to your games if you want your players to have a little bit more fun or at least stop putting D NPC's in your games you can have allies and allies are basically characters NPCs who have to be convinced to work with the party or they have completely different motivations but you can't have all in the same because that should just be another character and you're the dungeon master and you're not a player you're a player at the table because here's the dungeon master but you're not another player as in like I get to play another character kind of person anyways that's the end of the video I'm going to keep ranting about this for another hour if I don't stop I'm gonna be sick getting drinks of dayquil and play at Jedi fallen order also go check out nerd Archy
