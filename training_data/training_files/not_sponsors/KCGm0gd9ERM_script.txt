this video is sponsored by Squarespace everyone Conor rank was chair about a month ago I got a text from my good friend will someone you might know from he does it with podcast he texted and I quote Pixar movies feel like movies to me Ghibli movies feel like I'm being told a story and actually shown the world that takes place in if that makes sense I love Pixar but I don't know there's a genuine magic to Ghibli for me now at a first glance as a die-hard Pixar fan this really grinded my gears I was like you have the nerve to come into my facebook Messenger app and and come at me with this with this this message and then I realize you don't want Carsten hey calm down calm down it's all good let's think about this I've seen this beef online a few different times Pixar vs. Ghibli and it's always left me automatically answering well Pixar but as of recent after seeing more Ghibli films and after wills argument it's left me second-guessing listen they're both amazing companies and comparing them isn't going to change my appreciation for them but I still think it's worth doing so so with that being said buckle up and get ready to be offended by me lightly criticizing your favorite company in this week's episode Pixar vs. Ghibli one of the most important parts of any animated film were you using all of your imagination is world building some of my favorite animated films are those that take the time to take you into the mind of the filmmaker when looking at Pixar they definitely do this but it could be a bit better when I watch a Pixar film it feels like I'm stepping into a Pixar film not that specific film there are a few exceptions though Monsters Inc Finding Nemo and Coco all stand out as being incredibly immersive and definitely take their worlds into consideration I hesitate to add Finding Nemo though because it's similar to other Pixar films plays off of the real world rather than asking the what-if questions Pixar is just kind of like yeah this is this is what though she would look like aside from maybe the school scene everything feels like it lacks a sense of childhood wonder hey this isn't a problem though Finding Nemo is still one of my favorite films of all time I think it's great I think it does everything just fine it just feels like the worlds that come out of Pixar aren't exactly as magical as those that come out of Ghibli you see Studio Ghibli is on like another level when it comes to world building like will said watching a Studio Ghibli film is never just a casual thing it's immersive its detailed it feels like I'm not even watching a movie you look at maybe their most critically acclaimed film spirited away and you find it hard to believe that what you're watching isn't a real place in the world the way the characters interact with the setting the way the animation is able to perfectly capture wind sweat etc it just feels like you're there not only is it immersive it's also just a lot more magical no matter your age it truly feels like you're a kid again when you're watching a Ghibli film so with that being said when it comes to world building I'm gonna have to give it to similar Ghibli when it comes to animation I feel as though character writing is an extremely underlooked aspect while being brought into the world is essential I feel so connecting to the characters in said film is just as important this is something I really have to give Pixar props for Pixar is phenomenal at everything they do but I think they shine the most when they're talking about character's story and emotion when you look at characters like Woody and Buzz and lightning McQueen and wall-e and Sully the list goes on they all feel like they're the faces of the animation industry and even the faces of Hollywood and the craziest part they're just animated characters but the thing about Pixar is they make them out to be more than just animated characters what they truly understand is emotion while they may seem as though they've gotten a bit manipulative with this ability as recent there's no denying that they know how to make you connect to a character Studio Ghibli does this as well they know how to make you cry and connect to a character when you need to they just do so with a bit more subtlety while Pixar presents you with the characteristics of the character from the outside and tackle things that way Ghibli attempts to put you in the shoes of the character while dribbly is undeniably pretty good at this I just don't think they're nowhere near as good as Pixar in an attempt to put me in the shoes of the protagonist when I'm watching a Ghibli film I often get lost and and start to fantasize about the world I'm in I'm not thinking about the protagonist as much as I'm thinking about all the cool things that are happening around them I'd like to add that I haven't seen every single Studio Ghibli film I'm sure there are a ton out there that actually do nail this pretty well but my point is Pixar seems to get it right every single film so I'm gonna have to give this one both Ghibli and Pixar are at the top in their field when we're talking about the animation industry Pixar succeeds with every film at depicting the real world through animation in incredibly detailed ways you look at their most recent work like The Incredibles 2 and it's like you're watching a real head of hair bounce around it's exciting to see how far they can go and watching the real world blend with imaginative animation in a smooth and entertaining way on the other hand you have Studio Ghibli they approached animation in a different way while at the same time coming across just as exciting as I mentioned earlier the way at which the animation captures things like the wind water food etc it all feels incredibly realistic they strip away the details and focus on the aspects of real life that make it what it is the do companies approach animation in two completely different ways so it feels wrong to compare them in that aspect and in fact it feels wrong to compare these companies at all see I think comparing the two is fun and it's worth discussing from time to time but at the end of the day it just feels kind of pointless both Pixar and Ghibli are amazing companies that I love but they just approach their work in different ways they're so different that the only thing they really share is a love for animated storytelling when I look at Pixar I see a company that has a passion for storytelling and studying character they delve into what it means to be human on a level that is not only enjoyable for all ages but is also beneficial Pixar is able to take complex ideas on life Society whatever and incorporate them into a fun and incredibly memorable way looking at Studio Ghibli they aren't necessarily doing the same thing in some films they don't shy away from the fact that they're dealing with heavy subject matter some films are best for children and others are best for adults Ghibli doesn't have the same goals as Pixar Ghibli is focusing on experience and a love for imagination they perfectly capture what it means to be free in your mind and have no limits they take the world and go what if this existed what if it did that it's an incredibly unique and exciting way of telling stories that millions have latched on to when you have two companies that are essentially aiming at two very different goals you can't really compare them they have both broken so many barriers and pushed animation forward as well as filmmaking in general so let's just shut up sit down and enjoy these movies if you're wondering which company I like better the answer is neither you know my watching check out Squarespace and I will see you guys in the next one [Music]
