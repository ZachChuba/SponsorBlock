so so why was there every screen and a button now the screen is the button or is the screen not the button i don't know maybe we'll find out when we are compacted like tuna fish so i guess we are ready we have a screen so let's look at the [ __ ] screen see no buttons so what do we know we know el rubio's compound is on the south side of the island we know the files are locked in the safe which is in the basement and we know the basement is accessible from an elevator from el rubio's office which is on the top floor of the main building ow mr madrasa look at this [ __ ] [ __ ] oh man i mean this is [ __ ] cool this is some space age [ __ ] man where we are going we will be far away from space as humanly possible now i kind of wish i was going with you guys but you put a ring around a general right first rule of war i mean look at this [ __ ] it's [ __ ] what do these do floods do both okay now just to be clear all i give a [ __ ] about are the files so as long as i get those by any means necessary you'll get paid anything else you brought from that son of a [ __ ] is just more money in your pocket the more we hit el rubio where it [ __ ] hurts the better huh okay mr madrazo we should set off shortly cool yeah cool uh just wanted to say real quick uh i didn't have to come here today i was having like a really good time but uh i wanted you to know that i'm a modern leader i i've done the hard work on myself and i'm gonna be there for you because i respect you and um i'm here for you now okay so go get him team okay uh i'm gonna head back to the club see if i can pry my mother out of the dj booth uh you can make the drop at my house in vinewood hills good luck my god they just keep getting younger and dumber well i guess we're as ready as we're going to be yeah shall we do this capitan one day i too will go up the ladder but not today so here we are at last be planning the espionage the late nights of red caviar and scheming it comes down to this i tell you one thing mr royo is i have your position i will also access compound cctv to see you when you are there alright see you in midnight uh excellent did i ever tell you about the sewers in my hometown it was there i first decided to join the navy perhaps it will have the same effect on you we'll see is it i have two operations in the same way now we look for the vault maybe start in the central building watch foreign he has a fingerprint scanner too all right we found the usual plan cycle through the partial prince to match the target print and the tool will do the rest you are true now let us just hope he has not changed the combination looks like good name safe in our hands bad news they have sealed the drainage pipe you will need to look for another way out of there out there well done the compound is done the only thing left to do is escape carry on like this and they will never know you were there your extraction point is at the main docks on your river now um i have something to report mr robios just asked for his private attack helicopter and a minigun and two pounds of cocaine this would be a good time to leave i think so based on my experience and intuition i think mr rubio knows that something is up it um to be selective with your looting if it is too heavy it will slow you down perhaps too much so how did our little water trick go down hola hold on the water is full of attack boats you will need to be careful oh god oh but there is something out there hold it right there okay you're good to go hey you made it hope everything went to plan mr madrazo only got back from the club a few hours ago i probably set a new record for overtime yeah we're good here look at this the perfect end to a party the survivors we've been going pretty hard it's been emotional why don't you sit down and stop making a fool of yourself evan i don't even know who she is we spent a week together in tulum [ __ ] come on let's go sit over here [ __ ] come come see so success think [ __ ] excellent [ __ ] wait till my dad hears about this hey hey dab uh yeah no this will be quick i just wanted to let you know that that strickler thing the files yeah i did it no no no they're in my hand i took care of it it's done yes so why you know what i was thinking that maybe you and i could sit down again and talk about that uh crypto deal or or that condo project that i mentioned remember dad dad dad hello the service here it's just [ __ ] third world you know so uh where were we yes uh payment right give them the money yes sir okay and now that you know the drill i say keep hitting that son of a [ __ ] he's always dropping money on flashy [ __ ] trying to flex like some big man clean him the [ __ ] out you could bring anything to jorge here he'll fence it for you no questions asked you've got el rubio's recurring [ __ ] nightmare i love it i don't even know if i want to look at these excuse me no no no no no what can i get you some fresh oj coconut water no thanks i really don't want to go [ __ ] [ __ ] i love you guys so much you're hardcore mrs m wild night darling so what is it it's nothing now nothing at all it's over thank you this means a lot come on the least we can do is offer you some champagne and then i think i need to sleep for a week this all goes well i'd do it again so bravo capitan but you know in russia we have saying for moments such as this the wolf is dead now we wrestle the bear do you understand mr rubio has a taste for expensive items soon we can pay him another visit i think and then another and another and this
