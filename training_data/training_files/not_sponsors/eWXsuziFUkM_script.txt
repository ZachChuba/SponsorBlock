[Music] gals and gentlemen welcome to draw with Jazza I'm jazzy and today I am going to attempt to create a spectacular artwork with literally the cheapest crappers textures I could possibly find now this is going to be a challenge in part because the text is a cheap and crap but also because I've been spoiled for a very long time and I'm used to using alcohol-based markers which I mean these things are amazing but they're very expensive but my goal in today's video is to show that while these expensive art suppliers are fun to use they're not always necessary to create something thank you to Wix for sponsoring this video now I'm anxious to see what I can make with these but as usual when I try add a new or weird art supply I need to test it now why are these so expensive well because they're alcohol-based you can do these really cool tricks like blending where you can take several colors of similar hue similar tones you can see how they lay down quite flat and look very vibrant and if I lay them down one after the other and then go - my original colors I can blend and create really nice gradient effects oh my goodness just using these makes me feel sad that I'm not getting to use them for this artwork beyond that you can actually get some contrasting tones like this blue and green and just again because it's alcohol-based even if I just let's say I'll do a green circle here green ball I can mix in the blue around the outside like if this just sort of do the edge and then go back to that green and once again blend and do these little circular shapes and basically by doing this I'm laying down more and more of that alcohol that's mixing the colors together until I get a nice gradient even though the colors contrasting look at that oh it's beautiful let's try these things I don't want to come out of the packet they're being stubborn already I had lots of color options that's nice I'm just gonna put these down for a direct comparison just to see how they work now they're obviously not alcohol based so they probably won't blend I don't know what how did you know that that doesn't go down too bad but if you lay it down too thickly you'll see that actually sort of breaks up the paper it sort of tears it up a little bit yeah see that's where if I go back to that yellow and try and blend do you know what it's it's semi works for like half a second but I've actually got like the paper coming off of the texture here let's let's zoom in for a clearer example so they are nice and zoomed in you can see see that paper you can barely see it but I've also tried to hold back a little bit so if I just take this orange texture now and just push it out see how it really doesn't take that much to just scrub it in a little bit and you start lifting the paper off it really tears it up I bet you if I keep doing this it's just gonna make a hole in the paper look at that it's falling apart this is actually sculpting a hole in the back oh my God look at that but even when I don't go out to eat he'll like that one there you can see just directly the gradients next to each other on the Left we have something really smooth and rich and beautiful and on the right it's not the worst thing in the world but it's pretty janky and we can't create the same effect so I'll be interested to see you know how that limitation comes in place in the piece that we're going to create today because the other challenge is that creating a flat even tone can be doable but really tricky it requires me having a really even hand but if I accidentally leave a gap and then try and go back you'll notice that it actually sort of lays down too much and it goes too dark and then I can't undo that oh good let's try and do the green blue blend this is thoroughly depressing [Music] yeah not blending no not gonna happen oh did you know that's not the worst in the world you know that I want to use different methods that probably won't involve blending but trying to create really even tones and see if I can plan an executed piece that is ambitious and exciting and awesome and that if I show people they wouldn't guess that was made with a pack of textures that literally costs kuddle adults now you guys know I don't like to do anything by half-measures so when I say I want to do something epic I really do want to do something epic so texture for scale this is not the size of paper we're working with we're going double the size with a very large eighty-three piece of paper today and I'm gonna create something as epic as possible well when I say epic I mean like epic let's just see how this guy's the first thing I needed to do was scribble down on a scrap piece of card just to check all the colors and see if they're all usable being mildly surprised that they were all in good working order I move on to a little plan formulation on the other side of my scrap card with some thumbnail sketches of concepts that I thought would be epic enough to make those markers more awesome than made feel to use being somewhat inspired by the daunting task of having to rely on these dodgy materials at sutter create a piece that could act as a bit of a battle cry for artists also wielding cheap materials I move on to create a refine sketch in composition a scene depicting a young schoolboy carrying the same cheap markers that I would be drawing with holding his ground on a battlefield of giant paper in front of him stands a giant beast challenging him a sentient art supplies golem made up of expensive colored inks and liquids no Beast the child screams you and your fancy art liquid will not defeat me I may only wield crappy markers but I can create art with my soul and that will triumph over your sentient alcohol ass any day at least that's how the same plays out in my head it's time to color this thing in and this is where the real challenge begins first the Beast now I know I wanted him to be made up of an epic mixture of colors but knowing that these markers don't blend and can't be laid down in more than one layout I needed a creative way to make this happen so I opted to attempt a look of marbled paint colors clean and individually showing all swirling in a de twining and shaping around the mass of the beast working with these layers of colors and lines was good in that I could use a lot of colors without needing them to blend plus I could use the flow of the lines and swirls in a way that would accentuate the perspective of the character and make him look more three-dimensional essentially adding one color at a time to the marbled mass eventually the whole dude was colored in so I could move on to giving shape to the world around him and add more depth if I could first the outlines during the clean lines of the school boy and the paper battlefield between them and then the Beast minimal use within the beast for some of the more extreme geometry of the body mass I really loved the way these lines around the beasts made him look really clean and super badass but the next part of my plan in fear would really make him pop so I start off by filling the entire background with a solid black this was particularly tricky since as I've shown these markers leave awkward marks and lines if they go over the same place twice it's unavoidable so as much as I wanted a clean black backdrop of solid color it simply wasn't possible so to work around this I created a few base perspective lines to break up the background and give me some guidance then in chunk by chunk I filled in these portions drawing only in the direction of those perspective lines while the background would still have the awkward chief marker textures there would be consistently in the same direction and evenly distributed meaning that in the end the textures might add to the grand sense of scale in this image and make the beast seem even bigger next I took a big leap of faith and attempted to use the light gray texture to add a layer of shadow around the piece and praise Poseidon it worked but it was still very tricky I had to work really fast and accurately because if I go over the same stroke twice it would tear up the paper and make it look like it's big black smudge where I just drew now as you can see zoomed in with me working on this piece the text just throughout the piece of pretty strong and it's a very obviously cheap marker sort of look but because our worked as clean as possible and use the markers on the paper and with each other as intelligently as I possibly could at least the end result was something that looks really consistent and made for more of a stylistic aesthetic than something that looked like a lack of proper art materials last but not least I gave the school boy his uniform colors and a touch of depth with some two-tone shading and then added the final touch of some gray shadows around the paper battlefield to add a touch more depth and to push the epic piece over the finish line [Music] so there is ladies and gentlemen this is my finished artwork using some cheap crappy textures obviously there are some things that couldn't be avoided like the texture of the marker when it lays on top of itself you can't get a flat color so I was just really careful to make sure to go in consistent direction so it wasn't distracting and looked like an intentional texture I was also pleasantly surprised that with this gray texture I still managed to somehow get a layer of shading in on this giant character I feel like the theme of this artwork is also quite fitting for the challenge we have this underdog of a young character using cheap textures himself art I feel your buddy it's it's no easy feat I guess it's just really fun to take note every now and then but you can make art and have fun without a big budget in fact all of these markers or all of these textures that I have opened here plus all of these unopened packets all combined to still be cheaper than this but I couldn't make that with this now could I no oh my god this video is so inspirational how hey right while we're feeling inspired and on the topic of things you can do with little to no budget I
