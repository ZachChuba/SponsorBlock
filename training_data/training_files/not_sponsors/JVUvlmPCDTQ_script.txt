this is PJ Tucker University of Texas alum current small forward power forward to the Houston Rockets in for the past few years the reigning sneakerheads champion of the MPA PJ Tucker might have the largest collection among NBA players but his rabid infatuation is indicative of the rising popularity of sneaker culture both on and off the court in 2018 the global sneakers market stood at a reported 58 billion dollars and estimated compound annual growth rates expect the industry to reach 88 billion by 2024 so how did we get to this point we have to go all the way back to 1917 when the converse rubber shoe company launched their first basketball shoe the all-star it was the first mass-produced basketball shoe in North America consisting of a thick rubber sole and an ankle covering canvas and it was the shoe of choice for semi-professional basketball player Charles Hollis Taylor Taylor believed in the shoes so much that after he retired from basketball he went to work for converse as a salesman he helped redesign the shoe to provide enhance flexibility and support and had the idea to add a patch to protect the shoes ankle he even became the player coach for the converse all-stars the company's industrial basketball team throughout his career with converse Taylor traveled across the country hosting basketball clinics and promoting the all-star shoe he slowly became an icon in the sport of basketball people would go into stores asking for Chuck Taylors shoe instead of the converse all-stars so when a brilliant marketing and branding move converse eventually added Taylor's signature to the design on the ankle in 1932 the first signature shoe but not the last in 1971 adidas dropped the adidas Jabbar name for Kareem abdul-jabbar in 1973 Puma dropped the Puma Clyde named for Clyde Frazier in 1976 converse dropped the dr. J's Pro leather named for Julius Erving and in 1984 Nike was hoping to partner with a rookie rising star Michael Jordan but Jordan didn't want to partner with Nike he wanted a partner with converse the shoe he wore while in college at North Carroll converse was still a widely popular shoe for NBA players at the time worn by superstars like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson but Nike laid out a plan that other brands couldn't offer a huge contract worth more than three times the richest contract at that point creative input that would customize the shoe around Jordans wants and desires in a marketing push unlike anything that had ever come before it what emerged was this the Air Jordan the shoe came in a number of color ways but when fans think of the Air Jordan one they usually picture the band colorway they're called band because the story goes that Jordan was fined $5,000 per game that he wore them because they broke league uniform rules on September 15th Nike created a revolutionary new basketball shoe on October 18th the NBA threw them out of the game now Michael is this the shoe and of course we can't show what kind of shoe this is that's okay to color standpoint is this the shoe that the NBA wouldn't let you wear what's wrong with the coloring this what rule do we violate here well neither does the NBA NBA policy mandated that each player must wear shoes that not only match their uniforms but match the shoes worn by their teammates it's true that Jordan wore red and black sneakers and it's also true that the NBA front office sent Nike a letter about the shoes but the actual truth has basically been forgotten over time as if the public preferred the legend over legitimacy the shoes in question were actually airships and Jordan wore them only once his promotion for the eventual Air Jordans since they had a similar design and since the actual Air Jordans wouldn't be ready for months there's no confirmation of any subsequent violations or fines but it didn't matter at that point the buzz had already been generated and Nike ran with it all the way to the bank it's widely believed that modern sneaker culture really began in 1985 with the Air Jordan once the style the marketing the controversy created a level of demand never before seen for a sneaker not only did Jordan quickly emerge as one of the most exciting players in the league he did it while wearing shoes that looked like nothing else on the court the modern sneaker landscape is flooded with choices signature sneakers are more calm than ever but seemingly every big star having their own line of shoes and multiple brands are competing for eyeballs with so many choices the decision for sneaker heads now boils down to the factors that mean the most for them how it fits functions the material the structural stability the silhouette colorways technology whether it's meant for performance on the court or athleisure off the court but perhaps the most important aspect of sneakers today is the unique story at the helm the shoes you wear say a lot about you who you are where you've been and what you believe in Elizabeth Similac curator for the out of the box the rise of sneaker culture exhibit says the cultural meaning behind sneakers is a constantly evolving dialogue between the people who produce sneakers and the people who wear them sneakers have signified everything from national identity race and class to masculinity and criminality but simply they are magnets for social and political meaning intended or otherwise in a way that sets them apart from other types of footwear in the modern sneaker culture shoes perform well based on the story surrounding their release that's the reason why people choose to remember the Air Jordan ones as the band shoe it's a better story players today are layering in a variety of stories into their shoe which give insight into their background hobbies and inspirations for example the Nike LeBron 15's equality Edition had a huge impact that was larger than the game of basketball with the growing interest in sneaker culture amongst players and the fans coincided with Nikes 2017 take over as the official manufacturer of league uniforms the NBA made a rule change to the dress code before the 2018-19 season this change removed color restrictions that previously limited regular season on court Footwear to combinations of black white grey or team colors it's given the players a voice on their stage but they didn't always have and with the floodgates finally open the players have certainly embraced the opportunity sporting unique kicks on a nightly basis we made the change to provide our teams and players with a vehicle to showcase their individuality as well as their passion for basketball
