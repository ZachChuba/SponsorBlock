this video is brought to you by dashlane so out of my body's five basic senses I tend to assign the most economic value to that of sight after all without it I couldn't do many of the things that I enjoy including making goofy videos like this I couldn't read books I couldn't write use a camera mounted on a computer or perhaps most importantly see the faces of those I loved or the innocent smile of a newborn baby yes without sight my life would be much much different I owe a lot to my eyes I use them every day and yet I know very little about how they work the same is probably true for you too for instance unless you're in the medical field or a biology student or some Wikipedia reading know-it-all you probably don't know the various parts of your eyes and how those parts operate together to deliver an image to your brain to put it simply when an object enters into your visual range the available light bounces off of it and enters into your eyes there it passes through the cornea pupil and iris to your eyes lens which then reflects the light onto your retina a layer of tissue in the back of your eyeball that contains over 100 million light-sensitive cells the light hits these cells and triggers nerve impulses that pass through the optic nerve to arrive at your visual cortex located in the back of your brain and here the visual image is formed all of this happens instantly you can think of it like an organic form of the mechanical operation of a camera when light passes through several filters and a lens before hitting a sensor which produces an image in that same way when light passes through your human high your eyes lens causes the image to be inverted when it hits your retina this upside-down image is what goes to your brain and it's your brains job to sort the image out so that you perceive it right-side up that's right even at this very moment your eyes are sending an upside down image to your brain so while technically you actually see everything upside down your brain has naturally developed to correct for this so that in your mind the image appears right-side up in fact it's believed by many that infants actually spend their first few weeks with inverted vision as their visual cortex slowly yet surely develops to properly in prett the information coming from their eyes that's led several scientists to ask a very sciency question if our brains are constantly interpreting inverted images can we hack our brains to see upside down in the 1890s George Malcolm Stratton an American psychologist pioneered the study of perception in vision by experimenting with a special pair of glasses that flipped the wearer's world upside down literally inverting the image up and down and left and right so that everything the wearer saw was flipped and flopped this meant that the test subjects brain would need to train itself to interpret the image correctly other scientists including James Gibson and Theodore irassman also ran experiments where mirrored glasses were placed over a subjects eyes and they were asked to go about their day as the men documented whether the human brain could figure out how to make sense of an upside-down world test subjects naturally struggled in the immediate aftermath of donning the glasses simple tasks like writing their names or solving a maze were essentially impossible the brain struggled to make sense of up down left and right and attempting to integrate the inverted seeing with the inverted moving caused mixed signals for otherwise routine motor skills if you want to see a bunch of youtubers struggle to do menial tasks with upside-down vision check the links in the description like in the experiments even after wearing the glasses for several hours test subjects struggled to function dealing with nausea and scrambled senses but Stratton Gibson irassman and others found that after wearing the upside-down glasses for a couple of weeks subjects brains adjusted so that they could function and operate normally in essence the brain taught the body how to interpret and function when everything in its visual range was upside down imagine flipping your vision and then being told to ride a bike or write a letter or pour a cup of coffee turns out in less than a month your brain would likely be able to adapt to the new environment of course once the experiment was over test subjects had to take the glasses off and this and a new problem their brains needed to adjust back luckily within a day most subjects a sense of sight return to normal this in return helped scientists to narrow down which parts of the visual cortex are trained to interpret spatial and directional awareness and how that information is sent to the rest of the body so yes it is possible for you to hack your brain to see upside down but let's be honest the glasses then look pretty goofy to wear around all day so really what's the point all this information of course helps to drive home the real existential question that humans grapple with every day namely can you really believe what your eyes are telling you hacking your brain
