thanks to dashlane for sponsoring this video hey kids the human spirit is a very powerful thing with the right temperament it can allow us to survive things you wouldn't believe however some people are stronger than others for example I've never so much as broken a bone in my life haven't been hospitalized since that first time 20 years ago so I'm like 90% certain if I'm ever forced to dance with death my souls pussying out to the great beyond first thing on the other end of the spectrum you got guys like Phineas Gage Gage was a 25 year old railroad worker in mid 19th century Vermont he and his crew were busy gang blasting rock to prepare the roadbed for a newly planned route this involves a big hole being drilled into the ground filled with gunpowder and packed down using a tamping iron well being the gentleman and scholar that he is gage decides to lean forward and look directly into the hole right now the first rule of gun safety is to never look down the front of a gun everyone knows that gage basically just turned the earth into a gun and decided to put his head right in front of its gaping barrel and wouldn't you know it the powder goes off the tamping iron shoots up into his cheek moseys right on through his frickin brain and goes soaring out the other side landing 80 feet away I'll smear with blood and thought juice now by and large gate stood a drop dead immediately and been thrown into ravine for his blatant disregard for OSHA regulations and that would have been the end of it but I guess Shiva Gautama Christ Chan the one true God decided gage still had unfinished business down here on [ __ ] outta luck three cuz after a few minutes of twitching on the ground he got up looked around and thought well now's a good time as any for my yearly checkup according to the doctor he went to well gage was retelling the story of what happened he suddenly started vomiting all over the place the effort of which and I quote pushed out about half a tea cup full of the brain which fell upon the floor he didn't say what they did with it after I'm picturing his dog just running over and immediately scarfing it down then being plagued with the memories of a human railroad worker for the rest of his life and the months following gage made a near complete recovery physically anyway he did lose a bit of his mind which caused him to lose his mind a bit whereas gage was once an up standing hard-working citizen his untimely brain blast transformed him into an angry incoherent drunkard mumbling quote the grossest profanity whenever he deemed fit and showing little to no regard for human life whatsoever naturally he was fired from his job at the railroad so gage ended up wandering the earth earning money any way he could for a while he hung out at Barnum's American Museum in New York City basically making an exhibit of himself standing there with the tamping iron like hi this went through my brain by he later had a stint as a farmhand in California and a stagecoach driver in Chile which I don't know who let the guy with severe brain trauma and no depth perception drive a vehicle but whatever over time he actually became a lot more functional until finally ten years later when his brain remembered oh yeah I shouldn't exist leaving to gauge having a bunch of seizures and dying at age 36 a similar story happened with one Ron hunt in 2003 he was an American construction worker who was drilling a hole above his head when the latter he was standing on decided to give way leading to hunt landing face-first on a 1.5 inch auger drill bit the drill went straight through his left eye and out the back of his skull to give you a reference of what 1.5 inches of drill looks like here's the actual x-ray that doctors took when hunt arrived at the hospital miraculously the drill ended up just kind of pushing his brain out of the way leading to no cognitive impairment whatsoever matter of fact hunt was perfectly lucid while the doctors tried to figure out the best way to take the thing out of his head initially they considered cutting it out but that would have been too messy so eventually they decided to literally just unscrew it from his head like all right hold I'm still now oh you [ __ ] milf lefty loosy does that mean the top or the bottom that what it's a rotating circle and okay you hold on for one sec look one way the top goes left one way the bottom so which that clearly the one on top why tell me why why clearly same reason North is up on the map it's just common practice alright well sorry for not subscribing to your Eurocentric propaganda dan you soggy [ __ ] anyway what were we doing if you think hunt was just a little too lucky with his incident don't worry according to Snopes he was self-employed and didn't have insurance so while the accident didn't ruin his life you can sleep easy knowing the hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills rehabilitation costs probably did our next tale revolves around Greg Rasmussen a British for an animal conservationist who was studying wildlife in Zimbabwe one day he got reports of a highly endangered Rhino being spotted in the area so Greg took to the skies in a single passenger plane to track the Beast fate was looking down at Greg that day and after a moment it said no Rhino must die and a huge gust of wind came out of nowhere sending Greg into a tailspin crash landing right in the middle of the untamed African bush when Greg woke up he found that his legs look like used up tubes of toothpaste so he was essentially trapped right where he was arguably worse than that was the fact that Greg was dehydrated before he even took off hoping to get water at his destination and just when things look like they couldn't get any worse they got worse a group of elephants showed up and started harassing and straight up stampeding at Greg with no other option he starts banging on the wreckage as hard as he could the elephants would and decided to leave him alone he was also approached by a pack of hyenas and actual lionesses on the hunt but fortunately animals are all morons so the same trick worked on them too Greg spent an entire day and night pinned under the wreckage fighting off wildlife severe dehydration and extreme temperatures before finally being rescued the next morning incredibly after over 100 operations doctors managed to get greggy's leg ease up and running again although he was now three inches shorter which is probably for the best because now they can just stick the keys at the plane on top of the fridge so he never has another incident like this again so moral of the story us humans are resilient creatures who will do anything in our power to survive and just as Greg Rasmussen banged on his destroyed plane to ward off predators in Zimbabwe you should bang on your keyboard right now to ward off predators online with dashlane in this day and age will get 10% off their - link premium
