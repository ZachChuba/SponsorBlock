it is uh it's time it's time we think today's the day uh hi welcome welcome to a really exciting stream it's been an exciting week in spaceflight i can't even begin to express how big of a deal this this whole week has been we've had you know less than a week ago we were going to mars with uh perseverance then we had uh the static fire then we had dm2 bob and doug came home yesterday splashing down just an awesome awesome awesome night so awesome week so yeah we are ready to hopefully uh hopefully we're gonna see this thing hop today so this of course is spacex's starship prototype you'll notice we're a little bit more zoomed out than we normally are and that's for a reason because that shiny tower there right in the middle of the screen is going to be taking off and flying and it's hopefully going to fly 150 meters up which is about yeah the funny thing is if you quit and come back it like works for a second that's what i'm very confused by i'm back am i actually back that is so weird this was on youtube's end are you sure i've never had this happen before we haven't dropped a single frame in obs our connections are stable i think that was a youtube thing have you guys ever seen anything like that ah thank you for your patience that was weird we're just like sitting here like we're not we don't have anything to troubleshoot like youtube was showing like excellent connection our throughput was like through the roof our live stream from boca chica was solid that was confusing that was really really confusing i don't know but thank you for bearing with uh us and youtube uh yeah so sorry sorry for that but okay so we are here to witness history hopefully youtube doesn't doesn't totally drop the ball on us again but um we've got some people to thank here right away andrea thank you for the new membership you're awesome and so you've got we've got philip uh eicher with the pair lifting some weights i appreciate that and luke pryo i have been very busy the past two weeks insanely busy maybe i'll go ahead and say maybe a little too busy for my liking uh it was it has been like a sprinting marathon like sprinting a marathon for the past two weeks the last week was absolutely bonkers getting a 30 some minute out minute video out about the how you re-enter from orbit and all that stuff um it's been it's been hard it's but it's been fun and we saw some really cool stuff from space flight so um a good good week to be a space flight fan that is for sure um this is from marcus says my internet sucks yet i'm sitting on 10 gigs here literally 10 gigs my friends i can push 10 gigs up under the internet and then the internet doesn't even care uh yeah we've got we've got a pipe here we're sitting on about 2 500 worth of networking gear as well we're we take this stuff seriously so um it seems to be like we're all good to go and everything's running smooth now though so um it's at this point i think it's just up in the cloud that's having some problems so i do apologize for that again thank you guys again for coming back uh yeah like i said um thank you paul like i said i'm really really excited that we can have a zoomed out picture here because we're going to see this thing fly so you know if this thing's about 30 meters we'll still probably have to be doing some tilting up and a little bit of panning left to get the entire flight um and yeah it's it's gonna be crazy um i'm just glad you guys are back i'm glad it's back on air so uh thank you guys how did everyone have an awesome weekend this is a pretty this is a pretty historic weekend this could be a major back-to-back thing for spacex they just flew their first humans to and from uh space to the international space station of course bob and doug just got home yesterday with a massively successful milestone achievement of of commercial space like people were going you know why is it such a big deal the soyuz has been doing this for 50 years well that's kind of the point is you know that we finally have a vehicle besides soyuz that hasn't changed in almost 50 years hardly had minor minor minor tweaks but all you have to do is get to look at the dragon capsule and see the interior of the dragon capsule and see how it's made to not realize that this is obviously a step in the right direction and it's cheaper right so we it's the both best of both worlds it's a cheaper vehicle and updated safety updated you know comfort and features and all of the things like it's it was a big day it was a big day little oof thank you for purchasing the new hoodie i'm stoked i'm really excited for that um this is from uh let's see youtube did not have a point hand up and flamingo down we should probably do that shouldn't we we've got some check off things to do here so let's start off right away we do need to do uh pointy end up and flamie and down and maybe i should actually dial into to andrew my producer so that he can he can do this um but let's see um i'm thinking um yeah andrew we're gonna go ahead and confirm right now that pointy end is dup is up and flaming is down i'm trying to type and do it at the same time i probably should have dialed in but yeah i can officially confirm it as long as things sink in the background there we go and it happened pointy end is up flay man is down i'm even wearing the right shirt for that today i've got it here we can confirm pointy end up and flaming in down it is time oh i'm sad i'm not there though i am a little a part of me is just crying on the inside but uh and on the outside but this is still really exciting um i'm gonna try and then the other thing we need to tell you guys that the personnel are are definitely clear the pad so we can check that off as well um let's see sorry um the countdown isn't centered in the box okay andrew i'm going to address your ocd give me one second here let me fix that one two three clickity click kitty click let's see if that's better is that better i gave it three clicks hopefully it's good enough are you worried about left and right you tell me um all right so we uh thank you guys for for hanging out and being here with us including robert um so yeah i feel like we should probably again give you guys the full run down here i'll just do a quick little thing so uh again this is of course spacex's starship prototype we're calling them prototypes we're gonna go ahead and say i'm gonna throw this up since we're not really seeing anything yet um i know that sometimes uh people panic not that one we want this i'm gonna make this a little bit bigger because we really don't have much to look at right now so that you guys can read it a little bit easier um but oopsies that was the wrong thing to do hold on good old obs like it never never wants to play nice come on clickity click no click click click click obs don't be a jerk anyway this oh did i get it there is this the right one no get you're making me look stupid on the internet in front of all my space friends obs there we go here we go i'm gonna make this bigger i promise look i did it i did a thing i did a thing in obs and it didn't crash that's a first okay so this is where we're at here with starship prototypes this is spacex's of course this is their prototype vehicle because their next rocket is is going to be the starship vehicle so it's a huge massive upgrade from their falcon 9 their falcon 9s are currently falcon 9 falcon heavy the falcon family are their only orbital rockets that they fly right now and they've been great they prove they can propulsively land and reuse rockets uh with rapid turnarounds we're getting down to like almost a month turnaround time uh which is really impressive and they're really showing us that a rapid cadence of rockets is is potentially possible so we're seeing a really cool future but this is the this is the real future here this is when the whole paradigm shift happens and when things really get nutty because now we're going to be seeing you know bigger bigger rockets these things are nine meters wide when this thing is stacked what we're seeing right now on the pad behind us uh you kind of see these little shiny the shiny things on the screen the early prototypes and the full-size prototypes that's only about a quarter of the entire vehicle this will be on top of a booster that's two-thirds of the entire thing and this will have a nose cone on it that that's about a third of what this currently is so it's going to be huge it's going to be about 120 meters tall which is getting close to like 400 feet tall so it's almost like a you know 35 40 story building it's 9 meters wide which is 30 feet wide it's made out of stainless steel and it's going to utilize spacex's raptor engine which is their full flow stage combustion cycle uh the most advanced rocket engine ever made um the most i guess as far as actually utilizing the propellants it's it's right up there pretty pretty impressive stuff and um so far we've only seen one vehicle hop and oddly it was really close to a year ago that it first did its flight and that was a star hopper vehicle um starhopper was just that it's off to the left hand side of the screen it did survive it tops barely um and so did a 20 meter hop and then a 150 meter hop as well and uh yeah we're sitting here i'm gonna turn down the ambient noise just a little bit so you guys aren't getting blasted um but then since then we've seen two i'll say i'll go ahead and say these were mock-ups basically the mark one and mark two the mark one was what was at the starship event with elon musk last september and mark two is being dis has been disassembled in cocoa florida there two teams working on kind of how do you build something this big out of stainless steel and then of course we've seen some pressure test articles we've seen serial number one two and three full-size prototypes all have different failures and now here we are ladies and gentlemen we are here to finally see serial number five do its hop do its job this is and there are legs up in there a lot of people are kind of confused about where the legs come from or why or when or what how it's gonna land there's legs up around the skirt i should probably find um andrew can you link me to neopork or someone in discord um link me to one of those videos that that some of the awesome like i know kimmy um had a really good animation um there we go new york hog how'd you how did you do that um but yeah somebody somebody showed me the someone show me them legs there's some tweets out there from from some awesome people um yeah casper stanley that's right casper you had a really good um let's see here yeah but so yeah there's six legs tucked up in there once this thing takes off from this little stand those legs are gonna pop out and they're kind of like spring-loaded and it's it's really crazy the craziest thing to me is that they haven't really tested these legs so what if the legs or that we know of i mean of course they could have done it somewhere but we haven't really seen them do it they can't really do it while it's on the launch mount so who knows they you know that's if now i don't want to ever put anything into you know like which will anything into existence but i would definitely say that's probably one of the bigger unknowns because at this point the raptor engine um here we go we got casper stanley's awesome animation as well let me pull up casper's gosh there's just such an awesome community of impressive and incredibly talented um 3d animators and designers these days it's so cool okay i'm going to pull this up here quick these are about how the legs will deploy something along along those lines let's and come down like that something along those lines we also have um another one from uh kimmy talviti i i'm sure i'm totally mispronouncing your name kimmy i apologize but you do some awesome work as well let me make this a little bit bigger for you guys um but let's let's check this out here real quick because it's it's cool here i can i can make that one full screen so this is this is kimmy's rendition and again i think they're both probably pretty much spot on we've got some some pictures from them yeah look at like kind of looking up they're gonna deploy about like that now this does only have one raptor engine on it eventually the starship prototypes like this the serial number um you know probably like eight will end up with three uh raptor engines just like this but for now you know these are kind of how the landing legs actually are so kimmy fantastic work um support your local 3d artists because they're helping visualize a lot of these things really well so uh yeah that's super cool so that's what's up inside the skirt there at the base of the vehicle and right now it's sitting on a stand and yeah man i am i am excited again we're kind of just guessing the time we're going to keep pushing the clock here at the top likely going to change we're just kind of pushing it out until we start seeing some um some fuel signs of fueling and things like that um because we just really have about no idea um but we haven't even seen you know condensation forming down on the ground or anything so we're probably we're guessing we're within about an hour window or something you know so um super cool stuff gosh you guys do awesome stuff oh i don't think i've seen this one hang on i'm pulling this up kimmy i missed this kimmy's actually got a full blown or stanley i mean casper stanley has this and we're gonna pull this up here and you guys can check this out um look at this this is awesome i haven't seen this even all right left monitors you guys can watch it this is a full blown look at that oh yes so again for now there's only a single raptor engine which it means it's going to fly crooked because the raptor engine is not mounted in the very center it's mounted offset which means oh i did actually i saw that last turntable thing actually i don't know how i saw that but not the rest of it very cool work um but yeah so you guys got to follow you know stanley creative on on twitter and on youtube awesome work so um yeah it's this is crazy stuff this is this is definitely what we're all here to see you know this is what i've been waiting to see for a long time unfortunately we're hoping to see this last year you know we're hoping when star hopper did this thing it was like we hope to have the next prototype ready to go um in like a few months and unfortunately they've learned a lot of lessons these are new fuels these are new systems and uh you know there's a lot of things that they've learned lessons on so we're really really really really hoping thank you andrew we're really hoping that this all goes well today because we don't want to see them set back the last big one that they lost was seal number four and that was not a good hang on i'm gonna do serial number four explosion we've got we had some slow-mo of that that was that was not a good thing that was um yeah let me show you guys this this was this was um let's see like the end of may right before dm2 launched they accidentally had this happen and we don't want that that's very bad um notice the pop-up suggested why won't starship have an abort system should it i wonder why i suggested that video here is slow-mo quarter speed um yeah we don't want this to happen again we do not want to see something like this these are although luckily the just stuff flying everywhere you know luckily with this being you know something that they're just cranking out these prototypes like it's not a big deal it's definitely less of a big deal than like say if you know right now if tomorrow uh sls would end up exploding while it's doing its pressure test and green run that would be devastating because that thing has taken years and years and years and millions and millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars and these things are way more akin to like a you know multi-million maybe and they're producing them in a couple months or at this point they're producing in a couple of weeks but the to redo the the ground systems and all that stuff definitely took a little bit so um it it it's yeah this is oh man this is good but man um yeah this this is some pretty nutty stuff still though they're still pushing the boundaries of of what they're currently comfortable with so um yeah i'm hoping that everything goes right the one question i have is i don't know where the um you know where the uh copvs or the sorry the cold gas thrusters actually are mounted i really haven't seen too much from that stuff so yeah um oh gosh so i'm like almost at a loss of words today it's been such a crazy week i don't yeah i really really really wish that i was down there i was down there of course for the hops last year i think i spent like five or six weeks uh around brownsville and south padre island and boca tea it's not a bad place to get stuck frankly um especially when rachel and jean took me out surfing uh i mean it's fun there's a lot of there's some good people out there uh but it gets exhausting like getting out there from south padre is almost a full hour each time even though you're like five miles from south padre getting out there is is kind of uh yeah it's a little bit frustrating at times um and speaking of of rachel and jean uh we did have yeah this is perfect chris thank you yup thank you to uh gene and rachel who are also the ones running the camera for us here at space padre island and they they have been working really closely with the coast guard with other people because we don't want wayward boats like we had that last test day whenever that was thursday or whatever we really don't want launch you know any boats in the way we don't want boats to surround the dragon capsule like what happened yesterday uh so they yeah they're doing a great job they're obeying all local laws and have talked explicitly with the coast guard cooperating with the coast guard they're outside the exclusion zone just doing everything by the books and we really really really appreciate their hard work and dedication so um from marcus my internet on sucks yeah baby we're firing on every cylinder now um yeah so uh the reason that i didn't travel down this time is is just a multitude of things first off i i'm not a big fan of traveling during a pandemic uh it's hard it's a little bit spooky um you know it's it's hard to sometimes get food and get things like that especially uh when you have to charge your car on road trips like that it's hard uh some of the restaurants are closed like lots of times like superchargers are only at restaurants or things like that and some of those are closed so you don't have a place to go to the bathroom you don't have a place to grab food and it's it's just hard i i had to do it for dm2 at the launch and it's just like i don't know it i don't really want to risk that for myself or you know when i i hang out with my family quite a bit here um i don't want to risk exposure to any of that but also like i've had a crazy the last two weeks have been insane we got out two long videos all back back-to-back um after getting the studio finally all like set up and all the stuff like i was just ready to to not do you know not not have to go and travel and drive 24 hours uh to get down there for this so uh this is from zac b not the md astronaut and we're here to hi hello it's me zack b not the everyday ass now we're here to talk about water tower levitation can water towers fly and is tim dot an alien well it's complicated i like that yeah this is uh you do almost have to light the candle in order to know which end is the flaming end on this vehicle because it is uh it definitely points down but it's pretty hard so um yeah discord oh are you guys talking yes for in discord channel we're talking about uh we are definitely talking about um we're working on a new merchandise fulfillment because currently our merchandise is all fulfilled from long beach international shipping is horrendous especially during the pandemic shipping prices went way up um the lead times got longer they're stuck in customs longer customs are taking longer like if you live in the uk or if you live in germany's really bad switzerland's pretty bad like there's a lot of places that uh netherlands it'll get stuck in customs forever and it'll show that like it'll show on the tracking that the last thing it did was was in la and it'll be like it was there for four weeks yeah i know your stuff is probably sitting in customs uh if if it's left the warehouse then it's officially stuck in customs at that point so we're working on um we are working on european fulfillment for our merch store where we're going to have a separate warehouse with with the merchandise um that will make it cheaper for you guys because the like i said the we even discount the shipping we take a hit on shipping to europe and a internationally and sometimes depending on what the merchandise says we literally lose money on some uh like some specific details of orders we've we lose money on some of those orders even i know it sounds insane but trust me the shipping is is ludicrous yeah so uh although although it sucks for you guys it totally sucks for us too and we we totally get it so uh we're working on it and uh it's something that's kind of difficult to figure out um no it's beyond just a fan's basement we have a major operation in long beach um yeah it's it's a it's a legit thing it's a team of people that run the merchandise it's not print on demand like put it in a tube and let it go um it's it's actually pretty legit so um yeah so we're working on you guys europe i wanna like i think it'll be a much better thing in the future we're hoping to have that out ready for the holidays because yeah um [Laughter] um oh yeah this discord is is difficult but yeah if you oh if if you guys want to join our awesome discord channel we do have that available as a patreon exclusive perk you can join it by going to patreon.com everydayastronaut we have just an incredible community of like-minded people um people that are all in here to learn together and hang out and it's just awesome and and you know they we get to go through some of the fun facts that we're working on in videos being like hey guys help me figure out you know what what was the last splashdown type of stuff and it's it's fun um we really really really have just an incredible community and we're very tight-knit and and friendly so yeah um [Laughter] i love that um yeah so that it's it's a good time how are you guys feeling are you guys feeling good about this hop like i i'm curious i do want to see your odds of success of this going up doing it everything it's intended to do and and touching down and being perfectly fine by the end of the day like having it still on the pad tonight after it flies i want to know your guys's odds my odds i'm actually i'm above 50 50. i used to be like below 50 50 but for this i'm like i'm like 80 20 actually i'm feeling pretty good about it um i think one of the i almost feel like okay again the landing legs and then also once it lands and depressurizes and de-tanks that's something that to me is the the almost the bigger unknown variable um but i think the flight will be great i think they have it figured out so um yeah oh there we go we're getting really in dax is going up 100 moving over 80 landing fine 50 falling over afterwards 20. i i know what you mean like there's there's different portions of this that i'm that i'm worried about more than others uh but yeah it's uh i think they've got it honestly they've learned a ton they've i think the raptor engine is incredibly mature by now and i think uh i'm not worried about that anymore i'm more worried still about the new fueling systems and some of the valves of the fuel system and all that stuff so but all that stuff you know is it has to be worked out for every rocket and it's no different so um yeah you might jason you just might need to delay your trip to the gym because we're kind of just winging it here on times like always but we tend to get we we have signs that help us know uh as a matter of fact if this doesn't do anything here or update if we don't see any ground condensation we might push it to to seven uh pm local which would be uh yeah t minus like an hour and 12 minutes but we'll see um let's see here is 150 meter from the bottom on the seal number five or the top so 150 meters is um is the total height traveled so uh you just add 150 meters to either of those 150 meters above the nose or 150 meters of travel you know it's not um i don't think they're going to say 150 meters the nose cone just at the top of it to sea level i don't think but then again but then again i have to pull this up this is funny hang on guys this is funny i really wish you could do bigger things on when we [Laughter] oh this is from new york hog in our discord channel this is good uh when you forget rocket your rocket orientation check that would not be pointy end up flamie and down that would be very bad i think we're i think we're pretty confident it's at least facing in the correct orientation at least somewhat at least somewhat hard to tell though um alexander hopefully you saw us talk about the landing legs um we did a whole thing about the landing legs uh how stable is it i mean it's landing on totally flat ground so it's not like it needs to you know really be able to pivot or do anything like that so the landing legs should be fine but who knows honestly uh like i said that is that isn't a variable they are up inside the skirt the skirts pop down i would definitely check out there's a lot again a lot of good 3d animators that um yeah we already confirmed the pointy end up flaming and down that is why that is highlighted we are good to go we are we are doing it so um yeah so oh man yeah it it um sham dresses can't be as stable as falcon 9. well can it though i mean right now again this already has a wider base than a falcon 9. it's it's 9 meters wide the falcon 9 is only 3.7 meters wide so it's almost three times wider to begin with right so it already has a wider base its center of mass is really low again that that raptor's slung in there pretty low um it's not like you know these things they look so tall and wobbly but assuming that it lands okay i don't know i don't know it'll be it'll be absolutely crazy it's going to again it's going to fly crooked it might do like a power slide off the pad and then i'm just nervous when it lands i hope it doesn't have horizontal velocity that like trips those legs back in but we're gonna find out we're gonna find out um yeah uh thanks for the membership there rob and mark let's see plot twist serial number five lands on star hopper flies to mars oh poor star hopper star hopper is no longer the star of the show and look how just rinky dink it looks compared to you know seal number five up there it is quite a bit different so um let's see yeah so um let's keep going here thank you so much water towers gonna fly absolute mike roberts thank you uh here's a good question from from sam dillon uh this is a great question so i'm gonna wait for that to clear out of there and then we'll pull this up how tall is cereal five compared to falcon 9. so falcon 9 the first stage booster is 45 meters tall which is um 75 feet tall basically wait is that right 70 meters tall in total sorry and um 100 about 150 feet tall almost right around 150 feet tall the entire thing stacked with the fairing and everything second stage that's 70 meters tall which is um i haven't done 220 feet tall so uh yeah it's this is a little bit what we're seeing on camera is a little bit shorter than the first stage of a falcon 9. um so this is about 30-ish meters tall uh which is about 100 feet tall so it's about two-thirds the height basically when there's the nose coming on this it'll be the exact height of the booster stage of the falcon 9 and then remember this is just the upper stage this is kind of a prototype mock-up ish of the upper stage the upper stage eventually will be 50 taller than this it will then be on top of something that's about twice as tall as both of those together like this is just a tiny little fraction of what this vehicle will be in total uh and yeah so it's it's a lot bigger there's a lot more potential there's a lot larger fuel tanks um methane is not as dense as rp1 rp1 is a lot uh about twice as dense almost it's let me let me pull that up um i'll show you guys this this chart here that i've got from uh everyday astronaut raptor engine uh if you guys haven't watched my video about the raptor engine how the full flow stage combustion cycle raptor engine works you definitely need to check that out because we go into everything including the fuel tank and everything so here is a little chart here and um this is this is definitely confusing so bear with me and it made more sense when we animate it on screen because we show you kind of the densities so this is about how big a relative tank would need to be uh burning at the fuel to oxidizer ratio so i guess the tanks are the tank isn't twice as big but it is um liquid methane is half as dense as rp1 basically at about 422 grams per liter rp1 is about 813 so it's about twice as dense and you want a dense it means you have you don't need as big of fuel tanks you know for the same amount of fuel right so if you have a more dense um rocket fuel it means you can fit more of it in a smaller tank and obviously you don't want a big heavy tank that's not good but liquid hydrogen on the other hand look at that it's like 10 times less dense than rp-1 or more than 10 times like 11 times less dense but now here's the thing is they don't burn them at a perfect one-to-one ratio so it's not like you burn 1 gram of liquid oxygen for 1 gram of rp1 you for instance rp1 is about 2.7 to 1 so you burn 2.7 units of of oxidizer for 1 gram of rp1 but the um the methane is 3.71 so although methane is about half as dense it does burn a little bit more oxygen rich and that's the kind of the balance they choose between temperature performance you know getting your actual mass ejection because you want to eject that stuff out as fast as possible so just the right the right mixture or maybe that's the fuel hang on um yeah that's all in there oh i guess there's a sorry i should go to the pre-launch preview of this because that's all in there um wait where is their pre-launch preview am i missing something um oh yeah pre oh yeah right it's on the hang on let's go to the main site this is all in there up my bad here we go pre-launch preview okay so yeah we can actually do this rundown anyway uh i'm sorry that we're not really seeing the rocket right now i would like to make it so it's a little bit more out of your guys's because i do want you guys able to see the rocket you know that's that's what we're all here to see so we'll do this for now it's not the prettiest thing i've ever done in obs or just in general but it makes sense so yeah this is um this is happening today august 3rd 150 meter hop the launch provider is of course spacex this is so small you guys can't even read it uh who's paying for the spacex the rocket is starship serial number five the launch location bokeh chica launch site boca chica texas payload master is no real payload at all there is that squarish mass simulator just a hunk of steel on the top no satellites they're attempting to recover the stage they sure better uh the first stage will land uh the only operation is gonna be landing on the landing pad really close to the launch site uh there are no fairings on this vehicle of course uh not available for fairings this would be the first flight of starship ish you know star hopper and i don't quite know if we call this starship but it's the first flight of a starship prototype or at least a more mature starship prototype and not just a total like test dummy like it was um old school old school um but yeah i think so are we saying that in here we actually showed the density man this is an in-depth article yeah baby you guys need to read this ethan thank you for your work on this one um yeah definitely take a look at this if you guys need a full rundown on everything go to everydayastronaut.com um and we've got you guys covered so yeah there's definitely been some some trials and tribulations here but um yeah but so back to the density thing sorry that was a long rant here uh this this is the the you know it's about two-thirds or it's uh it's about 50 more uh like size of tank compared to uh relative rp-1 but this is substantially more area there's way more volume in this vehicle even as is compared to a falcon 9. so there's a lot more potential energy besides that the the raptor engine substantially more efficient produces even more thrust than a falcon 9 merlin engine uh it's it's pretty awesome so um uh this hopefully won't be a run i'm sorry that my stream had a little bit of a rut at the beginning but yeah we're we're back in it now firing on all cylinders uh let's see this is from chas we go down to the cape to see the next crew launch we'll see again travel plans are very up in the air for me right now i'm not entirely sure um you know what i want to be doing yet as far as all that stuff goes um someone wants to know how high is 150 meters for context is 500 feet and we'll likely have to tilt our camera up 150 meters should be really close to the top of the frame like i'll bet you the it would basically fly out of frame so we're gonna have to do a little bit of panning and tilting uh to keep this thing so um yeah let's see uh many thanks all right so um yeah thank you very much we really do hope to see this green green silo fly let's see if i think they're going for it guys it just feels like they're going for it i know that elon wants to get this thing off the ground he wanted to get this thing off the ground months ago months and months and months ago he's out there i think to to push for hard work um oh man thank you so much william everyone say thank you to william um who either looks just like dennis reynolds from it's always sunny or it just happens to be that handsome anyway thank you so much william that really means a lot i really appreciate that um let's see here i love the channel and where did that go um love the channel and some of the text sprinkled in during the broadcast but it will go ludicrous speed yes absolutely we are ready um yeah here we go we are watching elon's twitter feed to see if he gives any updates i try to prod him to see if we can get anything um you never know he he sometimes let's let's just pull this guy up here real quick and see if he has anything um left monitor elon musk mystery let me get that out of the way i'm going to shrink this down a little bit for you guys come on obs is being mean today no click right there okay let's just kind of shrink this down a little bit again and not try not to block too much of the rocket i don't know okay anyway the point is we don't have any updates from elon musk despite me trying to uh to get it out of him so ah we'll see we will see i don't know guys what do you think i i think they're going for it though i just have a good feeling they're going for it um so we're definitely gonna be looking for condensation on the vehicle and all that stuff um yeah so hmm so we're thinking it definitely feels like we're you know if we start seeing condensation i think we're pretty close to an hour so we'll see we're keeping our eyes on the the tank farm down there maybe i'll move my my little camera up for just a little bit of time here while we're waiting for it to fuel up and you can see more of the that that'll give us a little bit of better sense oh geez my my heart is like i'm i'm nervous uh if they used warp tool we would be airborne it's so true man curveballs just makes it too easy so uh yeah like i said we think once we start seeing signs of fuel up and stuff like that uh then we uh we're probably you know within it seems like seems like anywhere from about 50 minutes to an hour when they uh when they actually do that jack this is a good question when will falcon heavy fly again that's uh discord can you guys help me out on that one because i actually don't remember there's supposed to be there's supposed to be one this fall i think it got pushed back to like the end of the year and now with all the pandemic stuff i'm not entirely sure if it actually move beyond that even uh help me out guys i don't remember it's i haven't checked up on it in a couple months and a couple months in space flight is is years basically december net net december uh is is what we're looking at right now thank you very much gva morning show this is awesome from hong kong uh ignore the negativity you're receiving lately appreciate your high-end content keep going greetings from austria that's awesome team space thank you so much henrik i i really appreciate that you know i like i said we're i say this all the time but we're just here to hang out be a giant space family and witness some more history so um yeah pretty sure um three to five seconds yeah this will be about 45 the whole flight will be about 45 seconds to a minute so this will be more exciting than the static fire those of you that tuned in the other day just go and then we're like really disappointed when that's all it was yeah this is gonna be a lot more exciting so uh this is uh from james appreciate your perseverance in this continuing endeavor to bring this bring us all this great space hey i really appreciate that we're like i said we're just all here to to hang out together and you know it's just witness history and and be excited about something we have something to be excited about in an era where there's just so much bad news so much sad stuff um let's see um hector wants to know what type of drone does spacex use to record these it's an inspire can't tell from the ground if it's an inspire one or two but it's a dji inspire which have you know you can change out the actual not only can you change out the cameras between like the x3 x5 x7 all those or whatever but you can actually change a lot of those have uh their own dedicated version of micro four thirds even so like a micro four third sensor it's an awesome drone definitely like i mean this this is sponsored to you by dji no i i i used to own an inspire one back in the day when it right when it first came out and it was awesome did a lot of aerial work with it incredible platform it's just so cool that right out of the box something can perform so well so um you're welcome ben i really appreciate that but um they are they also have a robodog um uh let's see here thank you very much also from tad what are the questions you guys have i am curious um so yeah this is my camera i actually have uh i sent rachel and jean it's a it's called a z cam e2 it's a a 4k 120 frame a second camera they're shooting on a 500 millimeter lens although they're backed out a little bit right now no they're shooting on a 600 millimeter lens and they're backed out a decent amount i think they're only around 300 or 200 probably about 300 millimeters but of course on a micro four thirds lens um 300 is more like 600 and that's to those of you guys that's more like that's kind of like a 12 x kind of like 12 time telephoto 12 times magnification so they're they're far away i know it looks like they're pretty close but they're actually a ways out that they are like you know a mile and a half or two miles away so about you know two and a half or three kilometers away and uh yeah we might need to push the clock back andrew since um let's andrew let's push the clock back uh to like seven local because we still haven't seen any action yet we haven't seen anything no no condensation in the tank farm or anything but keeping our eyes open though um this is yeah george you're welcome we did intentionally i wanted him to frame it and it is going to be flying that way anyway so we kind of lined it up uh in the direction that it's going to be flying so uh but i i thought it was cool to see star hopper there for reference as well because star hopper you know we just need to continually give it some love it's cool that we have different views you know from between lab padre and nasa space flight and here uh it's just awesome that we have so much coverage and again this is something that normally would have been done like behind closed doors something that you can't really see so uh yeah it's just really cool that that we get to be able to cover this stuff for you guys and that just makes me really happy because this is history this is fun stuff um yeah thank you very much and uh from this is from yagor the rate at which spacex is making making moves is really impressive can't wait to see the next few what the next few years have in store by the way i love your content i really appreciate that thank you yeah that's what i keep saying like i don't know how much of this is feverish pace or how much of it is because we're seeing it out in the open like i bet some of this stuff happens that even the most conservative uh players in the game like you know we all think of ula as as slow moving and conservative or you know boeing and and new uh you know blue origin but i think a lot of this stuff does happen just behind the scenes but then i think this is definitely taking things up a few more notches like they are trying really hard to just absolutely knock it out of the park oh thank you very much bamboo hip-hop i really appreciate it everyone should visit patreon and join so tim can get a ride to mars i don't want to go to mars please don't make me go to mars mars looks no offense to mars looks pretty bad there's not a single pool i couldn't go swimming anymore there's not even grass i wouldn't have any squirrels to watch or hang out with and like try to feed uh there's a cardinal that's in my tree named cardi b like what would i do what you know what would i do on mars i would just look at mount olympus and be like i can't it's so tall i can't even climb it don't make me go to mars don't don't make me go to mars but thank you very much oh thank you uh do these do you think it'll stay upright after landing i have no idea that is anyone's guess i wanna hope it will again it has a low center of mass and its span is pretty wide you know because the whole vehicle is nine meters wide so uh we'll see honestly i have no idea but jeez what an arrow we're living in we're watching a paradigm shift in vehicles it's kind of incredible to me if this can looking object can fly yeah i said the same thing my mind something happened to my mind when i saw star hopper fly because i had been really close up to it well actually in march of 2019 i got to i actually got to go up and touch it with permission i was on a tour uh of with the facilities at the time which was like a building and like almost nothing else like i i got a tour with at the time uh the the pad manager and they let me just go up and just gently touch star hopper on the leg uh again with permission don't do that yourself it's behind a gate don't get arrested like that one guy that did that uh yeah that's seriously that happened a guy clearly trespassed uh but so having been up close and personal like it just doesn't look like something that should fly your brain just goes yeah like a water tower or a big giant holding tank when it flew when i saw it cleared smoke you guys have probably heard my video of me just screaming my face off my brain kind of broke because it just didn't look right it just didn't look right it just didn't seem real and ah yeah i don't know that was a fun day uh this this has a similar vibe to me though um do you think the crooked crooked flying makes the landing a lot harder for today i could see it tipping over at the end what the ckc i mean there's some dynamics in it that make it harder to control when you have a center an engine that's offset from the center of mass like it is harder it's going to be uh the cool thing though is a set an engine that's off center can induce roll so if an engine is going right through the center which spoiler most engines do unless they're if it's a single engine they're pretty much always in the middle uh but you know if you have uh you can have like two engines that are offset for instance the rd180 which is one engine has a single turbo pump but two chambers you can induce roll by by twisting your engines opposite each other and that will induce roll um along the z axis actually wait it's the x-axis of the rocket it seems backwards but it is the x-axis of the rocket um yeah i know i know it totally seems like z should go up through the center but it's x through the center z and y or i believe i have to remember i have a video all about that why do cylindrical rockets roll because you'd think they could just point over in any direction they wouldn't need to roll to like do anything because it's all arbitrary right but i have a video all about that which is pretty fun uh but yeah the the cool thing is though an offset engine like this can induce a little bit of roll by yawing and when you do that because it's offset that would that would create some torque on the rotational vector and uh yeah it was really funny though back in the day when i made that um space i'm gonna say space shuttle axis when i made that that uh the spatial coordinate system when i made that video i had people constantly saying you idiot why would you think you know the x-axis goes through the through the nose and all this you know people just like berating me about being an idiot and it's like well i trust that nasa has it right in all of their yeah so this is this is the way the space shuttle was here um and the space shuttle is indicative because it's based on the cockpit and don't forget on the launch pad you're sitting uh you know with your feet facing forward your head up and so that's actually your vertical axis even though you know your vertical axis is basically like through the top of your head which is pointing sideways so z even though the rocket's pointy and going up like that they actually consider the x-axis the what we're seeing is like the tallest part um is the x-axis and then through your head z and then out your arms basically is why so that's just the way it works it's kind of all based on airplanes um hence the cockpit aspect of it but you wouldn't believe how many people thought that they were correcting me uh by saying that so it's like i'm just following what nasa i didn't name it i didn't do it uh but that is the way they do it indeed so um man i'm hoping that we start seeing some action here otherwise we have to push our clock again so i'm not seeing any real signs of uh you know of tank clouds or anything like that yet so we will see we will see hmm let's keep going here with you guys it's venting grass [Laughter] oh there are there are condensation clouds on lab stream oh okay well in that case andrew why don't we go ahead and say ground clouds but they can't be those little ones it's got to be like the real ones like the ground tank farm clouds let me pull up their stream here quick venti grass is happening okay that's that's good to know that is good to know i'm sure most of you guys have multiple streams pulled up because that is the way that this stuff works these days um man i haven't actually i'm not seeing too much venting but maybe man yeah i don't really see venting yet but i don't know we might have to revoke that who knows um yeah i'm not seeing anything yet i i don't think we're at the i don't think we're at the real venting because there's always some oxygen kind of like bleeding off a little bit in the liquid oxygen tanks like there but then when they press it and actually get it ready you know you definitely definitely know um it's not just like some obscure thing it's like oh there is stuff happening for sure so um yeah that's a good neurostream that's a good point and a good question neurostream in our discord says i wonder if the mass simulator was offset in order to make it fly straighter up and down with the single offset engine that's a good point i would not honestly be surprised if the center of mass is slightly offset to make up for that offset engine i don't know why they wouldn't do that frankly to make it fly a little bit straighter um but then again i think we would have seen that in photos like i think people would have you know um yeah i think i yeah i would assume that someone would kind of uh you know people would have figured it out in the photos but alex diaz uh is it really gonna happen today we're trying man we have no idea like we're all in this together this is all just a ride if you are here with some high expectations tamp your expectations a little bit like don't hold your breath on this stuff we've seen how many times have we pulled up a stream thinking that it's gonna be going um and then nothing happens but the road's clear i mean they are trying as far as we're concerned um elon said he wanted to do it you know asap basically so we're we're definitely thinking that that this is the day you know so again don't get mad at me or lab padre or nasa space flight when when you sit here and spend a lot of time waiting for something to happen you're on the cutting edge of stuff you're you're on ground zero here so there's a very good chance nothing will happen and we just hang out together it's not a bad way to hang out on a monday night to be honest so um yeah um for that first epic interview with elon hey thank you very much that was that was a fun one it definitely isn't the last you know we had the the interview uh in the firing room right there right before dm2 with with elon and jim that was a lot of fun um i have to i have to admit something to you guys i assumed first i didn't know that jim was gonna be in the interview so i only had two audio packs so i had to wear like i had to record myself with an iphone which is hilarious um but i didn't know jim was gonna be there so i yeah so audio is already a mess but then in my head i'm like okay time with elon like let's talk about you know a lot of the stuff i was gonna keep it specific more to like spacex working with nasa right so um oh there we go there's clouds that's what we're talking about there those are some ground clouds that we can move into ground tanks clouds i'm still thinking we're within about this this is about 40 our countdown's probably pretty close it's probably within about 40 minutes oh baby that's what we're talking about there and it will only get more obvious from there too it'd only get more and more obvious so anyway this interview you know i went into it thinking like hey i was maybe gonna have five minutes of time and i was thinking i'm gonna squeeze out things about like dragon xl and starship lunar lander all these things you know that had to do with nasa because it was still nasa relations um and immediately as soon as i'm like yeah you guys threw a big surprise with us with the dragon xl and elon's like we're focusing on dm2 today and i'm like oh like all of my questions and the things that i wanted to talk about were like out the window in the first three minutes and then coming to find out i had 15 minutes with them which is never a bad thing like that's fantastic i am so thankful for that amount of time but in my head i'm like panic button just like freaking out because i didn't know that i was gonna have that much time and i thought we could talk about things other than dm2 because you know if like dm2 obviously i was more excited than that than that for anything throughout the year and literally my entire career is covering spaceflight that was the most exciting thing i've ever covered but like frankly i knew most of the things about it so it just feels disingenuous to me to be like so tell me about how is this racket gonna fly like i know i know the falcon 9 i know the the dragon capsule i've been inside the dragon caps like i know the system inside and out so there's very few things that i can ask questions about that i'm not just playing dumb being like no remind us about you know like so i had a bit of a panic so i hope the next time i'm with elon it's like we can just do whatever and i we're supposed to get a tour of the facility down here at boca chica um that's a lot of venting yes that's a good sign that is a good sign we got strong wind is gonna be flying into the wind it looks like yeah so hopefully the next one's even better we will see uh this is uh no i do not live in texas alex i live in iowa which is nowhere near texas so it takes 24 hours when i've driven down there previously thank you randy for the pair i appreciate that um and the membership here so now guys what we're gonna be looking for is we're gonna be looking for the rocket actually venting a little bit those are gonna be purging getting ready to fill the vehicle up and that is uh that's a good sign again that we're moving forward like i said i think our t-minus clock is is pretty close i think we're um notice we have a big ish next to it because we we can't tell within what will likely be within about five or ten minutes but it's not that accurate so don't get try not to get your hopes up too much uh and but so once we're done within like t minus ten we're gonna be all eyes we're all we also might adjust it a little bit um based on like the hearing the siren and things like that um yeah oh i'm so excited um how will it land on his legs if flying at a tilt so if assuming it does fly at a tilt it it'll come down at a tilt and then just kind of like go like this now my question is if it's flying and it has a lot of horizontal velocity it's going to have to cancel that velocity out by tilting even further this thing is going to fly really weird like it will be it'll probably take off and do a power slide right so it's going to do this so that it can pitch up and be at its about five degree angle while flying then it's going to translate over while flying 150 meters above the ground and then in order to cancel out its horizontal velocity it's gonna have to tilt even more back and then land at an angle and when it lands at an angle it'll start just on a couple feet and then they'll slowly kill the engine which will then tilt out and let it put pressure and uh on the other landing legs as well so yeah this this green silo has a bad attitude problem i like that let's see this is a good question from david willis how are you david uh hey tim how's it how's it going quick question uh why didn't they choose to go with three engines instead of one is it not more stable configuration since it doesn't rely on such a large gimbal absolutely david uh three would have solved a lot of issues but brought up other issues and right now i think they're just still on the point where they're wanting to solve one thing at a time so this is just the next iterative step attaching three raptors to it right now would just have a lot more things going on a lot more physical moving parts a lot more subsystems a lot more buttons and levers and knobs and gimbals and all these other things the idea is like let's just make sure our new architecture works let's make sure all of the systems on board can handle did i just see a little tiny puff from starship sorry i'm trying to keep my eyes peeled here um i don't think i did but uh yeah so sorry i'm okay so um so really they're just doing the path of least resistance that's been the entire philosophy behind this entire program is like one step at a time and so in this case let's prove that you know our quick disconnects will work because otherwise what you end up doing you know we saw what happens when the quick disconnects didn't work right um for seal number four it went kabumi why risk three raptor engines when we're still just trying to solve other things like the gsc the ground service ground service equipment you know there's so many other moving parts and things that they want to solve before they risk having three raptor engines and all the extra control schemes and all that stuff too there's a lot going on when they do this and and frankly actually three is kind of hard because the minimum throttle of the raptor engine is around 50 i don't know if we've ever gotten some kind of update from elon on the minimum throttle but it is actually deep throttling is an art of its own and it's um oh here we go guys hop in about 33 minutes and that was okay so it's probably right look at this look at this all right andrew adjust the clock for about 6 55 local yes yes this is why we think it's going on today this is why we think it's going on today oh no i'm gonna say we're all watching [Laughter] yes where's the look where's the eyes what is that under c no that's not it see now you guys are just watching me tweet this is weird eyes look i thought it was like look someone help me uh i'm gonna make it so you guys aren't watching me do this because that's just kind of weird too where is it i thought it's like c we'll get it pulled up um but maybe not um [Laughter] oh i'm so excited i am so excited why can't i find these eyes though i like losing my mind maybe it's not available here for some reason all right well i'm just gonna do a more generic thing than like the hands raised okay okay okay who's excited now who is excited now now it's there you guys you guys all have the eyes why don't i have the eyes whatever all right i'm gonna retweet that too retweet there we go i'm gonna okay you heard it guys oh man i am so excited let's see this let's see this baby fly today we're going to see a 30 meter tall grain silo take off on the ground and fly crooked so yeah we are we're in we're probably getting real close to seeing the um the venting from the rocket so probably within we tend to think it's around 30 minutes is when we see the burst of the rocket and yeah that will uh we'll see here so in the next probably minute or two hopefully we'll start seeing a little bit of venting coming from the rocket itself oh man i am so excited all right let me let me keep trying to get to you guys questions here i'm sorry that i may have lost some did i oh geez i can't tell oh wait okay uh where were we where were we um gosh sorry guys i'm trying to find um this isn't necessarily a joke about the proton but uh yeah uh it's all happened i don't even know when it happened i think it was i was playing kerbal space program or i was at a rocket launch or something and i was just like i'm here to oh that's what it was i was i don't know what it was like an atlas 5 or something i was like i'm here i'm just here my job is to confirm the pointy end is up and flaming out is down i think i said it on like an instagram story or something it's just kind of stuck ever since then um yeah uh let's hear yeah seriously it has been a busy busy busy week thank you very much struno that really means a lot um i'm trying i think i'm getting so far behind that i can't even catch up with like they're disappearing here from me so i'm really sorry if i miss you guys things they're they're getting kicked out crap i'm sorry guys i am losing some of them like neuro neurostream i just missed yours um huh members only shirt that's not a bad idea well we are working on a hoodie that has member patches that shows your insignia of what rank you are in patreon so that's going to be really fun um they look really really really really cool we're we're almost out of them they're actually going to be a future martian version so um so besides being taller and having a weight at the top how is serial number five different from star hopper well it's it's a lot more advanced it's a lot like star hopper's walls were thick it was heavy it was a chunky old boy and it was not anywhere near like properly flight ready right it was literally just like let's make some tanks throw some stuff in there and let's go with it you know like that's again the path of least resistance that's kind of been the whole philosophy behind the starship has been a philosophy in general for spacex kind of but specifically when when dealing with this stuff um it's it was the path of least resistance it was a very low fidelity prototype basically um it had enough uh you know enough propellant on board to be able to do the little hops um but yes i've seen from all my for all mankind and i loved it i thought it was awesome i think they're renewed for another season um but yeah so but back to the star hopper though was nowhere near really any kind of actual prototype now the seal number versions of this are getting to the point where they're you know they're pretty much on to like the actual uh manufacturing processes and the welds are legit and all that stuff is is legit so um it's just a lot closer to an actual flight vehicle uh thank you so much from from ouija truly top not not sure if you've answered this yet but when starship re-enters is there a heat shield or is it bare steel exposed to the plasma good question they will be having a heat shield still on the stainless steel on the on the windward surface so the leeward surface doesn't need it which is cool it doesn't need any insulation remember the space shuttle which was an aluminum frame had had still had to have those thermal blankets on the back of it so it didn't melt and destroy the airframe while the front side of the shuttle needed to have those thick silica tiles needed to have wings to keep it up in the upper atmosphere long enough so it didn't experience peak heating starship on the other hand can handle a higher peak temperature because it's using stainless steel and they're going to be doing a 300 x series like a 3ox that's a variant that is going to be made specifically by spacex for this vehicle and hopefully for cyber truck and currently they're at like 300 they're going to be going to a 300 304 l stainless steel which should have a little bit better properties at cryogenic temperatures but in general stainless steel is a good balance between really strong and cryogenic temperatures which is good because it has to handle high loads and a really good choice too for for re-entry because um in general oh man thank you so much math i really appreciate that sorry again sorry that i'm not keeping up with you guys this is insane i i really appreciate everyone and the new members and everything you guys are awesome um so you know having stainless steel though allows that they don't need as big of a heat shield so the heat shield on there uh is is presumably a lot lighter weight a lot smaller a lot more reusable um it's technically can ablate um meaning it can wick away but not as much as pika x we think they're using their turf rock or however you say it um so it's definitely uh meant more for for reuse in mind um is the rocket actually venting yet i haven't actually seen the rocket venting yet but i still think we're probably on yeah hopefully we're on target here um let's see this is awesome yeah so again i i'm sorry oh devin jason i don't want to miss this i love saying hi i love when families are watching this stuff together so devin how's it going i'm glad you're here tuning in to see history because this is this is a really cool deal this is this is a big deal here we're about to see spacex attempt their most advanced attempt to fly and hop their most advanced prototype to date if this goes well it's going to be full steam ahead towards a more finished prototype maybe we'll start seeing the elana rods as i call them the big flippity flappity airbreakery things you know that are mounted off the side of the the vehicle there's four of them in total i wouldn't be surprised if we start to see different statics like a static surface or or more like strikes or something along the top or the front um to to reduce complexity but um you know i think that stuff's all coming up here really really really quick um um good call andrew thank you um reminded me to make sure i have the live view audio pulled up nice nice and high when when it actually starts to take off so hopefully you know if this goes well today guys it's just full steam ahead we'll see hardware getting rolled out to the pad and more flights more hops more advanced prototypes where some of the stuff that's stuck on the outside goes on the inside and more raptors more power more everything it's time you know we are really excited to watch this come together um i i cannot draw on screen unfortunately but that's a great question um yeah i can't draw on screen but i probably should do that i know that dos does that sometimes huge shout out again to to my friends and and compadres i guess uh the other people in the field as well again that the bokeh chica mary uh obviously right now we have gene and rachel from space padre isle on twitter filming for us lab padres always done a lot of work and it's just an awesome community i do need to give a shout out though to das valdez who does work with nasa's space flight though das is dos is the reason that i kind of started straying from instagram i originally started doing twitch back in like 2016 because of dos he got me started on live streaming he would take phone calls and help me like learn how to live stream so dos is just an awesome guy he does a lot of behind the scenes work for a lot of people with just thanklessly like just he just does it out of the goodness of his heart i just really really like that guy and if you guys ever see him online das valdez um or on on twitch or on youtube or helping out with that's the space flight just tell them that i say hi uh and that i really have always just absolutely loved that guy and he's been a huge help big supporter of everyone and he's just an uh i just love that because again we're all team space like it shouldn't be a competition you know we're all watching history be made together and i just really really appreciate that so yeah sorry that was my rant about how cool doss is and nice das is um let's see here a question i thought spacex would said something to mars this window maybe a falcon heavy with some modified starling satellites with cameras you know i am surprised too that how cool would have been to send like 20 you know upgrade the infrastructure on mars i would not be surprised if next window we're absolutely going to see a falcon heavy launch a bunch of starling satellites so yeah guys this is looking good this is looking good sorry i'm like totally tuned in here um i'm kind of sorry that i'm a little bit behind here on discord and stuff too so um i love that we're about 20 minutes here from from a risky and fun flight so uh this is a good question will the raptor engine gimbal for the hop absolutely that's its main control authority is using the gimbal to steer it so think of like you know holding a broom on your hand where the center of mass is really high up and you have this long leverage and you can balance it uh using that that's almost the exact same control vector and control system you know just sitting there like steering like this and that'll help it not only stay stable and upright or tilt it about five degrees but it'll also make sure that it you know uh it's traveling in the direction it's it's wanting to travel so um let's see question do you know if there have has been any astronauts that had parents who were also astronauts example of paul astronaut having a son or daughter that's a good question that would be a i feel like that's a scott manley question does anyone know um i do not know that off the top of my head at all unfortunately i know there's astronaut families again bob and doug both of them uh have wives that are astronauts karen nyberg who's doug's uh wife is retired i believe uh but but bob's wife is going up in literally like six months or so or seven or eight months that's pretty amazing so um hopefully yeah so guys we're still waiting to see a few more bits of the actual rocket oh as i say that do you guys see that the raptor is venting let's go ahead and say rocket is venting they are definitely pressing fuel i definitely saw some condensation at the base which means the raptor is is going in for uh you know engine chill and things like that which means they're they're starting to really like there is fuel flowing through the vehicle um oh gosh i just love this stuff how can you guys not be excited even though this is who knows what we're gonna see today who knows if we're gonna see a big success i mean this is just just something to be excited about and just something to come together and cheer for again just some good news something that we can all strive to to either be a part of or you know just at least just take part in uh oh man thank you so much to leadfoot i really appreciate that that is beyond generous thank you so much um yeah someone asked if we could i missed it but someone asked if we could zoom out the problem is when we zoom out this is not a parafocal lens so if we zoom out it will ruin our focus and then zooming back in yeah the rocket is definitely venting this is good looks like that copv is topped off um yeah so we can't really zoom out or zoom in without ruining our focus and we just don't really want to risk that so um what are my thoughts on sls this is a great question um so uh can we can we get you guys a bit during the downtime before yeah i can size up a little bit too uh so my thoughts on sls i have a video that goes into the breakdown of like why does that celeste still exist um and the short answer is like i really wish it had come online about two or three years ago it would have a lot more beloved place i think in history uh helping to break in that overlap but now we're getting so relatively close with other vehicles of similar capacities coming online relatively soon that the you know the overlap might not be as great like if it had a seven year run of being the only super heavy launch vehicle i don't think anyone would question it if it's being put to work but if it only has about a two year run of being a super heavy operational super heavy lift vehicle it's just not as appealing so um i have a video about you know sls versus starship definitely watch that i've got more parts to do from it um yeah tim can you talk a bit more about serial number five's inner structure are tanks uh equipped with baffles to prevent fuel slash yeah there's some there's some baffles in portions uh there's they're relatively simple right now though there's not really um there's there's some portions like around the the skirt where the engine is the engine is up inside that uh around the around the skirt there's a lot of structural uh supports but when this thing's pressurized it actually adds a lot of rigidity and strength so it doesn't necessarily need extra barring on the inside or anything like that or sparring is that blanking on the word but uh you know just like a coke can or a soda can when it's full it's really hard to compress but when it's empty it's really easy you can just go you know like that so uh yeah good questions i'm getting i'm getting the butterflies already i really um so this is again it does have landing legs the landing legs are tucked up inside the skirt so right now you don't see landing legs you're seeing the launch mount where you can see sky underneath it that's all the launch mount the landing legs are tucked up there's six once it starts flying those landing legs will drop down and deploy and it's going to be absolutely wild and want to see if it works uh thank you very much um ooh this is cool i'm hoping it hops today because that would be an awesome thing to have happen on my birthday uh sidenote want to thank you tim for all this stuff since it's encouraged me to pursue an education to get to spacex see that's what i'm talking about that's right there what i'm talking about people being inspired you know and and wanting to change their own course because they want to help humans explore space get further into space go actually see other worlds for the first time go back to the moon and actually spend some legitimate time on the moon it's time we push our species forward and that's what we're hoping to see a very small step in today is is seeing a vehicle that's so advanced that had never been attempted before um you know there's a lot of technologies on this vehicle that were just considered kind of too hard to be worth it and the ultimate pursuit of full reusability although that's uh really really really hard to do i think this is a pretty good architecture they've proven spacex has proven they've made reusability work for their falcon 9 in an economical and viable way compared to the space shuttle which had the right idea but i wish the space shuttle had iterated more like they had done the first one you know uh got it out the gate there challenger wait what was the columbia was the wait i am blanking right now first flight was columbia right um sts-1 but i do wish that they had started with one seeing you know like what you know they did a little bit of iterations on it you know like of course like the heat shield there were a handful of iterations but i wish they had really just been more aggressive in those iterations and made it you know more and more look at that we are definitely still going this is great um so yeah i just wish that the space shuttle had iterated more to pursue reusability more and more and safety you know like injectable crew cabins and things like that i have a video again about abort systems if you guys want to know like why doesn't space space starship have an abort system should it um i definitely would recommend that because i go into a lot of the comparisons uh with with the space shuttle as well uh thank you rockstar rule that is awesome i really really appreciate that you guys i can't even keep up with you guys thank you so much for everything uh again i'm like literally losing these on the screen i can't even push them fast enough um i i really really really appreciate it i absolutely think there's going to be space hotels in the very near future like i think definitely in my lifetime there will be space hotels i think we're just we're just there do i think elon is in there he is absolutely here he said he's in boca control room hop attempt in 33 minutes that was 20 minutes ago so we're yeah we're looking at it um yeah i'm sorry again that uh that i'm missing a lot of you guys super chats i really really really appreciate it uh trying to get through these but we are just absolutely cruising firing on all cylinders right now so again if you just happen to be tuning in we do have a lot of new people joining us right now we're hoping and we're about 10 minutes away or so from seeing spacex's next rocket some of you maybe just for the first time yesterday or or the last two months saw your first space flight thing when you saw bob benkin and doug hurley fly on spacex's first crude mission that was the first time humans got on a spacex rocket was just two months ago right that was on a falcon 9 and the dragon capsule which is the dragon capsule's been flying since 2011 the falcon 9's been flying since 2009 or is it 2011 and 2013 um but you know those those are pretty well you know established systems well-established vehicles of course the crew dragon variants only flew for the first time in february 2019 but um but as far as like the architecture the the general um you know the general entire sense of the vehicle all that stuff is is easy easy relatively you know and it was a low-risk thing what we're seeing now is the next generation it's like the beginning of the next generation of rockets where they're going to be fully reusable like an airplane the land the two stages the first stage which will be huge which will be almost three times bigger than what we're seeing right now just the first stage uh you know will land be able to be refueled and take off again with 30 plus raptors 31 raptor engines on the bottom of it the raptor engine is spacex's full flow staged combustion cycle raptor engine um yeah it's it's exciting stuff guys and this thing is huge it's hard to tell you how big this is again nine meters wide it's about 30 feet wide it's around 30 feet 30 meters tall so about almost 100 feet tall this thing is enormous it's it's currently being filled with liquid methane and liquid oxygen uh which are the cool thing about liquid methane liquid oxygen they're relatively close in temperature at their liquid point and what we're seeing now is we're seeing venting from uh boil off of those propellants so when uh likely boil off from the liquid oxygen because when liquid oxygen goes from a liquid and warms up esp you know it's texas heat down here we're in boca chica texas and the texas heat you know when when uh when that stuff boils off it expands a thousand times in volume going from a liquid to an that's why they don't use gaseous oxygen because the tanks would have to be essentially a thousand times bigger which is clearly not practical way heavier and uh but yeah so we're seeing what we're seeing there is basically liquid oxygen boiling off and uh i don't think we've heard a siren yet i'm waiting to hear but uh yeah so that's normal that's totally normal all rockets do that especially those that have liquid oxygen so not maybe not a rocket with solid rocket boosters only like what the omega will be in the near future or like the minuteman or the um you know stuff like that but siren okay we've got the siren yes okay so yeah we're still on track for about t minus 10 minutes yes okay again i'm really sorry that i'm just absolutely um my kids were wondering if you could explain why stainless steel as build material yes so um again i have a video all about this why spacex went with stainless steel versus carbon composite or carbon fiber watch that show your kids that video i promise it'll explain a lot of these reasons right uh but the big thing is it can handle really extreme temperatures both it's very strong when it's at its cryogenic temperatures right now the liquids inside there are like minus 200 degrees celsius basically they're so cold if you touch the tanks right now your hand would freeze to it very very very cold so stainless steel gets stronger under cryogenic temperatures something that aluminum doesn't actually do too well aluminum at a certain point is is a lot is substantially weaker and same with carbon composite it does not necessarily love um being exposed to cryogenic temperatures it can be more it can tend to be more brittle same on the other end in extreme heat there's a lot higher melting point of stainless steel stainless steel can handle really high temperatures higher than aluminum higher than carbon composite and because of that don't forget that the big key to this puzzle is that this vehicle is intended to come back in from reentry and when you come back in from ranchers you just saw yesterday uh you know you experience temperatures of like 1800 degrees celsius half the temperature of the sun will be hitting this rocket eventually not this exact one but the later versions of this when it when it comes in for reentry um that's because the air can't get out of the way fast enough and the air ends up getting compressed when air gets compressed it heats up due to the laws of thermodynamics and next thing you know it turns into a plasma and it's just you know just absolutely crazy hot so therefore stainless steel has a higher melting point to begin with and then you add a little bit of a heat shield to it you make it so it's totally survivable through reentry as a matter of fact even like some deorbited centaur upper stages that are also stainless steel have survived mostly intact without any kind of like protection system on them because stainless steel has that high of uh thermal capacity so um yeah i love this this is this is looking good guys this is looking good again i'm sorry that i'm missing a lot of you guys um let's see uh no boats absolutely we've had bad luck with boats in the past uh yeah i think the coast guard is trying to do a little bit more look at that we got good venting at the top oh baby i am really excited so again remember our clock was based on elon's tweet assuming that's accurate we might be off by just a tiny bit but i think it's basically going to be right around you know 6 55 local basically so um yeah the drone is in the air apparently we do have audio i'll start bringing that up here a little bit we do have audio drone i think was spotted did someone say that the drone is spotted so they do have a they just literally have a camera drone again like i said it's likely a it's either a dji inspire one or two yes i should put on headphones so i don't get feedback it's headphone time baby okay i'm listening hopefully it's not too loud let me know if it's too loud but we're gonna let it this is awesome this is true orientation check for the proton was not a joke you are right uh will siri number six be the first with the nose cone uh we're not entirely sure yet uh we kind of think so but we're kind of waiting i think a lot of stuff will will be determined today you know um yeah if it's too loud you're too old it says ginger man 512 on our discord yes guys i am so excited i can't believe we're actually pushing forward still um the um how do they how do they simulate the one engine um offset flight um you i mean you can simulate anything in like physics simulators and stuff like that and just even doing old school math the apollo program people could have learned as a matter of fact i mean literally uh the wait was it actually did the apollo engine have a tiny angle on it uh the apollo was sent or was it just that it was offset from the actual center of the vehicle because of the offset difference in the in the fuel and oxidizer um but yeah it's something that you just take into account for you know where your center mass is in this case the again the engine is offset so when we see this thing take off expect it it might make a very scary looking like slide off to one side immediately because that engine is going to be gimballed it's going to be angled at a little bit of a degree because the engine is offset so if the engine was right in the middle of the rocket which most rockets do have this particular rocket doesn't because it's eventually designed to have three in the center all in a nice little triangle nice and tight around the center but um but oh sorry i'm like getting so excited okay so because this thing is offset and because it will tilt or whatever uh it's not going to fly straight up it's going to fly not only will its power slide a little bit like an atlas 5 does with a single solid rocket booster uh it'll do some power slide but then it will also once it gets up a little bit it's going to fly crooked it'll likely fly at like a five degree angle so um yeah oh man i yeah so we're gonna be tuned in again we we're pro we might be about a a minute off our timer could be a little bit off and there's always a delay from our camera feed down there compared to here just a little bit but okay so again i feel like every time i look up we have more people tuning in to try to figure out what's going on again this is a prototype rocket down in boca cheeka texas bokuchik is right on the border this most southern point basically of texas right on the border of texas and mexico and spacex has a whole as you can see a whole like prototype test pad here and they have a they're building rockets just up the road about two and a half three miles away which is about five kilometers away from here and that's where they're building these things they're building them in rapid succession now they're just it just iterating quickly these prototypes and this thing is huge this thing is nine meters wide 30 meters tall that's about 30 feet wide almost 100 feet tall this thing is really big it has one of spacex's most advanced rocket engine is their raptor engine which is a full-flow stage combustion cycle rocket engine and it's yeah it it has it's just it's going to be crazy and again like i've been saying it's going to fly crooked because this engine is slightly offset because the engine is not aligned with the center of mass the engine's a little bit off to the center and uh and so it's going to power slide a little bit likely fly a little quicker then it's going to go up 150 meters which is about 500 feet it's going to translate over it's going to land probably somewhere around what looks like the star hopper over there on the left bottom left portion of your screen but um but here we go we're really getting in so again t minus zero we're probably looking at about 655 656 depending on where we're at here um someone asked i just i just saw it i'm gonna go ahead and answer it um has is this the first time the raptor has flown no star hopper the little thing in the left corner of the screen flew last year in july and last year in august it did a 20 meter hop and it also did a 150 meter hop that was about exactly a year ago this is right coming up on that one year anniversary of the 150 meter hop we're seeing it again with a much more advanced prototype vehicle so star hopper was the first vehicle in history to fly with a full flow stage combustion cycle engine because there's only been two other engines that even demonstrated that full flow stage combustion cycle is possible if you guys are curious what the heck is full flow stage combustion cycle i already have a video called is spacex's raptor engine the king of rocket engines but i think we need to i need to be getting quiet here and really tune in but again there's i have a lot of videos if you guys need to learn about all of this stuff because there's a lot of things happening and a lot of it's really exciting so here we go we're probably literally within just a couple 30 seconds or so okay guys here we go and again we are actually filming this in 4k slo-mo 120 frames a second okay i saw a good question what is the thrust to weight ratio of this vehicle it depends on how much fuel they put into it oh that looks like de-tanking maybe but then again we've seen this before this could be pre-start-up shoot that looks like d-tanking ah shoot i don't think something was happy we'll see maybe it's not done yet don't give up on me yet but that very much looks like d tanking my guess would be something the engine didn't like something i think we got right there right down into we got right into it i think we got right into it and i think they went to go you know the rock is in a terminal account it's basically an automated countdown sequence and i just don't think it was it must not like something you know the other day we had a problem where the it was getting ready to spin up the turbo pumps and uh a valve wasn't working properly that stuff happens when when a vehicle's sitting there under extreme operating conditions but yeah this definitely looks like de-tanking although i'm not gonna look away i've learned my lesson dang it um well that looks like a detanged rocket rocket to me unfortunately now we have to wait and see um let's see i'm just gonna see here if we can get an answer d tanked um man yeah scrubs are cheaper than booms guys don't forget this is all very automated this vehicle is is literally you know it has sensors galore if something is out of family or something doesn't look right it's going to definitely like do what's safe and in this case it appears what's safe was de-tanking itself it didn't like something something just was not right on the vehicle oh man that's too bad it really seems like we're right there we are literally right there that is too bad so they might have time to refuel here they still have another hour in the road closure um let's see if elon happens to give any updates hmm obviously our crew is going to be staying out here to um you know to to see if we get another attempt and if it doesn't happen tonight it'll we'll be out there tomorrow or whenever the next attempt is man um good question ben unfortunately i honestly can't i i don't know much about the the tank farm all the i don't know why i think the the long ones the long low white ones those are the uh those are the liquid nitrogen tanks but i don't really know like why some are so big and some are so little you know i think they could have some of those are just nitrogen tanks some of them are um are helium some of them of course are liquid oxygen and liquid methane those are all the different gases and and fuels and everything on the vehicle um shoot i'm still just gonna refresh here make sure elon hasn't said something else oh man let's see will will spacex use laser tattooing to put uh nasa logo on starship like they showed on cybertruck that would be cool that would be really cool i would definitely definitely be a big fan of that idea um let's see so this is um do you think we'll see less venting since they're only filling up enough for a hop instead of a full pressure test so when they do the full pressure test they fill it to the brim with liquid nitrogen that's why you see all the frost on those pressure tests liquid nitrogen being cryogenic frost you know develops on the outside and they fill it all the way to the top with liquid nitrogen when they do static fires they barely have enough fuel to fill the bulkheads there's like bowls at the bottom of each tank right and if they you know fill just up to that amount you don't even really see the condensation on the outside just because and the icing on the outside that's why we don't see this vehicle look like it has much ice because there's just not that much fuel on the rocket so um let's see let's see again hmm yeah we're we're going to push the we're going to clear out our checklist here since we don't really know where we're at at this point again from a friendly reminder here this is not like a sanctioned thing spacex doesn't have press or media telling us you know they don't have press packets or a published launch time all the stuff we're just figuring out by looking at road closures by you know by paying attention to elon on twitter by looking at the progress of where the condensation is around the vehicle to know what's going to happen and when uh we wish we knew more information this is again a very this is just a prototype vehicle for spacex they don't really want us looking at it like this and scrutinizing it having multiple high-definition cameras pointing at it for when they do fail i mean it's not exactly um yeah it's it's not exactly um ideal uh yeah sorry about that uh java java guru i'm delayed way more than that i'm just manually trying to read these things uh and i just can't keep up with you guys you guys are are breaking breaking my brain breaking my computer but i love you guys and i'm so sorry again that i'm uh that i'm missing so many things and the they're out of order um but you guys are awesome thank you for sticking with me again i sincerely apologize if i miss um some big you know like my tesla adventure of course eli how are you my friend uh i have something to show you guys we have in the chat with us the author of adventures of starman that is my tesla adventure um that is eli how are you my friend eli's working on something really special specifically for our audience uh awesome comic book like legit comic book series i am just absolutely blown away by how awesome it is um yeah so if you guys haven't heard of that definitely check out the adventures of starman we love we love a good eli around here um so we're debating because they um i ran over my own headphone cord yeah we're trying to see at this point if um we're trying to see at this point if they are able to recycle and reassess um let's see when will the next falcon heavy launch happen and what's your uh your favorite rocket from history so i think so this is a terrible hard question it's a great question but terribly hard like i don't even want to answer it uh the next falcon heavy is currently net like end of 2020 end of this year so hopefully that happens don't be too surprised if it gets delayed a little bit just because it's space flight um so uh as far as my favorite rocket from history ah man i honestly it's somewhere between i mean how can you not love the saturn five saturn v is awesome but i think in a way i actually am a i better be careful saying this energia was amazing and also the n1 i mean those are two unbelievable rockets and i need to do dedicated videos on them i can't believe i haven't hey look that might be repressing that might be repressing or detanking the oxygen hard to tell that might be that d tank we will see um but yeah i don't you know i don't know i i'm somewhere between saturn five the n1 a nergia and falcon heavy i don't know can you have four favorite rockets an electron i don't know why electron just steals my heart but i have to say i actually like the anergia better than the space shuttle sorry i like liquid fuel boosters better than uh solid rocket boosters i think that's a more elegant solution uh it was a lot more it was a lot more the rocket portion uh besides the baron orbiter uh the rocket so yeah so verona nergia would be like i probably don't even know how to say it right because it's um i actually like it better than the space shuttle though sorry guys uh i just think it's cool it's fully autonomous in the 80s they had um they didn't end up really doing it but they had options to have like jet engine pods so it could extend its glide range and everything i just thought it was it was cool it was really really cool yeah that's that is an upcoming video it's braun vs space shuttle so stay tuned for that um i'll break it all down for you guys hot take i know hot take um hopper has one radar on top yeah there's there's there's a good amount of uh sensors actually on star hopper star hoppers become like a a little radio tower at this point because it has cameras and all that stuff um let's see um hi tim if starship works as planned do you think orion will still operate all the best from uh italian in an italian in finland is 235 wow yeah i'm going to tell you i have that video again about sls versus starship why does sls still exist so if you need to know a really deep rundown on why these two programs are overlapping and why it actually still makes sense to have these two programs overlap for a certain period of time yeah i absolutely um i do think orion will operate of course i mean it's built there's like a handful of them done if we built them and spent the billions of dollars to build them uh and didn't fly them i think that'd be a much bigger shame than being like you know what nah starship you know might happen in the future like orion is now sls is now like you can't argue with that um they're gonna be flying you know relatively soon the hardware is done starship is very much still in its infancy but growing quickly and and developing and iterating very quickly um insanely quickly so hard and hard to predict quickly that it's hard to really figure it out you know it's hard to predict this stuff but i it's hard to tell how um yeah how much overlap oh nice nice you got ken has a full year membership thank you so much i really appreciate you uh watching all my stuff um let's see this is a great question from epic space models how you doing epic space models how will spacex manufacture the propellant for the reaction control system on mars so so remember their eventual plan is to actually use um liquid methane liquid oxygen these are going to be hot gas thrusters what most thrusters use we'll go through a quick little history of thrusters the most simple is a cold gas thruster that's what's on top of the inner stage of the falcon 9 so you can see my rockets in the background you've sometimes seen when the booster separates from the upper stage the booster does a flip maneuver it has these little pods with four little rcs thrusters four little reaction control thrusters um and when it does that flip it's using that just using cold gas thrusters just literally just compressed nitrogen it's not very efficient super simple super elegant no big deal um besides that a lot of most satellites will either use monoprop which is just a um a propellant that reacts with a catalyst and will have a chemical reaction against a catalyst and therefore it gains a little bit of efficiency but all you have to do is open up some valves then it will fire we were talking about that yesterday with the super draco's i talked about that in my video about how you come back down from orbit um but then the most common is a buy prop and so right now this vehicle has on it actually cold gas we would think it has like some a couple uh nitrogen co copvs and um and then on top of that uh oh what a condensation okay cool um but as far as uh what eventually is going to happen on this vehicle it will eventually use the liquid methane and liquid oxygen um so the propellants that are onboard so they'll be able to manufacture liquid oxygen and liquid methane on the surface of mars using the sabati a process and right now what's heading to mars as we speak of course perseverance is heading to mars as we speak ooh there is some venting again from the rocket notice below the rocket there is engine chill down again that's good um i think we need to go to um rocket venting i i hope this is a reset i really hope this is a reset oh it has been there for a while i did not see that and we don't see other um [Music] yeah if we're only seeing a little bit of residual there and then just that you know the big flare over to the side i don't know i wish we could put a big old fat ish maybe andrew throw a maybe question mark over top of the rocket venting because i don't know we have no idea where we're at right now we don't have any real assessment hoping that elon says something but um yeah the trifecta here this is awesome watching everyday astronaut lab padre and nasa's face but at the same time on your triple screen that's awesome um yes again just keep your keep your love flowing for those people i mean everyone's working so hard on so many different aspects of space flight and i just love the whole community it's so awesome to see uh what everyone's doing coming together so i love that people do say like you're stealing views it's like most people have more than one device in their house there might be a couple people that are only watching a single device and for those make your pick of whoever you know whatever commentary whatever view you like best no harm no foul no you know it's all good it's all in the family obviously like we're all here just to witness history but um as far as like i know most people will have like a laptop and their tv and their phone and they have all screens pulled up so i totally get it i think that's so cool and there's the trifecta like that um yeah i like the idea of stealing views people forget that uh i was live streaming this stuff last march march of 2019 with checklist just like this basically um this is there's nothing novel about any of this stuff all of us are just doing something that we enjoy and are here to provide the community um with access so um yeah um thank you so much to uh stephen oh and i should probably stephen i appreciate that really i should probably go back real quick to the the hot gas thrusters though i do have some questions and i really hope that elon answers uh some of these sometime i here's my theory ready for this theory if you have you know those small header tanks or the little not the header tanks the um yeah the header tanks little slosh tanks basically that can be under different pressures you could also have like copvs still inside the rocket that also still just hold higher compressed liquid and uh liquid oxygen and liquid um and liquid methane and then you can feed those out to uh you know to your your reaction control systems because otherwise if you're running your reaction control systems off the main pressure you're limited to three bar and it's just not a lot of thrust and it's not very efficient to have those low of operating pressures for a rocket engine you're much better pressing up three bar is what the tanks are at the the inside the combustion chamber of the raptor engine is near 200 bar 300 bar they're working at 300 so they're like 276 right now uh it's substantially higher and because they get more thrust you get more power you get more higher efficiency so running cold gas or the the hot gas thrusters off of 3 bar would be very bad so i think it'd be cool if they used a tesla motor had a copv and ran a pump and actually whenever you know whenever there's spare time or whatever when they need to recharge you could recharge that copb in you know ingest in a low pressure uh liquid oxygen and liquid methane press continue to pressurize with a rechargeable battery you know solar panels re and just continually repress your rcs rcs system so it's almost like pump fed you know take a little bit of a note from rocket lab and pump fed engines right electrically pump fed engines but instead of feeding the the actual little reaction control engines which would have a little bit of a delay instead you just you have like a holding tank like some kind of auxiliary tank that is just there to rapidly fill up and continually repress and then you can still have your your quick reactions of your reaction control systems but you still have to have an ignition source so there still actually has to be um some kind of spark or something like that in your ignition source so we're still hanging in there guys to see what exactly um this makes me laugh look look at mr muscles over here crushing cans with his bare hands can't get doesn't if you have an empty can isn't it fairly easy to crush it i mean obviously i'm super strong so i i get it but again we're just happy to see this thing still vertical um let's see do i have a video comparing orion versus commercial capsules not really ish because so far the commercial capsules are not meant for anything but low earth orbit people were mad at me for not including orion when i did uh the starliner versus dragon orion is serving a completely different purpose it's a totally different vehicle than starliner and then crew dragon capsule it's it's meant for deep space it's meant for the moon um it's it's never intending to go to low earth orbit there's no real reason or possibility for it to go to low earth orbit so it's just a different vehicle um there's not really anything commercially competing with it right now eventually starship should and could compete with it but yeah um we're just still waiting guys again it's it's better that we're that this vehicle is standing even though it didn't do what we wanted to see you know we're just happy um happy that we're seeing something so um let's see that's awesome that's very cool i'll take that little history fact um you guys are awesome again thanks for sticking in here and hanging out with us um guys i might take a real quick little little break i'll leave you guys with the feet up here don't go anywhere though we're gonna i'm just gonna top off on some water and uh and i will take like a i'll take a couple minute break but but don't miss me too much um again thank you to all the super chats you guys are awesome and the new members um and i'm still gonna do you know i always do launch day codes i don't have it up right now but because i'm wearing this shirt if you guys do want to get uh your own pointy end up flamey and down shirt i will make that 10 off on this break so you can go over to shop.everydayastronaut.com for the next 24 hours and get 10 off the pointy end up flaming down down shirt um which is using coupon code launch day all one word all lower case and again while we're in the shop we do have new keychains again everything is actually fulfilled manually here in the united states we don't do print on demand these are all hand printed hands sewn out in long beach california this is the new raptor hoodie this is like super premium stuff now we have uh a sleeve reminding you of the pressures and all of the you know the specific impulse the thrust of chamber pressure of the full flow stage combustion cycle engine new sew-in tags custom hoodie strings like these are these are premium things i'm really excited uh to get these out to you guys and of course this is my current favorite because this has to do with starship but this is the future martian society shirt um that which has the uh arcadia planatia on it which is where starship hopefully will land someday on mars arcadia planatia with the exact coordinates and it even has on the sleeve it shows you what the oxygen and the gravity and all of the things on mars are uh this is definitely my one of my new favorite shirts i think it is my new favorite shirt uh but you can pick that up by going to shop.everydayastronaut.com or if you need to cover your your your face hole we have face hole not a masks they're just they're just masks but they're face hole not a face will cover not a mask so if you have a face hole you need to cover it uh yeah you can grab that those are those are based off of different things like normal which of course is a saying around here for fun but we have the hatch from the international space station as well right there and we also have this is a sample return thing that was on the apollo missions so yeah we got it we got it nerdy for you if you want to be if you if you need to be a nerd while you're out and about grocery shopping stuff i've got you covered i won't let you down but yeah there you go i'm going to take a real quick break for you guys um thank you guys again for hanging out i'm going to try to assess and see if we can get more answers from elon and twitter and get a new t-zero time and see if they're still going for it tonight i really hope they're going tonight because tomorrow is my dad's birthday i was planning to go spend some time with my family tomorrow and when we do these things all day i'm basically just sitting here like is it going so i really hope it goes tonight just so i can have tomorrow often and and relax and not be worried about it constantly uh and worried about like leaving so um yeah the venting from starship has been happening the whole time so um we're still waiting to see where they're at so hopefully we get an update um i'll be right back i can't wait for you guys it's not gonna work this time if when i come back and everyone's like you missed it you missed it it's not gonna work because i won't miss it i will have known if i missed it because it would no longer be on the pad it'd be on the landing pad it'd be a different position so you won't be able to trick me your tricks won't work this time chat i'm not gonna fall for it not gonna fall for it nice try nice try silly gooses we'll see in a minute [Music] so so [Music] so so so so so so so so so [Music] you so um did you guys miss me you guys miss me or not i can't wait here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes i i know it's coming i know it's coming why why are we trying to crash youtube servers at this point [Laughter] oh you guys can't fool me what i should do is i should fool you guys i should flip this screen around and make it so the flamey end is up that's what i should be doing filters you know effects let's see if i can like i don't even know if i can do that i don't know how to do that crop pad hmm let's see scaling maybe crop no oh that i don't i don't know i can't even prank you guys you guys goofy mcgoobers let's see i swear uh yeah this is in reference to the other day i should probably give a quick little update in case you happen to be tuning in you don't know what's happening here's what's happened so far again we are waiting uh very patiently we have our patient's pants on don't we everyone look down make sure you're wearing your patients pants because we are hoping to see spacex launch their launch i'm going to very loosely say launch because it's only going to go 150 meters up about that same amount of distance horizontally it's just a very very short hop 150 meters which is about 500 feet up um i'm not gonna be anything too crazy as far as that goes but but it is wild i mean this is as cutting edge as this stuff gets right now because this is spacex's starship prototype vehicle so again we do have uh starship progress for you guys here now that everything's all changed in the world um i'm gonna put this down here i don't know what i'm doing i i need an adult so this is where we're at you know of course this is what spacex has been working on for so long uh they really since the beginning of 2019 they've been working on different prototypes with only one having flown so far that was star hopper which you can see in the bottom left-hand part of the screen you can see the starhopper prototype but that flew last year twice since then we've seen two mock-ups basically the mark one and mark two we've seen four pressure test articles we've seen three full-scale prototypes all fail completely utterly fail not be good but we they learned something from it and that's what it's all about and today uh we're hoping to see i liked it better up here i feel like it's less in the way um and today we're hoping to see the 150 meter hop of this vehicle this vehicle again it's stainless steel it's uh it has one of it's running on methane liquid methane liquid oxygen it is uh running it has a single raptor engine which is the uh which is the most uh let's see um it's it's arguably the most advanced rocket engine in the world it's a full flow stage combustion cycle methane powered rocket engine and uh it has very high efficiency very high specific impulse it has the highest chamber pressures the most pressure inside of the engine uh that's ever been they broke the record officially it is the most um yeah as far as that stuff goes and that's and chamber pressure pretty well correlates to being able to have other things um yeah sorry we're kind of waiting to see at this point so yeah at this point we're all just kind of waiting to see if there's anything else i don't know um good call hang on let's tell andrew that there we go we had a we had a lowercase n apparently in our serial number uh eight or both of those are lowercase sorry to the world of people that want perfection [Music] oh okay let's see we did we got a review from elon let's see what how did i miss that no we didn't [Music] we didn't get anything from elon yet but yeah we do want this thing we do want this thing to do something tonight and again they normally only have about 30 more minutes left in their uh where they can actually do this stuff so we'll see we'll see [Music] let's see does is the amount of lift produced by the raptor engine is linear i.e just one raptor equals 200 tonne i mean 10 raptors equal absolutely yep the more you stick on there the more thrust you get they don't like take thrust away from each other but what does happen of course is the more wrapped your engines are the more hardware you have that the more uh heavy your vehicle is and the lower your thrust-to-weight ratio ratio can be it depends like you know engines weigh something right so but the the fixed thruster weight ratio of raptor is probably somewhere around 110 to one um as far as this thruster weight ratio but the merlin engine is a lot closer to 200 to one so the merlin is actually the highest thruster weight ratio of any engine really ever been that's been produced um yeah oh this is so cool too sorry again i'm trying to i'm missing so many of your guys's tips i i sincerely apologize uh but chaos dispenser says my tenure or my nine-year-old son joey is glued to the stream with me can't get enough space streaming that is awesome he's in luck then because this year especially this summer has been a very very very busy summer for space flight i mean we have seen some awesome things i hope that a lot of people were inspired and saw the you know dm2 launch and landing uh how awesome was it just to see a new spacecraft actually doing something again and and doing it cheaper and sexier and cooler and more capable than before you know um been here since my single stage to orbit video and i'm excited to study comp science at uw madison maybe i'll work on starling someday keep with the great work opinions on seal number eight awesome keegan first off congrats uh thanks for sticking around for so long see the ssto video is over two years old that's near the beginning of my youtube career um but yeah that's awesome congrats on on working in compsci my opinions on serial number eight i don't really have too many opinions yet because i don't really um i don't really know too much about it other than hopefully it's the first one that has substantial amounts of hardware on it um but we'll see so yeah the the road the window can kind of be extended except for as long as the the no tam the actual um faa clearance whatever that actually goes to but yeah i don't really have a strong opinion seal number eight from the outside looks almost identical to serial number five here and serial number six i mean we're just kind of waiting to see what hardware gets all of the things you know uh or what which vehicle gets all the hardware which one vehicle gets all these upgrades and hopefully we see the things like the alana runs that the flippity flappity air breaky things uh installed on on one of these vehicles soon i really want to see that 20 kilometer hop happen asap uh is time i'm just ready to see some some more exciting action we get so spoiled because you know um just got stung by six bees while cutting the grass got in the live stream during horn blasting fate told me to watch this great content thank you so much lucas uh sorry about your bee stings i hope you're not allergic and i hope you're doing okay um let's see here better to be safe yes of course you know scrubs are cheaper than booms again this is all automated though there's computers that are reading every sensor everything if if anything's looking off the computer is going to call an abort and that's likely exactly what happened so we will see um yeah same with this positive thing is that that thing didn't explode that's exactly right otherwise we set back quite a bit um and again here we go here's my tesla adventure how's it going thanks for saying hi thanks for hanging out with us today um yeah um this is uh elana spacex king of king of the cliffhanger thanks for all the content i will tune in next episode for sure yeah how's it going brian thanks for always tuning in thanks for always saying hi i really appreciate that yeah i mean again hopefully we see i i don't know if we'll see something happen tonight still got my i'm holding my breath a little bit but we'll see like i said i don't necessarily want this thing to go off tomorrow tomorrow's my dad's birthday was hoping to hang out with the family during the day go hiking and all these things we kind of had a day planned and i don't want it to be totally uh stuck in purgatory so um this is yeah we don't i don't think again the hop is how far it travels it travels 150 i don't know if unless maybe the ceiling the 150 meters is the ceiling of where the vehicle can travel but i don't know actually i don't know what the actual certification is but uh but we'll see we'll see um we have a question in our discord from daily con asking how much the serial number seven way we don't know how much any of these things really weigh other than uh the last we knew for sure is they were hoping to someday get below like 120 tons uh with all the engines on it and everything no idea where these are at right now these might be substantially lighter but um yeah so um let's see here third and last try can you replace the sls core and boosters with a super heavy booster and should spacex offer a bid to do so rockets are not kerbal space program unfortunately it's it's not as simple as just sticks you know throw this in there swap that around blah blah blah it just doesn't work that way um i would love to see that but if you change the booster you change the entire system because don't forget the sls center core the core needs to go almost to orbit it's virtually orbital by the time it's intentionally left slightly shy of orbit so that it deorbits but the sls is a totally different vehicle if you swap out the the fuselage now your everything is totally different your upper stage you would you know you'd have to have a lot higher thrust upper stage a single rl10 engine surely is not going to cut it um so it's just totally different we can't just swap you know ev everything is different your ground is service equipment you have to now have methane instead of liquid hydrogen your ground vehicle you know the actual crawler would have to be totally different the the tower the umbilical tower would be totally different everything would be totally different rockets are just not plug and play um it takes a lot of consideration that's why a vehicle like start like like uh like sls was all had to be planned out before they really put the pen to the paper and before they actually started or rolling metal it literally all had to be thought out and say okay here's what we're doing here's our final plans now those plans affect this this this this and this a hundred different things right change any one thing you change at all basically um so rockets just aren't some of the there's not plug and play like that so um let's see here this is a good question from from peter is spacex reclaiming the methane i notice there isn't a flame column to burn off the extra methane so they're now pumping it they're now recycling or compressing the methane to keep it to keep it liquid um they no longer need the flame stack to to flare off the the boil off but um i think they do recycle when they when they end up de-tanking uh they're able to recycle that back into the system i believe i need to maybe be corrected um yeah so um nothing let's see here ksp you want me to play some kerbal because now we're kind of bored watching paint dry again we're back in hurry up and wait syndrome um this is interesting have i looked at doing a video about the crude venus flyby mission uh that were studied by the us and the ussr back in the 70s i actually don't know anything about that that sounds frankly fascinating to me and maybe i should look into that uh but yeah i don't actually know too much about it uh obviously it says this is news to me but yeah um let's see here this is from candlelight i appreciate the work you guys do on the ground there'd be no way for someone like me in the uk to otherwise keep updated on such uh a detailed scale love this community i do too again uh just huge thanks to everyone for tuning in and being part of this community uh thanks to all the other the other journalists and other people working hard to provide constant updates for everyone oh it's all snowball all ships rise with the tide if we all are excited about this it makes for a an educated and smart you know community where we're all teaching each other things learning together driven you know off all of a sudden like we've seen people here today in the in the chat saying that they changed their career because now they want to work on getting humans into to mars getting humans into space getting humans back to the moon you know it changes lives literally i don't mean to sound like some kind of like you know some kind of like i don't know um it's i really honestly don't know uh what that's like yeah i don't i don't know how i hope that doesn't sound super cheesy but it just really is that important that we're all coming together and and cheering for something and and uplifting and collective conscious collective education you know this is all this all matters for our future the future of humanity if we have an educated uh world and if people are able to uh figure out really complicated things just look how much progress humanity's made in the past hundred years right this is this is one of those things when people say things like sorry i'm gonna go on a mini rant but when people say things like why spend a billion dollars on a rover to mars when you could spend that on x y and z well when you get people together to solve a problem that's very very very difficult right that is totally tangentially unrelated to anything you get people some of the smartest people focus on these very narrow niche things right and the money spent first off the money spent in space isn't thrown off if you put a billion dollars out of a thing and throw it up into space and it's a billion dollars in cash gone that money is obviously spent on on people on well-educated people on on hardware on you know companies it stays here on earth that's an infrastructure built on earth that gets launched into space but all that money is spent down here by high paying salaries for people working in these in the industry uh so it's generating revenue in that sense but the bigger picture is look at a hundred years ago no one even the richest people in the world did not have air conditioning did not have water filters did not hardly have running water still hardly uh they didn't have telephones they didn't have all of the modern conveniences of today nobody had like literally no matter how rich you were it wasn't you just couldn't have these things because they hadn't really been developed or invented and that's just part of progress of humanity is pushing the envelope on these really fringe sometimes fringe technologies that get applied later on in different ways you know think about how many things have trickled down because we had to figure out how to keep someone alive in space how do you how do you make food like so here's here's a question how do you solve world hunger just solve world hunger guys just go do it just solve it plan some stuff and just figure it out solve it well i don't think you can just solve it otherwise we would have figured it out obviously people want that people don't want people to be starving but for instance how do you have a crew live on the surface of an inhabitable planet for two years solve that now that's something you can have a narrow enough frame of mind to actually solve and i'll bet you the technologies used to solve how to have humans live on the surface of mars i'll bet you that technology would spin off and have huge implications here on earth just like reclaiming water you know we were able to drink out of the filthiest water um on our earth on earth because of some of the technology spun off by nasa and spun off from the space industry but you know there's so many things like that that the the even the the people some of the most people in the highest amounts of poverty still on average but if you're at the poverty line in the united states you still have like usually air conditioning a cell phone refrigerator all these things yes i'm not saying that your life is fantastic but it certainly is better off than it was a hundred years ago thanks to technology and that's it's hard to it's hard to grasp and hard to really push forward without pushing the envelope this humanity does not move forward we don't march forward unless we're pushing the envelope and trying to get humans to live on mars or live sustainably on the moon or live sustainably in space yeah that pushes envelopes that makes us think that makes us do new things we've never attempted never tried before and that matters all that stuff comes down makes again for a higher educated workforce higher educated population and that stuff matters um you know i i think you can look back at any point in human history you know at one point humans were trying to just simply cross a creek and they maybe made like a little stick bridge and then we tried to cross a bigger river so they made like a little floaty boat thing and then they tried to cross like bigger bodies of water and they got all that stuff so um looks like we had a full-blown abort today hold on scrubbed for the day unfortunately um let's see here it's scrubbed everybody let me show you guys this a raptor turbo pump spin start valve didn't open triggering an automatic abort we'll figure out why and retry tomorrow there you go guys there you go but yeah that's my rant is you know that is in our nature is to go and explore space right and go this is just the next thing we've explored earth we've we cross ponds and we cross oceans and we you know went to the depths of the ocean we've just all of that stuff the next step of human exploration is getting out there amongst the stars and this is a very beginning step of that um again i'm really sorry that i have missed almost all of um matthew i'm not going to produce a thank you for flying spacex if you don't notice my merchandise i don't do things that are like branded to like spacex or nasa i don't i want them to do that that's their brand that is their entity i don't sell things that say spacex i sell things that are nods to spacex nods to nasa um not to their vehicle not their hardware not to their engineers but i don't want to be riding those coattails per se that is absolutely for spacex to do that is 100 for spacex to do let's see here real quick i got to say this hello to michaela thank you guys for watching again if you are a family that's tuned into a television waiting to see a rocket fly uh a prototype rocket you are an awesome family and uh yeah you are making a huge difference in the future just by getting your kids and your entire family um you know involved in all this stuff because it definitely matters oh man yeah all right guys i'm gonna head out of here so that i can get some dinner um again i really really appreciate everyone for sticking around hopefully tomorrow we actually see this thing fly hopefully we get a decent time to see this thing fly because i have to hang out with my dad tomorrow worse goes the worst i'll have this stream up without my without my absolutely stunning face no uh there's a chance like that i might not be able to attend and if that's the case i sincerely apologize but we'll be able to pull up the stream if we need to um but it just won't have commentary so yeah um thank you guys so much for for hanging out and again if you want to support me and continue to help me continue to do what i do uh please consider becoming a patreon member by going to patreon.com everydayastronaut we can hang out in our discord channel hi discord love you guys um and you know all of that stuff so it definitely helps us continue to make better products here um keep keep the whole thing moving keep the whole thing moving forward so we can provide better coverage for you so we can make more videos answer more questions and just all around have a great time together so uh patreon.com everydayastronaut really appreciate it guys consider doing the same thing for nasa space flight and lab padre big resources for the space community so um of course and thanks to them as well but uh yeah and also again like i said today uh i'll probably do it tomorrow again if you want um if you want 10 off of your shirt uh the pointy end up flamient down shirt is 10 off if you use coupon code launch day by going to shop.everydayastronaut.com uh yeah that's uh that's where you get it right there pointy end up playing me and down and like i said we do have new merchandise so get yourself some merchandise that's another fun way to support what i do if you guys want shop.everydayastronaut.com but i just want to thank you guys for tuning in and hanging out and again i'm so sorry that i missed like so many things uh i i really just can't keep up when there's this much stuff um i really really appreciate you guys though so thanks for thanks for watching paint dry with us hopefully tomorrow we see something happen so all right i love you guys thank you so much for hanging out and uh that's gonna do it for me i'm tim dodd the everyday astronaut bringing space down to earth for everyday people bye everybody you
