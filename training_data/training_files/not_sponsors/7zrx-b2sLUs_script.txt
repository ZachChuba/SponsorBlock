now that we know what heat pumps are and how they work it's time to talk a little more about their future if you've not seen the first video well you definitely should fix that before watching this one as there will be a lot of stuff we talk about here that assumes prior knowledge i'll summon a card bippity boppity card great a link is below and probably in a pinned comment too you ever heard about those they're neat i want to start with a clarification of sorts heat pumps definitely are the future of home heating at least if i can help it but they're also not new and some people hate them it seems for every person who thinks heat pumps are wicked neato closest thing to free energy out there devices that's me there's another who hates theirs with a passion allow me to submit that you don't hate your heat pump you hate your thermostat see as we learned as the outdoor temperature approaches freezing it gets harder for air source heat pumps to work a smaller temperature difference between the source of heat and the evaporator absorbing it causes the efficiency of heat pumps to drop and eventually their output as well unfortunately it is under these precise conditions that the demand for heat goes up it's kind of a bummer so most systems with heat pumps have some sort of backup heat source be it electric resistive heat often this is called the heat strips though i prefer to think of it as a giant hair dryer or a fuel fired furnace might be utilized the trouble is until quite recently the thermostats controlling these systems would just run the heat pump as hard as it could until the output wasn't enough to maintain the set point only then would they switch to the auxiliary heat that meant that air coming out of your heat fence would get milder to the point it was barely heat at all before the thermostat gave up and switched heat sources that is undoubtedly annoying and if you've lived with a heating system that behaves like this i can see why you wouldn't like it but it doesn't have to be that way and it's not the fault of the heat pump instead of trying to run the heat pump until it just isn't enough anymore a more thoughtful thermostat could handle things more thoughtfully if the heating system can determine its current coefficient of performance it can determine whether it makes sense to run the heat pump in the first place you could even program at which cop it should switch to auxiliary heat that would allow you to prioritize comfort energy costs or emissions now if your backup heat is electric any cop greater than one will benefit you from a cost and emissions perspective and that's largely why these systems will use the heat pump as long as they possibly can it's saving you money you one group but you can still use this to force the backup heat on before you notice the output falling if that's what you really wanted if you have natural gas or some other fuel as your backup heat you could choose to input the cop that is your breakeven point on cost now here in the chicago area we have pretty cheap electricity and pretty cheap gas by my calculations you need a cop of about four in order for a heat pump to beat the cost of gas here that's certainly achievable on many winter days with a heat pump and certainly in the fall and early spring but many times it isn't and if you had a thermostat which was aware of the current cop and could switch to auxiliary heat based on it well you'd be able to optimize for heating cost just compare your costs of energy sources figure out what the cop break-even point is and set your system up accordingly this is actually a legitimate use for smart thermostats even if the heating system can't determine its own cop which many simpler systems can't that can be reasonably predicted based upon outdoor temperatures and system specs a thermostat that can determine outdoor conditions can use this to its advantage and knowing the outdoor humidity can even help but determine how often it needs to defrost the outside unit of course this can be done locally with a temperature and humidity sensor but if your thermostat were aware of the current energy mix on the grid in your area it could also help reduce emissions by bending the cop changeover depending on what's advantageous ideally we'd have some sort of pricing structure where the cost of each energy source was related to its emissions but that's getting deeper than this video needs to go oh and speaking of defrosts if you have a simpler heat pump system you might be very aware of when that happens because the outdoor unit makes a tremendous racket if that's a reason you don't like heat pumps you should know that this is also not a necessary thing by any means a lot of domestic hvac stuff is controlled with little to no brains if you will often the thermostat is literally the only thing in control of the outside unit and simpler systems will just slam the reversing valve while the compressor is still running and that's what's causing that racket if instead the compressor were stopped before it reversed allowing pressures to equalize it would be much less noticeable that's how this mini split heat pump does it and to my mind that's obviously better i also can't see how changing the direction while the compressor runs isn't somewhat rough on it but apparently it's not so bad because lots of systems do this very thing anyway the point here is the little annoyances you may have with your heat pump system are probably nothing to do with it being a heat pump instead it's simply bad design or a case of misaligned priorities in my opinion air conditioning systems like the one i just installed that have no reversing capabilities should not exist there is no reason this device cannot provide low emissions heating other than a few components are missing from it which made it slightly cheaper to build this is a case of but sometimes thinking leading to the embrace of less flexible systems for virtually no reason and it's dumb yes in my climate there are many days in the winter where an air source heat pump would leave me in the cold and that's a terrifying prospect i completely get it nearly everyone around me has natural gas or occasionally propane heating because in the deepest depths of the winter you frankly need it but since nearly everyone around me also has central air conditioning for our sweltering hot summers they already have a heat pump but it can only go one way because as of now few people see the point of redundant heating systems when you have cheap natural gas anyway but since whenever the cop of a heat pump exceeds 2.5 we can heat our homes with less fuel burned and ultimately lower emissions why would we not want to make the air conditioner reversible for the many days of the year when that's absolutely possible well frankly the biggest barrier right now is direct cost to the consumer as i said in my area unless you can get to a cop of four it's just not cost effective to run a heat pump over burning natural gas and since there are many many days in the winter where that cop is a lofty goal even if running the heat pump is more climate friendly it may not be more wallet-friendly the added cost of a heat pump may never make financial sense in my area no matter how small that added cost might be at least so long as externalities remain free to energy providers too deep alert and that is why they're not standard equipment around here yet but it should be noted that the financial practicality of a heat pump will depend entirely on your cost of heating fuel if it's not natural gas or even if it is but it's more expensive for you that math will be different now if i were king i'd proclaim that every central air conditioning system sold must be reversible it's equipment with a 10 to 20 year service life and who knows what the availability and cost of heating fuel will be in 2041. plus we keep making strides in system efficiency and air source heat pumps are becoming viable in colder and colder climates in fact i just read a piece on their use in alaska it can absolutely be done even up there but if you really want a heat pump to work in the coldest of the cold using the least amount of energy you gotta go underground look down see that it's the ground turn around there's a human sk sorry thinking of something else you know how we have water pipes going every which way underground and even in the dead of winter they don't freeze usually well that's because the earth is warm dig just a few feet below the surface and you'll find the frost line below this imaginary line the ground doesn't freeze where that line is changes depending on where you are but it's there management was just really bad about marking it when they built the place since heat pumps are great at extracting and concentrating heat energy from relatively cool places and since there's a place right below our feet that doesn't get cold enough to freeze water no matter how cold it is outside if we could just get the heat energy from that place to the evaporator of a heat pump we could get more than enough heat to warm our homes no matter what time of year it is and wouldn't you know it this is a thing we know how to do ground source or geothermal heat pumps scavenge heat from the ground below the frost line there are two main ways to do this and both involve using an intermediary fluid to transfer heat energy and yes some newer ideas don't use an intermediary fluid but we're not talking about them today instead of an outside unit like this with a large fan driven refrigerant to air heat exchanger these systems will have a refrigerant to liquid heat exchanger there's no law saying evaporators have to look like this after all inside your home the equipment doesn't look too much different from a normal furnace or air handler but the compressor and sometimes there's more than one as well as both heat exchangers are all right here and to those worried about noise from the compressors don't worry there's plenty of sound deadening engineers are smart what's special about these systems is where they're getting their heat from a long closed loop of piping filled with a mixture of water and antifreeze is pumped in a circuit out of the home and underground where the liquid will absorb heat from the earth before being brought back inside this now warmed liquid is fed to the heat exchanger which will absorb and concentrate that heat with the help of our friend the refrigeration cycle the refrigerant is then squeezed into the condenser and that heat is released into the air and ultimately the living space the benefit of doing this is that no matter what the air temperature is outside the temperature of the fluid returning from the ground loop will be a near constant 50 degrees fahrenheit or about 10 celsius that temperature allows a heat pump to run at peak performance and efficiency delivering a nearly constant near maximum cop at full output no matter what right now you can expect it to always meet or exceed a cop of four and that will undoubtedly improve as technology advances and that's obviously a huge deal a home with a geothermal heat pump needs significantly less energy to heat than any other heating technology available today unless you count home design itself and want to bring up the passivhaus but that's a topic for another time even with an entirely fossil fuel-powered electrical infrastructure emissions are drastically reduced when using a ground source heat pump remember exceed 2.5 and you're getting more energy out of burning natural gas in a power plant and sending its energy the zippy zappy way the natural gas itself contains that's astonishing and yet completely possible also important is that methane the main component of natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas and the infrastructure we use to transport it to homes across the country is notoriously leaky not requiring that infrastructure in the first place provides its own emissions reduction what's more the much lower energy requirement of homes with geothermal heat pumps opens up many more opportunities particularly when it comes to renewable and locally generated sources of power oh and of course these systems are entirely reversible in the summer months well below the frost line the earth stays colder than the air outside so in cooling mode the system simply puts heat back into the earth it's actually almost poetic that heat ends up simply being borrowed in the winter months and returned in the summer and being able to transfer it into a cool liquid means no matter how hot it gets outside the system will run at peak performance neat so what's the catch eleven words the upfront cost and disruptive nature of the ground loop installation that second part's getting better but unless you happen to be lucky and have access to some natural body of water like a pond that's deep and large enough to use as your heat source which is another way to go about it by the way there will have to be a network of piping installed under the ground to collect and transport its heat energy for a long time this meant excavating a large area around a home down to several feet think about a meter ish below the frost line then you'd go all loopy with a bunch of piping and cover it back up hopefully you remember to put the ends of that pipe somewhere useful but that's really disruptive and requires a large area of lawn or similar open space i mean if you're building a new house somewhere and have room please just do it it's the perfect time oh and one interesting idea that's taking hold is community ground loops a bunch of homes in a new development can be hooked up to a large shared ground loop that's piped into each home they each have their own heat pumps extracting energy from the fluid but the geothermal equipment is shared maximizing its potential and lowering the cost per user but if you want to add a ground loop to an existing home site it kind of sucks and sometimes isn't possible however a more recent and exciting development is the use of vertical drilling to go deeper rather than broader using equipment similar to that which is used to dig a well for drinking water a borehole can be dug hundreds of feet below the soil and a rather simple bit of piping down and then back up can be run to extract that earthy warmth this is much less disruptive and easier to accomplish in areas with denser housing and little green space dandelion energy is one company installing such systems now these aren't cheap their own website admits that this is going to cost about as much as a small car and depending on how your energy is priced you may never recoup that investment but regardless of where you are it will reduce greenhouse emissions and hopefully energy starts getting priced to reflect that oh sorry going too deep again what dandelion and companies like it are doing is really important for making geothermal heat pumps more approachable simply negating the need to tear up an entire yard is a huge step in the right direction for getting the reluctant on board but it's by no means a one-size-fits-all solution unless you have the rights to dig that far down and there's nothing below you that could be a problem like abandoned mines subway tunnels etc well you can't do it and what about in like you know cities how's a large apartment building going to get all the heat it needs from a borehole well it can't district heating though may be an indirect way to provide geothermally derived heat to large urban spaces district heating is unfortunately not that common in the us which is a giant shame basically it's a network of underground insulated pipes bringing really hot water into buildings that is then fed through radiators to heat them one of the more clever ways to heat that water is with the waste heat of conventional power stations and many countries have been doing this for decades it annoys me greatly that this hasn't been normal practice everywhere since power plants have been a thing especially since water loop systems for heating buildings are by no means a recent development but anyway that practice can be used to provide heat to urban centers without requiring combustion of fuels on site or the immense electrical supply which would be needed with resistive heating alone what you use to heat the water then is arbitrary it could be a large geothermal station running massive heat pumps or you could even drill deep enough to get heat directly from the magma kilometers below us if you're feeling adventurous this is all stuff that's being researched right now and as usual there's pros and cons to every one of these what gives well ellen there are no easy answers but this video was about heat pumps while geothermal heat pumps may not exactly work in the concrete jungles of new york city air source heat pumps certainly can and maybe they won't make sense to use on really cold days but really cold days are only some of the days of winter we really gotta stop this whole only solutions which cover every single possible contingency are feasible nonsense and start using what we can when we can that's kind of my whole point with the every air conditioner should be reversible thing it's unreasonable to me to limit their potential just because some days heat pumps can't work we have the technology so so use it when possible oh yeah here's a really dumb thing electric cars which nearly universally have air conditioning are only just now starting to make that reversible cabin heat is by far the largest non-locomotive energy use in an ev and is a large part of why range drops in the winter it has always been the case that a heat pump would help a lot with that at least on milder days and yet even some brand new ev models on sale do not offer them instead resistive heat is your only option i don't know if there's some trick to ruggedizing reversing valves for road use or maybe there's something else that makes it harder for cars but come on heat pumps need to be standard in evs figure it out and if you can get to a cop of two when it's zero degrees out fantastic but you know what's real neat we're beginning to put heat pumps in more places to do more things besides just heat and cool our living spaces fundamentally heat pumps are just heat energy relocators and concentrators if there's a place where we need a lot of heat we can sometimes take it from another and often with side benefits as well one real world application of heat pumps not for heating is the hybrid water heater okay well i suppose that is still heating but consider a typical north american water heater with a 50 gallon tank until recently you had two choices electric or gas gas is cheaper to operate but requires venting and also gas electric is more expensive to operate but the device itself is little more than an oversized kettle now the benefit of storing hot water in an insulated tank like this is that you've created a thermal battery hybrid water heaters use a heat pump to maintain the water temperature in the tank or you could say to keep the battery charged and it's ultimately getting that energy from the air of the room it's sitting in this not only uses a fraction of the energy that heating the water with electric heating elements does but provides the additional benefit of free air conditioning and dehumidification in the area around the water heater to collect the energy it moves into the water it has an evaporator just like any air conditioner and it gets cold and wet this means hybrid water heaters need a drain line to deal with that condensate but i'd sure like a dehumidifier in my basement that effectively costs less than nothing to run it's heating my water and more cheaply than before of course in the winter this is perhaps a bummer but if you have gas heat like i do well now your water heater runs on gas just indirectly and if you had a geothermal heat pump well it would get its heat from the ground after your main heat pump first brought it to your home for you anyway it's a hybrid water heater because these also have traditional heating elements to deal with periods of high demand the heat pump is slower than good old-fashioned hot sticks but assuming you don't have a shower-thon going on in your house it can take its time reheating the water in the tank between uses using as little as a quarter the energy of an ordinary electric heater the potential for heat pumps to be used in water heaters by the way has made me fairly anti-tankless water heater it's a myth that tankless water heaters provide you with instant hot water it still has to get through your pipes and if you want instant hot water what you really need is a hot water recirculation system and your plumbing to be completely redone or maybe you can get away with point of use booster heaters but anyway now that i know that heat pump water heaters are a thing i have no desire to go tankless save that energy baby another really neat development and perhaps even more so is the heat pump clothes dryer tumble dryers are a sort of guilty pleasure to me oh sure they save tons of time and space but they also use a lot of energy and are typically vented outside which not only means there needs to be event in the first place but also creates significant negative pressure when they run but what do dryers really do well they basically just tumble clothes around a drum with hot air blowing through it which makes the clothes dry faster making the air hot is the energy intensive part but that's right heat pump it heat pump clothes dryers are frankly amazing because it's about the perfect application for the technology you just need to get the inside of the dryer hotter than the outside yeah you could do that with heater coils or even a little gas furnace but there's plenty of energy from the room it's sitting in for a heat pump to take and concentrate and none of it gets lost it just gets concentrated inside best of all you can then exhaust the hot damp air that exits the drum over the cold evaporator and not only recollect that energy to be pumped back in but also the moisture from the clothes you end up with a clothes dryer that needs much less energy to run doesn't need venting and can be placed anywhere some of them can even be plugged into a standard 120 volt electrical outlet heat pump clothes dryers are slower than traditional vented solutions but they offer great flexibility and a much lower energy cost even if you have a gas dryer eliminating the need for a vent will lower your heating and cooling demand when it runs thanks to there no longer being a machine blowing the air you paid to heat or cool outside it's really kind of a no-brainer to me using a heat pump not only makes it cheaper to run but solves real problems that is if you're willing to have your laundry take longer which i recognize is not feasible for everyone now there is one real downside to the proliferation of heat pumps to make them we need refrigerants and refrigerants have created a whack-a-mole of engineering challenges when we first ventured down the path of refrigeration we were using gaseous ammonia as a refrigerant it was actually a fantastic refrigerant but it was very toxic and leaks were very dangerous to human life that was the problem that thomas midgley jr solved with the creation of freon freon was the first non-toxic non-flammable refrigerant and we were thrilled to have it of course decades later we realized the ozone layer was disappearing and we figured out that cfcs like freon were the culprit so replacement refrigerants were developed like our friend r134a these hfcs don't harm the ozone layer but they are ridiculously potent greenhouse gases this here is over 1400 times better at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide great even though in an ideal world it will never leave a refrigerant loop eventually refrigeration systems develop leaks if you ever bought one of these to recharge your ac that's why so hfcs are being phased out for newer refrigerants like 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoropropine also known as r12 this refrigerant has a global warming potential of less than one so as far as we can tell it's harmless currently these new refrigerants are rather expensive and the reason is patently obvious it's patents these next-gen refrigerants are protected by patents and their owners are absolutely okay with exploiting that and hard now that was once the case for this little fella but those patents have expired and that's why walmart can sell it in these cans for less than five bucks in some states anyway perhaps my most radical thought i'll put forth here is that patents on things like oh i don't know climate-friendly refrigerants that we really need to make a lot more of and fast should be invalidated maybe we ought to consider some classes of things unpatentable and instead encourage their development through some sort of prize system or just develop them publicly from the start i don't know just spitballing here i just think it's not great that r1234yf costs 10 times as much as the chemical it's replacing because we need that then again there is another option carbon dioxide can actually be used as a refrigerant although when you do that it prefers you call it r744 it's more polite now if you're wondering well if that's possible why haven't we just been doing that from the start i'll tell you the working pressures you need to make carbon dioxide a refrigerant are quite high think 1000 plus psi that means the refrigeration equipment needs to be much more robust in order to handle it making it more expensive more traditional synthetic refrigerants that sounds wrong but yes don't need such high pressures and so refrigeration systems using them are just easier to build so right now it's pick your poison cheap system expensive gas or cheap gas but expensive system but anyway we've talked about all i wanted to talk about heat pumps for now anyway i fully expect them to find their way into more and more places and i'm sure will address many of their flaws as time goes on and if we can make an air source heat pump operate with a cop of four in arctic temps well golly gee that'd just be neato i hope we can do it but one thing is for sure about the future i'm pumped for it [Music] that one and if you had a thermostat which was aware of its correct the i skipped a word what was that in the script aware of the current cop yeah that was just an error and i i i made it turn around there's a human sk sorry even with an entirely fossil fuel-powered electrical infrastructure that's a lot of big words in this one now the benefits of storing hot water in an insulated tank like this is that the benefit a borehole can be dug hundreds of feet below the soil and rather than [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you
