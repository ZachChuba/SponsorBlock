and film swag their support is super appreciated so the background of this video will be a sarah doman solo i did the other day left-handed so i apologize that the execution is very sloppy but it was actually a pretty good trip i got around 25 kills or so not bad hello everyone my name is andrew ajt thank you for joining us this week this week i want to talk about something that has been a heated debate on the old school community about account sharing and whether or not it is allowed and whether or not it should be allowed now before we get started i know 99 of you know this already probably even more than that but i do not like people going around and pointing fingers about account sharing or this rule i mean it is just a game there's no need to make an angry reddit post about someone who lets someone do some skilling on their account because if we want to start assigning blame or pointing fingers there is so much blame to go around for this topic you can blame probably hundreds or maybe even thousands of people who do account sharing you could blame jagex for not doing enough about it you could blame content creators for doing it heck even i've played a little bit on friends accounts a very long time ago before i felt the way i do now about account sharing there is so much blame to go around that i think is much better especially in this case just to have amnesty for everyone and to fix the problem going forward it's not a moral question account sharing certainly doesn't make anyone a bad person account sharing itself isn't wrong or anything at least in most contexts it's more of a practical question for reasons we'll see later as to what is the best policy for the community as a whole with that being said i also don't want to condone any buying and selling of infernal capes because that is clearly not allowed and unlike other instances of account sharing there's really no gray area with that so onesie will be joining me for this segment i remember that back in the day it was very clear that you couldn't account share it was against the rules you know way back in the day that's just what i remember but that's just memory that was a long time ago so let's take a look at a primary source from the time the official handbook of runescape and let's see what it has to say i always keep a copy with with me of this at all times this is from 2006 so let's see what they have to say let's get to rules of runescape rule number six no account sharing slash trading each account should be used by only one person account sharing is not allowed you may not sell transfer or lend your account to anyone else or permit anyone else to use your account and you may not accept an account uh well i'm gonna finish the last part here you may not accept an account that anybody else offers you so that is very clear but if we also want to go back a page let's see do not give your password to any other player period that's pretty straightforward just as a little side note i like how it says here it's important and best to keep a safe distance from other runescape players it's like they knew people playing this game were strange what do you think onesie so of course account sharing isn't completely allowed now there's many cases where it's not allowed like for high scores or for infernal capes but i looked at the report abuse and there's nothing about account sharing other than buying or selling an account so i just figured the written form of this rule like it was in the handbook has since been deleted but that is not the case this rule actually does still exist on the runescape website here is the official rules of runescape i assume these apply to old school as well and if we go down to account sharing and buying or selling accounts each account should only be used by one person never share your account with anyone else doing so will likely get the account banned players may not sell share transfer or lend their account to anyone else players should not accept an account that anybody else offers as they may be stolen and this could lead to your own account being disabled so that is very similar to the rule from 14 years ago and they go on to say here that they have this rule to protect game integrity achievements the high scores and also a very good point here if disputes occur or friendships break down it can lead to at least one of the parties permanently losing access to the account or having it stripped of wealth and items and i have seen this happen before that's why i sometimes advise against account sharing because it is an account security risk also some more very logical points here many of the accounts on sale are stolen so that is a very good reason why you should never buy or sell an account there's millions of good reasons to not do that and also some other good points the people who share accounts run the risk that one of the people using the account won't give it back or i didn't even think about this that one person could break a game rule and get the account banned or muted and then the other person's not really at fault but they're having to suffer the consequences i never even thought of that everything in this rule is excellent these are excellent points and very true and really this rule is designed to protect players it's not jagex just being annoying or nosey they just don't want people having to fall into these unfortunate situations and that is a very good reason to have this rule i'll just give you an example from this must have been 2005 and i've never told this story before i was in the falador east bank and someone was standing around as a level 83 saying i'm giving away my account and i'm like holy he's giving away an account he's level 83 i must have been like level 50 or something so he actually gave me the password he pm me the password i logged in the account was all good there was nothing really on it which kind of made me think something was strange but it was a really high level account and he just gave it to me and i was like wow this is amazing i just got this really high level account for free but i was smart i didn't put any of my items on it because i knew that the guy might just reclaim the account and sure enough the next day it had been recovered or the password was changed or something i don't remember but i bet a lot of people in that circumstance even today would put some of their items on the account and once the person reclaims it then they would keep those items so it's not a perfect example but it just goes to show there are some risks associated with account sharing so with all that being said why today is account sharing being done and people aren't getting banned for it all the time there just hasn't been the enforcement of it that you would expect for a rule that is so clear and it's really hard to say why or how this happened the only hypothesis that i've really thought of is i remember many years ago like early days of old school runescape i would see pking videos where people were using accounts that were clearly borrowed and i didn't think this was that great but most people didn't seem to have a problem with it and i guess maybe it could have been a slippery slope where that started being okay and then maybe people started sharing accounts or letting each other onto accounts for skilling or something and maybe just because those are not egregious examples of account sharing slowly it became more okay over time but i don't know for sure that's just what i remember and it could be totally wrong maybe there's some other huge reason that i'm missing leave a comment if you do know but even at the time i remember thinking it's not quite as fun watching a pking video when the person is just using a borrowed account and they didn't actually train it up themselves i feel like it's more enjoyable to watch an account that they themselves worked on but that's just my opinion and again it's not really anything egregious if my slippery slope hypothesis is correct then i think it's led to what we have today where people are letting other people onto their ironman accounts to train for them which goes against the spirit of iron man because it is a solo game mode at least that's my interpretation of why people are upset by this there's probably other reasons but i've seen people asking for iron man statuses to be revoked because of this i can understand those arguments but personally i don't think it's much different whether or not the account is an ironman or not so i'm certainly not the first person to inquire about this here's a runescape 3 post from two years ago asking about selective banning for account sharing and i looked around for a longer jagex statement about this and here is one from jagex infinity a former j mod and also steve w a current j mod and he basically explains here and i'm not gonna read the whole thing i actually do recommend you pause it and read it yourself or it'll be in the description as well but he does mention that it's important to look at why we have rules he basically says they are to protect players as i mentioned and he says it's against the rules but we're not going to take action against casual account sharing if there's no risk to game integrity like inferno quests i'm sure high scorers go along with that as well and they kind of say it puts your account at risk and they're never going to encourage players to share their accounts and he does say they are consistent with it like the players using accounts to pk on they don't have a problem with there's a lot here and basically my interpretation of it is it really depends on the situation there are some situations where they would enforce the rule and there are other situations where they would not enforce the rule depending on what is going on with the account this post is quite old though it's three years ago so if any j-mods want to provide an updated stance on account sharing i would be interested to hear it it is possible they've already done this and i just couldn't find it so if they did just leave it in the comments and i will add it to the description and pin it in the comments so what do i think well i don't really love account sharing i would say probably avoid it if you can because there are account security risks for it in most cases i don't really mind it but in some i don't really like it either so it's really hard to form an opinion about this topic actually because of that and it's also not recommended by me because you don't know exactly what jagex allows and doesn't allow as far as account sharing it's hard to know for every single circumstance what they are okay with and what they're not but you won't have to worry about that if you just don't account share if they decided one day just to stop all account sharing completely and enforce the rule fully i would be okay with that but then again pandora's box has already kind of opened people have been encountering for a while now so it might be hard to enforce that or even unfair to enforce that but maybe they could do it with all new accounts but then again i guess if they're going to continue the policy they have now maybe just updating the rule and being more clear about exactly what is and isn't allowed would be the better option again maybe they've already done this and i just can't find it and the best way to do that would be to update the rule on the website to list out all those things because maybe they've talked about it in tweets or q and a's but it's hard to dig through all that media and find it i did find one q a where they said similar things to the reddit post but again it was very old i'm not saying they've even handled this bad because it is a very difficult topic to make rules for but i think more clarity would be the answer but that's just my opinion what do you guys think should account sharing be more allowed should it be less allowed should the rule be enforced should it be rewritten to be a little more clear let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to like the video
