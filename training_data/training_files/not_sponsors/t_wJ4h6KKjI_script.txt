hey everybody Mike here welcome back there we are in a ravine trying to have two rabbits not very much luck with that go ahead and drink up a little bit here continuing on to a coastal I do have a sticky rabbit on me but that's okay they should harvest them can I have some is it gonna freeze I wonder if he freezes why is in your inventory now can i harvest him just like bare hands I can't I can't oh that's good that's good oh yeah we're gonna I don't want to do it here I want to do it closer to somewhere where I can have a bed if I need to I'll go on the other side of a ravine in case that Blizzard sits in here cuz I don't think there's a bed here anywhere and I don't want have to trudge my way through up there's a rabbit tracks I have to trudge my way through a you're a blizzard damage my clothes take a condition it get more frostbite risk though might as well take the good weather travel as far as we can then harvest a rabbit I just don't want to be carried around a stinky rabbit but we'll we'll harvest him before we make it to a wolf and then well some meat to cook looks like a pretty decent sized rabbit - how many do I have I wish I'd show right there doesn't really show does it okay that's okay that's okay oh here's a rabbit guys here's no know what interloper they're a lot more alert aren't they so used to playing stalker okay yeah they're definitely kept on it see those ears perk up like that man pretty cool kind of climb up all this rock baby oh that might be too far I don't wanna have to jump off the rock either sprained my ankle next forget gotta cook up the rabbit gotta cook up some rest eat got to cook up some rosehip tea guy get some coffee and some some regular herbal tea as well just we're having at man oh my god Arius thank gosh I've chased him all the way across the creation all I want to do is kill why won't just let me do that oh my god turn around oh I think he was too far away for me to run up on I don't know if they've decreased the time that they can recover or not but he's gonna turn around here soon he's like literally at a dead end I'm just gonna sit right here wait watch it we could start going up the up the hill what did he go that way yeah he did he did gotcha Oh such a satisfying sound victory I know I know I'm not right it's okay we all have her they'll have her little hangups mines revenge all right well but over here we're gonna have a nice restful night when we make it over to coastal get some more feathers all right search his bag see if he's got any good tonight of course no you're worthless he didn't he died with nothing yeah that's saying who dies with the most toys wins well he lost he's like Blue Ribbon loser if that is your mantra so make sure frostbite wasn't popping back up again all right well let's see here well there's a middle box we'll go check that out that's what I expected know if play interloper long enough of this game it will really what is it it will really increase your happiness know how does happiness is reality - expectations so yeah this is playing the long dark interloper will make happier in life just come not to expect anything you'll get in your heart you'll be like it's not gonna start they start be like oh my gosh this is just amazing thing that's Wow who'da thunk that was gonna happen I don't know what's all down here but we're gonna check it out I can't remember it's been so long I think there's sometimes a bedroll down this way at least there wasn't stalker maybe I don't know he remember is there's a cave or something back here I don't remember I never come back here okay well there's like nothing here at all what's back here yep nothing nothing nothing nothing wait there's a cave okay yeah we're gonna go for that let's see what's inside shall we I never come back here it's just too far off yeah it's like really too far it's maybe a hundred feet off the beaten path there's a dead guy here no no it's a fire pit I thought was a dead guy left this a granola bar which we could actually eat that is shocking without a risk to its our weight at or we really really have I'm not that bad I why she's move it's a slow oh you're fine all right onward no uh no bed roll yet no bed roll I think maybe the first time I'll get a better role is gonna be like a bear peril that feels about right starting to get a little dark actually but that's okay we can make it we can make it up here to do first first trailer when we get onto the coastal we'll just go to that first blue trailer and we'll be fine we should be just fine just gonna suck her rent she just gonna have to be a little cold a little bit hungry but an inch she's gonna be just fine I don't want to run it all now because I don't want to get to the point where I get on the coastal and I can't run know because I'm too fatigued so I didn't really don't want to bleed off my fatigue right now and don't have to absolute 22 could be worse could be much worse unfortunately we still have to go across another trestle and this one is the scary one who put all those rocks here that seems a bit suspicious yeah thanks thanks pointer tree I would have I would have obviously made a left or a right and gotten lost had not been there thank unfortunately we're taking like I've condition it's our percentage hits for our because of a because the cold but we're gonna be inside and warmed up within the next hour so not gonna be that huge of a deal we will definitely recover back to a hundred percent condition once we make it to our bed and lucky for us trailers don't burn down so we know we're gonna we know that that trailer will definitely be there oh yeah this is this is the big one wanna we'll give short term vertigo we're a beam Falls trestle yeah yeah that's that's not creepy or anything that doesn't make maybe the hair on the back of your neck stand up at all nope this is really me doing this I'd be staying in mr. Lake screw that don't look down now is not the time for gymnastics okay we made it and the wind started to kick up it's actually almost taking me to a dead stop forget that it's windy so Blizzard gave me for a ride what crap weather hopefully when we come out on the other side of this the wind is not going straight into our face if so I'll just be running around with my with my flare out ready to go but typically the Wolves don't come out during the blizzards either so that's a bonus like or say I'm carrying rabbits as well Alyce's get up here trying to get three years festive cake because I'm like double stinky right now no I kind of don't think I should be using a torch but at the same time I don't have that pity matches and the trailers right here I just hope I don't pull the wolf we really don't want that I might be able to run it the rest of the way I could drop a decoy if need be but I really want to keep my rabbits if I could possible I need those mittens I can always have more but I think see we hunt rabbits god it's like a two-episode it never right there come on get him later I don't want stand around while they're being drawn to him oh because they smell those rabbits I'm haulin want to get inside just let me get inside please please please please let me get inside good timing okay I gotta relax a little bit gosh I'm so nervous in this playthrough Wow yeah we do have beds in here so we will check everything in the morning but yeah pretty pretty decent result there yeah not bad oh know what I should just actually gut the rabbits right now yeah I don't know I should do it morning I think I need to do it in the morning cuz I'm taking condition hits I'll be taking well now I'm gonna warm up no I'm not taking any condition hits right now that will eventually get me but this is not getting me anymore and neither is this though yeah let's just do the rabbit right now and we were real good sleep and it's early in the morning it's early at night so we could still get the good ten hours to sleep not lose much daylight yeah let's do this it's nice okay it's taking a 2% per hour condition it but I think it's worth it and then we can drop the rabbit hide overnight before we pick it up again I might actually just leave it up here maybe she got drink mmm oh it's really close I guess I should have know what just yeah it's teressa's I was thinking about drinking soda for that last a little bit but I think I'm just gonna reverse that and let's not eat we're all rabbit that's not good let's have some more of this and in just in time it sounds like I think we're good better for yep we are good finish out just drink a little bit before we go to bed and let's get some rest bolster that Blaire let's get ourselves a good 10 hours of sleep we should wake up fully rested Wow good a thought ravine was so dangerous three days 18 hours 23 did I sleep up here with the dead guy the whole time No then we'll sweater oh okay top of the dead guy I mean a big deal I'm used to having a carl in the house he's left me just like fluffy in the dam they've all abandoned me all right holder something down here another soda we know we can reach it at least we've seen that trick before not not gonna fool me this time either all right I just want to double-check make sure it got everything a little better all open right here check that check that sure I'm not like passing up on anything real obvious and I'll see if we have ourselves a sunny day then I'll get myself a bargainable grill oh I forgot to put them ah I forgot to put the stupid rabbits down are the rabbit skins down that's alright just when it cost us an extra 10 hours before we get our mittens Oh fine let's eat this meat before we are cook it up where we go anywhere I will use the pony I don't want to carry this around with me it's too dangerous we're gonna end up having to lose it to the to the wolves to 0% chance 12 matches we think I don't want to do this I could sit here and cook for a while let's go ahead and do that I don't want to waste a match I'm just gonna like hold on silly silly me I know guys were freaking out right there I know long dark veterans we're starting to freak out right there weren't all right this is how do it so don't waste matches all right now we get multiple chances okay let's give this a shot I'm gonna cook up the ASE exactly why exactly what we didn't want to grow I think I might leave the the rabbit hides and the guts up here curing it's not too hard to get back up here and I don't want to carry it carry them around especially I'm gonna have the meat as well though extinguished wait yeah I do want a 16 was just there we go what no put that away there we go okay what are trying to do bro there we go should be good to cook on the fire so we're gonna put down our pots because I guess they cook faster when they wouldn't use a pot the rabbits do so then if just put them on the stove really three oh I was like three minutes holy crap did cook faster not quite right oh no no no put that back in there put that back in there put that back in there just keep using oh we could use reclaimed wood a little heavy get rid of that it's kind of crap wood anyway alright let's cook up some herbal tea some coffee yeah I should have yeah I should have made some it's alright I'll fix the problem should have made the all the rows of tea and all that but I didn't prepare my stuff and stuff at a time so I have to do that real quick here wait why am i drinking that okay fine whatever damn all right grab six five minutes let me see your daughter yeah let's give it a shot here at least get one of these go on how long's it gonna take 50 minutes yeah that's fine not that huge adieu there we go and let's see here know what might as well just throw these down in here I'm going to leave them here I'm only one stinky light though hmm keeping it with me keeping it with me I'm gonna avoid the the wolves I'll dance around them I got moves prepared rose hips yeah let's get up while that's cooking let's make some prepared rush she mushrooms and we'll make some of that tea as well I probably need to to rosehip teas just because of how hey like injury-prone I am to spring and ankles it will not get some on the fire here there we go it's almost like fall let's cook those and know what let's just uh we doing on water let's cook up some water he'll add some more here I just stay the night here again in that case we will I think we will just stay the night here again you're not too tired yeah we'll go down got to travel at night an interloper okay just sleep and everything's fine okay so I think we're good there get another pot of water going here one hour one hour fifteen okay and go ahead and add another guy's want to drop a poll in there I think with tropical we're gonna get that shows about a gallon of water of this take it to work should go let's get going 69 pounds loud been oh I didn't want to search this guy over here grab some feathers at least if nothing else this stuff oh decent ski direct check it that's going on right now going on to right now yeah two point nine degree work bonus that's nice all right let's keep going here I'm on instinct line it's all I'm showing don't know how strong that one sting line is but that's all I'm saying good eye out for the wolf downer might be able to skirt down there I'm gonna try this I'm try going this route I don't know where he's at but I might might not be here here's a house over here but I'm not gonna go for it right now it's also a budget it's also a bunch of cattails to be had but I'm just trying to do a direct route through here if possible I want to stop too long because I am a little little attractive to the predators right now I don't even my rabbit meat until I'm am already eat it on my own terms tried to keep this fire going a little bit maybe pick up some sticks as we go maybe start another fire know like could daisy-chain torches from fires just keep keep them going over and over and over again if can keep collecting the sticks oh my gosh there's so many those I got I think those are birch oh this one's not burned down nice and we have a dead guy here check it out real quick Oh dead yeah it's dead guy I need to get the next torch going here throw that down no oh and it's burned oh oh damn okay that's looked alright well at least we know we're at we've been here before it was definitely a fishing village just around this corner then down the hill and it cross away possibly with a bear running around but we should see bear tracks a fuse maybe shoot that's too bad what how many of these fishing huts are gonna be right now oh I see one I think already yeah well moving tonight I think was the good choice so far oh wait we need to check back here for sure there's definitely a possibility of something good back here yeah not today yep not today that's that's a shape all right let's get inside do some searching quickly here maybe make it up Jack Rabbit Island I don't know what guys think I think we'll make it there I think we will but plenty of time have to fishing nuts to hit and like another or two cabins to go through but I think we'll be all right almost need this when it starts to get a little bit dark I know much there uh-huh a little bar 25 calories looks to kill me it's trying to kill me it's like this dog food I'm a bit oh no the doctor feels much better yay for dog food sad face for the granola bar anything anything please tell me I'm missing something here oh okay I'll do the next cabin we got what we got so sports socks I think we can double up on those right yeah double up on those all right not see anything okay let's keep moving got to keep on moving all right I'm gonna have to go for the gas station for sure I really hope that there's a hex on there like in the version 1.0 The Lost episodes The Lost series yeah what's what we'll call it The Lost series okay what we got here newspapers wander well not really hook I've got like three hooks now and no line it's all right whatever whatever know what I'll throw this down here take this out light this one up know I'm gonna actually leave my my rabbit skin stuff in here because I can craft it at the at this workstation workbench whatever it's called and that way it starts I don't have to go I don't have to dodge wolves get them back to my my work station so I'm just gonna use this one right here Aurra for the crafting area yeah let's let's drop them here that make sense drop drop drop and then we'll come back after we go to desolation point and hopefully they'll all be cured and we can actually start crafting still a little stinky just because of the food we're carrying on this that's okay got another Hut right in front of us here we're gonna go for I'm gonna run because it's gonna be night and we're about ready to sleep anyway so no big deal I really need some wine or some cured guts in order to put some rabbit so I'm gonna need to get some rabbits killed up here on Jackrabbit luckily there's a reason why it's called Jack Rabbit Island letting a freaking rabbits oh well we'll kill a couple rabbits up here and get them harvested and curing and all that stuff as well oh no I kind of kind of want to almost go for desolation point but I think it might be pushing my luck if I do that oh boy I do need to stop by the garage first before anything so maybe well maybe we'll do that we'll head over there after this so yeah let's okay let me throw this down oh no I mean we're torches that sucks whip it and let's start a fire ah not not enough time that's all right that's all right had fun with it let's head up here do some looting I see a wolf over there front of the middle rocks there between a huge Jack Rabbit Island and that small outcrop there here there is right side of screen probably see it a little better too nice to shy in there okay let's go and we'll hit that one on the way over to the garage we're gonna stay the night up here I think no point in pushing our luck unless we got food though let's just get up here give this flare ready in case we run into the wolf up here don't know water again yeah we're doing good we're doing all right yep they sound a lot scarier in this boat I'll tell that much they certainly do there's some rabbits that live down there - we do have rabbit options here but I do want to definitely kill a couple of rabbits and get them curing and good their guts cured as well so I can make some rabbit traps out of I might need even just to make a fishing line actually fishing was probably a more efficient way to use their guts actually have two flares that's good we got a couple rabbits here so I just want to get inside come back out they should probably reset by the time come back outside the freak out a little bit here but this is gonna let me take a free shot at him okay they want to let me take the first shot this one I just wanted to get her into my sticky food I don't drink my stinky food here I think that's all of it yep no longer stinky just double check yeah I think we're okay try knock out a couple of these rabbits well there's one right there there we leave in there down get ready for another one then when come back from desolation point hopefully we can put some traps up here or just down the hill or wherever we won't put up honestly Ares I heard another sign a tree in it's a weird angle oh we got them also pretty good nice pretty happy with that all right I'm getting better I think actually I want to take a couple of those in all right I'll leave their meat outside I don't need to cook it right now I can wait on it but we do wanted to go ahead and harvest them and get their stuff curing in here kind of do it on water yeah I thought it'd make me just some water all right now let's try doing it harvest a little bit of meat not a lot but some feathers I'm done I'm not gonna be able to search the house tonight it's gonna be too dark yeah it's all right that's okay should have probably waited to harvest them until after I searched the house but whatever we'll just search it in the morning double stinky so that'll stay there and that'll be good for quite a while honestly maybe yeah I'll be good for quite a while I'm gonna eat no no what do need that yeah I might as well only 35 calories take that take that and that let's eat all of it tonight we'll be fine all right let's get back here to our nice warm I think it's a 10 degree bed isn't it 10.9 or something like that 10.8 okay ask so close oh is this a little bit of dust float past a little what's flanking me here apparently I can't okay let's eat from here 35 calories I seriously don't think it looks like that when it's only $35 there we go and know what I'll probably save that this is 450 calories and I'll supplement it with what do we need how much should we need we need another any about another 300 calories I don't really want to try I don't really we'll try that let's use this soda and then we'll use a cattail so does don't go bad so don't get sick off of those we'll use that and then we'll use cattail there we go could probably use the dog food I've been alright - I'll save that for my trip and we'll get a drink here should have some toilet water here as well but yeah I think we're in good shape now 860 - oh yeah we're actually over what we need so we're good let's put this outside but last longer means I can trip my way through the house here don't worry it's pretty dark for me as well oh wow ooh part of me wants to go for it now but part of me thinks that's a really bad idea because I'm tired and yeah I'm Lou I'm actually overweight now so I'm just gonna wait for morning wait I'm gonna leave my guts out here don't do that because I left it I dropped a decoy and dropped the wrong thing that's what I want to drop out here good thing I checked Wow I had to come back to like frozen guts out of sorts order this morning all right let's try dropping the guts - yeah drop those there we go so I'm talking about I can tear this thing down two minutes into a stick I get a stick out of it harvesting takes just this long though in in real time all right let's head on back here get our sleep all the we're good yeah definitely let's get some good restorative sleep see guys in the morning ah expired proof rest we're in good shape some of the drink and let's do some searching searching to be done anything under this bed that I can see I don't see anything actually anything I think we need simple tools don't wait to make the gloves we double-check here aren't the hat or the gloves I think I want the gloves takes for rabbit pelts really so I'm gonna have to use everything I got and to guts okay except I'll be left with two guts applied cured guts okay scrap metal make that your guts reclaimed wood okay that's not gonna be too are we point six I think I want the mitts plus the yeah I think I want the mids first this me time five hours to make three of it okay yeah else I already have a already have a hat so I really don't need an extra hat what I really really need is mittens and wait did say that I needed the whole purpose of coming here sewing kit fishing tackle I have those so I don't need I just need these to be cured and then I don't need any simple tools or anything okay checked all those toilet water we got some there I'm gonna leave that there for when we return we might need it all right little windy other here that how the house is creaky to everything I think I can hear it a little bit too okay oh wow I was expected to find anything oh wow I wasn't expected to find two things okay I'm just gonna quit the game I just well I think I just won I found two things in one container that's amazing and one of them was a Canadian money but I might need to stay inside until the weather clears a little bit take a look see are curing soon 9% 15% on the on the pelts I'm down with it I'm down with it I wish I would have left him curing overnight at the trailer instead of forgetting about doing that like a Momo oh it's not it's not that bad me it's bad but it's not the best that's okay I wonder if I can drop any of this gear all right well what I'm thinking is I'm gonna drop some other gear that she's talking about I really don't need to carry all that over there plus I'm gonna be bringing stuff back oh I think I'll drop one of my I'm gonna use this for my storage area kind of like I did before I don't need to really have two cooking pots one will suffice I really don't need 42 cattails yeah okay literally like mix will be just fine that's probably overkill right there actually coal that's fine I can get : two I can get coal in a cave on the way over Plusle show me cold air though we really don't need to carry coal with us don't need that many herbal teas yeah plus we're gonna be looting the entire desolation point map the same time as well so drop about half hour wait right there yeah we're doing much better now that I don't need to be reading I still I'm just I don't need to be carrying around all those books basically no put that in there probably don't need that until we come back right yeah we don't need that till we come back with the right oh know what I might need up to rosehips I could I could sprain my ankle twice for sure Russian mushrooms don't need that many rest know mushrooms don't plan on getting that sick herbal tea don't need that many coffees or bana just seems like a bit much we can always make some at a cloth afew need to we do have a cloth with with us here okay so we're down to 52 pounds system that's much better alright let's go I think we're gonna be all right in this later I'm starting to have a little bit more confidence maybe that's just about when I trip over my my own unit there and die probably what happens try how interloper works one degree we really don't want to mess around I'm gonna skip anyway yeah it's leave bad I don't really care about that I just want to get to the garage as big as possible so since this one degree what I'll do is I'll go up to this and drop island and oh know what let's do a little beach combing I'll go here to misanthropes and and see if I warm up before I make the next leg of the journey over to the garage this is so cold and this way we can do a little beach combing I'm just gonna take grab these sticks as I go I know I left some behind but that's ok we can always grab some as we go so when we get to the garage if we need to cook we can unfortunately the wind isn't cooperating too much with us but it does feel like a balmy four degrees feels like 28 in here and that's much better still cold but much better nothing there all right guys get moving is that a rabbit in front of us I think it's a rabbit that's right okay come straight at me I can't I can't pass up this opportunity now if I kill her habit and I leave it by - will it actually stay there forever Oh No all right notice sometimes have wolf up here don't really want to attempt it with a stinky dinky treat plus I can't really run forward that fast rabbit way over there but I just want to get inside at this point what I think maybe I'll just and now I leave the rabbit inside this house I'll harvest it while we warm up and I'll leave it inside the house along with the guts it will probably use this guts to make a snare or some passive hunting all right wanna get inside I just want to get inside thank thank thank thank all right let's just uh list the vs. rabbit here leave his guts right at the door as well I'll put the meat right outside as well and see now we're we're also we're harvesting and warming up the same time so it's kind of nice multitasking a little bit and there we go let's just drop what needs to be cured here that's a 500 calories and that was a fat rabbit man 500 plus 240 yeah that's pretty fat I thought they were both 500 at first till 500 that's that's pretty good I'll take it okay drop that drop that let's do some looting oh oh know what let's put the meat outside right outside the front door so we see it every time we come in here perfect should preserve pretty well out there don't worry the wildlife will not get it they won't come for it for some reason they did oh my gosh I would change the dynamics through the game quite a bit we don't have to learn how to play this game a little rancid cooked no I don't think really want to use this but know what if I get to a level five cooking skill I might eat this sometime in the future so I'm gonna take it and put it outside if I leave it in the container there it will disappear when it hits zero percent but if I put it out here it will not disappear it'll stay at zero percent and then I can safely eat it once I hit cooking level five even though I haven't touched it with my cooking skill so go figure cooking level of five gives with the iron stomach can eat anything and everything so well maybe we'll eat that in a cot if we survive like 60 days or something like that and we end up getting our cooking skill that high maybe we'll eventually get there who knows I'll take a quick look at our skills to see where we're at with everything like maybe we don't get to the erogenous episode but maybe in the next episode yeah I think I'm play better I'm thinking I think I'm playing better this this go-around I think version 2.0 is a little bit better than version 1 somebody was like man gotta kill more rabbits dude guys start throw some stones I was like oh yeah silly goose I should be doing that silly goose being me not cuz you're the one that came up with the telogen idea well gotta watch out for that door just comes right right everything's it knock out if it hit just right like everything else will does our message should say aster does extremely slowly opening these doors that doors opening know file cabinet stuff like that vote man she whips those microwave doors right open super fast all right well we do have a little bit of a blizzard if we can do some repairs on some clothes we might do that I think we have plenty of cloth in here don't we yes we do Oh an herbal tea irony definitely use this new hoodie yeah we'll take it I can't believe I'm really excited about a hoodie but we'll take it I'll take it sure it's better than whatever I got right now so let's go take a look here what I got here decent sweatshirt buddies at 7 sweatshirts actually well I got here then wool sweater I need to repair that that's gonna be better in the long run I think Hey okay here we go little bit better sixteen degree warp bonus no could be worse could be better oh that's actually might come in handy never know I don't know we'll leave that because I don't need it right now I think I have what point eight gallons or some everyone okay fine cooks I'll cook some up later once we get a nice sunny day okay um I think that's everything let's take a peek outside see what it looks like if it looks better Oh God looks horrible this yeah quiet to muffles all the sound alright let's uh just do a little bit of a repairs then we'll slitter let's let's go ahead and repair that up I'm glad we have so many sewing kits we are hurting on those before nice 89% and oh yeah yeah yeah hold on let's take a look at our skills I can't believe we're doing this I feel kind of good I do I feel like things are going somewhat decent mending really I've been mending like crazy Betsy Ross over here alright and I'll lay out is level one artery still Oh Michael that's gonna be level one forever ice-fishing haven't tried that yet fire-starting still Wow cooking start to move that cooking up that's gonna be huge once we can get that cooking way up there that would be really good carcass harvesting I'm doing better carcass harvesting than I expected alright well is what it is we percent chance to start fires face chance that is all right let's keep repairing a little bit here anything else not really no everything else is pretty good pretty good condition I really don't want to really need some new shoes as well so that's has a better wind proof bonus but then this has a better warm photos I always go for warmth bonus that's how I roll and do I want to wear that has a much better whimpers bonus that's not in this ability edition that's when we better actually sweat shirt is better than the hoodie cotton crewneck sweater made of heavy cotton high fashion for game developers he says yeah okay uh put that on and I think we will go ahead I need to tear up some curtains uh okay hah curtains for I get to or what I could tell bleached out out to okay I know I could tear up some of their clothes but I'm not wearing but I might want to keep those just in case something it's torn and ruined so yeah we're gonna keep those just in case something is torn or messed up or whatever thirty minutes let's do it there we go that's 1.89 yeah it's better than what I have here okay well let's see if the fog has lifted yeah we're gonna be ready to make some rabbit gear when we get back oh god I hate oh man come on gotta be like that let's hook luck some mistakes make ourselves useful thought I heard rabbit a little pitter-patter rabbit stuff get it air wolf not sure which not sure which well there's a wolf over there right there between the trees about to go behind a rock okay so oh it's starting to lift let's go for it hopefully don't run into the bear oh yeah it looked it nicely actually quite good looks pretty good timing yes 39 degrees guys I think we go I think we check the I think we check the gas station out and we go for it and I think we go for it oh gosh I really need to get some sleep I can't I can't stop I got three wolves out here come on I thought they were supposed to be scarce look back what the heck man why dude heck I stinky I don't think I'm stinky I mean I did use the rabbit meat his pillow but wrong with that Mountain Rope yeah I know it's always there I always put it there there's a place can put it up up top here but I don't know why never really want to not really a lucky day put him back I don't trust him I don't trust those I don't want to get food poisoned okay so I'm gonna go goodness gracious how do I want to go about this I think I'm gonna go wide around this rocker here the kind of looks like Gibraltar and then move in I got to script this one too alright I hate I don't know how Jill tells does it he loves he like loves living at the garage here but I just thought I was pretty good at dodging rules he's really good at and he's really good at interloper oh yeah I have a lot to learn like I'm pretty good this game then watch a couple people you're like I'm alright I haven't heard much from it though lately I wanna pee stop stop doing the YouTube thing or what or the long dark I don't know luckily we have lots of speed like we could run for days lots of stamina ever get into a bad situation we can we can do do what we need to do that deers about to get eaten he's got he's got evil in his eyes alright probably not the best place to play pick-up sticks but it's my let's play I'm gonna do it I want to hey guys doorbell it's not that easy now would tell go back and watch the previous series but YouTube screwed me on that one can't see that footage alright I'm gonna go straight where I think I need to go first please be one there no no it's often there is gonna be a hex I'll stick it out there uh-oh we got several tools at least do we need we need those for the forge heavy hammer I have that scrap metal yeah cool yeah can do that yeah we'll need some more scrap metal so need to make that or maybe bit now I do the hatchet before I make the knife obviously we need more scrap metal and hopefully we run across some I really need is a hatchet those are in really good shape but I did need some gloves so thank thank for that's like a consolation prize okay I'll Lantern will take that absolutely can't depend only 31 percent in dishes but I think we'll find more Landers before that one goes tango uniform this stuff will come in handy still looking for my frickin bedroll right guys I'll let Coop's I'll let read this if want to find it it's select yeah I'll look at each one of them there's one can pause it if you'd like there's the other one and here's the other one alright there go can't get into that one that's my favorite storage locker too what I like to use for us hold on my gear anything yeah just a tin can right yeah look anywhere thank I think it's probably safe to eat I'll eat that one I will take the risk on that still just I'm just double checking triple checking everything really just wanted to make an X on here though now I really really need one like I mean I'm gonna be able to probably make what I need but I'm gonna be able to make it like arrowheads or anything like that not too many of them at least it's gonna be difficult plus uh yeah well probably big do but I the hacksaw really helps really helps recycle can't yeah I might carry the recycle can just in case I start a fire yeah 5555 less of perfect but whatever sorry primer hey it's gonna be my thing be the world's best survival slower water there might leave that Oh No gallon or put to a Cal 20 against whoa got a low flow okay let's see here cuz I'm getting tired is that what it is yeah starting your tire plug oh it's a little heavy I can drop this I'm gonna need that I'm not gonna eat that create that I'll probably I'll drink that and I'll eat the rest but I'm not eating that stuff probably kill me I do need to crouch when I come out at this place especially should yeah it's a good tactic guilt as does it so well I have complete rubbish in it all right those for that sure a lot of other people do it well too but gold for that house back there we got cars on the way what do is duck before go in then go in and then when come out because can't duck while you're in the car when come out it'll put back into a duck position so not my tip but somebody have previously mentioned he's really good at this game really I know could even do that I never knew could do that carry much more oh I just learned something completely new that's pretty cool I think we got to go for a distillation point I don't know if I'll get there start to get tired maybe I just want to go to misanthropic stay the night there then it's not really that far I can probably do that all right well we'll search this and then we'll call this end of the episode looks like we're pretty long in this episode but that's okay guys are guys deserve it sometimes I go a little short and then I make up for it with a longer episode so it all kind of balances out yep nice now those are nice whip it open yeah there go all right some rancid rabbit meat or something search that what about this one yep okay it's ass down here new spirit it's always newsprint down there isn't it herbal tea again same spot nothing there nothing there okay there's your or medicine got anything for me not this time all right I believe that there's well hmm take a little bit just so I can make it through the night tonight and be kind of ready to go for the distillation point in the morning cuz I don't think desolation point has any let me think about it I don't think I have any free water areas like toilets should a Crouch for making about I know I don't think can get sick off of beef jerky I don't think I'll sound very confident about though I don't know I believe myself either okay well I think what we do here we kind of move up here no nothing I think we go up here we go for those houses that were burned out last time hopefully
