hey the friends how's it going my name is Kevin and today we are playing The Sims 4 and if you missed the last episode don't worry I'm gonna fill you you what's going on with my Sims the zombie apocalypse happens so I locked them all in my attic I just realized it shows me thirst for flesh that's pretty cool must eat sim so that's awesome on hygiene that's very important for zombies the brush so yeah I locked them all in here for the moment and and gave them a bit of a cocaine and yeah that was about it I didn't get any closer to solving what happened but I figure maybe I just need to embrace it and just include them in everyday life so naturally what I'm going to do is open a restaurant and hire them all as my waitress and various other staff members a huge help to the channel now back to the video alright I already put it down oh my god that's expensive but okay we're buying it it is lovely though it's very nice like I would eat there or get eaten there one or the other probably eaten I think I would be a victim so you bought a restaurant know what I'm pretty sure whatever you say isn't going to be what I do look at this it's lovely isn't it I got it from the gallery and I made some like minor changes so I'll be safe from behind the counter but yeah it's it's pretty nice I manage employees oh my god you're still alive I thought you always she's a vampire yeah and she used to mind my kids one of them died that's a 50% success rate encoder I guess he's fallen on hard times but he's got a cool factor the restaurant is now open all my chef is here hello you chose interesting clothes wait I just realized I'm gonna need to get some dishes for zombies if they come oh my god what is he chopped her up what do you feel like I saw a hand okay nice don't you take any of that now it's not for you it was awful speak for yourself he doesn't like it probably wasn't the best meal and put this up on the thing just to show were including everyone here okay out of sight out of mind she's gone she seems to have forgotten too she only looks minorly sad okay close the restaurant I need to interact with my employees use the virus on oh yeah now I don't even have to pay yeah the others didn't even show up maybe I should hire someone else like I haven't seen this guy in ages he's all through my Colton he never shows up to anything wait she's not even my chef where did she come from what the hell is going on she was just a random lady all right you know what I will do all the work then uh I gotta go she's just wandering out aren't you you were hired Jim is fired Valentino he will no longer show up for work he's also pretty upset well why didn't he show up himself then it was that a donut oh no that's a sim me plate what the hell is that I had the sim meat played to my his restaurant please and can we just remove everything else looks so [ __ ] weird all right all we do is serve human meat and water cheap price of 49 bucks and the waters free all the hot dogs are here my old gang can my employees show up please what do I do a lot of people being eaten here so many people are waiting to eat but my employees and showing up and they're just eating the free food outside instead I'm pissed God Jim's a sound sleeper he's sleeping through the zombie apocalypse I think my restaurant is broken after all this hard [ __ ] work leave Jim leave problem is I don't even know how to sell my freaking restaurant I'm stuck with it just because I'm too awkward to go about selling the thing let's just buy another one I'll have a collection of them it's a bit of a weird thing to collect but then again Jim's a weird guy all right I'm gonna buy back my old restaurant I already edited it a little bit so it's actually like usable now wait why can't i buy it furnished the [ __ ] god dammit stop hold on stop this madness what the hell why are you sue me on this God he looked like he was here to survive to here the military jacket on everything well have fun out there on the beach folks I respect your privacy or even zombie apocalypse in like real time here Jesus what the hell is this restaurant it's [ __ ] huge oh my god it uses every single stuff pack in the game it costs 1.4 million okay I don't have enough money for this somehow strange Phil is the least strange neighborhood in my game I just didn't mess with it as much oh [ __ ] another mermaid no no Kevin no no distractions come on kids back in restaurants sorted out I want to sell meat goddamn this is such a mess I managed to sell the restaurant I know Jim's at the restaurant it brought me back to my house and I can't get him back here for some reason so Shrek is calling him to come over Jim Pickens will be right over thank God okay he's here great you're back that's why that stupid restaurant he's actually so hard to deal with okay great this place looks lovely look at this this is brilliant I love it all right police work okay there's one I think she's an employee hey there's another okay they seem to be showing up this is great the chefs first day and it's like uh we kind of skirt around having to buy premium meat and they're like ah horse me so it's like no human oh my god it's extremely formal it doesn't look like the type of place that would be super formal or anything looks like a diner he keeps going to eat it he [ __ ] loves it now he's getting a taste for it put it away he's taking notes but he wasn't even using his hand maybe he was using this hand to write it I need some posters up on the wall it's very important available on the merch store link in description yeah just a little plug there has to go up quite high I will he'll be looking down on all of us like he always does and we can replace that that doesn't really fit that static anyway the Jim Pickens one does there we go that's way better put this away taking this out just dropping it on a table there randomly oh my God look at them they're eating it oh she loves it Jesus Christ you can just see the chef going not to the knife in the background that's really disturbing they're loving it okay I went down to answer the door I came back and everyone's dead I'm not sure what happened maybe I'll have it somewhere I know I will didn't even leave recording well fact I don't know what happened everyone's dead well Jim is fine though somehow he's Manning the door she's still my employee look you're just wandering around are you brainless or something oh my god my host is dead too just walking around with the plates I'm so ashamed I didn't mean to mess up please don't put this on my permanent record I'll praise her for accepting criticism you're really good at it which is great cuz you're gonna be getting a lot the appreciation feels great keep conference rolling in I can't get enough of them I don't get fully yourself oh I'll be apocalypse whatsoever my chef is fine but there's no one to cook for wait is my chef fine no my chef is also dead it's gone all right I'm gonna cure my staff just so hopefully we can get back to normal here I need to open my restaurant I need to keep those dollars flowing in oh god damn it come on I just used the serum on you Jesus Christ what are you doing just like Jim is the best don't scream at them seat them you know I'm starting to think this zombie apocalypse might be more serious than we first imagined I think it might take a serious toll on the economy like no one's buying things they just want free food all the time they want to eat people not my people yeah but you have to pay for it I mean why get a human meat plate when you can just eat a human at least this guy's working through the difficulty I respect that could you please leave her alone Jesus Christ all right I'm gonna cure you again and you again oh no one else is showing up should i I'm gonna go out there and tell them to leave administer infection vaccine well that do I've got a different sort of infection too maybe they like cancel each other out they're gonna appreciate that yeah they're pretty pissed all right I can't ask them to leave because they're zombies so you know what I'll just hack you to bits and I'll serve up your meat in the restaurant he's holding the cleavers and he was gonna give me a good review to feck sake shows up he's just packing up this guy into sack lunches oh god damn it my new customers getting eaten too he's just running off oh god damn it his business you gotta be really hard to run isn't it offer effects they closed the restaurant for the day here everyone go home what the hell the Grim Reaper xenia what does she try opening it again I need fresh customers come on what are you dancing for her he's happy whatever business is going someone told you how much they dislike me I've got bigger problems right now one of my staff is literally going into shock here that kid you don't want to be here trust me Jim get out of the way come on leave them hand do his job for once okay what is that kid doing he's standing uncomfortably close thank you for taking a step back when I asked I'm gonna promote this guy he there's a lot of standing around but he looks like he knows what he's doing look how happy he is yay oh no stop it work is what work is it's just a means to an end for me why are you kissing her she's got this bite Mack on the side of her neck and he's just kissing her okay good he's making his way into the kitchen great now where's my waitress you zombie here come on it cure her so she can do the work I don't wanna be waiting tables stop reacting to him he's fine he's doing his job I only bit you a while ago but that it's a fancy restaurant that's what they do in France service at this place is fantastic she's thinking and she's screaming he's playing he's doing his best he can everyone down like she's bitten she gonna change I think you might have to get bitten twice I think you might live if you get one or maybe it just takes the I'm stopped screaming hey screaming about our prices is that we are seeing look it's human meat it's a delicacy I know they're having a great time traditional family meal we all sit at different tables brings me back to Christmas Day we're not getting many customers for some reason I have a feeling a we may not have a great reputation and B I think most people in the neighborhood might be dead who is this guy he's a bit full of himself well you're about to be full of someone else because we serve human meat here get in sorry he's screaming but how good it is I will give them a great review on Yelp it's delicious don't come into the kitchen please I can't control this guy like I can tell the others to stop biting people but this chef I can't interact with him at all other than managing him and the speaking of which she probably deserves a promotion she's [ __ ] stirring flames the funny part is the people like in the restaurant like even her and she huh bitten oh god damn it she's turning ma'am I'm gonna have to ask you to leave god damn it she's gonna eat her family isn't she come here come here stop interrupting stop ruining my restaurant back off you're ruining everything it was going well I come here frozen food there you go maybe I should close that window would that be a good idea but I like it aesthetically it's great I know I know I know but look your mom probably was gonna die sooner or later anyway you know eventually she's gonna thaw out I hope she'll pay her bill he looks so camera but the whole thing just making drinks they're free by the way and you get a song to shut up you know I'd be careful on a date with that guy he's got a hickey see that he's into some freaky [ __ ] why are you crying like genuine question was it that you human meat was it that the chef is a zombie or is it that your mom is pretty much dead I swear he's the best character ever if you just leave him to his own devices hey welcome to the restaurant you've been here before we like to do things a little differently walk out this places great prices there love in this place I'm not getting many customers am i can I like post an advert or something I could get another waiter which would be nice wait I've already purchased it do I have all the perks is it for my last one Luis is very slowest oh it's you I can see why I'm satisfied if I don't even know your first name as I might give him a promotion and then I looked at how much I'm paying him and her promotion is giving him 6 dollars an hour he's earning like three I've been working really hard and I'm so glad you noticed oh I can change these as well okay give me some diamond package advertising fresh organic food when it's packing human meat local GMO free and freshly harvested the only time I'm actually serving high quality food wait what the [ __ ] I thought I told you you weren't allowed to die here that was in your contract how many times do I have to cure this guy he's still doing his job maybe I'll leave it maybe he can do his job we'll see now bees wander that side now god damn it cure the guy all right she's unfrozen close the restaurant they're not leaving where'd you get that I thought we only served human study for historical insights eating like a gossip magazine it's it's all about the history I read it for the articles what I think you just said gulang which is not the solution we're looking for for the zombie apocalypse max killed Jim Pickens is master dance Jim can OD the bakflip and has unlocked a new pair of dancing retro sneakers oh can I get those oh god damn it they shot my power off and Andy's them they're a bit too trendy for Jim I don't think he'd wear them you know what we're gonna take off the colander we need it in the kitchen we're in the restaurant business now wait we're the rest of your hair go oh my god look at a [ __ ] looks oh my God look at that is so trendy Oh slick totally different person I know back to the tried and true there you go oh my God he's eager for me to just ran in that door I'm sorry I know I don't actually do any work I just stands at this specific spot every time for some reason oh god damn it another zombie Jesus Christ no stop don't bite her ah-ha-ha sake he left wait I'd emoted him by accident I meant to promote him I just clicked on anything to distract him please get inside how can I convince you to go inside I feel like I'm the only one working around here you're the only one not working there waiting for a chef inside cage with a bit of motivation he does start working eventually a perfect sake Oh for [ __ ] sake perfect sake then there's another one everyone's just dropping like flies it spreads so quick around the lot look at that I'm starting to think maybe this wasn't a good idea even though Jim is happy and I guess that's all that matters maybe we should end the business here before we even sink further into death you means once there what gives you that impression huh and he's back to dancing that's all he cares about well you know what we'll end it there I hope you guys enjoy this was particularly fun I think I frustrate him to get my restaurant working but once it worked it was very fun I really like this zombie mind it's a ton of fun hey I hope you guys enjoyed if you did I'd appreciate a like I appreciate you watching as always and I guess I'll see you next time bye for now shadows patreon slamming Bank Jones SPC
