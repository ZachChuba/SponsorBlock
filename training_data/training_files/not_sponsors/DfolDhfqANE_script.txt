you little DDoSing double-barrelled or camping rat what is going on YouTube so we're coming at you with another brass video another one of these maps that were looking at one of these monuments rather from a lone design here he he has the submarine I believe it was painted in a community blog a while back quite good and yeah again this guy does amazing work so I really wanted to feature and show it off guys I don't use the mp5 all right so what dresses were dressed a little spec Opie today as you can see loans rooking the fine a tire right now shall shall we chunk out let's get to it oh hell yeah ah this is sick this is really cool be nice if the part that tanks or exploded when you shoot them yeah that's the total opposite I said we'll head 80 East should bring us pretty much right there does did you ever play like a modern warfare 2 really it was like where your honor oil it's actually an oil rig it's one of those special ops nostalgia is real so there's one live submarine and that's the one you can go into the rest of cosmetic alive ones obviously the one with smoke as we approach the ladder is on the house okay [ __ ] yeah that was cool security door right what do we do with this Oh push it so the hatch go on date ye I got sick it's like a nuke sub so yeah this is where flashlight e area yeah so we'll go this way the back end is where the engine room is okay what kind of [ __ ] soldier on this ship has been sleeping with a Pookie bear who doesn't sleep there bro I mean I do because that's my fiancees game handle so we needed a fuse I have a fuse they pop that dude in oh that's just decoration yeah so once the fuse is in you'll make your way over here to the control panel and there's a switch for to override the electricity so now we have some lights on very nice then over here is a blue card reader aller this drone station oh dude I'll be so cool if they had drawings into rust one for people I'll open it for you go fly through people's windows and [ __ ] that would be cool Scott after building this I realized why would you need drones underwater but uh nah well wouldn't you popped up on like this you can send a drug to the show you know make sense it's true very true oh but it's just the whole thing this is the the blue car this is like the puzzle room so yeah this is uh it's kind of a smaller Monument but yes yep that sounds speakers towards the starter area also alerts a RF broadcast as in the spawn oh I can hear yeah as in the where we first drop down Ronson barracks this is where the nan Pookie bear sleepers good as you know what I really want for a monument and I hope you know it is cool to see you make it an underwater one where you need scuba tanks and [ __ ] there is one wait you've made one that does that yep it is in e18 area yeah there's an underwater version II echo it's the same Monument but with a red card within pcs okay also there is a like a secret not a secret door but an extra door here that you can't open it opens up at the same swipe of the blue card so I'll swipe over here get it in my inventory so it should open up that door when I swipe my card there should be a little bit of loot in there in okay 47 torpedoes see you later yeah yeah you can even those are the Rockets from my launch site on the exit hatch push that see the light of day again first alrighty another another victory the custom Monument the other ones had a couple crates on them but you can't go actually in those mmm yeah there's a couple just normal crates nothing too crazy go for it dude there's several things on this map you can do by yourself the pyramid - room - player thing was one of the main - player thinks but you can I think everything else you can do solo I have like Stonehenge stone hinges in a monument it's literally just like a decoration the underwater sub it's somewhere around the e18 you just can disable water to see it yeah and then the auxin gas station and what you can see the towers over there that town is like another kind of monument on its own there's not like any real puzzles on it other than the crane yeah the crane has a pretty neat puzzle and then other than that custom monument wise q11 has a pretty like a lengthy tunnel in it nothing too crazy it's it kind of almost more fits the feel of rust than the other monuments but you can just go through there and just check them out right alright so learn had to go but you know here we are EA teen on his map f18 so it's marked by this it's another submarine but it's underwater and underwater monuments our cool is that we need an underwater monument so it's probably just like the same gist I'd say is the other submarine yeah security door let's have a gaze everything lovely burrata it's probably cuz the submarine I think alright let's go in I mean I don't yeah and it'd be cool if you could swim underneath and stuff alright let's take these is that still going down no it's not going down alright so I think it's pretty much the same submarine we'll just double check that we need to put a fuse in so we got a fuse Chuck that in I think just ready turn that switch right here all right so we're gonna go down here now and use lots of red card to stock so we got a red card out swipe that [ __ ] because it's probably better Lube we already got one of these boxes tool these box three of these boxes goddamn so look obviously needs to be scaled down a bit for these monuments but I reckon he's done a great job on the monuments themselves let's do this again let's swipe it again because this we got two green boxes in there yeah so these are the two submarine monuments on his one under water and one above water let's swim back yeah we're gonna need goggles and flippers remember how I think it's like that I don't know if you can have water through monuments and stuff because remember on water treatment when it's flooded sometimes and then you swim like you go down the ladder into water treatment and it just like it does what that did like you just go into air so maybe that's just the rust thing and can't be fixed right now but you know for the most part that is pretty damn cool anyway guys I hope you guys enjoyed the video and as always I will catch you guys [Music] [Music]
