yo what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video hey in this video you're gonna be seeing some nice 1v2 team wipes that I racked up over the course of the last couple of days playing some crimson doubles with some buds and even a little bit solo I did I didn't play any Titan in doubles this week but you'll see plenty of gunslinger and dog League plays here you'll also see several super shut downs where I sort of lean into the strengths of those subclasses and use them to deal with supers one-on-one also note that all these plays were done live on stream with our awesome community where I can interact in real time with viewers offer insights on how and why I'm doing what I'm doing in the game and it's also an excellent opportunity just to get to know you all who watch my content so if you're watching this video within the first few hours of it going live then I'm live-streaming right now so feel free to come say hello from YouTube and we will greet you warmly just type in true Vanguard calm into your search bar or click the link in the pinned comment I would love to meet now let's chat a bit about crimson doubles we'll start with the bad and you know we'll go from there unfortunately crimson doubles had 12 months to cook and come up with some new rewards to chase and it's pretty lacking in that department it's it's not gonna take you long at all probably just like one good gaming session to acquire just about everything Jax has to offer and the bow The Vow it isn't really the best bow out there and it's well it's a bow yeah there's there's so little surface area on bows there's hard to make them look unique and special it just looks like another bow to me I really I mean just looks like another bow I would have much preferred to see an item that's maybe somewhat knew that we could farm random roles on do this activity you know kind of like we had with the daunting with the SMG additionally I'd prefer to see crimson days rewards drop at the end of crimson doubles matches you know maybe maybe that's something we can see more of in the future I don't know but there's also a lot of good things going on about crimson doubles that thoroughly enjoy too one of those things is quite frankly it's a Shaq's dialogue that we get in that playlist it's it really is fantastic between those lines like you know I the crucible and some Titans like to be tossed and even saying that you're flirting is disgusting you know I spend half the time just chuckling at the shacks lines and you know I I don't know what shacks has going on in his britches but apparently powerful women are into it like between lady Afra needs tossing s X Capades and Maris oov using a freaking autumn car wish to summon shacks to the wishing wall for a booty call I mean I'm starting to think I need to get in on whatever shacks has going on downstairs if you know what I mean but what we quickly on I'm also a huge fan of doubles in general my clear preference is the standard doubles playlist without the crimson day's mechanics but that almost never comes up in the rotation for some reason I don't know I love a good 2v2 playlist with skill based matchmaking on and frankly I think it needs to be in the playlist with I I think my personal opinion I think ski always magically he needs to be on in playlist with small teams like that or else it's gonna be a bad time for lesser skilled players they're gonna get stomped if the game isn't actively trying to find them an appropriate match if to v2 was connection based matchmaking it would literally become the new hottest spot for lame top tier players to go hunting for gold medals by farming teams they can't compete with them they could seriously get we rands undefeated metals like crazy in that environment and they definitely would but obviously the system's not perfect but I've heard a lot of good things from casual players playing with casual players the struggle is when you get a big skill gap in the team though like it's hard to get a good matchup when you have someone who plays a lot teaming up in doubles with someone who plays a little tends to be a bad matchup in terms of your matchmaking but crimson doubles is an excellent place to refine your playstyle and even try out practicing the use of your abilities I've thrown a lot of knives this week like like a lot a lot I'm just willy-nilly going around trying to go for silly Bank shots and cross map tosses I'm also eating celestial fire across the map in hopes of sniping someone with it then along those lines doubles is really an excellent sort proving grounds it's the prime environment to take weapons and builds take them in and test them out see how they fare you can really start to understand the strengths and the weaknesses of things in that environment it's also a great place for learning how to counter various play styles there's a play in this video where my teammate goes down and leaves me in a1 b2 on Twilight gap no I know that both of my opponents are using spare rations and mine vendors so what I did was I ran all the way to the the back of the outside area the big wide-open area and I just laugh as they spam spare ashen shots at me and like barely tickled my health and in that time it took them to you know sort of realize what was happening and start to close the gap on me and making moves on me they actually ended up in the low ground for my teammate who respawn and made his way back and we were able to pinch them in a kill box and wipe both of them out but uh I played that way because I knew that spare rations wouldn't be able to gun me down at range and that they would have to step out into the open in front of my sniper in order to close the gap on me and we ended up winning that round because of that choice it's so much easier to understand the detailed nuances of your play style better in a 2v2 setting where you can cut away all the excess and just keep it simple it's it's also like I'm saying much easier to understand some of the mainstream approaches to PvP in that environment as well I'll be honest high impact fusions are kinda trash against a smart player in to be - it was not difficult at all debate out fusion shots and starve players of ammo who leaned too heavily on fusions in this playlist I mean one unbroken Titan with a one iron mask even switched to an air until halfway through the match and then proceeded to not get a single kill with the thing for the rest of the match and then switched off of it for the next match after that won the rematch that we had after that game was over it's because smart players can bait out voop ammo in a controlled environment like 2v2 the one mechanic I'm really not that crazy about in the playlist is the drifting apart debuff that marks you for your enemies I mean this discourages flanking maneuvers setting up pinches and it favors the more stagnant team additionally I'm not too crazy about the insta heal when your teammate dies I get what they're going for there with that mechanic but it just leads to frustration when you have a player outgunned a now played in a duel and just before you finish them off suddenly all their health gets restored because your teammate kills the other guy and it leaves you with you know you got little ammo in your mag and suddenly you lose an engagement where you were rightfully winning and that's kind of a frustrating mechanic to be honest oh yeah I really wish standard doubles or even skirmish was a regular game mode in the crucible instead of all these other rotators that like in my opinion serve no purpose quite frankly I think it's important for the health of the player base as well that we have smaller controlled skill based matchmaking playlists we're dedicated PV peers can congregate and consistently have good matchups that aren't chaotic like sixes with skill based matchmaking you know I've lived in the doubles playlist this week and I'd continue to invest more time there things like this were permanent some days I really missed skirmish from destiny one even salvage I spent way more time there in d1 than standard sixes those smaller controlled environments is where you really learn and grow most optimally well I hope you enjoyed the gameplay and the conversation today feel free to offer any feedback
