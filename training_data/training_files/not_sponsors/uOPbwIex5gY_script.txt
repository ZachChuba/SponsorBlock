which is a key for steam Origin Xbox and you play well how long has it been since wipe twenty minutes yeah today's adventure begins right after a fresh blue print and white a server cater to group play and since it's a month white people are in it for a long con I overslept and it was a bit late and luckily met up with my friends pretty fast our goal is large oil rig to conquer that monument so early in the game you need to act quick hit barrels recycle make a quick base and rush compound bows usually people have trouble farming large oil rig with the best guns and best deals however we should be able to do it fairly easily with great positioning teamwork and patience that's better but time is against us the oil rig is in the snow this time around and is turning night we need to do it as fast as possible fighting aimbot machines when it's negative 9,000 degrees outside is not offensive because we were rushing and some of us were just getting back into the game after years of not playing pretty much everyone died I'm one hip nice listen to what I'm saying come to the left side comes our West after we kill it's comforted somewhere I have a splitter db's in secret and secret there's people here we thought we were the first ones here but that was wrong someone actually beat us at the very start of why if someone rushed a mini copter with fuel and flew straight into the secret room where elite weights are you can't do this anymore because of recent updates but this meant that visca had feed rain over the last five to six bonds and could potentially have a gun there's a boat coming right now - there's a boat coming right now soon I was left alone and the backup was arriving instead of going for the hero play against however many people I decided to pick up as many weapons as I can and dip out of it if I die we're back to rocks if I live we can always regroup and try again and try again that we did luckily we managed to find a scrap helicopter large oil is so important to gather the items you need on fresh way we can't let these guys house oh my god you're good you're good straight down there is a boat I killed guy on crane nice that was I'm reloading another one coming another one coming let's try to get some guns go get this TV instead this 25 let's go kill the other guy let's go for the other guy right now nice we're getting Tyrone just like we suspected these guys did have a gun and mp5 if we are able to get that you're set for white day I'm Trent I'm going to try to kill the guy on the other one up again I'm going up again I I killed the guy on the other crane okay there's two guys left two hands Matt's left on the bottom what does that be five there's one guy down here you got him got him got him in hindsight actually did here and see a guy swimming away with the mp5 but in the heat of battle I didn't notice until one of his teammates came with a mini copter and they successfully ran away with a key to the white it was now the time to build a main base the design is a double bunker I managed to come up with that as a workaround to my last one which was patched a small 3x3 design but with a lot of peaked outs and means to defend online however while I was trying to get established we were attacked it was a neighboring clan and they also had a lot of firepower if we lose here we could potentially lose a spot and get grieved it was crucial to win this fight Oh mine is up at the base on the trees somewhere I can't see Tommy she I mean shoot me there's nuts are they right in cloudless are they right up yes that right fries are right in front of us many people come out right now I'd shot me dead Tommy's dead okay mine's pushing left sides right now by himself Neal there's a guy on the right side right side really close I've chopped edge I'm dead l9 left side look at me now like you know much murder I hate he's an open field by himself you're killing with you down by the base can they get look em on Phil -
