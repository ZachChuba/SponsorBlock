Hello and Merry Christmas and welcome to an
absolutely beautiful morning in the Lake District for another day of landscape
photography. I've got three locations picked out today this first one is
looking over a very icy and very cold Blencathra so we've got a lot planned
today is gonna be cold, it's gonna be impressive so let's go Okay so I'm set up for my first shot of day I'm in the same
location where I started but I've got the camera set up on the tripod and the
shot I have in mind is pretty much the stunning scene, simply stunning scene
behind me i am using the tilt shift lens again and I am using the shift function
to create a panorama that i am gonna stitch together to get this whole scene
in because I've got this frozen tarn here which is particularly impressive
and that's reflecting some of the light back into the camera that's reflecting
off the snow or the ice on the mountain and it's looking particularly good so
it's gonna be a sort of scene a little bit like this so I've got Skiddaw mountain
in the background that way and then we sort of go across the shot and
then we've got Blencathra which is sort of peaked with a bit of cloud and
it's looking particularly impressive this morning that's the composition I'm
using some of these frozen Reed's in the foreground and then in the mid ground
we've got that frozen tan which is Tewet Tarn I believe and then you've got those......
just they take your breath away to be fair those mountains in the background
there are just remarkable really and that's the shot so all I'm doing is I'm
at....... The camera's turned itself off because I've just been enjoying the
moment. I'm at f/8 and 1/50th of a second iso 100 and then it's five shots
as i rotate or as I turn the shift function
it goes from all the way over to the left and then all the way over to the
right and that's where the shot finishes so a nice panorama with just stunning
light on the mountain there's some really dramatic dramatic light over on
Skiddaw as well which is just really adding to the scene and I think it's
gonna work out really nicely and just be a classic Lake District winter shot. Its a
good start of the day I've got a couple of other locations I want to get some of
this good light with. I'm gonna pack up now I've done some drone work nice little
time lapse as well with the Sun rising up onto that mountain so I want to get to
my next location and make the most of this
truly stunning morning. There's not a breath of wind in the air either it's just really
special really quiet there are a couple of other people around us that's all
good so let's get to the next location So second amazing location of the day
and I'm at Castlerigg Stone Circle it's just a small stone circle which is very
very old....I don't know the details of it I'm sure you can look it up on Google
if you wish it's just outside of Keswick and it's a really accessible location
which I've shot before. The problem with the location is it does get very very
busy it's very popular it's not always ideal for a photograph, a long exposure
can help you out to sort of get rid of the people but this morning there was a
couple of people around when I got here they've now gone and I've got the whole
place to myself so it's working out really nicely an amazing day it still
got a bit of a chesty cough this cold weather is not helping but it is
absolutely stunning morning so the reward is there. I'm feeling good at the
moment I've shot this place before it's
actually really difficult to get a really nice composition because the
stone circle is actually on top of the hill so you can't always get a raised
position to actually see the whole thing if you get close enough you do get a
little bit of that but then you don't get the whole thing in even with a
wide-angle lens I'm using the tilt shift lens to my advantage again today because
I've got the tripod up as high as it will go cameras as high as it will go
and then I'm using that shift function again to take a panorama of the stone
circle with a wide-angle lens if you just sort of tilted the camera around to
do your panorama it wouldn't look right it would just look very warped in the
image but this tilt shift lens.... as you use that shift function to move the lens
across the sensor it really really produces a really nice panorama I'm at f/16 because there's quite a lot of difference in the depth of field between
the front stone and the back stone so I'm at f/16 to get that maximum depth of
field. I am at ISO 100 then I'm just balancing out that exposure with my (ISO - error in speech) shutter speed and I'm
just being careful because it's brighter on this side where the Sun sort of
starts to approach the image that it is on this side so I've underexposed a tiny
bit on this side and as I go across the image is just nicely exposed and I'll be
able to sort that out in post-production I've taken the shot already I'm really
happy with it I've just did about five shots again which I'm going to stitch
into a panorama and it should work out really nice the mountains are
snow-capped in the background I've got some really interesting clouds as well
it's just looking absolutely beautiful I've got a busy day but what a great way
to start it. That feeling of well-being I keep talking about I've been in
desperate need of that recently so it's good to be out and about again
shooting some landscape photography right time for the third location of the
day Okay so I'm in position for the last
shot of the day and this is probably going to work out just as a bit of a
scouting shot because the light on the mountain behind me which is Skiddaw is
not quite right it's a bit cloudy over here as you can see where the lights
coming from and I wanted that to be casting that nice light right across
onto the mountain itself at this time of year in the Lake District or this far
north it is pretty much golden hour all day
long so you get that really good quality light striking the mountains especially
when they're snow-capped as well there is a bit of cloud coming down across the
top of the mountain as well so it's not gonna be the perfect shot but I wanted
to come here while I've got the tilt shift lens. The tilt shift lens is not mine, I
am thinking about getting one because it's adding a lot to what I'm doing the
reason is because similar to the last shot is this in this position even with
a wide-angle lens you struggling to get that whole shape of Skiddaw in there so
I wanted to use a panorama and panoramas that this tilt shift lens creates are
just so much nicer and so much smoother and less distortion than your normal
type panorama with a normal lens it's really like the images that it produces
I wanted to come to this spot which I've been to before just to get it right
composition wise again it's not perfect there are actually some rocks hiding
under the water here the water level is quite high today I wanted to use them as
my foreground interest but it's not to be but there is these sort of reeds
covered in ice here which are still providing some interest in the
foreground you've then got the the lake there which is Bassenthwaite Lake I've
got a polarizer on just to take a little bit of the sheen off the top of the
water and then you're up into the mountains I'm at f/16 because I'm quite close
to this foreground and then obviously that mountain is quite far away so I
want that maximum depth of field. I'm at a shutter speed of about an eighth of a
second I believe and then i'm at ISO 100 I'm doing the five shots with the tilt shift
lens just using that shift again I'll combine it in post-production and it'll
come up with the final image there is a nice bit of light actually striking the
mountain and it's gonna add a bit of contrast to the scene as well but I
think as a whole it's still gonna be a pretty nice Lake District panorama image
and that's what today has been all about. So what an absolutely brilliant morning
in the Lake District it's really got me into that Christmas mood all this frost
and ice and the cold weather and the beautiful snow-capped mountains. I'm
looking forward to some time with my family over the next few days as well
yet again another absolutely spectacular day in the Lake District and today I
wanted to make it just so it was a bit more accessible. I didn't want to climb up a
mountain today because I've still got this cold which is lingering. It takes
longer to get over when you're a bit older doesn't it?.... but..... what I've been
thinking about doing as well is creating sort of photo guides and walking guides
with GPS positions of where I've been during the vlogs. If that's something
you're interested in please do leave a comment down below and let me know it
will include pictures of where you can park, instructions of where you can take
a decent shot, all that sort of stuff I want to hear from you. I'm not gonna be
able to offer it for free because it will take quite a lot of work so I'm
thinking around about five pounds will be pretty reasonable but let me know
what you think down below in the comments and really appreciate your
feedback on this as well before we go please do share this video sharing the
videos really means a lot to me it helps me out as well
to get my video seen by more people but I hope you have a really really great
Christmas I'll see you on New Year's Eve as well and I hope you have a great day
and lots of good things happen to you whatever your belief, whatever your
religion. Also this video is sponsored by get 10% off your first purchase
