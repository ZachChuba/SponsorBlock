when it comes to phones I don't conform to the mainstream trends I don't need at all aspect ratio screen a good camera or if Tim sleek design what I need as a gamer is the fastest high-resolution screen biggest thx sound and the logo that says this product was made by a lifestyle brand for gamers and like it should have like our GPS okay so just to be clear you don't want any of the stuff that most people consider important yeah as long as it has RGB and [ __ ] yeah oh-kay thanks I think we're done here no not just yet first I need to tell you about our description [Music] when we reviewed the razor phone one we weren't exactly sure what a gaming phone was supposed to be and frankly now that we're looking at the second iteration it isn't much more clear so under the hood of the razor phone 2 you'll find a qualcomm snapdragon 845 processor 8 gigs of lpddr4 x ram 64 gigs of expandable internal storage a large 4,000 milliamp hour battery and dual 12 megapixel rear cameras with sony sensors that support 4k 30fps recording just like pretty much any other non gaming phone not to mention in a much more attractive form factor like this this whole thing that they got going on this really looks more like a cost saving approach to tooling rather than an attempt to create an iconic design which isn't to say that they haven't improved anything to last year's model they've added wireless charging thanks to the glass back slightly faster cellular networking ip67 water resistance a blessing and a half for toilet gamers a brighter screen with HDR capability and of course razer crobat not gonna lie it looks pretty sick like honestly I'm getting kind of like an underwear model vibe here like it's it's beautiful from the back with the new glass finish and the illumination but then it's got a face that deserves to be cropped right out of the frame like dem bezels yo the screen the body ratio of the razor phone to is absolutely abysmal for a modern device and not helping matters is the sixteen by nine screen aspect ratio that makes the overall design of it feel really dated especially with the on-screen navigation buttons taking up even more real estate like it kind of felt like going all the way back to a four by three monitor by comparison I mean in fairness to razor sixteen by nine is still the dominant aspect ratio for TV and YouTube content consumption so they've got that going for them and of course in exchange for those unruly bezels we are getting the rare treat of dual amplified front-facing stereo speakers it's just that the asus rog phone has that too and it's bezels aren't nearly as cumbersome that right there is honestly the biggest problem for the razer phone - it's not the only gaming phone in town anymore and if we compare our two gaming phones side-by-side the ROG phone really seems to meet or beat the razor phone - at nearly every turn on the spec sheet and it's got a headphone jack something that raised our dresses with a dongle in the box so then contrary to our silly intro I've always been into the performance aspects rather than the lifestyle aspects of gaming hardware so how does it fare there then well this is actually a more complicated question to answer than you might initially think on mobile devices in particular specs tell us only part of the story a high-end CPU without adequate cooling can perform like a mid tier or even an entry-level one and it's here that razer manages to really shine while the razer phone - isn't far and away the single fastest phone out of the bunch we tested in its normal mode it maintains its performance for longer than many of the phones we tested our og phone included in games this along with its large battery makes its high performance gaming endurance its main source of gamer cred over most of the competition moving on then of our three major complaints about the razor phone one we've crossed one of them off the list so far let's look at the others the ergonomics frankly they still suck the big one because they didn't really change so I could tell you guys just go watch the original video to get our thoughts on that but that's kind of stupid so here's a summary it's heavy and boxy which makes it dig into the palm of your hand more than a more rounded design and the fingerprint sensor equipped lock button is flush mounted making it difficult to find by feel and even harder to access if you use a case as for the camera well I don't know it probably better not a hundred percent sure since we accidentally on purpose kind of trashed our razor phone one when we were installing liquid metal on its processor but even if it was better than the original razor phone that's about like beating your six-year-old cousin in a footrace compared to current non razor phones the most charitable thing I can say about it is that it sometimes manages to capture an image that I would describe as competent the issue is just that at this price it draws comparisons to true flagship phones like the iPhone 10s Macs and the Galaxy S nine plus it just can't hold a candle to them I mean there might be a candle there but that bright point in the image it would be so blown out it would be hard to tell I mean razors camera app is at least a little more fleshed out but it's still laggy and it lacks features like slow-motion face detection or anything resembling manual control and the only thing I can say in its defense there is that the ROG phone's camera ain't great either so at this point as you've probably guessed this is not gonna become my daily driver like its first gen sibling it's just it's not competitive especially not for the $800 price tag for $100 more the base model ROG phone offers double the storage a two to one screen aspect ratio and always-on AMOLED display albeit at a mere 90 Hertz versus 120 max a far better camera app dual SIM card slots and better overall performance plus it includes an active cooler though you do give up the superior ip67 water resistance and a micro SD card slot on that note the razor phone too has its bright points it's still got an excellent almost stock Android skin and front firing stereo speakers with that 120 Hertz panel that is just so smooth the problem is just that while people like me can rank phones and talk about their pros and cons you the end user can only buy one and this just ain't it you check them out at the link below so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video the bottom is right there but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description that way that's very cool also down there is our merch store turned off that's breathing also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should definitely join
