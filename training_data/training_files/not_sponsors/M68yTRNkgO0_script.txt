ah right faster we don't get 10 scripts written by the time Linus gets back he's gonna make us go to the lucky room not the lucky fruit sir they're moving as fast as they can but having to move their hands from the mouse the keyboard is taking up valuable time not to mention the repetitive motion to straining their hands ai dios mio [Music] [Music] [Music] not today lucky not today yeah that's that's not what it's like to use this thing it's kind of janky but it's actually not as janky as it looks private Internet access that's exactly features as well check it out at the link in the video description the roller mouse red Wireless belongs to that kooky corner of the tech industry that doesn't try to give us the coolest-looking most game errific products to help us get more headshots know the tribe that this gadget belongs to is the one trying to delay the slow death by sitting that all heavy PC users inevitably fall victim to and if they have to make a weird Rolly wrist rest mouse thing to do that by golly so be it they're saving your life for pete's sake now the idea according to contour who makes the roller Mouse is that the motion of moving your hand over to your mouse and back to your keyboard is one of the major culprits that can cause repetitive strain injury or RSI moving your hand down a few inches instead of a foot or so to the side is definitely improvement in that regard but how effective is it whereas other organ AMA cows designs like vertical mice allow your hand to rest in a neutral handshake like position the roller mouse still requires you to pronate your wrist that means your wrist is rotated inward causing the radius and ulna bones in your arm to criss cross so while it eliminates that repetitive side motion it's still not perfectly ergonomic but are any of us now I called this thing weird earlier but as far as economic peripherals go the roller mouse doesn't look bad I mean yeah the concept of using a big roller as your mouse is unusual but the whole device itself looks kind of classy its structure is metal with a silver black and red aesthetic and these nice leatherette coverings on the wrist rest hmm it does not look or feel like a cheap device of a break after a couple weeks which is good because it's not cheap it's 265 bucks but the price might be worth it if it saves you some trips to the chiropractor to fix your screwed up shoulder do you go to the chiropractor for that is it physiotherapist acupuncture so here's how the roller mouse works rolling the bar up or down translates to vertical mouse movement and sliding the bar translates to horizontal mouse movement it ends up feeling a lot like using a trackpad on a laptop from an alien planet where everyone has wheels for hands and this was the best solution they could come up with now you can either click by pushing down on the roller bar itself or by using the surprisingly high-quality left-click button on the module below the roller bar there you'll also find buttons for the right click double click copy paste cursor speed and a scroll wheel which also serves as a middle click on the left side is a microUSB port for charging contour claims it can last three months on a single charge and on the bottom there's the power switch and a little cavity to hold the USB dongle then using the roller mouse is as I mentioned a lot like using the trackpad on your laptop and because of that I was able to adapt to it pretty quickly initially I found it necessary to move both hands down to use my right hand for the roller bar and click with my left hand but after a few hours one-handed use was no problem I found the best style for me is to manipulate the roller bar with one finger the scroll wheel with another and use my thumb to left-click since you can remap the double click button to also serve as a left right or middle click there are a few other minor customization options here as well like changing the force required to activate the click on the roller bar or disabling the click altogether now this being an ergonomic device there are also some things you can do to make the whole set more ergonomic it comes with these risers that can raise or lower your keyboards height and angle to be flat with the roller mouse and there's also two other types of wrist rest attachments available the red plus palm support for 20 bucks and the arm support red for another 150 bucks wha no wait is this product dumb it might be see while the touchpad like nature of the roller mouse makes it easy to learn it also makes the benefits a real touch pad has over the roller mouse much more obvious pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling are the obvious examples but a number of people in the office also remarked that the roller bar design seems less responsive and precise than their laptop trackpad moving the bar all the way to the right or left will make the cursor snap to that side of the screen so at times you can't just drag the mouse directly to where you want it the cursor will often go past your intended destination and then you have to bring it back now to be fair I used this on my ultrawide monitor at my desk and it was more of a problem there than it would be on a regular 16 by 9 display but still with all these buttons I wish they'd have programmed one of them to pause Mouse movement like on the key Mouse that James reviewed so I can you know recenter the bar that might have helped with the feeling that I was fighting the cursor sometimes and like I mentioned earlier while you are skipping the lateral motion of reaching for your mouse which could be the solution for your particular elbow RSI for example it doesn't solve everything your wrist is still pronated and you're still dealing with ulnar deviation while using the roller bar that is laterally bending your wrist like this so while the roller mouse might be better ergonomically for people with certain RSIs I don't think I'd recommend it for the general public now that said I do find this whole idea of integrating a wrist rest with a mouse to be pretty interesting and while reviewing the roller mouse there were times where I liked having the mouse control right there already under my fingertips what I think would be really cool though is something like this but with a touchpad so I could also use gestures like pinch to zoom and to finger scrolling sadly while there are a number of other wrist rest devices with a similar roller bar type of design I couldn't find any wrist rest touch pads now you can buy good desktop touch pads for less than half the price of this thing if you want to try it out it's really too bad the roller mouse is so expensive I really wanted to believe speaking of things I save 15% through the link
