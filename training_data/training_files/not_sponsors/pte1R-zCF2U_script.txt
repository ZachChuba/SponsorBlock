everyone is lady right welcome back to another reaction in this video we're going to react to nature and their uncensored version of the music video girl the reason why I finally decided to react to this it's like I'm hearing a lot of people like mentioning them especially with this uncensored version of the music video but then again I don't really know anything I did know about them and like this YouTube video you know there was like kpop news video it says Rosie kind of like encouraged nature to like stand beside them or something like that I mean that is cute but it's like you know it's it's a nice thing to do but I don't think it needs that much of like oh my god Rosie did this you know it's just kind of like too much but then again you know it's always nice to see and know about a new upcoming k-pop group so yeah I'm definitely all for this I'm so excited and I heard this is pretty dark of course I'm going to just straight check out the uncensored version common and Instagram shout out like subscribe down below the belt and let's get in [Music] okay I don't like scissors okay we have Dawes and rest strings okay I'm definitely scared guys seems like everyone have like died already or something [Music] oh my god this tune is so disturbing oh [Music] yeah that was the thumbnail the needle to the eye but the vocal slaps them Wow [Music] Wow what okay now both of them are in a bathtub I'm so confused I'm so confused right now [Music] oh I mean they all look stunning like what is going on whoa what someone literally just oh my gosh she's blind oh my god this is giving me like the Coraline moments Wow what [Music] oh excuse me yes but like tell me what's going on girls I'm not kidding I have like goosebumps right now I don't know what's going on [Music] [Music] under on eclis my eyes just like automatically lend it to my sisters Bible right here I'm scared I'm scared okay so so far from what I know this song is like super different from their previous ones not that I I think I've heard of it but I can't really like remember them right now it was uh what is it oopsie and I'm so pretty is it yeah and it's like nowhere near to whatever this is and I honestly think it's very interesting the first thing that comes into mind when it comes to like regularly kind of these like eerie and dark concept kind of music video would be a dream catcher but even dream catcher is nowhere near to this level of like gruesome and dark and just like I don't know it's almost like close to insanity kind of horror concept and I definitely think it's a very interesting move I wonder why they choose this concept and to go you know with this like song music itself I'm obsessed so even though like with the music video it sounds really creepy but it like it almost like complements it even more and it just makes the experience of the song that much more inviting and exciting so yeah I'm definitely very surprised I'm also like very very confused of like what is going on why is everyone like making each other blind so many scissors and like sharp objects yeah that's always not gonna make me very comfortable or like any sharp objects there like anywhere near to the eye so we literally have a scene of an actress like trying to go straight through one of the girls face so I'm just like wow I don't know if there's any other way I should put this but I'm sure feel free to leave your content like this and I'll see you in a next video all right
