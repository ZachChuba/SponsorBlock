hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with queso deb that's right i'm going to show how to make a cheese
dip that's better looking better for and way way better tasting than anything
you're gonna get at the store and of course whether that amount of extra
effort is going to be worth it is going to be up to and will depend on
factors like how much plan on drinking but if do decide to make
your queso dip from scratch want to use this very easy and virtually
foolproof technique and to get started what we'll do is grate about a 1/2 pound
of cheese and I usually don't film this but it's come to my attention - some of
are still using pre grated cheese which i think is a terrible idea since
it's usually of lesser quality and coated with cellulose dust so do me and
your guests a favor and take the extra minute or less it takes to grate this
yourself oh and in case you're wondering I'm using a nice sharp white cheddar
here but any melty cheese will work and sometimes I'll go with half Monterey
Jack and half cheddar since that's how they did it in the Mexican restaurant I
worked out in college so feel free to use whatever want
I mean are after all the hey-zeus of your cases which by the way is a much
better rhyme in English but anyway no matter what cheese we use once it's
grated we're gonna toss it with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch alright just
sprinkle it over and take a spoon and give it a toss and then as soon as our
cheese has been successfully starched we will set that aside and we can move on
to preparing the base of our dip and for that we're gonna melt about a tablespoon
of butter over medium high heat to which we will add some finely minced or
crushed garlic as well as some sliced green onions and I'm just using the
white and lighter parts here but we will save some of the dark green parts to
garnish the top later if we want and then to our garlic and onions we will
also add a nice big pinch of salt as well as a little bit of ground Chipotle
which as probably know is a smoked jalapeno and we'll finish up with a
little bit of cumin and then what we'll do is cook this stirring on medium high
for just 2 minutes ok we're not trying to brown or caramelize anything here all
we're doing is taken off the Rodge so like I said we will only give that a
couple minutes before adding the next two ingredients which would be 1/2 cup
of canned fire roasted chilies and I'm actually using hatch chilies
here but any of your popular fire-roasted camp peppers will work as
would of course freshly fire roasted chilies oh yeah get extra credit for
that and I will also toss in some diced seeded tomatoes and we'll go ahead and
give that a stir and cook this for like two minutes
and by the way as might know I'm not a huge fan of using fresh tomatoes in
the middle of winter but I'm happy to report this is one of the few recipes
where terrible supermarket tomatoes actually work pretty well so this time
at least we can include those without any shame and then what we'll do after
we've cooked our tomatoes and peppers for a couple minutes is add one can of
evaporated milk which depending on the brand use will come in lots of
different colors none of which will be white all right they can range from a
pale yellow to a light brown but don't be concerned okay that color happens
because of the way the milk is condensed which reminds me
please do not accidentally use sweetened condensed milk that will not be good and
what we'll do after stirring that in is wait for it to come up to a boil because
once it does what we'll do is give it a stir and then carefully and confidently
add our cheese and we will stir that in and the combination of our melting
cheese plus that cornstarch swelling up in this hot liquid is going to thicken
this mixture up and then very important as soon as our cheese is melted we want
to immediately turn off the heat all right we never want to boil a cheese
sauce because it will get all grainy and separated and not have a good texture so
as soon as that cheese melts turn off your heat and then we'll finish this up
by stirring in a nice handful of chopped cilantro if you're going to use it okay
if don't like it don't put it it's not gonna bother me at all but I do like
it so I'm gonna stir some in and that's it at this point our queso dip is pretty
much done except of course we have to taste it for seasoning which we are not
going to do off a spoon or our finger all right we need to use a chip which
have salt on them and by tasting this on a chip we will get a much more accurate
gauge for whether we have to adjust the seasoning and I decided might need a
little more salt and a little more heat so I gave it a few shakes of cayenne and
gave it one final stir and that's it once that's tasting exactly how we want
will go ahead and serve it up next are
probably a whole bunch of corn chips and I hope like how those look because
those took me about 30 minutes to arrange but anyway we will serve that up
and maybe top it with some more diced tomato and possibly a little scattering
of green onion plus one last gratuitous shake of cayenne and that's it our queso
is now ready for our face though so let me go ahead and dip in and that my
friends as can imagine was absolutely delicious and as I mentioned
earlier sure this takes a little more work but the taste and texture of this
is so far superior than anything out of a jar it is not even close to the same
experience oh and speaking of texture is this stuff cools down it will thicken up
but only to a certain point all right one of the things I love about this
recipe is even when it's fully cooled it still retains a beautiful creamy smooth
texture and above and beyond avoiding like a dozen ingredients we can't spell
or pronounce the beauty of making this from scratch is that can easily tell
if this to your own personal tastes okay we already said could add different
cheeses but could also have things like pickled vegetables or maybe some
roasted corn or yes even a handful of nice crispy bacon but anyway that's it
how I like to make queso cheese dip which if don't speak Spanish
translates to cheese cheese dip but anyway whether you're going to serve
this for the big game or just any old time your craving of delicious cheesy
snack I really do hope give this a try soon so head over to food which is
calm for all the ingredient amounts of more info as usual and as always enjoy
