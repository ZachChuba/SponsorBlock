today's video is brought to you by upstart hey brother J it goes together like peanut butter and jelly like pickled okra and sharp cheddar like mustard orbs and salami that's mustard seed on the salami maybe even like work in some of that sharp cheddar from the pickled okra for a little extra pizzazz you all be disappointed you heard it here first hashtag mustard orbs but today it's star wars and ice cream boom boom let's face it it's a pairing that goes back as long as I can remember you can't have one without the other yeah what do you mean it's not a thing it's definitely a thing it's the kind of thing ice cream and star wars yeah always been a thing [Music] guys financial responsibility is a big again that is upstart com slash SCB link is in the description down below let me spin you the tale of the time ice cream first landed on the sky planet of Cloud City could you just way back in the day a film unlike any other was being delivered to the anxiously awaiting eyes of the occupants of planet Earth the Empire Strikes Back highly regarded as one of the greatest Star Wars films of all time we saw action we saw battles we saw speeders we saw lightsabers the force and most importantly ice cream machines well just one as far as I know but you'd never be too sure yeah so if you don't know what I'm talking about it happens right here when the lovely folks of cloud planet or planet are evacuating due to impending doom the Empire has moved in and Lando has informed his people that they should all evacuate before more troops arrive they have fans taking control more imperial troops around where he thinks they're going to go on a floating city other than just somewhere else in the floating city is beyond me city no wait what either way everyone immediately freaks out grabs their most prized possessions and everything is just sheer chaos for the most part the things that people seem to grab is like giant cases of resources and stuff you know food water shelter but one guy this guy who actually has a name will row hood grabs a peculiar shaped object go ahead and give it a guess what do you guys think this is turbine engine small portable Death Star seriously leave your guess in the title section down below I'll give you to the count of three one it's an ice cream maker sorry I couldn't wait let me give you a scenario your house is on fire you get to pick one thing before you leave and before the Death Star blows up your entire planet and the house fire didn't matter anyway wow that sentence had no idea where it was going what either way we'll row you could have grabbed like family photos heirlooms the safe full of valuables and instead you chose your Hamilton Beach ice cream maker available on Amazon for $32.99 with free one-day shipping but apparently it also makes frozen yogurt custard sorbet gelato and sherbert so no matter how pretentious you are about needing ice cream this bad boy has covered although but you know what when these reviews are not great horribly bad durability at last in five uses check to see if yours works as soon as you take it out of the box come on will ro pick a better thing so yes after this movie released back in 1980 eagle-eye fans started to realize that one evacuate of the city was prioritizing his sweet tooth above anything else or was he see one of the more common things that is done in Star Wars is the use of everyday objects that are then incorporated into the set as like props for example this communicator that clogged on is talking on is actually made out of a woman's razor painted silver Goodluck unseeing that the lightsaber that Luke gets from obi-wan in the original Star Wars is actually made out of a flash tube from camera Anakin has a scoop and throw toy in his bedroom IG 88 was just simply made out of spare parts that they found around the set and now look it's entirely integral to the design of bounty droids that random mishmash of parts has just taken a life of its own and now we're seeing it like in full use in the Mandalorian my favorite part is the way he steps over this dude right here like who'da thought he was gonna take that step that way in fact let's watch it again even the reputation merit I'm just gonna say it cool this step in Star Wars by a mile but for whatever reason the purpose or else real identity of this obviously actually an ice cream machine prop has remained an unconfirmed mystery for years unconfirmed that is until earlier this year when a clip came out for the Mandalorian that showed our main dude being promised an entire Kanto no of bhaskar in exchange for completing a mission I become tone of bass car waiting for you upon delivery of the asset now the best car steal that you see here is extremely valuable and extremely durable metal that has been around in Star Wars for a while it can deflect blaster fire glancing blows from a lightsaber and will literally last centuries the Mandalorian has given one blob of best car as a down payment in order to complete the mission which he then melts down into a super cool shoulder guard which by the way is possibly one of my favorite scenes the Mandalorians arf-arf except of course for luna yes if I had to rank my favorite scenes so far it is one little Yoda to the arm guard thing three this step the reputation Baron who man is really cool step maybe that is number two but what is a cam tone oh this is in fact a new word in the Star Wars lexicon earlier this year it was revealed by Gizmodo that a cam Tohno is a small lock box or safe so if you were thinking that like home an arm always about to get a whole ship's worth of best car which is exactly what I thought it meant you would be wrong unfortunately it's not that much that would be like an absurd amount of best car like not for nothing but you could probably buy your own cloud planet for that much instead after a little bit of searching it turns out that the Zach amount of best car is whatever you could possibly fit into a Hamilton Beach ice cream maker available on Amazon for 30 and how do we know that because jon favreau writer and director of the mandalorian tweeted this picture of exactly what a cam Tohno looks like that's right it has been confirmed that Oh will Rowe hood is not as foolish as we might have thought he is not carrying a fully automatic no stirring needed just add ingredients it does all the works then stops when it's ready ice cream maker it's just a cam tone Oh or is it I mean let's face it this would be a pretty boring video who made you sit through an entire explanation about a thing you probably already didn't know about then the only thing we did was reveal that it does not in fact an ice cream maker please subscribe you're welcome mind blown or whatever no no no can't oh no don't you worry we haven't lost all hopes towards getting back to frozen treats yet because just like how the force awakens is essentially the exact same story as a new hope with a modern cast and better graphics who are about to come full circle cam tono may mean say for small lockbox in the Star Wars universe but just for giggles I decided to look it up and guess what it means wait for it ice cream yes cam tono is a hidden nod to the fact that will bro was in fact carrying an ice cream maker but the source of this word makes it even better because cam tono is not like some random word from an alien language that George Lucas made up or even from any foreign language on earth for that matter it is actually from a viral video in 2017 where a little girl is unable to say the word ice cream and instead says cam toe no Delta eat ice cream adorable right I highly recommend you check out the whole video link in the description down below but so if you are keeping track here is the full chain of events in 1980 The Empire Strikes Back comes out and for 40 years people wonder what will Roe Hood is rolling down the hallway then in 2017 Delta the baby girl fails to pronounce the word ice cream then jon favreau thinks it so funny that he sneakily inserts it into the mandalorian inventing a use and giving it a secret code name for the ice cream maker and that is the great Star Wars ice cream mystery solved guys if you want to see more Star Wars action from us you can check out this video right here to figure out where a little Yoda comes from or this video right here to figure out what the different lightsaber colors mean otherwise if you haven't liked the video already be sure to do that and subscribe to the channel and guys I will see you on Tuesday
