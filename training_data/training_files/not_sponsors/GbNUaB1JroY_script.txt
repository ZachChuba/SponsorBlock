this video is sponsored by brilliant hey hey hey hey what's up I'm going to talk to you today on how you can choose the sex of your baby I think I'm gonna take this upstairs because it's so nice outside today so sex selection or choosing whether you would have a baby girl or baby boy it's something that can be used by couples who want to avoid passing sex linked genetic disorders to their children or by parents who have a child of one sex and they want to have a child another sexagon which is called family balancing with regards to couples who want to avoid passing on sex linked genetic disorders children conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy for example usually only affect boys and hemophilia almost always passes from mother to son in these circumstances a doctor would probably just use a girl embryo they wouldn't really need to test for specific genes as well so first off we have a method simply called sperm sorting this method works on the premise that you can separate x and Y sperm through centrifugation during centrifugation controlled spinning causes particles and sample to become sorted into layers according to density of those particles so this process separates the more dense experiment normally roughly half of a sperm sample will carry the Y chromosome producing a male child and the other half of the sperm will be the X chromosome producing a female child females typically have Q of the same kind of sex chromosome so two x's while males typically have two different types of sex chromosomes so an X and a Y chromosome so by separating the sperm based on density you can increase the chances of producing a child of specific sex during sperm sorting the sperm cells are separated from seminal fluid and the sperm are concentrated into healthy and motile sperm so you obviously took away all the unhealthy on viable sperm and finally you separated into X and Y chromosome sperms to get the desired sex and there is another method of sorting sperm and that is through the use of slow cytometry which has been termed Microsoft but because flow cytometry based sperm sorting uses fluorescent dyes that can stain DNA the safety of this technique is a bit of an issue at the moment currently the sorting process is available at Microsoft arbitraries only in Mexico Malaysia and North Cyprus and Switzerland so flow cytometry is a cell analysis technique where measurements of cells in solution can be made as they pass by the instruments laser at rates of like 10,000 cells per second and they pick up the cells by using fluorescent parameters because the cells are fluorescent Lee died so cells are fluorescently labeled and the suspension is put through the analyzer when the cells passed the laser the laser black beam illuminates a single cell some of the light will strike physical structures within the cell causing the light to scatter this light scatter can be measured and correlated with relative cell size and structures inside the cell at the same time light from the laser will excite all fluorophores associated with a cell which produces a fluorescence emission and all of this light is collected by the detector the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the DNA of chromosome ly normal fluorescently stained sperm there is depending on the presence of the X or the Y chromosome the X chromosome contains more DNA than the Y chromosome in humans X chromosomes bearing sperm X chromosome bearing sperm has approximately 2.8 percent more total DNA than Y during spring so basically X chromosome sperm have more DNA so in a study which I will link down below they used flow cytometry to evaluate semen for volume concentration percentage mumtaz sperm progression and viability before and after processing so fluorescence emitted by each stain sperm after laser excitation was directed through a 400 nanometer long pass filter to forward and right angle detectors so properly orientated sperm identified and gated by some 90 degree fluorescence intensity [Music] properly oriented a sperm were identified and gated based on minor degree fluorescence intensity the sperm identified were electrostatically electrostatically a deflected from this sample stream and into the collection container for any given sort only one type of sperm so either a girl or boy sperm was intended for collection and they aimed to have 60,000 motile sperm elected posts or one sperm has been sorted it can either be used by inter neutering insemination IUI so just depositing the sperm in the uterus after sorting or with in vitro fertilization arrived yet and just in case you didn't know IVF involves the retrieval of eggs their outsides and performs the fertilization in a petri dish and resulting embryos are then transferred to the uterus this study was carried out between 1994 and 2012 with nearly 5,000 couples they performed 7,000 ish sorts of which 5,000 fish I think was 73% were exports and the other 27% we're why sorts the sort of specimen contain an average of 88 percent of experience barium after egg so it's an 74.3% y-bearing sperm after wife so it's so it's slightly more successful if you wanted a girl it's not a perfect science but it does increase your chances of having one or the other compared to your normal you know 50 50 percent chance and then we have pre-implantation genetic testing this is a procedure that can be done during IVF to remove one or two cells from an embryo and test them for genetic or chromosomal disorders there are two types of tests pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or PDD and pre-implantation genetic screening or PGs both can be used to screen embryos for sex but which tests you have depends on the reason why you two this x-ray child in PGD parents with serious inheritable genetic disorders can have their embryos tested and reduce the risk of having a child at the same condition sometimes it's important to determine the sex of the embryo because certain genetic disorders are sex linked and mainly affect males for example if a couple is at risk of having a son with Duchenne muscular dystrophy PGD can identify male embryos with a normal gene then these would of course not be implanted in the uterus in PGS embryos from parents who are presumed to have a normal number of chromosomes are tested for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome PGs can also screen embryos for sex so some fertility clinics offer this test for non-medical reasons including family balancing PGD MPT azar almost a 1 percent accurate at determining the sex of the embryo because embryos artistic for sex before they are planted in the room whereas sorting sperm is effective but as previous mentioned you don't have that almost hundred percent guarantee that you are going to have either a girl or boy and when we've got the legality issue of selecting a baby 6 it is illegal to choose your baby sex and places like the UK Australia and Canada unless there is a medical reason for it so I had to do a bit more reading to so go check them out and thanks for watching bye
