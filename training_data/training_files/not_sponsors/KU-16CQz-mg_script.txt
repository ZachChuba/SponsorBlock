this is dangerous [Music] yo yo hey so alright here's the deal here's what's happening you guys might remember the video we did a few days ago where Sam and I made a bet about an Amazon delivery guaranteed new day shipping that arrives I owe you 20 if it doesn't arrive on her before the 30th then you owe me ten all right he lost sorry we missed you we tried we tried yeah we tried he still hasn't paid me he owes me $10 and today he's gonna pay because I am going to be making the world's largest airsoft rifle I'm gonna be stringing together eight airsoft rifles hooking them up to a single trigger and asking Sam one simple question you want to pay with cash or plastic in order to construct the world's largest airsoft rifle I've selected eight of our finest m4 platform airsoft BB rifles now if you don't know anything about airsoft these shoot little plastic six millimeter bb's at a velocity of about 400 feet a second so they do hurt you should always wear eye protection Jake's building this airsoft gun project and Jake took up all my nice game guns I'm very protective of them because they get ruined all the SUBSCRIBE time anyways Jake went ahead and ruin one of my guns already oh he plugged my frickin white ball battery and just a wrong battery charger now stricken blowing up you know some I didn't know that that was a special baby baby charger so it's really hot right now and it's swollen up [Music] just let it be it's not slow it's just gonna turn you on the flamethrower it's good until flamethrower but the [ __ ] almost started on fire oh don't worry guys I'm back from the desert I did not find the lens whatever it's cool I'll just get back to work where's my dad [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we were thinking about shooting till about like 2:00 p.m. oh he's gone he's got to do this now it's just very dialogue it sounded heavy where we need to you gotta make like giving it's like new yeah we just need that like commercial clean audio well yeah but the problem is I today's my day today or do we were scheduled to be here i I didn't know sorry so we did he's not just gonna come into the department have been aware of this and he should have told us this you know we know how to roll with the punches here corridor think about it well let's push the shoot now so everything in this shoot so far is pretty standard clean kind of flat commercial lighting which is on purpose but we have one shot here at the end I want to make it a little more otherworldly Danny is physically present in the space but not mentally present is he's sitting in a lighting environment that's somehow not affecting him huge window over there a lot of natural light spilling in what we're gonna do is use a reflector to block out the light it's negative fill instead of reflecting it that's gonna create a lot of shadow and that's gonna allow us to control the lighting there are some under light for some spook there's some edge top light for just a little bit of that rim outline that's gonna make a big difference it's gonna make the shot stand out and seen since normally these giant windows are just blasting light through all right so I really should have been doing this on shoes earlier but what I really love about the red cameras are all the false video color modes so one handy feature on the Reds that I really should have been using for years but now we're finally using today is the exposure toggle I have been using it but today we're using it the right way check out the exposure toggle mode on red it will show you what parts of your frame are underexposed and which ones are overexposed but what it also does it has a green cast on everything that is exposed for skin tones so if you're seeing this green on here that means you know your people and your skin tones are perfectly exposed that's really handy it allows your subjects to say very consistent okay do not get lost in the desert if you lens Danny is actually moving on to new and exciting things a lot of you probably know this I have my own YouTube channel and it's been growing really well recently and working here and doing that at the same time sort of felt like it was becoming working two jobs at once I felt like I wasn't really putting in my full effort into either one of those things and so the soldiers had to pick one and so now I'm just devoting all my time to my youtube channel I mean you're moving away from Los Angeles as well I hear that's a big city yes I'm also moving to Illinois exactly yeah we don't have a studio there yet someday maybe I'm well Denny's been a pleasure Oh once I selected my rifles I went through made sure that they were all perfectly functional then I brought them outside to set up my firing range I used a regular plastic folding table and then I needed something to prop the weapons up on I used an old monitor stand and a piece of wooden door frame in order to hold up all of the weapons I needed something consistent across all of the weapons in order to make sure that they all are being secured from the same place now that's why I selected all m4 platform airsoft rifles they all have the same lower receiver meaning that I could put a board at the front of the receiver and then behind the pistol grip at the back of the receiver and they would all generally be secure after I was able to prop them up I then used a very simple screw and string mechanism to basically just tie down the rifles at the back and the front of the receiver to tie down the front I use the trucker's hitch Truckers nuts are good when you have two anchor points and you're trying to create tension when you get to the second anchor point but you have that problem where because you're tied off to one you can't create tension with the other a trucker's not reverses the direction of pull so that you're able to actually get tension between two points I'll show you first off secure your anchor point so be my anchor point I just tie this down like that and boom there's my anchor normally without a trucker's not I go over and then I go to this second point I try to create tension but as I go to lock it I lose all my tension you make a little slip basically you just make a little a little loop make a little loop like that you just tie a knot in the rope like that then you go down to your anchor point but then you come back I come back through the trucker's not like that right now when I do this it reverses the tension so that I can secure even here and then you put that around the same anchor point and tie it tie it off yeah it actually helps us a whole bunch so it's way more secure yeah barely budging then I tight strings to all the triggers and ran those strings back to a center point from which I could fire all the guns simultaneously Wow okay the the sheer power of it is kind of intimidating and you know in theory it's working let's give a shot to people let's give it a shot boys ready yeah I saw every trigger move intense we have a rule around here any time you're going to fire a projectile at someone else you must first fire it upon yourself oh dude that's brutal look at that ah that that this is this is dangerous freakin hurt we should probably move it back that's that's that's like not friendly anymore that's not like haha that's like dude I just I see you with an airsoft gun and you you're literally gonna have a piece of your tattoo Oh No yeah look that's from an airsoft gun too look at that it's already swollen this is kind of dangerous now I need to go talk to my friend Sam yo I order everything on the do you see I was probably once a little weird I'm just gonna go up to him and I'm just gonna say Sam you know that ten bucks you owe me it's the time it's time to look if you just gives you $10 never carries cash let's yeah oh you're bending oh you know I only accept cash or flesh shot no about this look it's not it wasn't hard and this the million of airsoft guns sitting out that you've been getting functioning well I just thought many of you thought I was getting them ready for a shoot it's it's time man I tested it on myself I will allow you to wear armor here here's the thing Sam you can select as many friends as possible to help you absorb the bullets I didn't lose the bet then do him this favor if he asks if you're a true friend Wow are you seeing spring I don't know if I should answer this because it sounds like something's going on okay just my Jason flexes the way he said that no I'm not saying you're not Sam's friend I have a feeling I know what's going on Sam is my worst friend yes but he is your friend dude are you Sam's friend he's my boss I'm saying friend when it comes to hanging out but that never happens are you Sam around today I would I don't blame her we see the rig [Music] that's ridiculous you go with your this and yeah well that's sufficiently terrifying that is the most murderous No now what's your next project couldn't rapture next on J dubs murder machines a guillotine ray
