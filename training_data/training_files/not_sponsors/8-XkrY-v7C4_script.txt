this is 128 cubed deep fear one of the very few tracks in trackmania that have been granted a classic status on the community tractoring site track mania exchange it's a 10 minute long transitional full speed track when driven absolutely perfectly but what makes the map extra special is that up until this day it had never been finished by anyone the track was built in 2015 by wendy almost five years ago so why does it not have any finishers well there's two main reasons number one is the difficulty deep fear only has nine responsible checkpoints each one taking about a minute to complete the driving and tricks you have to pull off on each checkpoint is extremely precise where the tiniest mistake will cost you to fail but another big reason why nobody has completed it is lag deep here consists of about 14 000 blocks and since it's 128 cubed in size it means at 64 times larger than the usual 32 cubed building area making even the strongest of computers struggle with low fps as you constantly have to render the entire map i decided that since the track recently became classic and since it had gone nearly five years without any finishers i would take upon myself the challenge of trying to be the first to complete it i fired up my stream on a wednesday afternoon knowing the map was going to take a while to complete for the first two hours of playing the lag was almost unbearable but luckily one of my viewers bush ff discovered that it was possible to change the render distance with a mod for the game called tmn limiter so you wouldn't have to render all the blocks at once which made the track much better to play and then from then on all that remained was me overcoming the difficulty of finishing the map here's how it went before we begin i've noticed that a lot of my viewers aren't subscribed so if you like the videos we make here then make sure to hit the subscribe button so you can stay up to date with when new track media content is coming out thanks after resetting about two hours in to fix the lag problem i was really eager to get another run going since i knew it was undoubtedly going to be a long stream but the last part before reaching the first checkpoint was costing me a lot of frustration one small clip and the car would just bounce away and you'd have to do everything from the start again if i try to go here i hit this so i need to be like here in the middle of these two this terribly precise line and that's fine you can have a precise line but don't have this bumpy ass transition before it where you can barely control your car but after releasing some steam about it i was finally able to focus and do what i had to do [Music] any doubters any doubters any doubters in chat right now we did it [Laughter] it only took four hours but hey check point one all right so boys anyways this checkpoint we've already tried a lot i have become solid at it and without lags now it should be a cruiser it really should be just like a few attempts in rim but knowing the start wasn't let's not take it for granted and let's focus on making it work oh that's not enough speed [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh no don't have the speed all right please make it [Music] we take those i can't believe i got stuck there but that is enough that is enough and we're on the next checkpoint uh yeah so checkpoint here a lot of speed and then we go up but here is a very weird part transition goes here up here into the loop over this block into the loop up one left apparently stay between the poles go straight go straight middle straight i think speed slide here to get enough speed to make it across here and check but this should be a doable one then i'll swarm to the right at the end here [Music] well that was that was more like five minutes this is a responsible one [Music] gg all right now this is one of the harder ones this is one of the hardest track principles this one is truly difficult i have practiced as well you're gonna see it but uh there is this part so look at this right do you see the gap here you have to go over this over here in between this wall onto freewheeling and just try to go straight through this without hitting anything and there's another gap like this here onto the platform onto the booster one left another one left transition transition to the right go on the outside here back into the loop now left back flip on this you hit this and you backflip down here into wall ride and check them yeah so i said 20 minutes for the other one this one might be an hour [Music] one left [Music] oh come on that is so unintuitive it goes straight down at the end of the wall right it just goes straight [Music] my game crashed my mic my game just crashed [Music] i was so close to reaching the fourth checkpoint literally just a few blocks away when my game decided to crash making me lose all of my progress i was a bit bummed out at first but i decided i wasn't going to let that stop me so i went back to start another run but i decided that to make up for the last time i would do a shortcut to reach the first checkpoint again this shortcut isn't much of a shortcut really as it doesn't save any time but it did save me a lot of struggle and difficulty and after getting back to the first checkpoint the other two fell quickly as well and in just 30 minutes of playing i was right back at checkpoint 3 ready to keep going we have made our way back [Music] it's bad yeah oh come on it can't be this hard i go down i go down really hard here i'm gonna dodge the entire thing i keep saying why am i up here i should be here i i should be here it's free just just literally go down press right all right checkpoint four boys terrible but we did it so this checkpoint i have practiced and it isn't that hard the last part is the start of it is kind of trivial it's just pf but then is it enough holy that's a lot of speed needed and then and we're stuck here should continue with full speed transition back here down then here then through this then immediately up into a wall right turn around jump jump transition pretty straight here i like that up through the turnover back with speed and checkpoint on checkpoint 4 we found a massive shortcut that would skip over half the driving to checkpoint 5. i was considering doing it and taking the fifth checkpoint but part of the reason why i wanted to finish deepview in the first place was the challenge the difficulty and the precision that was needed to complete it and this shortcut had none of those things if i wanted it easy there were about 500 000 tracks i could pick from but i decided to play deep here for a reason and knew that it would feel much more rewarding if i had done it the normal way so i respawned back to checkpoint 4 and drove the track as intended [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh okay [Music] okay all right pogba's number five this wall right now [Music] could fairly have been like one block wider you know it wouldn't hurt wouldn't hurt especially with 800 speed it's like all right okay yeah left and right i think here [Music] in the middle of the checkpoint there's this and there are gaps between these dirt parts and you have to hit this gap right here on dirt you have to aim coming out of here for that gap it's it's pretty tough [Music] so [Music] so [Music] are you serious who on earth places a pole here are you i can't believe it who who does this who builds a map like this the block after the turtle you place a pole i mean i mean hello hello can we get classic status removed wait we can finish i think okay boys this is this is fair this is fair [Music] all right [Music] we did it okay what's up next loop straight straight straight straight sculpture bit left wall right oh it's this one oh this is terribly long [Music] you have to aim for this downhill deep speed up here sculpture to loop hard right and then on the outside of the sculpture down keep speed backflip land here keep speed and checkpoint like what like what [Music] it is so that is bouncy what excuse me how can i aim for that i can't see the road okay just oh i had to correct oh it's gonna work okay okay repair [Music] oh no i don't want to look at chat it's just going to be technologies it's it's it's always going to be w's oh god yes [Music] no air brake no air brake no air brake no air brake [Music] all right voice first try maybe not the very first but still a first to some degree let's go let's go let's have a look here to the right it seems down with speed you use the fence okay through the house straight land landing think haven't we been across the entire map by now backflip here [Music] wait wait what's this checkpoint hello it just keeps going stop okay here all right yeah seems doable [Music] all right let's go boys it's so beautiful we're in there and there's nothing they can take away from us anymore [Music] oh oh stop it's too late for this i bugged i bugged here on this i vote on this hello [Music] it's unreal how is he generating that much power no we keep going we keep going [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] laughs [Music] wow [Music] when i finally reached the last checkpoint it was 3 am and i've been playing for nearly 12 hours straight i thought that now we were done with the worst and that finishing would be just a matter of time but little did i know that the last checkpoint was the hardest one out of all of them part of it could be because i was extremely tired but the last checkpoint required a lot of precision and nailing each jump and avoiding every obstacle and if that wasn't hard enough in itself if you managed to get past all the obstacles there was also a so called speed check where the author placed a very tough jump to force players to maintain near perfect speed up until that point it wasn't enough just to get there you had to get there with at least 710 speed to make the jump up to the ring checkpoint getting 710 speed required immense precision and it seemed like no matter what i did i could never hit the magical number always having a bit too low speed as night turned to morning and the sun was starting to rise i decided that if i was going to finish it would require my full focus to get the final few kilometers an hour that i needed so i decided to turn off my webcam mute my microphone and go full ultra instinct virtual mode and still from there it was another two hours of grinding of crashing of failing and of barely not making the big jump until finally after 17 hours and 45 minutes of playing deep fear and at 9am the next day i got this run so [Music] boys boys boys boys we did it we did it it's done it's done it's done it's done after getting the ring on the speed check all i had to do was drive the last checkpoint one more time and go back to the finish just before the big jump and i had successfully completed deep view but because the replay file was too much for the game to load it instantly crashed after i crossed the finish line perhaps it's not surprising given that i had driven over 5 million meters in total but what it meant is that i didn't have a replay file to upload to the leaderboards but i didn't care too much i had completed the challenge and i had overcome my own self-doubt about being able to do it and that is what mattered the most [Music] in the time since i drove this run many other players have finished the map as well and there is now a fierce battle going on for the world record on the map mudda and don't care have gradually lowered their personal bests down to under 20 minutes and the current world record by muda stands at only 12 minutes where he managed to drive the entire map up until the last checkpoint in one go and as someone who's played the map myself i can't even begin to explain how insane that is their current goal is to achieve a legendary one-shot run which would be without any respawns at all i'll leave a link to their streams in the description below if you want to watch them try it but that's going to be it for now guys until next time have a good one [Music] you
