comm / polyphonic to get 30 days of membership for free some of the most recognizable symbols in the world may be the classical elements versions of this concept have been found in cultures across the globe but one of the most popular versions today divides the universe into four elements fire water earth and air each of these elements has their own spiritual and philosophical implications and because of this they've been used to guide artistic works for centuries and I think one of the best examples of this is Jimi Hendrix in both music and lyrics across his career Hendrix frequently explored the four elements and used them to enhance his songwriting let's take a closer look fire is a visceral home she did passionate and filled with dangerous beauty it might be the element that people most associate with Jimi Hendrix not only does he have a song explicitly named fire but one of the most iconic moments of Hendrix's career involved him lighting fire to his guitar on stage this speaks to one of the associations with fire it's something ritualistic people have called Hendrix's guitar burning a sacrifice and the iconic images of Hendrix kneeling over the fire feed back into this fire is something primal something raw and human many people even point to the invention of fire as the starting point of humanity early human society was grown from gathering around fires for shared warmth and that something Hendricks talks about in fire the chorus is a simple plea let me stand next to your fryer but of course standing next to the fire is a euphemism for another intrinsic part of humanity passion and sexual desire fire is often used as a metaphor for passion and Hendricks plays into that across his career this is helped by Hendrix's guitar playing searing hot and wild just listen to the solo on burning of the midnight lamp where Hendrix paints fire as a piece of passion a piece of vitality that keeps him alive and going during long lonely nights on the road but there's another side of fire fire provides the warmth necessary for life but there are also few forces of destruction as strong as fire and Hendrix uses fire to represent this as well in house burning down Hendrix's guitar squeals the chaos of a house burning as he looks at the destruction being wrought in the world around [Music] fire is a powerful primal force to Hendricks it's the passion and love that keeps humanity turning but it's also the destructive power of this passion how it can tear lives and worlds apart if we're not careful in many ways water is a mirror image of fire comforting and life-giving but with the same destructive potential just like how human life congregates around fire all life comes from water that's the thought that drives 1983 a merman should I turn to be Hendrix's epic musing on the element of water in that song Hendrix sings of a world ravaged by war by the destructive power of fire in this apocalyptic future Hendrix's narrator realizes that there's only one way to escape the brutality of life to return to the ocean where all of humanity originally came the sea and water represented a kind of calm for Hendrix a peaceful escape from the weight of the world musically 1983 tries to capture the sound of water the main riff sounds like the calm wash of waves over the beach the instrumental section in the middle is the deep-sea pushing downwards in an extended psychedelic breakdown at the end of 1983 water provides a true hope of escape as Hendrix sinks downwards and sees the lost city of Atlantis welcoming him and his love [Music] but just like fire there's a destructive aspect of all this destruction isn't man-made though it's the inevitability of time hendricks sings of this and castles made of sand another song with musical passages that emulate ocean waves that song paints a series of tragic vignettes full of sorrow and sadness in between each of the chorus sings a simple line castles made of sand melt into the sea eventually the sea represents the inevitability of mortality of pain in these stories the sea has the ability to wear down Beauty artistry all of the most intricately laid plans of humanity water is a calm life a beauty that you can meditate on escape to but water is also the unstoppable punishing force of fate [Music] earth can represent a lot of things it's analog in some cultures as wood and it's usually related with green a vibrant color of life but for Hendrix Earth tends to manifest itself in another way sand unlike any of the other elements earth and sand are malleable shapeable you can build your own destiny with earth you can shape it into whatever you want it to be and that's the other side of castles made of sand humanity can use the simplest smallest things grains of sand and create castles out of them create ones that snoozing out of basic vibrations create new meanings by placing words next to each other Hendrix expresses how powerful this creativity can be in voodoo child slight return he shows the way Humanity can shape the earth chopping down the very mountains with the edge of his hands [Music] the chorus of Voodoo Child even raises Hendricks up to a god-like state it's got an epic ascending riff and a meaningful hook Hendricks is a voodoo child he's a human imbued with magic he's capable of great feats for Hendricks earth represents the potential of humanity and the power of creativity though it's not a boundless power it's a power kept in check by the other elements mankind can build up society build great cities and great wonders but it can just as easily be washed away by the ocean burned away by fire error is an enigmatic element it's the only one we can't see yet it's in us and around us at all times permeating every inch of life two of the most common ways that people represent air are with clouds and wind symbols that both work their way into Hendrix's music in the wind cries Mary the air is personified as a kind of ancient wise force removed from humanity calling on it whispering a name Hendrix wrote that song after a spat with his girlfriend it seems to be a lament of a love gone the wind is a reflection of this absence it will be forever calling the name Mary sticking her in Hendrix's mind even if their relationship ends for Hendrix air has a transcendent beauty to it and an ancient wisdom it was no this is reflected musically in the calm tones of the wind cries Mary but also in the exquisite complexity of little wing and that song Hendrix sings of a woman of surpassing beauty it seems that if you could be seeing a personification of the air itself surrounding Hendrix letting it breathe her in but like a warm summer's breeze the air will fly on and be free it won't be tied to the ground tied to humanity musically little wing is delicate and floating but fine and complex one of the most impressive songs of Hendrix's entire career the air is an ethereal element all-knowing and all-seeing but impossible to place your fingers on impossible to control shape or mold the classical elements are some of the most important symbols in human history by tapping into them and using them for inspiration Jimi Hendrix was able to create something Universal in his music he was able to speak to the forces around us that shape and change us and the way that we shape and change those forces in the elements we can see the creativity and versatility of Hendrix's career and we can see some of the reasons he'll be remembered forever as one of the all-time greats listening to and to let them know that I sent you hey guys thanks so much
