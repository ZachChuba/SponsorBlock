[Music] don't want to give time for people to show up and see marks level I just want to get it out of the way okay seriously you're just gonna put an icicle that nobody can see you right at the beginning moving on he played three bro wives did Reap brother three brother Oh God I don't like bro lives that much anymore okay let's see do what I got to do here I go in this door easy enough perfect did that I need to add weight on that side oh my god the level rewards a skilled player did i hack it up what I knew that would happen I did see this part once upon a time I was like worried about getting clipped but I realize now that there's one waves here and I might be stupid this is hard as [ __ ] oh I lose I mean when you run into a bad level what can you really do if not every level is gonna be a winner that much is obvious it's hard to make a good level oh wow that's really cool those mantras are like shooting over somehow I don't know how that works but it is cool I don't want to stop walking a very soft lockable level oh can I get it up on the semi-solid I don't think so what you can hit it with with dump agent pretty sick I didn't know even more of them no easy easy levels for babies and I haven't three brother lives it's just like kind of a dick move dude Marcus mark look what you've done you didn't account for the fact that I'm [ __ ] stupid it's like when the level creator doesn't consider it that I'm stupid are they really considering anything I feel like when you make a level you have to assume that anyone gonna play it as no arms that's never played any game before and if no arms I'm just kidding right it's a it's a cool level there it is the bank shot of a lifetime okay what they have cute little parachutes whoa epic I'm stupid I had stupid activated Hey losing my stupid school I saw Marc making this you know I'm already an expert I don't really know how to do I think he has to be sitting on it she's not doing and [ __ ] my hands well back up I got it that was so you hell yeah I lucked into the correct solution oh my god if that hit me I don't know if I would have ever played the game again let alone beat the level you don't need to show me anymore Wow that Belapur spoilers for the big old question mark right there that's doesn't bounce on these does it how it does it I had to assume it did because there was a block of day do you think someone jumped out of the dry bones and soft locked up there maybe I mean why else would you put a question mark they they probably fell apart I mean the flood was full of soft barks I personally like if this was part of a competition or something I'd rate it a high three I kind of like oh I probably round it to a four but that's how good it is I still hear a pet reflect city [ __ ] you scary skeletons send shivers down your spine okay that's pretty low clear right there's a probably the last level of the stream without a little bit clear Raiders okay well it's not enough time to run forward and Crouch is there that level starts out awesome pop lock oh yeah known as I always did love not never the beginning isn't actually I heard won't you don't you get it that's that level if you're trying to get like a super expert three that levels a nightmare they're not the beginning in that this is such a good level it's got to be the best level I've ever played it it's so funny - did you guys see the way all the enemies no well my my head and now it's totally in control of it holy [ __ ] that was great oh I've actually hoping that there would be a blind jump in darkness and I have no idea what to do though glad that happened I was thinking like the stuff was pretty cool and it's hard to tell what's going on but and nothing would really get me going like a complete blind jump and what seems like an impossible gap too quickly I gotta say I'm not sure if I want to be there ground here okay nice bone me bon mot gotta at least put one light on each platform I feel like it one one enemy per platform even now I I'm not under the impression that you're going for the best level of all time if I don't believe anybody is when they choose this team but you got to give the flavor some wiggle room even in your bad levels gotta have at least some good elements to it okay oh you must go faster I once I fall I'm gonna try and hug the right side of the screen as much as I can hear that bones in my way so I'm gonna get boned most likely I'm boned later I'm part of the bone zone either opt in for the tiny bone at the beginning or you wait your turn and get big poppa bone once like once I have one once I land on the dry bones I think I'm satisfied of having experienced an emphasis level all sorts of people like all sorts of different levels and personally I just can't say with any real confidence that I am a fan of you can't see anything level and you just have to learn the level jump high jump I mean some people love levels where you can't see or do anything yeah I got it I got to respect the song though and play the level at least until the song is over oh yeah I could see the love that don't bond me but my favorite thing about the level is that I couldn't headbang with toadette several times is one of my favorite things to do alright last time last attempt because I'm gonna win that last try didn't count because the dry bones through the bone to the left so it didn't count to try it because my visual indicator was arbitrarily removed from me that didn't count because I must get to the end one more time alright two more tribes and I'll skip the level promise scouts honor something about bad levels fills me with determination that doesn't count though two more tribes asks the on/off looked promise scouts honor it's not a try if I don't get past the on off luck don't bone me [Music] I'm done playing this I'm not gonna be the level I'm not gonna like it even high next level sorry for the delay poisonous forest that sucks oh okay I thought I had to wait for second I like what's going on there I didn't really have to do anything managing oh the first time in my entire life I've expected a parachute it wasn't there that's why I had a really lovely rate for what it was other you level hey my catchphrase brush your teeth [ __ ] [Music]
