samsung comes out with a lot of new phones and they do it very quickly this new galaxy note 20 ultra 5g is their most expensive top of the line flagship yet for 2020. it's one of those phones where we all pay extra for the 5g but only 5 people get to actually use it inside the box we get a protective rubber case kind of cool this is the mystic black version and it comes with the normal usbc headphone cord and a 25 watt wall charger the thing that stands out to me the most though is this camera bump the cameras kind of own this phone it's like a full-fledged domino glued to the back and it's just about as thick as a lego rather incredible anyway i hear samsung is using new glass this time around gorilla glass victus so it should be interesting let's get started [Music] [Applause] [Music] one of the reasons i'm interested in this galaxy note 20 ultra is because it's the newer version of the phone that i'm currently using the galaxy note 10 plus and with their nearly identical footprint and specs it's time to decide if it's worth the upgrade for me or not for reference currently my older note 10 plus can be found on ebay in the 700 range and the new note 20 ultra is a wallet breaking thirteen hundred dollars so if you ever want to save oodles of cash buying last year's model is always an option let's talk about the glass so corning just came out the new glass and they've switched from using numbers to calling this glass victus meaning to live samsung was nice enough to protect the victus glass with a free screen protector [Music] but once we get that removed we can start with the real scratch test my most mineral picks can differentiate between different materials you know if the screen were plastic it would start scratching in the two or three range if it were glass it would start scratching in the five or six range and if the screen was made from sapphire which we haven't seen in a while now the screen would start scratching at a level eight or nine corning gorilla glass victus is still glass and it scratches at a level six with deeper grooves at a level seven you might be thinking but jerry what in the world does corning mean when they say victus is four times more scratch resistant than regular glass and that's a great question when corning uses these talking points they aren't comparing victis to previous versions of gorilla they are comparing victis to regular glass and it is indeed much stronger than regular glass but it's still glass you know we have the plastic glass and sapphire realms of hardness the glass realm is here in the middle at five six or seven all of the incremental improvements that gorilla glass has made have been inside this glass realm which my mohs hardness picks are too generalized to differentiate between the mohs mineral test is a rough scale designed to find the difference between lots of materials like plastic all the way to sapphire but not to check the minute subtle differences between different types of glass a machine capable of specifically analyzing that section of information would cost in the hundred thousand dollar range and maybe someday i can get my hands on one but while victus is an improvement in the glass realm glass is still glass and i'm still always just going to use a case the s pen does still have removable tips so you can switch between the soft and hard depending on your writing style the s pen even though i don't actually use mine all that often is still one of my favorite pieces of technology pulling out the back half of the pin we can see the brains of the operation along with the capacitor at the end that can charge up in a matter of seconds and provide enough power for the pin to last 30 minutes outside of the phone capacitors are way cooler than batteries above the capacitor is just the clicky bit of the pin but the writing tip of the s pen is where things start to get fun there are a lot of copper windings around the tip this generates a magnetic field so the phone knows where the tip of the pin is at even without it actually touching the capacitive display there is a pressure sensor inside the tip of course for when it is touching but apparently it needs to be in like one piece or something to keep functioning but you get the point it gets even cooler when we look on the inside of the phone there is a super tiny wireless charger resting on top of the s pen slot that you can see here on my tear down skin and that tiny wireless pad is what charges up the s pen through the coils in the tip while it's inside the phone pretty awesome the note 20 ultra does have a circular 10 megapixel front facing camera with about the same placement from last year's model as well as the almost non-existent earpiece grille just a tiny slit up here at the top the phone body is made from aluminum you can see the silver peeking out from underneath the mystic black and the buttons are also made from metal and for some reason still totally removable the top of the phone has some protective clear plastic along with the micro sd expansion and sim card tray and no headphone jack the left side of the phone is still bare no dedicated bixby button again glad that change is lasting the bottom of the phone has more temporary clear protective plastic and metal next to the usb-c port the note 20 ultra back is made from glass but rumor has it that samsung's regular note 20 is made from plastic this year let me know down in the comments if you want me to test that phone out where i do start to get a little bit tempted is the cameras the note 20 ultra has a built-in 12 megapixel five times periscope camera where mine only has it two times then there's the 108 megapixel 8k main camera where mine's only 12 megapixels and 4k then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera where it mines at 16. there are some pretty big changes this year camera wise but still probably not worth my thirteen hundred dollars especially since my own phone is still working pretty great plus maybe if i wait a bit they'll find a way to minimize that camera bump the only way to make this camera bump cool is by showing what's actually inside of it i'll lay the tear down skin over top of the camera plateau and get the rest of the phone covered up and now we can see exactly how big the sensors are and how much real estate that periscope zoom camera takes up underneath the hump it's kind of all similar to last year's design except for the s pen is on the other side i'll leave a link for my tear down skin available for most of the popular phones tablets and even laptops the screen has improved a bit this time around even though it's the same resolution it has grown 0.1 inches and also has the capability to refresh at 120 hertz also a tiny bit tempting but avoiding 1300 hertz on my wallet is more important than needing hertz for my eyes after about 23 seconds the screen started to go black which is normally something we only see on lcd screens this guy doesn't recover and stays burnt rather interesting for an amoled and just another prime example of why we really have no idea why the burn test exists the fingerprint scanner test is useful though samsung is once again using the ultrasonic fingerprint reader you can see that it's not using the light from the screen to illuminate my digit it's just using those ultrasonic waves through the glass to capture my fingerprint ridges i'll add some level 7 deeper grooves to damage things up and try again and it still works every single time not too shabby i'll peel off this structurally enhancing magic skin kind of kidding on the structural part but it is magic the note 20 ultra weighs 4 grams more than my note 10 plus and just like last year it's as solid as a rock no flex in the frame no damage to the glass or to the phone itself i would say i'm impressed but it does cost thirteen hundred dollars so it better be durable and no one should be surprised that it is instead of buying an ultra phone and having an ultra thin wallet i'm gonna stick with my regular phone and just keep my wallet where it's at speaking of keeping your wallet where it's at i'm gonna be giving away these jerry rig everything stickers for free all you have to do to get one is send me a regular old snail mail letter to the address you see on screen and i'll send you one of these large stickers back to you for free just make sure your return address is readable so i know where to send it and feel free to send me a sticker of your own if you'd like i'll add it to the sticker wall in my garage with trump and a joy working their hardest to stop the mail it might take a bit longer for you to get your sticker but we can help stick it to them by being pen pals the address is up on the screen and i'll even be sending these internationally for free so feel free to write me a letter no matter where you're from it feels good to keep my phone around a while longer no need to replace something that isn't broken i will be taking apart the note 20 ultra to see how the insights compare with the outside so hit that subscribe button if you haven't already and come hang out with me on instagram and twitter thanks dumb for watching i'll see you around
