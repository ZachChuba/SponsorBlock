[Music] these and hey don't forget to join our discord all links to the parts will be in the description enjoy the build [Music] [Music] [Music] so day one went actually a little longer than expected that ended up taking a day and a half to get these four destroy plates done we had to replace the tops of both of the original destroyed plates because we have Newport placement to account for the new destroy plates which are going inside the desk now the tool Parveen did turn out pretty good but you can still see a bit of the tool markings inside of the distro so we'll give them a bit of a polish this is actually our second time doing a may just sort of disrupt plate with the CNC as we only just bought it so quite happy with how it turned out considering it really is our second project using that CNC with this row plates so there is a feature that I did see where it can do like a finishing pass over which we are going to have to learn and we'll give that a go in the future and see how that goes but for the most part we've got the long destroy plate done and we've also got this shorter destroy plate done so what we are going to do now and today is we are going to thread all of the holes and these screw holes as well and then we're going to move on to some other stuff [Music] [Music] [Music] so threading all of these plates actually took a lot longer than we thought we actually got a machine to do all the tapping now which is great it's like a manual sort of machine but it works a lot better and make sure that it gets that straight sort of threading going down so that the fittings are making proper contact with the acrylic and we had to hand tap all of the screw holes which absolutely took forever we have two of these so one for the left side one for the right side which is this one here and then of course we've also got the longer one which you guys have not seen this is going up the top of the desk where the hard drive chair trays we're sitting in the previous one so that we can bring some tubes up to the front of the desk as well and then we've also got this little one right here which has two separate bays right there where the liquid will come in and out just to add some more length to the loop and bring some tubes around and fill out any empty space in the build I'm glad that we got this done my hands are absolutely torn to shreds I don't really want to show you guys cuz they're it's pretty gross so I've got blisters everywhere from screwing and all of this in and and doing everything manually by hand but I'm glad it's all done it's all leak proof and it's all been leak tested so we're good to go let's go on to the next stage of the build which is all of our laser cutting that we have to do we're going to be getting some mirrored pieces that fit behind here so it looks like a nice mirrored disco plate with the liquid flowing through it so we've got to make pieces for all four of these destroy plates and then of course we've got a power supply cover which we will be building with the mirrored acrylic then we also have a harddrive cover which will have the mirrored acrylic as well so let's get onto that and hopefully you're enjoying so far [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so majority of the cus of stuff is built we're onto the specs now let's dive into putting this piece here together getting everything into the desks what I'm going to do is I'm going to clean out all of the hardware in that that was previously in the desk give it all nice and clean I'm gonna show you guys exactly what hardware will you see you guys get a bit of an understanding of what's going into the desk and why we used it for those of you wondering why we chose the CPU that we did the client actually purchased all of this gear early last year so it's been quite a while third generation thread Ripper was not out in 10th gen CPUs we're not out for Intel so we've got the 99 80 XE going inside of the desk and that's the reason why the client ended up going with that CPU but with all that said and done let's go ahead show you guys the specs and we'll get on installing everything into the desk [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now for those of you who are new to the video you probably haven't seen the first video of this des PC which consists of a 99 80 X II processor now a lot of the comments in that was saying why don't you go with the new AMD thread Ripper CPUs this desk expands back to all the way back to last year it's almost been about a year since the whole process began obviously the thread Ripper CPUs were not out by then so we have the 99 80 XE processor inside this desk for the graphics cards we actually have 228 ET Liars in sli this is the Strix version from Asus and so it's going to be running games nice and smoothly so the combination between the 99 80 XE with the high core counts and the hyper threading combined with the two GPUs allows him to render out his projects then of course he got the power from the GPUs for gaming now we did not get any time to actually benchmark the system I do apologize for that but if we do get any time in the future I'll be sure to post those on social media for you guys to check out because it is a really beefy system now the client actually has for two terabyte ended up two SSDs and he also has a 10 terabyte hard drive so the hard drive is mainly for mass storage and the m-dot twos are also there for storage but for more important files which he obviously wants to access a lot faster and of course this is a desk PC so he's he's gone all the way out for respects so for this particular project we actually invested in two new machines we have one machine for threading all of the holes for the screws and the fittings and things like that and then we've also got a new CNC machine which we got which we purposely got to start creating distro plate so it was the first time actually using destroy plates in the desk and they turned out really nice for you know me beginning and not knowing anything - now what we can make so as a pretty awesome project to actually get my hands on and attempt so if that being said actually learned a lot along the way and ways that I can improve on these distro place so stick around if you want to see some you know future projects utilizing distro blades anyway guys if you have any questions for us please leave them in the comment section below and we're always open answering them as best as we can we're trying to stay active in there as well
