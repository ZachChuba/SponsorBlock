hello this is chef john from
foodwishes.com with the scrambled egg omelettes
that's right say goodbye to the days when you had to decide whether you
wanted to make scrambled eggs or make an omelet
since with this exciting breakthrough in the latest breakfast technology
you're now able to have both at the same time and by the way if you're one of the
viewers that had a little bit of trouble mastering the french omelette technique
we posted this is going to give you basically the
same results with an easier simpler method so with that let's go ahead and
get started with three large eggs we've cracked into a bowl
and while this technique will work with two eggs i do recommend three
because i think the texture does come out a little bit better and then to
these eggs i'm gonna add a little pinch of salt
but not too much because i'm going to put some cheddar cheese in these
i'm also going to do a few shakes of cayenne and then for a little bit of a
french twist i'm going to do some finely and freshly
chopped herbs parsley marjoram in time to be exact
and then last but not least a couple generous tablespoons of grated
sharp white cheddar cheese and then we'll go ahead and work these over with
a fork until just combined and as long as you don't use too much
feel free to add whatever ingredients you want
whether it's a different cheese or some diced ham or vegetables pretty much
anything goes i mean you are after all the pen
gillette of your scrambled egg omelette and the real magic trick here is the
method not necessarily the ingredients all right as long as you got the eggs
this is going to work no matter what you put in
and then what we'll do once we have all that mixed together is go ahead and grab
a spatula and we will head to the stove where we
will transfer these into a small non-stick pan set over medium heat
into which i drizzle a little bit of olive oil although if you want you can
use butter but i figured since i was going to have
the butter fat from the cheese in this already
then i would go with olive oil this time or maybe i was out of butter
okay there's no way you'll ever really know but anyway once those have been
transferred in we will simply start cooking those over
medium just like we're making scrambled eggs
pretty much keeping things moving constantly and whenever we see a little
bit of egg splash up on the side we definitely want to make sure we mix
that back into the middle so we don't have parts getting overcooked
and then what we'll do when it just starts to come together like this
is reduce our heat from medium down to low and then continue to stir and
scramble again making sure we're scraping that
egg off the sides and what we'll do is cook these on low
until our scrambled eggs are almost but not quite done
all right they still should be fairly wet at this stage
but what we'll do when they look just about like this is turn off our heat
and we will begin to form our and to do that we're going to basically push
everything down to the bottom while at the same time tilting our pan
and the reason we're doing this is we're basically going to use that
curve in the side of the pan to create our perfect omelette shape
and what we'll do once we have everything down there is just continue
to go around with the edge of our spatula
sort of tucking and shaping those edges nicely
and even though the heat's off that pan is still going to be pretty hot
and we're still going to have a good amount of residual heat in our eggs
so our scrambled egg omelets basically going to finish cooking while we're
doing this shaping stage and then as far as the dismount goes
once we have that beautifully formed and our eggs are still pretty soft but
they're holding their shape we'll go ahead and turn our heat back onto medium
for just like 15 seconds to sort of form a skin on the surface of
our eggs which is really going to give it that classic omelette look
and i should mention this was a little bit challenging because i have the
tripod and camera right in front of me so i'm actually doing a reach around
trying not to bump the camera as i work and that's it after about 15 seconds or
so we will turn off the heat and go ahead and plate that up
which i did next to some whole grain toast that i spread would mix berry jam
and all we need to do is carefully flop that over and voila
what appears to be a perfectly made omelet except i realized the curved side
was facing the wrong way so i quickly pulled off the toast and
performed the old scrambled egg omelet slide
since having that go in the wrong direction would really bother me
oh yeah that is much better and i put my toes back on and finished up a little
more fresh herb and i could not have been happier with
how this looked but forget about the appearance
which while gorgeous is not the main point of this technique
all right the reason we're really doing this is because it produces an
incredibly moist and tender omelet and to achieve that all we basically did
was just make a really nice batch of scrambled eggs
and then wrap it in this omelette shell and give or take a few tablespoons of
butter the texture here is extremely similar to
your classic french omelet and while i really don't consider that
technique overly difficult this is definitely easier
and i say there's fewer things that can go wrong and right here you're going to
get a great look at all those gorgeous layers of egg
and sure the cheese helps but even done with just eggs
you should be seeing a very similar outcome
oh by the way i didn't serve this with toast and jam just because i thought it
would look pretty or because maybe i was out of butter but
rather because it was an absolutely perfect pairing with that white cheddar
and fresh herbs in the eggs just a match made in breakfast heaven
but anyway that's it what we're calling our scrambled egg
omelets and you know what would have been great with this
that's right some hash brown home fries with maybe a side of bacon sausage
but anyway whether you just can't decide whether to make scrambled eggs or an
omelette or you've always wanted to make one of
those fancy french omelets but it just seemed a little too fussy
either way i really do hope you give this a try soon
