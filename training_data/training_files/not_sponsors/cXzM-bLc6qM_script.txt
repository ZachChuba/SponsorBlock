okay so a friend of mine recently got into playing old school runescape after taking a very long hiatus he hadn't played since he was a teenager in high school now he's a normal adult and he came back to the game to see what's up and he started off in the free to play he didn't want to go straight into members because he does he wouldn't know how much time he's gonna invest in the game how much money he's gonna invest in the game he way to try out in a free to play first as most of you runescape players know both new and old gay and to runescape can be a pretty hard thing you pop in in lumbridge and you're met with this giant open world with a lot of things to do you're a bit overwhelmed like what should i do what should i do what should i do that was the most common question that my friend asked me when he got back into the game and was playing free to play what should I do I reply what like leveling wise or quest wise or money wise like you can do these things to do these things but in general just what should I do just give me things to do and so after helping him and his free-to-play adventure I decided that this could make an interesting video and it could really help out newer wins key players because a lot of join they're a bit overwhelmed with the amount of things that you can do that they end up believing they don't really know what to do because well you can do everything that's kind of like a suffering from success take the deal runescape it's got so much stuff to do that you're overwhelmed and you don't know what to do and so here is 10 things to do and free to play old school runescape [Music] subscribe right now do it subscribe click the subscribe button so we have a list of ten activities for free to play old school runescape but before we get get into the 10 things to do in free-to-play ten number one getting a bond no hear me out it's a bit of a crazy one because bonds cost like 4 million GP it spray unrealistic to get one of these in fee to play you're better off just paying money for them honestly if you want membership but it's still possible to grayned and free to play for cash and buy a bond with free to play money making methods i have a three-part free to play money making cities designed to teach players how to get a bond and free to play go check it out there should be a link on the screen or something gang a bond through money making and free to play is pretty unrealistic unless you've got a lot of free time well as an overarching ultimate goal anyway is a good idea because in your quest to achieve a bond through just playing the game you will experience everything free-to-play has to offer the quests the money making methods the monsters they're leveling up the armor all this kind of stuff so having it as your overarching goal whether or not you pay for it with in-game cash or real wife cash it lets you experience the game or at least it does in a way that I got a bond and free to play and the way I teach players to get a bond and free to play and my scaping free to play CDs thing to do number two this is my go-to thing to do when a free 2 player asks me what to do it's Dragon Slayer and I think this is probably the best thing to do for free to players if you're new to the game or returning to the game after a long time if you complete Dragon Slayer you've basically complete a trail run of the game and it lets you decide whether or not you enjoyed the game because doing Dragon Slayer means you have to do a bunch of other quests to get the quest points to start Dragon Slayer it means you've experienced leveling up your combat stats and it means you've experienced making money to buy bear armor in order to defeat the boss it gives you an experience of a many boss fight and win scape unless you experience everything runescape has to offer a small contained free-to-play package and if you enjoy ganked dragon slain completing Dragon's Lair you will probably enjoy playing runescape as a whole as a member there's a link to the Dragon Slayer quest guide in the description below and now also shows you all the requirements for the quest if you're interested and this Dragon Slayer thing to do try a PvP number 3 pvping also known as peaking an old school runescape is very common a lot of people enjoy doing it but it isn't mandatory if you don't like to fight players you don't have to fight any players peeking / PvP as a big thing and rinse keep and and free-to-play and you have two options to PvP you can use your akarin that you're currently leveling up your normal or Caryn that has defense level strength levels tank levels range levels magic levels you can use all those things to go pvping and either the wilderness or in PvP worlds on free-to-play but you can also make a pewter cane which is making account with one defense never leveling defense and getting very high strength and range while keeping for tank it means you have a low combat level but you have really high damage basically and people use that to pay each other and there's also a minigame called Last Man Standing it's available on free-to-play and it gives you a taste of some high tier pvping as a member it gives you a taste of that when you go into this mini game you actually get members gear and you can fight other players with all three combat types with all members gear and many member spells and stuff like that it's pretty interesting and could be pretty fun I would recommend before you get into it you do a bunch of research on how to do and what you should do and where to go and what you should wear all this type of thing because I don't really have all that information I'm not very good at peeking or pvping so do a bunch of research there's lots and lots of material online to teach you how to do some free to play peeking I would recommend that you try this at least once it can be pretty daunting thinking if you die you lose your stuff but if you kill up there you get their stuff so it can be really fun and if you practice and get good at it it can be incredibly fun thing to do number four get base for a combat stance for a tank for a strengths for a defense for arranged and for a magic prayer not so much I wouldn't recommend anyone trained prayer and free to play honestly because it's so much easier as a member and in free to play it's just tear it's just it's a terrible experience maybe ignore prayer but in terms of combat get base for each that unlocks basically everything you need from those skills and free to play foreign attack gives you ruin weaponry for it defense gives you ruin equipment for arrange gives you access to the best free to play ranged equipment and 40 magic basically unlocks all the teleports and free to play so you can travel around the world about easier also speaking of travel quick pro tip there is a chronicle and Draenor you can trade this guy in the market he gives you a chronicle if you've got money and you can buy pages for that chronicle and it's basically teleport to varrock without any magic level required so yeah getting base for is is something I recommend all new free to players do if they want to experience free to play before becoming a member let's base for is you can we're free to plays best gear which brings us on to thing number five get best in slung gear fortunately this one isn't very complex free-to-play isn't very complex so getting the best in slow gear you just get base for a combat stat and you can be where everything and free to play the friend I mentioned earlier one of his main goals was to get God ruin Armour God trimmed ruin armor like guthix armor Salladhor Man armors Amarok armor that armor is basically the best in slot melee armor and free to play because it's the same stance as ruin armor but you get plus one prayer bonus as a stat for winning the god version of it so it's basically the best melee armor the best range armor is green dragon height and the best mage equipment is just the normal bog standard blue robes with azam rock skirt I believe and a staff obviously it's not very complex to get the best and slog gear but if you get all the best and slog gear it is quite an achievement because you need a bunch of money to get it which brings us onto thing number six making that GP it's possible to make a decent amount of money and free-to-play there's no amazing money making methods but there's money making methods that are pretty good like telegraphing zani wayne's but that's one way you can make money by killing the right monsters while you're treating combat like cows then giants held James moss Giants then augers in Coursera Korff you can make money playing skilling like crafting you can make jewelry to for profit you can cook for profit you can main the ores and smelt the bars or whatever you can do skilling in order to make money or you can do some miscellaneous things they don't really progress your account statistically but do make you a decent amount of money like tele grabbing nature runes in the wilderness tele grabbing Sam Rockwell's collecting red spider eggs is pretty profitable and free-to-play right now there's many money making methods and they're all okie none of them are particularly amazing but there is a lot of free-to-play money-making gates out there and there is also an old school runescape Wikipedia article called money-making gate just type in just type in the old school wacky money-making and a money-making gate pops up you can sort it by free-to-play and pick a money making method there there that you like the sound of if you want to make GP and free to play old school runescape thing to do number seven unlock all the guilds this is something I done personally as a free-to-play noob I would always every time I made an account and rinse key before I left free to play and spend money on membership or ask my mum to spend money on membership I would try and for whatever reason unlock all the guilds that includes the free-to-play girls like the champions the guild which requires that acquaints the cooking guild what you need to in crafting you need for a crafting meinen guild you need sex demeaning as prey painful to gain free to play but I did do that not the prayer guild the monastery because like I mentioned earlier treating prayer and free-to-play just isn't worth it whatsoever I also got requirements for some pay-to-play guilds where I could like the ranging guild or the Wizards guild heat for a magic or sixty-six magic the wood cutting elderly needs 60 wood cutting that's a new yelled and always didn't do that back in a day but I would today if I was a free tea player and the fishing guild we need 60 fishing so I would personally myself for whatever reason I would just make these guilds my goals it was just a good thing to go for because when I did become a member I could instantly use the fishing guild or the or the magic guilds or whatever some guilds aren't particularly great like the ranging guild but I just feel like I accomplished something when I unlocked these guilds thing to do number II unlock the total level what I was in free to play I couldn't do this back in the day because they didn't exist at least not to my knowledge but today if I was playing runescape I just got back into the game or was a first-time player I would probably try and unlock the 500 total level free-to-play world that means in order to access this world you need 500 free-to-play levels so all your free to play stats need to add up to 500 I would try and get that give me access to a much less populated world free of bots and free of all the spam and stuff like you see the grand exchange because that genuinely doesn't fury me all the bots in the game and all the spam bots and the skilling BOTS and the combat boss just watched everywhere in free-to-play if I was a free to play player and didn't want to really spend money on runescape at least not initially might to play it for quite a while before I decided to spend money on it I would try and get 500 total level there is a 750 total level world which would be even more devoid of bots and spammers and stuff like that and it would be even choir but that's pretty unrealistic again 750 total level and free-to-play that would take a long time and I think by that point you probably would have decided whether or not you want to actually pay for the game but getting access to these restricted worlds is definitely a good goal if you plan on staying and free-to-play for some amount of time the thing to do number 9 now this is gonna sound cheesy or corny or a just a bit dumb but it's true it really is true it's faint a clan or some friends play with or speak to in the game when you're playing the game with friends or join a clan chat there's a bunch of ways to find friends in the game you could just see people on a boat and speak to them and add them and when I say clan I don't mean the caste Deus clan where you have to fill in an application form in order to join I'm not talking about that type of stuff unless that's up your alley I'm more talking about just large groups of people and a clan chat just so they can all talk to each other I have one myself or people from these YouTube but it was join and chat a lot of crap usually but it's okay but there's many client chats out there with many people you can check the forums you can ask on reddit you can PM your friends ask people in the world if there's any clan chat speaking about that you can join it do if definitely do recommend it thing to do number 10 is trying out free-to-play bossing hell Giants have a 1 in 128 chance of dropping a hell junkie and with that key you can fete the hell giant boss orb or a single team and if you defeat orb or that he has on one in 118 chance of dropping a hell giant Club which gives you four hundred kgp the club's worth 400 kg P that's the hell giant boss and if you can and if you don't get the club you're gonna get other aims they drop her own items pretty frequently so it's pretty decent money but and free-to-play there's an even better boss Bry off the Brio priority' I think that's how you pronounce it it's the most giant boss any free to play you can fight Moss Giants and they have a 150 chance of dropping a mossy key and with that mossy key you can fake Bray or Fatah the most giant boss and the most giant boss has a 118 chance of dropping but I Oh fetus essence which is worth over 4 million GP if you got really lucky and got the key and killed the boss and got that a.m. you've got yourself a bond instantly so try fighting these giants getting the keys and fighting these bosses because killing bosses and praying for a good rng as a large part of a large part of a game Rin scape and there is 10 things to do in free to play old school runescape use your free to play time as a trail run of the game if you enjoy your time in free-to-play you'll enjoy your time and pay to play or you can just stay in free-to-play if you don't want to spend any money or make your bond and free-to-play use in-game cash to do it but whatever is yours 10 things to do get a bond definitely recommend becoming a member if you enjoy the game do Dragon's Lair experience the questing experience a boss faith try PvP some people like it some people really like it especially if you're good get base for is so you can use all the free-to-play equipment get some money make some GP because GP is a large part of runescape and lock all the guilds that's just something goofy I done as a sort of achievement thing once they got a guild unlocks I feel like I achieved something in that step and I didn't go back to at least not if you to please get total levels so you're unlock restricted what I would they have way less players and way way way less bots meet some people fame some friends join a clan do something like that so you can speak to people about the game ask some questions generally just having a sense of community as you're playing improves the experience overall and try a free-to-play bossing it can be a little bit tedious trying to grind for those keys but during your grain for those keys killing Hill Giants or moss change you're gonna be making money the drop leg bones and the drop some hams are fairly valuable and then you get a key you fight the boss and they may drop their beg AM is the hill giant Club 400 K or the essence from the most giant boss worth 4 million GP that could be if you got one of those things you're probably you're probably going to be very happy and that's a lot of what rince keep as it's doing hard endgame content with bosses and if you get a good drop you feel amazing and that's it if you have any more things you'd like to put in the comments feel free or if you think one of these things is absolute garbage feel free to leave a comment and and let me know but this is just for free to players 10 things to do I hope I've helped you enjoy free-to-play experience runescape because real scape is a beautiful game of old school runescape and you should button click
