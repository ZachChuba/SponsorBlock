all right OBS versus stream Labs OBS which I'm going to do my best to stop calling slobs from now on this video has been requested so much and I've honestly put it off quite a bit I at first I thought it was kind of silly to 1to like to me it was pretty self-explanatory and so my answer initially to everyone was just watch my first video on it or try it for yourself the difference should be obvious but I if since it was requested so much I took some time and I do think I have a good way of explaining things and I had a chance to interview one of the devs behind OBS studio and talk to some of the people behind stream labs OBS and so I have a good explanation some wording that I wouldn't have had before as far as the difference between how OBS works and how stream labs OBS works and why they're so different and what problems or benefits that may cause in the future so buckle up I think this is going to be a good one useful tech education and gaming nostalgia that won't put you to sleep get subscribed and turn on notifications so you won't miss the next guide so the easy question that everyone kept asking is one that I will address with the entirety of this video which is which one do I prefer and who should use which and I really feel like this video will line that out a couple easy questions can you record with stream Labs over yes yes in my video if you look at the software there is there's a record button down there you click it it's like asking how to upload to YouTube there's an upload button just look for it now it's it's a little more complicated than that yes you can record locally with stream labs OBS but it is missing some features you do have the normal advanced output mode to customize most of the settings but multitrack recording is a missing feature at the moment and we'll touch on some more missing features in a moment so you can record but it's not necessarily complete per se can you use restream mixer etc etc rather yes but there is some limitations as you in order at the moment you can only sign in with YouTube or twitch in to stream labs oh yes and then that is the platform that you're getting your built-in integrated widgets from so if you're using mixer or another platform then there's not a whole lot of point other than the Auto config because you still have to manually configure all of your alerts and all of your overlays and things which to me detracts from the point of using stream labs OBS in the first place and you can use free stream they do have that as the streaming services they have all the normal streaming services listed despite whatever you sign into but you can only use one platforms alerts and widgets and stream labs integrations at a time so you're kind of stuck there stream Labs OBS does have quite a few missing features compared to OBS studio and I will touch on I will expand why that is I have there's actually really good reasoning in a minute but it is missing studio mode and for those of you who don't understand what studio mode is or why it's net you know useful I do have an entire video on that which I will have linked in the video description because I had a couple people asking they're like what's the big deal about not having studio mode I don't even know why you use it I don't know what studio mode is I do have an explanation if you want to know but that is missing and may never be implemented multitrack audio recording is for whatever reason not functional right now you can only choose the drop-down of a single track so you have multiple tracks you can assign things to but you can still only record one track which is useful if you want to mix audio sources differently for a streaming track in a recording track like if you want to exclude a separate music channel or something but you still can't actually record multiple tracks another annoying issue is that when Yuri MUX your files from stream labs obvious they all go to FLV instead of mp4 no matter what you choose really weird annoyance hopefully they they should fix that but otherwise you can still just use normal like instead of remax in with stream labs OBS just use normal OBS and remix in their VST apparently does sort of work but you have to put the VLC or the VLC VST plugins' files in the OBS or stream labs OBS folder instead of just where they naturally go it doesn't look for the external locations for that stuff it's a little tricky and shreem Labs OBS installs to the app data folder for some reason so it's a little annoying defined but hey that's fine one other thing is every uh not every one but a lot of people seem to think that recording odd or streaming audio at all was the missing feature in stream labs OBS and it's not if you don't have audio double check all of your settings and input devices and stuff of course but it has been found that if you have a noise gate filter added to your microphone and normal OBS and you import that profile in scene collection to stream labs OBS it just like stops working and you don't get any audio at all so you need to go in and disable that noise gate filter or reset it back up at least I don't know which one of the big questions that everyone keeps asking and wants to know the answer to and it's the hot topic since that's what they bragged about is is it really faster and at some point soon I still haven't done this I wanted to do it in preparation of this video but it's more complicated than that at some point soon I will be doing some sort of a be testing on a lower-end rig so I have more significant results probably in my Windows XP rig just running Windows 10 with in AMD 6300 at some point I will be doing testing to try to get some numbers for you but the issue is it is it is very difficult to get quantitative data to say whether or not it is faster because there claims about it being better performing and stuff are fairly theoretical and abstract as is because the the source well well first of all and I will expand on how they're different literally like very quickly after this but the core encoder the core functionality of OBS is at the heart of stream Labs OBS so the way it works works mostly the same like on the back end the way the core recording and streaming works is mostly the same they do have some special optimizations for x264 that you can enable to try to get a little bit better quality for lower bit rates and squeeze a tiny bit of performance out of it for specific games but on the whole it's the same core encoding functionality where the supposed performance benefits come is from having the integration of twitch chat and your the the little history feature for stream labs and the native integration of overlays and things so that you don't need your web browser with 50 tabs and three different windows pulled up at the same time you can keep your web browser closed and have OBS up and theoretically that helps but the problem is the app itself still uses those resources that may use a little bit less but it still uses some and my cats yelling at me and it uses more it uses more RAM than normal OBS would in the first place and so some people found that it uses more processing power for them than normal OBS would and that makes sense vanilla comparison of stream labs OBS versus normal OBS stream labs OBS for all intents and purposes should be using more resources than I am stream or than normal OBS stream labs is heavier and more intense than normal OBS because they packed all this functionality in here and it's basically a giant web browser and so that's where it gets really confusing and it's difficult to actually quantify because the way that they are implying that the performance benefits come it's true if you keep your web browser closed but if you like anyone ever you're still probably gonna have your web browser open to have other things to check on to tweet out your stream to just look at other stuff when you need to like there's that being said I have seen a lot of comments come through on the video and a couple people on our discord who said it is running better for them part of that is just the way they have optimized it in that way part of it is also the diversion of the auto config tool that they have in the onboard process as soon as you open the app the way it automatically detects the best settings for you and all that stuff is pretty accurate and so that alone can get a better grasp on what your streaming settings should be and be more optimized for your hardware and that will make him perform better and so that's really cool like it can make it to where it can automatically set up a more optimized profile for you to use which runs better on your machine which is great and that's fine and that's the big thing I was praising it for in my original video but the core software isn't inherently faster lots of questions about updates have come in as well his studio mode in yet are they gonna add and plug-in support in DI support stream Dex support what's the deal with them forking it I'm gonna talk about how that changes things you know are they adding the new audio meters and surround sound from OBS studio short answer no the way and I I took a good couple hours to go through how this works and I talked to like I said I talked to the OBS dev I talked to some of the people behind stream labs OBS to figure out exactly the wording I should use so stream labs OBS is what's called a fork of normal OBS studio they have taken the core software because it's open source and available on an open source license the core back-end software I believe is referred to as a Lib OBS they have taken that and used that for their own software which means inherently their software goes in a different direction period doesn't matter what normal OBS does over here stream labs OBS is going this way not necessarily better or worse but they are now two completely different pieces of software that just shared the same core base of code now it's split over here and doing its own thing it's like if you cut off half of a plant and plant it over here this plant will keep growing regardless of what happens to this plant they are no longer linked so this you give some food dye to this plant and it grows purple petals this one over here doesn't magically start having purple petals I hope that makes some sense so the way OBS works it is it's a desktop app designed for desktop functionality it uses the the QT front int which is a basic window display framework I don't have the exact words but it's called QT it's used for a lot of Linux apps as well that I've used in the past and that is what they use to create the front in the user interface aspect that you see the front-facing features which includes things like studio mode the the way the settings menus look and how they work the new audio meters that they've added things like that dream labs OBS uses electron which basically takes the chromium web browser idea and wraps it around a piece of software which is a different way of approaching things which a lot of people hate electron apps this is how discord works discord is an electron app it works this basically the same as a app as it does on the website and it is running Chrome basically to run discord if you hit f12 and discord you're gonna be able to view page source just like in Chrome and so that is how it does things and so it anything that they do on the front end they are completely custom coding themselves now they've tried to take some of the newer UI elements and kind of hack it together in their own way but it's not gonna work the same so that means that any of those front-end updates like the audio meters that OBS studio introduces stream labs devs are just going to have to take the core idea and completely implement it in their own way it's not OBS updates and you just got to wait for stream labs OBS to update it is they are two separate things and this is why there are missing features this is why there are broken features they are taking this approach to doing things and sacrificing whatever compatibility with normal OBS stuff again could be good could be bad based on how you feel but that is what it is this is why some UI elements don't work like the multitrack recording there's no studio mode the remix thing doesn't work because they're still working through the beta kinks of getting that together and this is why new features won't be implemented because they will have to make those up from scratch this is also why plugins don't inherently work at all because plugins are designed for everything that normal OBS uses the UI the front end all of that and you can't just plot that in a completely different piece of software and expect that to work VST plugins are a little different since they don't actually use that necessarily like they they're made to be universally compatible with all audio software in the first place and they're basically just a bunch of dll's for the most part so those can work a little different but that is why so many things don't work so in order for the NDI plug-in to work that would require the developer Pilatus to develop a separate NDI plugin or stream Labs OBS or for stream labs to just develop NDI functionality themselves in order for the stream deck to work which is what a lot of people have asked about outside of normal hotkeys you Elgato is going to have to introduce within I guess the stream deck installer a separate plug-in installation specifically for stream labs OBS which is fine they just have to do that and that means that any of that extra functionality you wanted isn't going to be there out of the box it will be easier for the stream deck plug-in as an example to be implemented since its 100% back-end all it does is control basically the hotkeys and the functionality on the back end because it doesn't like there's no UI that you use for the stream deck plug-in and it's barely just to make the stream network over here you don't see anything on OBS so that one will be a little bit easier to introduce but things that require full front-end use and stuff not gonna be so easy I hope this clears things up a little bit I hope this makes this a little bit more clearer as to why things don't work because a lot of people think this is just like a different update onto OBS and why doesn't this or that work it is completely different software at this point every aspect except for the core encoding capabilities basically and compositing are gonna work different and so they have to do things completely differently the question has been brought up a few times now that if I like stream labs OBS a lot what is the point of sticking with normal OBS at this point should we all just abandon normal OBS for the the power and glory of stream labs OBS well no first of lis as we were just talking about updated features all of the new features that they're going to continue develop and implement into OBS studio you're gonna miss out on those or at least it's gonna be very delayed until you see stream labs implement their own and their own implement their own implementation ok whatever until they do their own version of it but also OBS studio gives you a lot more control and in advanced features so if you don't want that totally fine for me I do a lot of you know intense advanced recording stuff for that is very difficult to set up in stream labs OBS or you know multitrack audio recording still need normal OBS stream labs OBS does one thing really well and that is four game streamers to stream to twitch and use the stream Labs integration its strongest feature is that onboarding process where it asks you you know basically a series of questions of what you want and then automatically configures everything for you and it does a good job of automatically configuring things which is pretty cool and then they have all of those integrations of the browser widgets and things like that that you don't have to configure yourself or really even figure out you're just like oh I want that put it here and it does it which is great they even have that built in library for templates and things like that that you can just pull from which is great that's amazing for those people wanting to do that specific thing in a Gration to youtube is still a little bit and part of that is because YouTube's API for streaming stuff is still pretty messy there's no direct integration support for mixer or beam or any of those other platforms and the software itself doesn't really work very well at all like half of the functionality is disabled if you don't link it to a twitch or YouTube account but that's the point of the software so if you're not gonna do that there really is no point to using it but it does do that one thing very very well and serving that audience is going to be their strong suit and they can do this and this is what I was talking to the OBS people about is they can implement things specifically catered towards game streamers on Twitch or whatever platforms when they introduce that may sacrifice more advanced or universal stuff but that make that experience really really good that OBS cannot do because OBS is supposed to be a neutral you know all usable platform and so if they introduce features that break other features or you know features for one audience that ruins the experience for other audiences that they can't do that whereas stream labs OBS can they say we're the ultimate tool for twitch game streamers and then they cut out some features like people like me might want that's fine that is exactly who they are serving and they're gonna be able to do a better job of it but they're going to you know exclude some in another way I had some basic questions for the stream labs OBS team as well based on stuff you all had asked that I wanted to run through as well I asked what the end goal or a longer-term version of stream labs OBS looks like they want to be the simplest way to stream for twitch YouTube mixer and so on while still remaining free and open source and I appreciate that they're aiming to do that their target user will still be new streamers and existing streamers by just making your life easier then your previous setup may have had currently I said currently the apps more catered towards twitch game streamers are there plans to do more directly support other platforms they said absolutely they are planning to support other platforms and have major upgrades coming for that within the next two to four weeks it was easier to get started with twitch since all of that functionality was kind of there but they are definitely introducing things for mixer and so on within a month or so they wanted me to hold off doing tutorials until they have something more stable and that's what I wanted to do because it would make more sense to cover it in a more finalized state and they will have more stuff coming so I will be producing a little mini master course so to speak for stream labs OBS my phone just went off haha but I want to wait until they have more of the core functionality that they want to see in the software established I asked about why they chose OBS is the core why didn't they just make a plugin for it and basically you know the years of optimizations and tweaks for this kind of purpose that went into OBS is what makes stream labs OBS possible and while they could have developed plugins to like do the native integrations of certain things like certain individual features from the software the entire software as a whole wouldn't be possible just with the plug-in API so they needed to fork their own version and so that's why it's something a little different which makes sense like it would still be cool to see them produce the stream labs plug-in like had they developed that parallel or developed that first like I think some people who are helping with plugins and stuff for OBS are hoping to introduce like the sidebar chat feature into OBS and someone wants to introduce the little where it pops up the little alignment lines for your sources on the canvas in OBS like individual people want to contribute that but it would have been cool for them to have done some sort of plugin first but that would also kind of count you know create competition for their own sales of their own products so that would be unlike I in the first place I mean I realized it's a free product but there's still an advantage to having people use the tool you developed versus it and head on for someone else's tool and this was also a question received a whole lot so I asked you know if they plan on supporting Mac Linux etc as well with the software and they said in the end goal they do want to support all the different platforms especially that OBS already supports but they have a long long list of optimizations tweaks and fixes and improvements they need to make for Windows before they tackle another system so long-term Windows and Mac users can see the stuff for Windows and Mac users Linux and Mac users can see the software but it's pretty far out right now and it could be another year or so or more probably this is coming from me not from them like don't plan on it anytime soon keep learning normal OBS so that's it for me Stream labs vs. OBS or stream labs OBS vs. normal OBS studio or just OBS studio I don't want people calling it like classic or old that's not what it's just OBS
