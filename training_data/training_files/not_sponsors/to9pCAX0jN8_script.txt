don't worry kids I'll be your daddy your perfect daddy hey guys massacre X here are what it's the plenty of good boys knocking around as one of our tropes is taking characters who had had a more bold streak and then changing them into either the most endearing little cinnamon buns out there or at least giving them the chance to shine where's prior to that attention they've been cascaded off into the background after just a few episodes you know I'm looking at you Raddatz you know I think we've done good with you today's subject has been created to be the perfect good boy perfecting being the operative word of course Goku didn't get the chance to redeem of this one this time he was a mixture of Balmer and the wonders and marvels of the subject that is of course science good boy 21 is back but in a way that not many people saw coming and it was certainly not an April Fool what if which of course made people go even more well now if you're new to this story let's give you a quick reminder just in case you were confused or crying foul at the premise of this story cell turning good MARSOC oh how does that make any sense cell was created to be the perfect villain the culmination of every body and character that had come before him a perfect way to round off Dragonball Z in a way so in a way you're right the cell that we know of was still bested in the cell games and never got the chance to redeem himself he wasn't any different from what we saw in the original timeline here this version of soap that we're referring to is the one that was in the sub lab of dr. zero in this universe Krillin trunks didn't vaporize this underground fortress of zero and instead informed Bulma of its existence and she took the genetic creation' back to capsule core now before we continue trial of crunchyroll premium now thank you in the last part of this good boys adventures we've just completed the aftermath of the tournament in universe 6 in that competition our boy had done fairly well not embarrassing himself in the slightest good boy 21 started to think about having a people in fact he felt that confident the trouble was though who was available to train who didn't have a master already all was inclined to acquire one initially he attempted to train the likes of Goten and Trunks I mean he had been their playmate for a very long time and knew them inside and out but he then quickly realized that they're already quite skilled and they honestly treated more like a sibling or a friend rather than a problem mentor it just wouldn't work now not that there is something inherently wrong about this it's just not the right kind of two-way relationship he was looking for over the days that followed the victory of the universe 17:21 began to feel a little less motivated to train which took the likes of Gohan and Videl by surprise he and 21 had been training like before there's something unusually melancholy about the bug man's groove lately one day after another training session in which we saw 21 make lots of very amateurish mistakes like he wasn't really trying Gohan decides to intervene taking him aside to the local cream shop to cool down from the morning workout on the young man's way to his job yes ice cream makes everything better I suppose I mean that's the Goku in his DNA for you as the two of them begin to talk 21 begins to share a little bit about why he feels so glum he has started to realize that he was alone there was nobody around that was exactly like him entirely what with the way he was designed he would in theory be able to live forever thanks to the way he was built semi mechanical and with Piccolo's DNA he could look the centuries at the very least maybe millennia if that was going to be the case then he needs to have more of his kind along for the ride he wishes that you know there could be more beings like him goal one starts to lick his ice cream and discloses that maybe he isn't the best person to talk to about this maybe it's best that he talks to his siblings in confidence now that three of them have actually reconciled 21 does agree that even though girl was pretty smart this might be for the best later that day he shares his wishes with his sister 18 is pretty surprised to listen to this 21 didn't seem like the kind of person who would get so broody and want to be a dad granted she had done but she was mostly human and still had the same urges but her brother was mostly bug and wasn't built to raise a family in the traditional sense the sole genius work like clones and he treated them as such but at the same time she does want to help him and so she remarks that she had heard that the other guy could in fact create some offspring but she also wants him to give it some deeper thought this isn't something to get into lightly if he decides to go along with this venture his progeny will be his responsibility not his playthings this isn't like playing with Goten and Trunks 24/7 these children would look to 21 their father for guidance and protection as they grow up they would need care love and plenty of hugs 21 agrees on that and decides to get some better education in the matter sadly he doesn't go for the most to more personal on the first bounce as you will soon find out he starts with Goku but even he remarks that he isn't the best when it comes to these matters but he wishes that he would be I don't know I just can't seem to quite get it most songs are pretty great null but chichi is the better parent in all honesty he also remarks that GT is the one doing the hard jobs in their family while he mostly gets the fun parts like playing and training together with his sons well sometimes working on the fields for the family's newly formed grocery business you know which is actually going pretty well at this point in the story of course he says that he wants to protect his family as much as he possibly can but he also informs 21 that he simply doesn't think he could train him in parenthood and he said that the Jeeter is getting better at this though he might be worth talking to didn't really wish to hear this he didn't really like talking to Vegeta since it was less talking and more shouting in some of them all recent conversations as you might be aware from the previous two parts no reluctantly 21 decides to visit Vegeta who is left speechless after 21 openly asks in the bat Parenthood and shares his wishes about becoming a father 21 rolls his eyes and nods that indeed his thoughts were correct Vegeta was about to shout again however the same princess must be silent for several moments Vegeta is internally terrified remembering the cell juniors running around back in the day in fact remembering himself fighting one although he's stronger now than he was then he could take down the cell Junior the prospect of seeing more little so genius roaming the planet again was something he never expected to occur clearly he didn't read the manga but he quickly reminds himself that 21 has proven to be a valuable ally albeit a bit silly he's a lot like Kakarot but he is getting results slowly but surely because of this Vegeta decides not to mess around with him as he had originally planned to he takes 21 aside and is pretty matter-of-fact with him he says that no one is really ready to become a parent and if he embalmer would ever ever have a second child No he would try to do better than he did with trunks surprisingly Vegeta wants to talk to 21:00 about this and 21 is equally surprised that Vegeta wants to strike up a serious conversation that doesn't involve training or raising his voice the prince opens up a tiny bit more into anyone's company saying that he wasn't a model father for his son but he has grown to respect his dual nature he points out to 21 but a good father should encourage their offspring and not force things upon them allow their passions and drives that they manifest themselves to flourish and nurture them to do better every single day if they're willing to fight then he can train them but he should respect their wishes if they decide against it 21 thinks about this for a moment his children may not want to fight he has to be prepared for that he also brings to his attention that there will be times when he's gonna be tired or annoyed with his children or they will be annoyed with him that they may argue with each other and despite that 21 should always remember about his duty as a protector of his family not just the planet he needs to ask himself a question is he ready for both good and bad 21 isn't so sure but he thanks for Jesus for his opinion it is the first genuinely friendly moment that the two have ever shared but there is one more person that he has to visit his brother Android 17 he knows that 17 is not only a child of his own but he's also adopted to other children he wants to know his opinion as well not at first seventeen thinks that his blood bros joking but he quickly discovers that this is most certainly not the case 21 has a very serious tone in expression which is very unlike him in normal situations so 17 nods and decides to be honest he tells him that he and his wife adopted those two other children because he knows how hard it is to grow up without a loving family and someone to look up to and although they are pretty odd Bunch they get along remember bro family is what you make of it 17 makes him realize that all this time he has been treated as a family member by piccolo Gohan go ten trunks bomber and the others in a way 21 already has a huge family he also remembers Piccolo's tales of his father who left an only revenge him a bad reputation kinda like perfect self did to him without the revenge part 21 calmly thanks his brother and disappears off into the distance in fact he doesn't go home he just benches off into the mountains but not before swinging by capsule Corp just for a little bit and asking Ballmer for some advice about how you would make babies being who he is would she know the bomber wasn't prepared for this nor was she prepared they're hearing that he and Vegeta had had a very polite conversation earlier on she tells him what she knows and he simply flies off nobody sees him for weeks and weeks on end which is making everyone quite worried now normally people will be able to find them due to his very unique energy signature but all this time away he hid his power to make very sure he wouldn't be found making almost everyone feel even more distress like what happened to him almost everyone except his siblings and Vegeta though they kind of can guess what he's doing they deduce what's going on yeah now after a few weeks twenty-one returns accompanied by two small creatures resembling him thanks to the likes of mucus over on deviantART who created this fan art we have a very basic design of what one of them would look like suddenly the gang all senses power back at the dojo that he built where it usually hung out and a lot of them gather around to see him after all these months his friends and family surround him pretty surprised by the revelation even 17 came by to visit smoking a bit so these are your sons asked screwin ah neat twenty-one simply smiles no Crillon my friend this is my son Kandra and my daughter mightor I'm sorry that I worried you all so much but I was just busy showing them the world so that they can decide who exactly they want to be contra mightor a very shy in front of all these different looking people then nothing like their father at all but if he's comfortable around these people they can't be all that bad right that's mightor shuffles her foot and bowels out of perspective trunks Ballmer gets a sudden phone call from a security detail back at capture call a craft has appeared on the grounds without clearance hmm a crop that hasn't been around since the days of the cell saga Boulder then looks to 21 and to the others with a very apprehensive expression who's going to tell trunks about 21 trunks says 21 might have an Condor at the same time but but he was right there they pointed the present trunks but then Gohan says that they are referring to the future version future version I'm confused they then realize that they had glossed over this detail it's time for them to tell the truth about his other self and this is where we're going to be living things for right now so what do you guys think how is 21 in this family going to help during the Goku black arc is the very notion something that interests you leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
