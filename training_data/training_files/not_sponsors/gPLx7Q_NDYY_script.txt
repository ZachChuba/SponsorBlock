okay I'm starting on the main screen this time around because I don't know what's happening here but I went on to the server just to get things ready as we were about to record and inside the cave there's a mob it looks like it belongs in the water it's like got a water tornado around it it looks like a fish and I'm like what's happening here it's floating on the ceiling why is this here what so I was working on getting the server up because we set up a new server you know same world obviously but and at one point I had to log on during that and you know remember when you logged on and it gave you the like the little voiceover and the the things showing it was a new season yeah you know winters for sure yeah I did I did that and again it played some music and then came up and it was like sharknado what so see what was going on but I logged out shortly after cuz I didn't want to proceed anything and then you were like there's a tornado type thing and I was like also so here's a fun one for you hey should we jump on here's a fun one for you okay I am under explicit instruction from the mod pack creator and have set the configuration as such we were on difficulty 1 and it's supposed to be difficulty 3 so we will have gone from easy to hard when we log on are you ready let's go log it why has it what what do you mean there's tot what oh oh no help what why are we here where am I I believe I believe again no this is Bennet how am I still alive still under water I don't know what's happening where's Mike I'm being I'm being spun killed now ok yeah hey just punch it just by kids I'm frickin Frick le we'll see you take take that take those punches oh darn Frick God dang it whoo we're gonna end here ending each other why is this a thing I don't know and I don't know oh my god dude oh my why is underground I'm in an underground whirlpool and there's more sharks now that wait there's more yes there's two new hey I don't know where the water starts and ends oh I got some hits on it though did you I don't know where what now my stuff is everywhere else I don't know where it is just wait no it didn't it's over there Oh God everything again yeah but it's over there if my stuff is over where the thing is good okay okay you gotta know yes I do there's another one no no there are two there's there could be more do you have a weapon of some sort I have my halberd on me wait I don't know where my stuff went though I don't know either show me stuff in here oh here's some stuff okay I have my halberd oh my goodness pants and I food I had a lot of stuff but wait where where have you got oh no no no no no no no no oh you're up there wait where are you oh you're over here oh I see oh those are killed scobie's there's one oh oh oh don't go that way go up to the terrace what up top there's no there's not no is a problem it's a problem man we can't go anywhere what's true oh there's all of our stuff too we're is it I got I got some stuff I got some stuff okay is or some silver or a shovel so you know is there any armor there's the bandage no the only power armor I've found so far is my pants which I'm wearing oh my god all I have is a frickin chest plate so you know the idea was we were gonna do some exploration today yeah no I don't think we can have you have you ventured up up yet no oh no no no so how long until they despawn is the question it's in question I see two right over there right now there's two yeah you see those actually are not what concerned me nearly as much okay as the predicament that presents itself upon venturing up top okay yeah I mean they've got to go away sometime right or we've got to figure out how to kill them sometime yeah but it's you're gonna you're gonna see basically there are UFOs everywhere uh-huh uh-huh yeah oh my god there are so many oh my god oh my are they coming towards us are they coming towards us I can't tell if they're well what do we do is our big boy gone well um wait nope no big boys over there big boys over there okay the oh I don't know what happened to me oh you got lobbed I got long you got lobbed oh yeah I could I didn't even have a line of sight okay so you got also I've heard tale that mobs canna in this can spawn from from cobwebs the cobwebs can actually spawn mobs where did my armor go I don't know but I found some it's okay please may I have oh my god I can't believe that we're okay I can't believe we're fine keeping the shoes that's just how I am goodness well today the idea was we were gonna explore and now I suppose that's a possibility potentially oh that was a high stress environment I'm a little bit more woken up than I was yeah good morning you could say I'm low very woke you're the locust super all right so you have torches I know that I do I don't have any do we have any glowstone do we have glow star I don't believe that's the thing that we can acquire yet because we haven't been to dusts we do yeah but we you know the glowstone dust can be used to create a something or other oh wait oh wait did I get to where I needed to be I got to where I needed to be in building in order to actually God dang it I had levels and I can't do levels anymore because yeah yeah we kind of we kind of got a little D leveled there excuse me oh my goodness I need to frickin get some levels somehow I got one level how many levels I don't know I just got like a level off of you off of me how dare you oh no no no you open you go you pulled out the iron and I got that okay that makes more sense Wow okay Wow a lot of cues me of forgetting about canteens and and purified water but the reality is is I haven't had any leather to make a canteen so that's why I haven't but now I do okay so if I can do that then I have a water canteen and then we had some charcoal filters that were right here to make us a canteen that's pretty cool dude purified water cool all right well alright Willie and I can team that I can drink purified water throw and how many uses does it have I don't know but it does have a durability bar on it so I'm actually trying to find myself a darkbeast so that I can get to three levels and then I can bring my halberd all the way back up to full which will excite me very much because it's been a little bit worse for wear lately and I'll be super ready to go or I guess we want to prioritize the things that we want to bring with us and we'll just kind of pack up and go unless we want to make backpacks yeah no that makes sense what what's involved in the backpack I mean it's worth I haven't actually looked into that part yet but oh don't headshot me go ahead and shot me boy you now have ourselves a permanent what what the what so you seem to have died yeah I'm a green rat has demonetised me where were you over here a green rat with instability what is that even oh that's just a rat oh my god it's like a where rat yeah dude yeah yeah he'll get away right did you did you pick up my stuff oh no wait no problems I have problems the freaking zombie picked up my halberd okay give the rat oh my god ah be back back over here I was fine and then you were like oh I'm gonna go find a rat and now my life is horrible Wow is this taking place all I wanted was somebody monetizes zombie i freakin dread Freaker Oh Frick I punched it many times oh my god oh my god oh my god I just need to get a weapon just need to get a weapon okay are you whatever you takin it out okay I killed it there's also another really punched the rat to death there's something over here that's absolute no mother agree why I didn't sign up for this no no what have you done gene what have you done don't blame me you said that difficulty the like that destroy you every two seconds this is this is the appropriate experience we are experiencing the appropriate experience right now no doubt I've never seen this before it it sucks I don't you know what are we do about this what have you done you've ruined us we can't exist here any longer I got some chores fruit so oh my god oh my god you think I can kill GRU oh my god what is this I'm trying I got it I got it I got it I got it okay well there's so many I can't hit it find it with lights oh my god where's the zombie that had my freaking halberd oh that's gonna be fun to kill it he's over that way come here what did I get caught by the zombie what do you mean huge help help help yeah no I need give me my halberd did you get my halberd no no yes I did it's almost broken but it's up here my god do all the levels okay can you please it just shoot I need I you can't do it cuz you don't have that what's happening help what is I what's on me it's it's about this maybe I don't know there he is what the get out of here you're not allowed yeah that's right that's right alright there's still more stuff down there something that came at me and I and I ran and ok I need armor or something okay I have here's your pants I was just trying to get one more level I just wanted hey and here's your helmet and I yeah I don't even know what that means all right so we're all prepped we're good to go everything's fine what is that what are those no leave that doesn't look spinning balls at me I got it it's dead I'm Drive elucidating and in siblings would build eyes okay that's everything god I'm leaving we need to go elsewhere I'm done with this game what happened we go Fred Fred why is it do these what is this what is this red it's harder than everything else it's the final boss all right bad rat better how are you getting down here like where you coming from stopping outside did you get the rat I I didn't get the rat I don't know where the rat is but I've gotten a lot of stuff so I'm coming up here again it's over there before I can even do anything it just designed me alright have your shoes I need my levels I don't know where Oh how many house do you have let me have a little some levels don't to late God dang it I'm sorry okay there's a lot of stuff down here I'm full up on stuff but I do it I did get some seeds I got 21 letters I get 21 levels and I'm killing things oh that would no no no no no neither of us have that many levels I got a fancy helmet I think that was a rabbit that was a gnarly rabbit I'm wondering where you're coming from oh my right here right here yeah right over here oh it's like taking a long way around man yeah but I was okay for you I have shoes I'm wearing him okay and I have the iron ingots that probably dropped off my body at some point I have some iron ingots too or did you ask for him I was asking for him there you go we're in good shape full armor got some weapons apparently our full armor does a lot oh yeah yeah did you an iron sword and pickaxe by any chance I have a stone sword I do not have I do not have an iron stick here's some sticks here's some sperm okie dokie bud listen they changed how it looks and it looks how it changed you know what dude we got six interpose though oh those are ender pearls nice we also already have some ender pearls which is pretty cool we got some obsidian too we're gonna be able to make another portal at some point you're never gonna leave this spot ever yep I need to organize my inventory and regroup are you getting faced hugged again yeah I don't like that good are you good I don't like I killed it okay good job good job I don't like that Gooch alright good jorb I I would like to who I was worried for you for a sec just say nay to that ever again mm-hmm that's completely understandable I understand oh god I might want to make another iron sword all right let me take a look at what goes into a pack so backpack is craftable with leather wool and gold that's actually pretty easy I think leather is craftable from at various leather sources do we have dried flow okay so if we take rotten flesh combine it with sugar then we can smelt that and turn it into yeah turn it into leather okay so dried flesh actually has a purpose yes now question is have we found any sugarcane anywhere hmm okay if we looked around a little bit perhaps then we could try to find some sugarcane and then in then we combine it with rotten flesh at which we have an entire stack and we should be off to the races with a backpack and we have wool so that's good and we have gold so basically everything that we could ever need and here's something every I hear something why do I hear something there's stuff around okay thank you no thank you all right all right good good great great good good good let's go find some sugarcane really quick and um yeah oh why still particles coming off myself when I don't apparently have any status effects very unsettling but you know what I'm gonna do hey what do you think I should level up what do you think I should level up I have 18 levels on me right now magic is good okay witch or mining or attack so I can use diamond stuff mmm know what magic what do we need at higher magic levels I don't know Oh ender pearls require magic eight so I couldn't even use the ender pearls that are on me okay I'll do magic boom and then let's do how a male I will level up mining cuz I feel like we're gonna want to get better resources at some point where have you been off to chased a rat a kobold oh okay not a not one of the bad rats no no no just a kobold god there is a guy oh he's attacking our nymph hey wait dear alone that's not cool let's not fell that's uncalled for you got a dark eight now those guys are those guys are pretty easy to kill I realize this it's just heyyou ue4 it are the bad guy out who's killing me okay I maybe I should be able to hit you from that frickin rate what is the fire it's never been like this before I feel like oh hell I'm on fire yes I must go water I must go water water okay I'm okay I'm okay is the nymph still around I heard yes yeah she's here oh okay cool % help I could use you now she's 70 % held so ya leather hah I got just what we needed wait do we have any letter actually already done hey that's what I had leather but I used it for the canteen because I didn't know we were going for other things ah I see not a problem not a problem did you use a bottle leather but we had yeah ok it's no worries let's go we can try to find ourselves a bit ok that's horrifying it's on my head help how would he have a face hugger no no it was a bird it was a bird on my head a bird yes it was a bird I didn't like it I didn't like it I didn't like it at all it was not ideal what are you oh there's a dark NIM that's kind of pretty it's an ass big you're not friendly are you you don't look friendly you look decidedly unfriendly ok please sugar cane that's all I want in my life kind of I'm looking around I'm over checking out the coastline dude I followed I followed the swamp where I'm at okay I'm just investigating the coastline seeing what's up you know okay perfectly okay do this turtle over here that's kind of cool dark Aspen okay it seems he'll it go so far good good I'm checking out a turtle it looks like a nice cool turtle that's turtle seeing cool well that was a fast boy turtle if I've ever seen it just zoomed away or something there's a great Gryphon hey I haven't seen one of those yet getrekt but oh wait that would tell me wouldn't it I wonder if sugar cane is actually like difficult to come by here that's a possibility or we just don't know what we're looking for to know you nice how many yes okay cool operation sugar cane now to return I guess maybe well no we're gonna we're gonna to take them with because we're gonna leave this place so once we get the leather and make the backpack see I guess we'll just maybe leave one over just in case we want to have some to grow in case we don't stumble upon anything else before we hit our next home point okay so a golden nymph fancy fancy so you were giving me instructions and I'm gonna be honest I wasn't listening what did you want me to do it just saying maybe save one put it in the backpack in case we don't stumble across any and I'm gonna start a sugar cane farm when we get to nice thanks well I mean we're gonna be leaving momentarily so oh oh no no no fire beasts in our cave oh why is it shooting freaking face orders on me a fire beasts shooting no no no no no no no no no no no no golden nymph help help help help golden them I need your help you're ready to face the fire Beast is everything fine down here nope it's not you're about to find out that's just a quill beast it's a quill beast are you sure it's not a fire Beast it's dead brah I'm scared of everything now leave me a hold your hand with anything else let me know I would loved your hand holding at this point would be very comforting for me okay regeneration I'm a comforting okay so I see two leather in here right now and then I have to sure cane on me so that just mixes with rotten flesh you were saying yes and then you smelt it and it gives the leather mm-hmm what do you know no no sugar yes it's sugar and then it's for rotten flesh with the sugar okay I didn't I don't know what the recipe was I was just guessing so I apologized that I didn't into how dare you not know and then smelt the dried flesh oh do you have buckets on you by you I do actually I have a spare bucket I literally have a spare bucket I actually do have a bucket - oh it's purified already oh nice also I have one more letter so the canteen you can purify and they get they basically are one thing of like they it took away all my thirst but used used up all of it oh gosh one bar one bar of thirst a full a full bar yes okay alright so we got to leather and you fill up the canteen from the purified water that you place down no no no no just regular water and then you use the charcoal filters on it oh okay you make charcoal filters and those get used up got it got it got it so how do you make a charcoal filter Oh relaxing bed I was like I might do I seem a high-strung because if I see my strong it's probably because I am because I'm being attacked a lot by things because everything tries to kill us always yeah yeah just just a little bit no what I guess I'll bring some iron with us okay so we are what are you you don't look friendly at all and then sticks and yep okay let's rock and roll I'm sure I'm forgetting something important but we'll deal with that on the way let's go find things I'm sure nothing could pasta should I bring the anvil just in case that bring the anvil just in case mmm no it's fine I reckon October durability on that thing probably okay where'd you go what direction I am at the wheat oh shoot I need it we definitely should both have compasses you probably have the presence of mind to bring yours God dang it a different still around mother for car what got for obsidian from that actually which brings us a lot closer to another portal that's kind of cool what are we up to 10 wait me actually we could make another portal but we don't have to do that yet but it's more exploration at some point for another episode oh yeah I don't think anything could possibly go wrong with us going happiness and joy no definitely okay great where is that compass because we definitely are going and do want eat okay I have a compass I've compositions loaded with chaotic energy they emit this through their spines on their back in order to attack their prey very few creatures attack dare attack these dangerous produce I don't know I'm not a fan of that I like I like the names no the nymphs are actually I'm a I'm a big fan of a big fan personally I think they do really really good quality work and I can't complain about them they do good with inventory again because I realize that bandages would probably be good to have so I brought some stuff but anyway let's go do things alright sounds good sounds like he's fighting me on fire I need a nipple I need a nymph as well as an adult the only thing we've done passed in this direction is this is the let's just head in this direction this is hell yeah this is this is West and the only thing I've done here is this where I found the sugarcane but we really haven't been down here much all right sounds good you could take this bra out getrekt doc Oh a couple of leather from that actually sets cool place I feel like by the time we're done here we will probably be able to make a big pick oh do we actually know the coordinates of our home so thirteen so thirteen hundred three thousand about yeah about and I'm sure that won't be varied by a significant amount of D monetization but I guess new monetization will send us back home so it'll be fine not to mention that assuming we die we won't be able to find out coordinates but that is that's true uh if we if we D monetize now we're as good as losing all of our stuff so as can be oh you said you don't don't don't we don't want it I don't think we want that do we want that is it a bad thing let's see Aspen is peaceful reptiles Oh strange growths on their back acid love mushrooms and can be farmed with them be careful as they constantly emit a cloud of poison oh yeah they love you so hard that they and you that only wonders love you the fact that we looked up you know the creature in the dicks in the encyclopedia should make some viewers happy yeah how do you access that actually from your inventory it's top right it's the green oh wow okay that's cool I didn't actually know that was right there's a flying thing that's flying oh this a like Griffin thing that looks pretty good Griffin are they angry no far it hasn't seen to be too angry here's some cows because they look like they would do bad things to us Sam damn leather nice and tie what you'd expect but we're working towards some backpacks boys get in there we're getting there there's some more over here and a structure I like structures I know that you can get there are some gnarly structures that we can find and oh yeah I'm hoping we do a lot of cows oh we can wait is that just another portal that already exists thanks for getting very dark dude is it there's just we forgot to bring beds it's true but then we would have like transported to or whatever so it's just a nether portal no but oh that's that is true but it's gonna be scary too good night oh you can do a sleeping bag that doesn't set your spawn oh that's kind of cool how do you make those leather I soon I think it's sleeping bag 3 wool is all it takes really I have 10 nice for site 100 oh is it a one-time use do we know I have no mirrors cross that it is not here you go mate cool thank you ah if we had a flint and steel I mean maybe not okay well we'll keep in mind here's the coordinate of it our boxes but 1000 comma 30 100 there we go let me see what looks like yeah and see well looks like I'm on their side Oh God imagine dealing with water supply while you're in the nether okay I mean are you alive I'm alive I'm alive we're okay everything's fine actually we're fine no issues at all in fact this is quite peaceful looking other than the flaming golem spirit ember over there and the green thing it might be coming Souls coming Oh God big guy over there okay go that that guy he looks like a big devil dude who's gonna do bad things to us anyway I'm over here I'm back yep oh yeah yeah yeah okay where we owe all of our water went away oh that's nice so that's what we've learned is that do we know they were thirsty how do we actually live in there that's a that's a question yeah how does well is what is what are magnets but you know I mean it ones morning well should we go over to the big tree now knowing that we cannot sustain ourselves in the nether for more than 10 seconds at a time sure okay big tree 9 sounds good I like big tree there's a witch over there I am worried about witches in this mod back is that a witch or is that okay skeletons there's witches there is many many what what's wrong what's wrong oh okay attack wherever attack okay I'll watch the flanks hope your your reaction seems excessive hey listen boo did he drop a fancy bandage he did he did my man okay gotta love fancy bandages it's more the the skeleton over there in the dark that has me concerned that's us way up very much does it there's a big fire over there oh hi sorry I just hit you a lot because you decided to jump through me yeah thanks thanks for that appreciate you don't don't blame me okay okay alright alright we got a we got a skill a bro who's there's a okay let's get over here and sleepy maybe time absolutely I approve of this is by then over by the nether portal is yes yes yes yes sleepy oh nice it's it's it's always interesting sleeping on top of your sleeping bag hey no there are no durability it just works that is an exciting development yeah alright so how do you want to tackle this tackler little worried but I mean nymph over here did you have any I am actually all good no I'm full and full - okay we're good - no mmm-hmm I just like to drink the water straight out of the lake it feels more refreshing okay here we go here we go I feel like we've got a chance but before we go I want to level up my skills so that in case I do monetize things will be okay I'm gonna level up attack a lot cool we go we out here not jumping in front of me I'm gonna try not to jump in front of you any of them anymore I mean I'm just saying it's a hat it seems to be becoming a hat okie-dokie spiders hello ah the Suns in my eyes so badly I barely see a thing oh no Grim Reaper got him he did thanks nice nice the grimmest of reapers yeah the Sun I'm eyeing the Sun we're yeah hmm there's anything in here to obtain oh right I forgot to make a I forgot to bring in myself a stone axe oh these are seal Androids and thus I am NOT able to use an axe we're really good at finding tree houses to explore they don't actually seem to have any a lot of enemies I mean even axe you wouldn't happen any cobblestone would ya I have a lot of my man's there you go right behind you thank you sir my hero my hero except that why mmm I think that I had a moment where I broke my crafting table and didn't shift I just thought I'd pick it up - you've a crafting table I do okay thanks for helping me out in every possible way I'm pretty sure it's your crafting table so oh okay so maybe you picked it up XL grab it cuz you know this crafting tables only four spools it's unattractive lame have you uh have you updated your Twitter name yet no not even why there's a tree man and that just came out of the lantern it's an int okay thank you yeah I was worried that it was an octopus it looks like an octopus I was gonna get tentacled what I wasn't ready well cuz it the sea lantern that's where my mind went it looked technically and there was sea lantern and I was like oh it's dr. octopus yeah that's reasonable obviously it is don't be a little moving up top okay why are all these treehouses full of nothing what whoa go go go go go be back yeah we can't we can't fight against gravity that's it that's a losing battle oh there's a lot of boils down there a lot of boys be careful on your descent alright alright just continue ahead that was it oh are you an imp was over here right I eventually eventually there was a nymph over here yes yes and nothing seems to de-spawn very much other than I guess sharknados did eventually which is kind of them having slight problems right now I got an arrow in my head you know I don't know how is it like oh I know you know I know you okay where are we going you're running around in circles we need to pick a direction and go that way I say we continue you better I say we continue on the west would we like to make it boats and sail and probably get demonetized by a freaking sea monster and we are off what is what there's some spiny - oh never mind just a tree the head was a big that's a thing is that a battle tower that's underwater there's a lot of muck out what the okay something hurts you when you get in here by there oh and I'm sick sons come after you some stuff it's in the boat you have a chicken lizard in the boat what the heck okay there's another one up here what are

do I don't know if I've let it anywhere near away from like where you were at but this is problem I should put some levels into lower level skills before I D monetize here any minute to this spitting mothertrucker all right well I'm swimming I can't make any promises on that what's out yep nope oh my god they laser you from a million oh really do they now they do it's almost like it's an abnormal range oh no I see it I see it I'm so worried why don't mad at me is that thing what it is did you get your stuff though no it's as soon as I go over this hill it's gonna start laser beaming me I don't

anything like this this is unbelievable I need no I don't want to use the seat I want a drink dude it's a problem that we're experiencing super badly yeah no I trust me and I understand III feel like I'm almost dealing with it slightly more I know I'm trying to I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to get in try to get in I got it it's down it's down dad nice okay okay now all right I am on my way see if I can get your stuff well I'll try to get back to you what I have determined is that it's apparently summer because now we have the problem of it getting way too hot out apparently a little hyperthermia yeah it's gonna toast II and I'm having to find myself going into the water you the I am on the plus side though collecting a lot of leaven that we should be able to use for additional backpack space also I see a little Hut over here this is a village all right it takes a village takes a village to figure out a conquer this freaking server I'll tell you that much dude speaking of servers we definitely neglected at the very beginning to thank our sponsor for the series MC pro hosting for providing the server that we are playing on and if you would like to snag a server for

it's it's I think what I did there is I ran into literally the worst clump of mobs I've experienced thus far the entire series so it's bad news what's just taking place I think everything is gone oh I

currently am in travel locations I'm just gonna be honest you this doesn't look good from the outside really doesn't look good I think I've lost everything I know I I'm pretty sure that I lost it all it's bad I had a lot of I had a lot of stuff on me too yes died I passed those guys there's a creeper but I don't know where you were I know I was there that that is the part I was there in that water eBay surrounded by a lion and skeletons and fish and everything that wants to destroy us with great great passion I am missing the basics on how to exist in this world right now well for starters okay that's it that's it we're gonna have to do some work offline between this episode of the next to like collect gear because I just lost everything I'm not I can't even bother I can't I can't even bother to go there new Nets give it one more shot oh my god if we can't double up I don't know why I ran through that area that was a mistake on my part but also now that I have run through that area there's no point in bringing more stuff because we're just going to getrekt every time that's the spirit well no but this is this is a particular kind of predicament because I can I can kill everything was gonna kill them all if the lion the lion being in the water is a particularly interesting thing because lions don't usually cats don't like water generally so we feel like that wrong so you can maybe I can lead to a fight yeah actually I can lead the boy leave why is the crabbing good there's a forget angry crabbing me no mother trucker get the fork away oh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna punch a hole in my monitor I'm fighting a lion yep like mad for you I see that no never not never mind I'm not fighting a lion anymore I'm gonna try to continue that battle where you left off yeah

okay I wasn't I wasn't expecting the outcome and I did take care of the lion I got it in the lava oh that's that's good thank you clever job so he's done I mean I died but you know I guess I'm gonna try to get the stuff that I was just II monetized with by skeleton way over in that direction so maybe I can do that but yeah the fish is a slight issue and then blue blue amphibian monsters hug themselves out of the water at me okay yeah and I'm gonna be honest I don't see it coming back ya know oh my god it's it's the it's the thing from Guillermo del Toro's movie the the font or it's the
