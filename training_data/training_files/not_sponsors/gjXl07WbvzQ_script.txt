so back in april i made a video asking if you guys would like to see a video where ipk on a bunch of different runescape names and accounts in order to get fights with people who don't know that it's me the reason for this being that the wilderness is already so dead and for some reason goodbye cares always tend to avoid each other nowadays so today we're going to go hybriding trybird staking and deep lunus pking and try and make a ton of money undercover nobody i fight will know i'm databitter until they see this video or i tell them sponsoring this video so when the whole otoblock and panic thing happened a week or two ago tribute stakes were a big thing and you know me i love tribute stakes panic was streaming practicing for the fights and i wanted to help give him some practice as well as take his money so i got on a 75 attack 75 defense med level to fight his 80 attack 80 defense med level and by this point we'd both won a couple small ones but this next one was going to be for 100 mil and they still didn't know it was me [Music] [Music] so i managed to win the 100 mil and we're going to go in for another fight so we go into our next fight and he puts up 200 mil i'm not going to shy away from the challenge i put up 200 as well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we'd managed to win the big one for 200 mil i did end up telling panic that this was me after the fights and we are friends so please don't go flaming him or even flaming me trying to start drama between us as we don't care for it i'm always down to nhk any content creator for any amount of money so shout out to panic for doing these fights regardless i find the edge hybriding pretty pointless as all the good brits who fight each other camp 115 hp and try to expect 80 40 ags malls for max hp to try and get kills however these guys risk loads of money so if they think i'm a noob they might risk their hp for me and end up getting ko'd so despite the fact we didn't even ags back that guy we still did end up killing him with the ags whack for a total of 97 mil loot good fight oh i just killed another one so another hybrid and kill an edgeville and this really stacks the paper another 72 mil kill on top of the 100 mil kill we just got and these two kills were in the same day so that was pretty nice so i was doing some chill peaking out of 44s with my friends on the account that people don't know and abyss who's actually one of my closest friends on the game starts attacking me up at 44s and i wasn't going to tell him it was me we're gonna have a little fun fight and if i kill him he can find out so i didn't end up killing abyss for around 25 mil but that's my boy so as soon as i killed him i told him and traded it right back to him how'd you pick at egos deep wild is in one of the worst states it's ever been in but i still found whatever fights i could and that was a nice little ags smite i was doing some more deep illness pking and ran into another pk who was  talking me and i managed to convince them to try birds take me 50ml at the dual arena [Music] got a little bit close for comfort at the end there but we do in fact take those and we managed to make 50 ml off that guy next up is a pk streamer called dyno xx he was doing some deep well pecan and i was just chilling in his chat and he actually wanted to set up a tribute steak with me we did a couple and then we went in for this 20 miller [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and that is another 20 mil added to our collection big shout out to dino for actually doing those fights with me and good fight to you bro so a pretty successful video if i do say so myself managed to make over 500 more pk on different accounts in different styles so i'm going to go ahead and help give back to you guys by giving away four acbs to four different people all you have to do to enter the giveaway is like the video subscribe to the channel and comment down below one old school runescape content career you'd like to see me nh take preferably one that wasn't in this video and i'll pick the winner in the next pking video thanks for watching and i'll see you guys later
