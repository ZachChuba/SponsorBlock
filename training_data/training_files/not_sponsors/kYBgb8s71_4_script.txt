specialty cards but rather I am listing cards that whether in mono black or three color are the essential staples of black color commander decks in my evaluation of course this means in many ways we are taking more broad appealing picks than simply whoa look at this overwhelmingly / powerful corner case card in black so while cards such as ulla port cutthroat blood artist and viscera seer are classic black aristocrat staples and absolute must runs in any sort of aristocrats deck in fact I'd argue they are the heart of just about a terroristic rat stack they are not going to be must run in other black or black X builds that aren't aristocrats or aren't based on sacrificing creatures for a win so I'm not going to include them on this list and want more Universal pets though yes a lot of black decks do run these three cards they're great but starting at number eight on the must run list of black staples as a card I played with great glee and affection over twenty years ago wild I have literally been playing with this next card for over 20 years I'm so old and when I do eventually fall into the grave if you'd like to bring me back to fight for you it's just one in a black to animate dead animate dead is one in a black for an enchantment aura and chant creature card in a graveyard and holy moly even fixed this is a wall of text look animate dead is you enchant a dead creature in any graveyard it returns to the battlefield as long as that creature has the enchantment on it you control it and if the enchantment falls off it goes back to the graveyard and it also gets a negative one negative zero okay it is a lot but it does a lot in commander this is a must run because in under powerful creatures either win games or they end up in graveyards well this is a cheap cost to grab them and try again maybe you brought out something yourself and had it removed or better yet an opponent launched something scary only to have it taken down animate ded lets you have your pick of the dead and it's also nice when there's a super powerful utility creature in someone's graveyard for you to rob no similar choices reanimate and this spell allows you to circumnavigate the whole enchantment clause once you reanimate with reanimate you have that creature until it dies period but reanimate also costs you that creatures converted mana cost in life which will not always prohibitive in commander can still be too high a price in some situations also speaking of price reanimate is a $10 card versus the two buck reanimate dead the many black decks run both I'd say your black deck should run at least one next up let's talk about the new Magic the Gathering digital client or rather its biggest competitor for everyone knows how expensive arena can be and well this new competing magical digital client gives you all the same advantages but with no cash cost you just pay in life and what's that it's not a new digital client it's a magic card by rex ian arena well it seems I got a bit confused arena how come on come on whatever phyrexian arena is an enchantment for one generic mana and double black at the beginning of your upkeep you draw a card and you lose one life see animate dead that's how you write a card greatness at any cost is the mantra of black and that cost is usually life going all the way back back back to my high school days once again the card necropotence defined this quality but it has been streamlined here with the perfect amount of power in phyrexian arena basically for the rest of the game or until someone disenchant set you are now drawing two cards a turn instead of one you take a whopping 1 point of damage sorry and whopping 1 loss of life which is quite a little to pay for quite a lot despite the double black units casting costs - and even three color decks that are in black should be running a copy of this card as it is an absolute must-have staple of the color but black isn't just about reanimating the dead and trading life for power it's also about killing things but in commander what if we want to kill all the things what's the must run black card for that well take a clue from the living nightmare hellscape that most internet discourse has turned into these days and grab a copy of toxic deluge toxic deluge is too generic in a black first sorcery as an additional cost to cast the spell pay X life all creatures get negative x negative x until end of turn here we are paying life again toxic deluge is great because you can customize it to the size and scope of the board if you've got a couple players with stalled out boards of tons of do two tokens to life clears them away a bomb creature that needs to be taken out or the game ends pay the price in life and eliminate the threat 1 black and 2 generic means this can go in any deck running black even 5 color and toxic deluge is just a must-have the clothes alternative is the infamous damnation but deluge allows for not just customization but some potent tricks as well let's say the board is filled with creatures but the toughest is only 5 toughness and then you happen to cast a good old 6 6 illusion wipe the board but leave your creature standing to swing in and do serious damage while everyone else needs to rebuild it's an absolute powerhouse and staple of a black card and my pick for number 6 all right we've talked about the must-have commander black card for reanimating the dead for trading life for power or a card draw for mass removal of irritants but what about proper retribution for the removal of our own creatures coming in at number 5 is hard for the opponents to stay alive with a dictate of Erebos dictate of Erebos is three generic and double black for an enchantment with flash that's right flash in this enchantment and whenever a creature you control dies each opponent sacrifices a creature this is certainly a must run in one of the black aristocrats builds where you were always looking to sack out your creatures and with dictate on the board wipe your opponents boards as hordes of tokens get taken to the phyrexian altar but dictate has a lot of other uses and is a must run in just about any black deck first of all it serves as an awesome deterrent have a 1/1 spirit token they have big scary creatures but if they attack you and you chump block that chump is taking a creature with it from each opponent this is especially handy when an opponent perhaps only has one big scary creature and we have a dictate in hand they attack we flash it in jump block and bye-bye threat now the runner-up here is the original grave pact which technically is less to cast but harder for non mono black decks as it costs triple black instead of the more manageable double many would argue that shifting the triple black pips to only two is worth an extra colorless in the cast as is the combat trickery of flash and I'd be one of them because Dictate is my pick for number 5 black can't rely on board wipes like toxic deluge alone it needs targeted removal for those precision cuts well number four and number three are our two must run forms of direct removal we'll start with a shriek ma shriek ma is an elemental creature for for generic and a black and it has fear meaning this creature can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures now when shriek MA enters the battlefield destroy target non artifact non-black creature 5cm C is pretty costly but you can evoke a shriek ma for one and a black meaning you can cast this spell for that evoke cost but if you do it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield well the hard cast is costly for this creature late-game it can be done in a three-two with fear does often come in handy but since you can evoke a shriek MA for only one and a black it's essentially a doom blade and if you have that dictate of air bosun play it'll target one creature to be destroyed sacrifice your own shriek MA trigger the dictate and then everyone will have to sacrifice a creature as well and hey once streak Ma's in the graveyard reanimate a target another creature rinse repeat number three is a lot more straightforward it's a must run catch all the heroes downfall one in double black heroes downfalls an instant with the simple text that reads destroy target creature planeswalker this may seem plain but it is a no restrictions removal that even hits Planeswalkers hits black and artifact creatures well the double black is a bit tricky for three color and up decks I would still run it as there are too many times where you just need a creature or a planeswalker to die to removal number two is a special one in that it is - no it's not a tie it's a combo this may be my most controversial pick and I can already hear the disagreement and hopefully debate now but I feel very strongly that most commander decks really need to have an option for a combo win in there somewhere and in black that combo win is the classic and must run exquisite blood + sanguine bond exquisite blood reads whenever an opponent loses life you gain that much life and sanguine bond reads whenever you gain life target opponent loses that much life so this two card combo can end the game and I strongly believe that if you were in black you should be running this look sure you couldn't do something like play wound reflection and Chao how done plus full rafts stronghold and throw in a temporal extortion but look let's be honest that's a stretch of a combo and a lot of black combos are either several pieces that need to be slowly assembled or they involve artifacts - enough of a degree that cards I'd recommend aren't really in the best and black but exquisite blood + sanguine bond or the quintessential black combo and what's more both these cards are excellent in isolation of one another so unlike a lot of other combos even if you never get both pieces together having only one is still great advantage but what's the number one black must run staple it's not too fancy it's not a game winner by itself it's a workhorse far too often forgotten but if you are in black be it mono or two or even all five colors it's hard to justify not running a copy I may be the prickly professor but your deck means a demonic tutor demonic tutor one generic in a black first sorcery search your library for a card any card put that card into your hand then shuffle your library this is the superlative tutor the one all others turn to and then water themselves down from get the answer you need the combo piece you want the creature you desire the spell you crave for just one and a black reveal it to no one and put it in your hand if you'd like to copies of this card diabolic intent does the exact same thing but it will also cost you a creature the closest there is to a superior tutor spell I suppose would be vampiric tutor as it only costs one black mana and is an instant speed but it does cost to life and instead of placing the needed card in your hand puts it on top of your deck now if you have ways to draw card at instant speed as well diabolic can help out in times when a sorcery just lacks the speed but when it comes to the single-most run black staple for commander the single must have the OG demonic tutor is head and shoulders and horns the card to have so strike back with these eight cards in black but now I want to hear from you what black cards that I did not list do you feel our top must run staples of the color let me know in the comments below program was made possible thanks
