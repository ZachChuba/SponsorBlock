hey everybody I know it's been a few months since I've uploaded and in that time I've actually received more messages than I thought I would asking where the series has been or if it would be coming back and to that everybody on screen right now I just say thank you it means a lot to hear that you're actually interested in the episode and without further ado let's carry on wait where the hell am i this is no winter not my own knowledge of the game one that capitalized on more than just quests all right we last left off starting Merlin's crystal and now we're headed to do a sweep through catherby to get a few things done first off when entering town we're gonna purchase a Kindle from the shop to satisfy a kinder or an easy die requirement however note that you could also do this later on when getting a black camel for Merlin's crystal now south to the docks and talk to our hime to continue Merlin's crystal then further south to the charter ship to purchase a bucket of sand and soda ash to make molten glass for the observatory quest later back north past the bank and pick up an insect repellent then south east to the fishing shop to purchase whatever code that we need I'm choosing to buy a big net for 20 coins right now in order to fish a mackerel to the south for another Kenda or an easy diet requirement but be done at another time later on after getting the mackerel it's north to the tunnel entrance to start the fishing contest quest before heading back to the bank keep out only the insect repellent and bucket and then head west out of town to the apiary and flax fields pick up the bucket at side the fence then use the insect repellent on the beehives we're here to get two buckets wax want to make the black camel from Roland's crystal in a bit and one for shoulder oh man it's way way later on now further west into the flecks fields to fill out a Natori with flax picking five will satisfy yet another kind-- are an easy diet requirement but the main reason we're here is for the crafting experience continuing on after getting the first inventory of flax before spinning it detour to the church beyond the yew trees and play the organ in order to satisfy the fourth or fifth can't are an easy diet requirement of this video already now seven more inventories or about two hundred more bow strings until we're done okay time to pause and recap a bit in the last few videos we focused on doing quests that rewarded crafting experience goblin diplomacy missile and mystery dwarf cannon and murder mystery which just pushed us past level 10 crafting so we'd be able to crack bow strings right now for a few big reasons the biggest one is that we need crafting to be level 30 in order to use the already easy diary lay upon it herb lore would be a better option but that won't even be close to 30 for some time and XP Lance can't be banked level 30 crafting also allows us to do elemental workshop to which we'll start when we do the dig site quest so we also need level 20 crafting to be able to do element workshop but we're here in Sears and because of that we'll be picking spinning around eight inventories of flax to be able to get to the point where we can not only do a little workshop one but that finishing the quest alongside the observatory quest will bump us up to exactly level 30 crafting other Eleonora shop one will also get us past 30 smithing which requires required for elemental workshop - there we go 200 one of those strings and exactly one bowstring under level 20 crafting we've had a few miscellaneous sources of crafting experience along the way like cutting gems or polishing buttons and a ham hi so there's a bit of variance now we're gonna prepare for the fishing contest grab your coins garlic pull red vine burns and contest pass and then head southwest to the gate north of the fishing yield uh you know what I'm gonna grab this glass blowing pipe continue the fishing contest quest up until the point of completion but don't turn it in yet now back to serious to do elemental workshop one note that if you don't yet have the battered book grab it from the bookshelf in the house with the garlic on the way back to the bank read the book then use a knife or slash weapon on it to get the workshop key all right now time to prepare for elemental workshop pull out the key for coal a hammer a pickaxe and now we have these steel pickaxe as well as some food cakes and wine should be able to do it as well as here magic gear fire staff instructions a needle thread and a knife a laundry list I know I know if you don't have a needle I believe you can final an inside the workshop now here's where I tried to do some testing that unfortunately didn't work out I had hoped that the furnace he used in the workshop to smelt the elemental bar would act as regular furnace allowing me to smelt the molten glass with the observatory quest sadly it does not and it only works for elemental bars so I'll have to home teleport to love bridge or something later on to smelt the glass also bring the book I didn't bring the book thinking I only needed it to get the key however you do need the book on you to Smith the shield whilst in the workshop you technically only need to kill the earth elemental to get the elemental or however to satisfy you another easy diary task we need to kill all four of them I tried to find a safe spot for each one however there don't seem to be any and since we only have level 1 defense and they hit relatively hard I tried to flinch them which worked well enough note that for the rock elementals you actually have to kill both types the rock form and walking form the rock form only works for the quest and the walking form only works for the direitos boom finish elemental workshop 1 getting us a solid 5 K crafting and smithing experience bumping us up to 28 crafting and 32 smithing once we go get the molten glass and Lumbridge we'll continue on with the Observatory quest get 30 crafting then do plague city and biohazard to finish off our first diary section moving on let's pull out all our mind there runes to get another free set of 30 from the tutor while we're lumbridge grab the sand soda ash bronze bar 3 points and some food 8 cakes is probably good you'll want some lightweight defense gear like I have a red cape no ma'am EULA and leather body maybe a ring of life that could be helpful and then we will home teleport to Lumbridge refill prayer get the starter runes and smelt the glass before using the minigame teleport to castle wars and once there let's head north to do the observatory quest from start to finish before entering the dungeon pick up at least one more super anti poison one as there are poison spiders in the dungeon ok so unfortunately I did something wrong and the last recording I did didn't save somewhere there's an hour and 41 minute OBS recording I can't find I don't know if it's saved due to not enough space on the hard drive or whatever so let's catch you all up on what's happened since then I completed the Observatory quest bumping us up to 30 crafting for my astrological sign after the quest I believe I got a maple longbow but I'll have to check I had been completed plague city netting us 2.4 km mining experience and allowing the start of biohazard which I've only done a couple steps of so far during plague City I turned in the grown cat for 100 death runes then after the quest took a detour aim chronicled to the champions guild to pick up a new cat so that by the time I finished the diary I'll be able to or almost be able to trade in the next one for 200 with luck we'll have more than a thousand by the time we can actually use them starting with wind blast at 41 match then thanks to the fishing levels from the sea slug quest I was able to minigame teleport to the fishing trawler to satisfy both the Tyndall merchant tasks of the EZ Rd diary the one that requires the rusty swords we got from thieving ham members as well as the diary test that requires taking a trip on the fishing trawler note that you will have to pick up your cat and you only need to start the minigame you don't actually have to complete it and upon finishing that the only task we've got left is to enter the training camp which requires completing biohazard our next step mom's laid tail okay so I know I did it as a joke for the intro but seriously why am I here I last uploaded a video four months ago and last played recorded that footage five months ago and I honestly don't know why I met elemental wizards I logged in here and I had a gas mask and a chronicle on and boots of lightness so it looks like I home teleported to leverage for strike runes and I clearly did the timber merchants task since I stole the swords and although I just mentioned that I got a new cat I apparently did not or I banked it because I don't have one so just to make sure and see if I do have a cat I'm going to head to Draenor bank and if I do not have a cat I will probably just run up to Gertrude's but I am going to buy some probably to Chronicle cards as well okay so I got the cat all right I don't know I didn't have it out oh it's because I had to go on the fishing trawler boat and you can't take the cat there and so I put it into the deposit box recapping a bit I need to do biohazard as I did not do the part inside west rd before it sends me down to Remington however also what I forgot to do before I left catherby is continue Merlin's crystal so I've only done up to the point where we talked to our Hein but what I need to do is get up to the point where the Lady of the lake wants me to meet her in Port Sarim so we're going to go to Artie now and then afterwards we are going to go to catherby before continuing on with biohazard and yeah as I mentioned before here is the maple longbow that I got from the observatory quest okay for plague city we only need one birdseed in one birdcage you can see that I've got five here but we actually need five more for one small favor later on so ignore that now I don't find that until later so let's fishing trawler teleport to the fishing trawler run north west to Artie and continue the quest okay so I got the first random event on the account that teleports me somewhere and I found out that you wouldn't lock all the music tracks for each location when you visit one I think that's pretty cool makes it easier for music gay people so you're not just standing around trying to wait for a random event from the event itself we got a sweet v cut rubies which is always nice could have been amrold sir sapphires but still free if I recall although I found conflicting information online in the past you couldn't teleport with them but looking at the wiki it says nothing about them breaking when teleporting until you go to the specific plague sample item page and then it mentions it so I'm not gonna mess around but what I learned was when Corsair Cove was created there is now a doc and Remington and you can take a ship to heartily so we're gonna do that and then immediately take the ship back so that we can go continue Merlin's crystal because we'll be back in Port Sarim again pretty soon oh and in fact now here's a perfect time if you happen to not have gotten the papyrus before you can just buy it now that's for the golden quest coming up okay now that we've given them the vials we need to head back to our doom and I actually should have put the plague sample in the bank because if I do teleport with that it will get broken so we want to bank it until we go to Barack where we can then fill it out of me now that we are back in our going we need to run all the wet catherby to continue Merlin's crystal because I forgot to do that before which I have updated and written into my route alright so back in catherby we need to prepare to continue Merlin's crystals so we have to get out our fight gear kill Mordred he does hit a max of 5 I believe so bring some cakes and wines whatever you prefer and kill him to continue the quest and if you're like me and you somehow do something wrong you'll have to kill him twice run down and out the front door because we need to kill a bat for its bat bones for part of the quest later and might as well safespot it and we need to go straight west and talk to Sherlock which will satisfy yet another easy diary tasks then we're gonna head back to the candle shop so we can trade the bucket wax for a black candle alright so now we need to head to varrock there's a few ways we could do that there's the chronical Lumbridge home teleport than canoe but i'm actually going to use the first of my law runes and teleport there because i don't feel like running once at vorak we need to head to the east bank and prepare to continue biohazard we need to pull out the touch paper and plague sample and then head south first head past the gate and all the way to the chaos temple to the south to continue Merlin's crystal by checking the altar then back north through the gate continue biohazard up until the point of heading back to our doing and then on your way back to the bank steal a cup of tea or pick one up for the dig site quest which will be coming up in just a bit alright now it's time to head back to our tea via the Edgeville lever in order to finish biohazard and the RT easy diary task since i'm heading through bar village what i wish i would have done was pull out soft clay to create a bowl just satisfy a task as well as a fly-fishing rod and some feathers to fish some trout for another task plus we need some trout for death plateau and to feed our cat so that would have been great but i didn't think about them till I ran past them so we'll have to make a quick detour for those too but that's fine because I still need to finish the bottom floor of the strong little security for a medium diary task all right now what we need to do is go talk to Ellen uh then talk to the king and we finished biohazard get three quest points an additional 1250 thieving experience now it's time to go enter the combat training camp which satisfies the final easy diary tasks for our towing and now we're gonna go get the Cape yeah yeah everything's coming together we got the Cape each cat's worth 200 death runes we have this lamp that we can use on crafting which bumps us up to 31 only 410 experience away from 32 which puts us at less than 10 levels away from being it will make the fishing bowl for the another kind-- are an easy diary as well as the pirate Pete sub quest of RFD plus we have a teleport over to the kinder and are doing whatever area now due to the Cape all right so now it's time to prepare for the dig site quest so let's head across the log balance to the north arty Bank pull out the boots of lightness our two cape and axe some cakes and a chronicle or varrock teleport to save some time home teleport to lumbridge take the canoe to the champions guild and since we haven't done it yet and we have 32 quest points we can go inside and start Dragon Slayer after that we're gonna run east and south to jump over the agility shortcut for the alum be easy diary and then we're going to continue on to the exam center to do the dig site quest we're gonna start the dig site quest and then before leaving we're going to check the furthest northeast bookshelf for the book that starts elemental workshop to read the book and a scroll will pop out you want to keep both the book and the scroll if you drop the book you will not be able to progress with the quest now let's go back to Varrick and continue the quest I could run but I'm gonna use the first of my Lorentz to teleport because I'm feeling a little lazy back in maroc we're gonna head northeast to the museum to continue the quest if desired we could buy a newspaper for 50 points in the square in order to satisfy a diary task that will be in vara many times later on so that could be done whenever afterwards head back to the east bank and prepare for the rest of the quest we're gonna need two ropes pestle and mortar a vile tinderbox the cup of tea some food leather boots and leather gloves and it desired some varrock teleport runes or the chronicle to get back to reduce some walking time but it's honestly not that far of a walk let's head back to the big site to finish up the quest alright so when we get to the panic section of the dig site quest there's a few things we got to do here so one is get the special cup to continue the quest two is to get an uncut opal also for the quest which drops or pans at a thirty one at a 450 rate which is six point nine percent nice but we can also get uncut Jayde's which are at a twenty seven over for fifteen percent chance which is like six percent so I don't know why they're different that's just what the wiki says and the Jade's which we could have gotten from thieving ham members unfortunately I think mine got crushed or didn't get me we need those four necklaces of passage to speed up the golem and shadow with a storm quest so I am going to pan for maybe five to seven minutes until I get enough okay I ended up going a little bit longer here because I wanted to get six nuggets because you can trade in three nuggets for a gold or at the exam center so I just figured since I have five might as well try to get the six and despite the drop chance for opals and Jade's being around six percent I'm overflowing with gems here I do have some oyster pearls as well but I ended up dropping those because they're virtually useless but I just have a crap ton of opals that I can use for who knows what at this point I'll likely make one or two expeditious bracelets but as I'm not doing a lot of slang for a while it'll likely be some combination of amulets of bounty and dodging necklaces which will come in handy a lot sooner oh my god I forgot a vial okay pretend you didn't see that Hey look at that now we have a vial funny how that works huh let's continue on and finish the quest okay now at the been sifting stage of the quest we need to get three charcoal one is for the quest one is for the goblin sub quest of RFD and one is for desert treasure make sure that when you get the charcoal for the dig site quest that you use it on your pestle mortar immediately otherwise if you use it while you have all three in or in your inventory it will try to grind all three all right turning the quest gives us two quest points two gold bars 15 points 3km mining experience which bumps us up to 36 and to Kerrville or experience bumping us up to 17 almost 18 also we can use our nuggets on the archeological expert to trade three of them for one gold or each so that's two free ish gold ore alright now back to varrock this time I'm just going to run before heading to the museum I'm going to stop at the east bank so that I can empty my inventory because we're going to do some cleaning fines so that we can get enough kudos to finish that diary task alright time to head up to the museum when talking to the curator remember that you have to go through the entire dialogue where he asks you about a food or drink option if you ended early after giving him the certificates he won't give you anything and you'll have lost the certificates alright so now we need to get fifty kudos we have 28 from doing the quiz on the bottom floor however there are 50 available kudos from cleaning clients after doing the dig site quest that we can do in order to get the 50 we need it shouldn't take too long to get all five so I might just end up doing that anyway what's nice is that in a relatively recent update they made it so that you can have an entire inventory of fines when you clean them as opposed to doing it I don't remember one at a time even so that should speed things up quite a bit boom look at that in the first inventory we already got three out of the five possible finds we can get and got us past the 50 kudos we need talk to the curator to satisfy the 50 kudos requirement and then you can talk to the information clerk in the northwest corner on the same floor and after 51 kudos she'll give you 1,000 mining experience I believe after a hundred one or so she'll give prayer crafting or whatnot but that'll be quite a ways away you know what I'm going to do one if not two maybe three more inventories of these cleaning finds as you get a little bit of cash and on top of that there is a chance I think to in 195 so it's like 1.02 percent of getting a antique lamp that gives 500 experience if I get one of those I would use it on herblore although an alternative would be to use it on Hunter to get to level 15 so we can finish off our Pisco Ilyas favor once we do queen of Thieves which is actually coming up pretty soon however we only need to catch like 34 weasels to get to level 15 hunters so I think we'll just keep using it on herb-lore see would you look at that there's a genie lamp you know what that means free 500 herb low experience alright after three inventories it looks like we got everything oh wait nope there's one more I'll do one more inventory and if we get it we get it and if we don't we don't boom got the clean necklace I think that's a one in 51 chance or something and once we eventually get level 49 magic weaken and chant the necklace and turn it into a dig site pendant that'll let us teleport - yeah the dig site once we're done with that it's time to home teleport to Lumbridge to start another cook's quest and then the first sub quest of recipe for disaster thanks for watching everybody see you next time [Music]
