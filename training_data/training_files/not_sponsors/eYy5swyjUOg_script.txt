the dragon hunter lance melee's answer to the dragon hunter crossbow causing 20 more damage and accuracy against dragons and draconic creatures but costing 83 mil is it worth selling your bank to buy one let's find out so let's start the four hours and with a quick free teleport to typhon through the mini game teleporter we can get ourselves to the dungeon super quickly luckily there is also an altar so we're gonna have unlimited prayer in here which is really nice just in this corner here there's just two baby red spawns and the big ones can't get us at all obviously this is gonna do absolute work to them so we really don't need to worry like three hit that one um and yeah we're only gonna need a few kills here probably an inventory or so we'll pick up the bones obviously that's how we're making our money go and selling the ge and we should be sorted to go ahead and grab ourselves a decent amount of stuff to kill some better dragons while i kill be waiting for you up in the top corner on top of every kill being worth 720 gp we also have a one in 80 chance of a 43k drop in the grubby key so there is always that chance as well okay coming up to the last kill of the inventory here and we'll do a quick price check to see how much we have total and we have a 20k in 10 minutes very very nice now luckily i actually have the ancient spellbook at the moment which means i can get straight over to edgeville first thing i'm going to go ahead and do is buy a black dragon hide body for 7.7 k very nice i'm gonna get ourselves a battlefront teleport because that will take us right to mount carolyn let's get a teleport back as well to varrock need a little bit of money left over actually so that we can buy the butterstone as well now i'm hoping this body is going to provide enough defensive bonuses that i can just protect from melee and they won't do too much damage to me with their magic attacks but we will see let's go ahead and chuck this in the one thing is we are going to hit hard because we are going to get this bonus from the dragon hunter lance now which is really really nice why are we not attacking there we go looking like we're holding up at the moment which is nice to see there we go first kill no damage taken very nice indeed what's the drop going to be it is lagging out there we go oh we get a bit of food back worm bones on their own without any other drop is gonna be worth 1.3 k really nice very nice passive little uh red dehyde upgrade and that is gonna give us more magic defense which means less damage taken but to be fair the body was doing absolute work on its own that is going to be 11 killed and 25k nearly 26k uh i'm gonna have to do that to be honest we're gonna have to get rid of corrupt one i'm gonna bang the telly i think we've uh made enough money here to start looking pretty good and go to blue dragons so let's sell all of these for 14 13k very nice let's sell the red d-hard chaps that we got we actually got the other ones we're wearing we got two of those so let's go ahead and sell those let's buy a black d hide legs and some vams as well get ourselves an anti dragon fire shield and let's get ourselves a glory as well on top of that very very nice we are looking a lot better than we were before with the rest of the money i'm gonna chuck it into house teleports i would expect anyone who has 92 mil to have a fairly decent poh so we are going to be using the poh facilities here grab ourselves four of those and the rest of the money we will just sit on and i'm pretty happy with that let's go kill some blue dragons here we are at the blue dragons already very close to the bank let's chuck that on and probably get a few kills here while flicking etc and then probably buy some prayer pots next so we don't have to worry about flicking constantly but as you can see this is just ridiculous ridiculous even in this gear how quickly we're just gonna kill these blue dragons it's just mental i don't know how long that kill took but there's the first one and we are going to get ourselves 4.18k for that just realized i was praying mage for that first kill as well so that was a bit dumb second kill gives us an addy full helm so there's a little bit more defensive gear just passively which is nice that is gonna be an inventory lesson learned i do not need to bring karatbars with me let's go ahead and sell all of this off very nice 30k and get ourselves a room full home but how much is a nature's not 55k i might do one more trip and get the uh the natives not okay there we go that is another trip completed and i think we're gonna have more than enough for a nezi now uh thinking about moving on to some brutal blacks i don't know how viable that's gonna be but i think we'll give it a go just to see okay so we've got 74k to spend gonna obviously buy that nezzy for 55k and there we go there is the nezi upgrade spending 10k on a super combat to try and be as efficient as possible and i think the rest is going to have to go into food here now we don't seem to be hitting very well unfortunately but we do have an altar right above us so there's no need to like go anywhere we can sort of just camp it here and there's also a bank really close which does give this a lot of advantages but when we do hit we do hit high and with each kill being worth 28k on average that is huge there we go first kill oh yes that's what you want to see that's exactly what you want to see i'm going to get my prayer back but that first kill was worth 45k guys which is literally almost the helmet is not straight back a lot quicker of a second kill nowhere near as good loot unfortunately but i think the first kill was just like freakishly long i don't think it was actually a true reflection of how good this is actually gonna be for this account right now oh nice drop with the lava scales they're worth a decent amount let's have a quick look uh 17k just on the lava scales very very nice so three brutal black dragon kills have made me 88k and we can definitely go for another one maybe another two or three actually this is gonna be a tight one i'm out of food 51 hp it does hit like 29s which is pretty [ __ ] brutal but we are gonna get the kill there what are we gonna get let's have a look and some soul runes not the best but 126k is what the loot track is saying let's go ahead and sell this and see what we've got oh 125k very nice just quickly popped over to adi and got myself an arty cloak just a free upgrade that we could uh grab which was nice next upgrade i think is going to be uh some barriers gloves which is going to cost us 130k so we're actually really not far off at all another really close one there but we did just manage to get it and we get more room plate legs that's exactly what we wanted to see out of food almost out of prayer but we did get it let's go ahead and sell this off there we go all of that being sold off and taking us to 210k which means we can now go and get the big upgrade of the barrows gloves right let's go ahead and buy them for 130k that is a huge chunk of our money but look at the attack bonuses 12 and then we also get the melee strength of 12 as well a few defensive bonuses as well that is so so lovely getting the barrels gloves on the account now i want to go for dragon boots and the tazar shield and then i genuinely think we could be ready to kill vorkath like probably two and a half hours left of time i think we could be at warcats so uh let's go to the g buy some food get everything set up probably do a few more brutal black dragons because they're just such good money like you can't really beat them for how chill they are as well and the gear we're currently in like wow also gonna go ahead and upgrade the food to sharks just because we're making so much money now i might as well bring as much extra food as i possibly can i did look at manta rays but they are just so expensive that i can't quite justify it biggest drop so far a dragon long sword very very nice kill after has just upped it guys to the dragon dart tips for 124k just in the draw i can't even pick everything up at the moment that's how well we are doing i'm going to drop a couple sharks just to make sure i get them right that is going to be that trip over i have so much leftover food we're just having to drop everything to be honest to accommodate for all of the loot that we've got but this should be a pretty nice haul of loot so let's go ahead chuck all of that in here we go 321 k dragon boots can we afford them that's the question yes we can and we got them on the cheap as well well by two coins lovely let's go ahead and sell these boots off we do not need those anymore beautiful dragon boots on the account oh my god we are starting to look very very tasty an hour and 12 minutes in oh we just got it again that is such a lovely drop to get ended up getting two kills there which is really nice that is naughty that is such a naughty drop let's uh fire on over and sell oh that's huge and the dragon head as well lovely let's see how much we're gonna get here 350 we could definitely get some tall rag legs with that let's buy those 240k yes very nice which means we can go ahead and sell these off so about an hour and a half in now i might have guessed it a little bit with being able to go to vorkath i don't know if we can go to warcap in this i feel like giving it a go we've got 100k so if i do die i can get all the stuff back yeah [ __ ] it let's do it oh my god i just came back to do just a couple more trips so that we had enough for vorkath completely yet another dragon dart tip drop i think that was back to back after completing the haunted mine quest you get the salve amulet which you can just go and get um similarly to how we went and got the the arnie cloak so it's super easy to go and get and then if we use this on there we have south e which again the tans diary you just head on over to the tonsler and get it i'd expect everyone to have this in their bank anyways seeing as it isn't untradeable so we're going to go bank this might as well sell this glory now because we don't really need that with getting those dart tips we can afford the tazar shield as well so if we buy that we've got 28k to spend in supplies that's going to give us a strength bonus and pretty good range defense as well turns out i don't actually quite have enough supplies to be able to go and kill vorkats so i think i need one or two more kills um over at brutal blacks and then we'll be ready to go okay so here we go nearly two hours gone and this is the setup we've gone for got the super combat the extended super anti the two restores an anti-venom uh the crumble undead for the little uh spawn and we're looking pretty good here i think we will get this kill i actually don't have a 100k in the bank we've only got 15k so if we die i do lose all of this and i won't be able to unlock it which would be horrible because we'll have to go back and start what we did at the start but i think we can get the the vocab kill here drink that bang the super combat and do we hit no we do not i think i'm gonna keep on piety for the whole kill as well turn run off yes we are hitting we are hitting that's what we want to see yeah we've got enough um we've got enough what's it called with 32 wow we've got enough prayer to be absolutely fine i think i'm going to stay at high hp here because i do not want to die usually just a death really doesn't matter but right now with losing all my stuff that would be pretty [ __ ] horrible to be honest probably a good idea to set these up as well we are hitting nicely which is lovely to see because that was one thing i was worried about and we don't seem to be taking too much damage either and yeah everything seems pretty okay actually which i'm really really surprised about i thought the di body would really let me down because i looked at the wiki and it did not recommend everything it recommended was like tank body but uh this seems to be okay i think it's only going to be one killer trip maybe two but uh as of right now with a with under 100k in the bank i do not want to be risking it there we go a lot of damage taken i don't think two of kills is gonna be possible but there we go 92k from the first kill which is actually slightly less than average from forecast but i'll take it well telly home and i can sort of upgrade my stuff a little bit more so i'm not sat here with like one doses and stuff and try and maybe go to the manta rays see if we can get two kill trip okay the inventory setup is looking a lot lot nicer right now let's uh drink that and hopefully get a quicker kill and hopefully having the manta rays means we can grab a two kill trip because that is really what we need to see because obviously we are on the timer and we want to see how much money we can make and running back and forth to the ge definitely is not very efficient okay so we definitely got enough food what's let me down is the fact i don't have enough crumble undeads for next kill so we are gonna have to go back 17 diamonds uh that is a kill worth yeah not bad over 100k over 100k i think we will take our time just have a quick look at this um yeah we need more crumble on dead spells because i just don't have enough 112k there we go yeah it just wasn't enough i can't go in because if he throws three at me i'm pretty much dead and i need to buy some more house teles anyway but you know what for cath definitely doable guys if you are enjoying the video please drop a like on the video it really helps thank you there's the kill it felt like a pretty slow one not gonna lie three minutes 30 but a decent drop to be fair 176k and we are set up for a second kill so let's give this a go there we go the two kill trip [ __ ] me that was a slow one oh very nice though very very nice three minutes 45 seconds to get the kill there let's uh let's have a look at how much we made from this trip alone 381k that's huge oh that's a really nice kill i think it's quicker than any of the ones we've done oh it's not actually 327 just use hardly any food at all really really happy with that and uh we got dragon dart tips again which seem to be our best friend when it comes to the uh the dragons but uh back in for another one so the cash stacks looking pretty healthy at the moment so we're gonna go and get a tour right body for 200 and just over 215k apparently a little bit more expensive than i thought it was going to be but luckily we do have that huge cash stack there we go very nice and that is just like the defensive bonuses on that compared to the black dehydra just huge 60s 70s wow that is going to mean we take far less damage from vorkath also i'm gonna fill the ring slot with the granite ring it's only 24k and it does give that range bonus of eight and a few other defensive bonuses as well too and everything as soon as we don't have a ring at all we might as well do that and i'll get a blessing as well already about 10 11k as well there we go nice just to fill the slots so this is how we're looking two and a half hours in i don't think that's very bad at all the defensive bonuses are through the roof now all in the 300s and with the salve helping us we are really hitting vorkath pretty decently as well so let's see if we can go for a three kill trip now that was so slow that was ridiculous four minutes kill the issue is we're tanky we can definitely tank it but there's just not enough dps coming out of this because we're pretty much fully relying on the lance to do everything that we needed to do and it's just not it's just not matching up to it you know unfortunately there's the two kill trip and horrible horrible four minutes 25 kill yeah it's it's it's disgusting now i know earlier i said the ring slot was going to be super hard to upgrade but actually we can go ahead and get the uh trees in this ring and that way we're gonna get a stab bonus um in defense and attack obviously with the uh dragon hunter lance being a stab weapon that is super useful so we'll chuck that on and we will sell the granite ring hey we got our first under three minute kill look how much food i had left as well that's after a double kill so i think i probably need to bring one more prayer pot because i could have definitely done a third kill here so one more pot few more runes and we should be good for some three kill trips here we just smashed the previous pv that we had and we've taken it down to two minute 14 now so uh the setup's starting to come through there it is guys the triple kill and we actually got a decent amount of loot from this as well we got the dragon battle axe we got the roon kite shields let's get this all together because we're definitely not going to get another kill and we'll see how much this three kill trip got us a massive 454k trip but yeah very happy with that we're just looking for a rare a unique and then that will really tip off how well this accounts done so we've got 25 minutes left and actually we have enough money to go ahead and sell the ring okay looks like we're going to take a bit of a loss on this but obviously that is just because we're doing the video within this time frame there we go and we can go and get ourselves a berserker ring now now obviously in an ideal world you would have this imbued but we're going off the fact that you know it's slightly lower level to count if you were going to do this and you might not have the imbued so we are just going to go with a normal berserker ring here but obviously if you have the points you would use it to uh do the berserker ring over at nightmare zone but that will give us another max hit which is really nice 24 minutes left can't really see too many upgrades coming uh a cert vc would have been nice but it's about four mil at the moment so that's not looking too promising and the rest is all you know if i want to upgrade the top and the body we're looking at bandos which is you know in the in the 10 20 million sort of range and we're definitely not making that in 24 minutes unless we get done lucky dragon plate skirt coming in not a bad drop at all um and we're actually gonna go for a four kill trip here guys we're going for the four kill trip so we need an under three minute kill really but it would be nice to get ourselves a four kill trip and there it is guys the four kill trip the b ring just feels like it helped out massively i don't know if we just got a fairly lucky trip here or not but the berserker ring feels like a huge huge upgrade there we go guys three kill trip one minute left dragon dart tips is the final drop not bad no uniques no crazy drops throughout the whole of the four hours but we will go ahead and sell all of this off now and uh i'll come up with all the items that we bought and our final loot and how much money we made in the four hours from scratch with just the dragon hunter lance okay so we made four point five five one mil um we also had the barrows guns which were 130k so if we chuck that on 4.6 nearly 4.7 mil which let's be honest that is over one mil an hour starting from nothing that first hour i don't know how much i made that's incredible i'm actually really really impressed by that without any huge drops nothing too crazy i'd say the dragon dart tips were probably the best thing i had all uh episode because we got quite a few of those i think i got a little bit lucky on those but a really really nice haul there i really enjoyed doing this one item thing so if you've got an item that you think is a really good idea and we could just start with it from scratch the best comment the one that gets the most up votes i will give you a shout out and we'll go ahead and do a video on it so if you've got a good item drop it down in the comment section i would appreciate it guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to like and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll catch you in the next one you
