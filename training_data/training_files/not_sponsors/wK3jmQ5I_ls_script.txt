2400 documentaries for free for 31 days link in the description welcome thank you so much for joining me I'm Rene Richey and this is vector despite the usual doom and gloom reporting that we got leading up to Apple's q3 2019 financial results or stock manipulation depending on your point of view the company managed to largely beat expectations but not escape the doom and gloom at least not entirely I get that there are people and press that are glass-half-empty and some like myself who tend towards glass-half-full but increasingly all we're seeing his glass smashed and all that tasty beverage spilled out all over the table that's just a waste of good beverage iPhone revenue was down 12 percent year-over-year but the act of install base those billion phones in our pockets y'all was up thanks to switchers upgraders and new customers alike Mac and iPad were both up services revenue which includes Apple music and Apple care was up 13% wearables which includes Apple watch air pods and beats was up 50% so what's the problem well depending on how you tilt your head and squint factoring in seasonality and a myriad of other factors for the first time since 2012 the iPhone accounted for less than half of apples revenue and where Apple was previously accused of being far too dependent on iPhone sales now going beyond the iPhone is seen as just as worrisome and troubling the age of iPhone is over or the post iPhone age is just beginning since then there's been just so much noise and so much dumb I just wanted to do something smart so I got analyst Neal SCI part of above Avalon on the line to help us sort it all out yeah I think what tends to happen is a lot of the earnings previews that are out there they focus on just a few big numbers and so they'll maybe look at iPhone revenue and they'll see that it's down and that's about the extent and the rest of the article is trying to explain why is it down and what is Apple trying to do in response and I think in reality when you take a closer look at the result and you look out K what's going on with the wearables business what's going on with services even what's going on with the iPad and Mac which are surprisingly showing quite a bit of stabilization especially for the iPad that's when you get a different picture I think you get a more detailed overview of what's really going on and you'll find there's a lot more moving pieces at play and I do tend to think some of the narratives that are out there they're off the mark because they're not able to capture all of those moving pieces so when people start to talk about we're entering the post iPhone age does that resonate with you and if so what is what are they trying to say by that yeah I think a lot of the post iPhone narrative is about where will Apple turn to next for growth or where will they generate revenue going forward and in that respect I think it's logical that a lot of people are making that claim for this quarter simply because of what's going on we have the nod iPhone part of the business doing well in the iPhone business struggling in terms of growth and what happened was each basically offset each other I tend I think a little bit differently though about this narrative post iPhone II or I go back to when Apple began to working on different product categories like wearables I'm like revamping the content distribution arm that started a while ago Apple watch launched 2015 we have ear pods out for a couple years now so I think this past quarter it wasn't the start of some new era at Apple some new post iPhone period I think it's just the latest sign of what Apple has been working toward and so what you see Happel doing is saying well here are additional devices that you will likely enjoy so much that you're willing to pay for and here are additional services as well as Apple wants to control a little bit more about what we do on those devices so it's it's one thing just to have more than 1.4 billion devices but we're doing a lot of on host devices we're giving those devices more of our time throughout the day and apples starting to say themselves we think there's some areas for us to play a bigger role in how you use those devices so I think you're starting to see there's certain metrics that I follow maybe you could look at average revenue per user and you're looking at the entire Apple install base then you could break that down into just the iPhone users or maybe just people who enter the Apple ecosystem through the gray market so maybe they bought and used or refurbished iPhone what you're seeing Apple do is launch all these new products and services and I think people are slowly or maybe gradually becoming more engaged with the ecosystem and that is something that we're seeing play out quarter after quarter again it's not something that you're gonna see all at once but maybe over the span of two or three years it's gonna add up and I think that's what's happening with wearables and also services so when you look at the iPhone business now and you sort of look ahead into the near-term future where do you see it I think the big issue with the iPhone right now is that people are holding on to their devices longer and it's not too surprising because as a new iPhone comes out I think in some ways it's handling our use cases it's doing a much better job at handling our current use cases and so whereas a couple years ago maybe we have the tendency of going out and upgrading every year or two on average it's it's longer and so you're seeing that play out from a unit sales perspective and I think the other issue here which is a little bit harder to gauge is the global economy and where you have foreign currency impacting prices and so on on one hand in the u.s. we're sort of familiar of iPhone prices and and we everyone focuses on say the thousand dollar iPhone but in many countries the prices have been much higher and so I do think that has played a role in people saying well wait a second I'm probably not going to upgrade my iPhone this year the price is now the certain level and so you're seeing Apple do things like price cuts outside the US really just to try to bring that pricing back to levels that here in the US were used to they're also doing a little bit more in a way or a lot more in the way of kind of juicing those trade ins and so we know that a lot of people buying iPhone in 2019 they have an iPhone already and so what do you do with that iPhone trade it in Annapolis trying to make it seem like okay well if you trade it in the price for the new one is a lot lower and so I think what's happening is you're seeing demand actually improve it's still down unit sales my estimate is it's probably down around between five and ten percent on a sell-through basis but I do think that's actually going to improve a little bit as we go forward for the next couple quarters you also have and this is just this is just an inevitable thing with financial modeling when you have a really bad corridor one year the next year it's an easier compare and so I think once you start into 2020 Apple is going to be facing that what was really a bad quarter in the first quarter and continue to the second quarter so it is possible that the iPhone business actually starts to stabilize a tad my estimates have iPhone revenue still down in 2020 but maybe not by much and again I'm not making too many claims in terms of a 5g iPhone causing a huge rush in upgrades I know some analysts like to still kind of push that the mega upgrade psycho I'm not one of those I I tend to think that we are simply going to hold on to these phones for longer as time goes on yeah but I think what ends up happening is just given the size of the install base even if the upgrade rate slows there's still a lot of people out there that are going to upgrade you have somewhere around what's my lay assessment something probably nine hundred twenty five million iPhones out in the wild that's a lot of people and so even if you assume okay the average person holds on to it three or four years that's gonna kick off a certain number of of upgrades every year regardless and so yes a lot of people made that they noticed this past quarter that the non-iphone business was actually more than the iPhone business it's a little bit trickier because the third quarter is typically the weakest for the iPhone business so that may not continue say next quarter or especially for the first quarter that's the big one for the iPhone but I think it's correct to look at that big picture and say yes you you start to see what's happening here and that is that newer product categories where Apple has been putting a lot of Rd and wearables content distribution services those are gaining momentum and with the iPhone business even if it stabilizes which i think is good for Apple you're still going to have that non iPhone business show stronger growth both in terms of the absolute dollars and the percentages so you could say that maybe this quarter was a peak of what we're probably going to expect going forward so where does the Mac then fit into this for you because Apple is relatively unique yet you know Microsoft was not able to create a new platform so they've had to bring Windows and the PC forward into the mobile age where Google never had a traditional computer platform and so they've started with Android and with Chrome and they exist fully in the modern mobile age where Apple has to straddle both worlds sometimes to the benefit and sometimes one against the other and yet the Mac still seems to be going strong for them right now it's been fascinating to see I think you could call it an evolution and how they're approaching the Mac there's a good amount of evidence to say that they've made some major changes to the way they're approaching a category in recent years I tend to think of the Mac as they want to position it as a content creation platform for use cases that may not have necessarily a home on something like the iPad which I do also think Apple's positioning over time as a content creation platform and so in some ways you see Apple they've decided that they're gonna push both the iPad and Mac at the same time push it forward and I think a couple years ago was a little bit different where I think Apple I I kind of describe it as they were pulling the product categories forward and the Mac was at the end of that rope and I think it was at risk of just kind of being kind of falling off the rope so I do think they're getting more aggressive that could be seen with more more of a sustained schedule for upgrades or updates I do think you're also going to see new models and so this idea of well maybe the iPad starts to eat a portion of the Mac again maybe a couple years ago that argument was stronger but now I do tend to believe them when they say that the Mac's future if you're a Mac user is looking brighter from my perspective the question is how do you grow the Mac install base and I do think that's more challenging for Apple I tend to think if you're comparing the Mac to iPad and iPhone there's really now there's not gonna be any catching up you're gonna have the iPhone at multiple times the size in terms of ecosystem in terms of install based versus the iPad and I do think the iPads going to be multiple times the size of the Mac but you know as you know as we saw at WWDC in that demo room they're clearly targeting the Mac not just at a portion of content creators but but a very very small portion these seems to push really hard on the mainstream at the expense of the very high-end pros and now it seems like they're focusing on their very high-end pros but I'm not sure what that means for the mainstream yet I think that I think that's totally right yeah and and I think that's the other thing when you look at the sales for the Mac those lower end models continue to sell really well and I think the most surprising thing about the Mac is about half of sales are going to people new to the map yeah and I hear from a lot of people who are longtime Mac users they're still using older devices they're out there using those older MacBook Pros and so if you do see Apple become aggressive with updates maybe you know kind of make some changes to the keyboard you could see even a surge of upgrades I'm gonna wait for the first analyst to say keyboard supercycle correct yeah all right so last question as you look into q4 and then beyond that q1 and you know potential devices from the September event maybe another October event new iPhones new iPads and you Apple watches what are you gonna be looking for I think when whenever you're looking at a new iPhone or you could say an Apple watch I'm always interested in is that new device better than last years of ice and I know better is a subjective subjective term but I'm thinking if you are using that newest iPhone and newest Apple watch do you still have an urge to go back and use an older model if the answer is no and that means that the newest iPhone the newest Apple watch is truly the best I think that's a very important thing and that tends to get lost in a lot of the financial discussion because everyone's focused on unit sales they're focused on upgrading but especially for the iPhone Apple is at that tricky point where you don't want to over serve users here and so we can even look at the camera a lot of people are satisfied with the camera that they have and so it's very interesting it's gonna be very interesting to see how do they go forward in terms of having new features bringing new technology that people say you know what I actually have a use for that in my life I think I may want that newest device it's gonna be easier to do with the Apple watch just because it's a newer product you're gonna see larger upgrades year-over-year so that that's the thing that I've been focusing on the iPhone in particular in recent years and then of course I am looking for those surprises and that is a do we see Apple expand the the wearables platform and would be a near term I'm primarily looking at I call the we're bull's eye I think of it as battles for real estate on our body and so the Smart Watch is a battle for real estate on our wrist wireless ear pods real estate and it for our ears it's possible that Apple will expand its product lineup for the year and then I think that's gonna be really interesting to consider when you're thinking of the wearables platform where all of these devices are coming together if you have an Apple watch are you a little bit more likely to buy that pair of wireless air pots I tend to think the answer is yes or maybe even right vice-versa if you have a wireless air pods you're more likely to buy another we're Bo's device so that's something I'm considering when the fall comes and you do have really extra traditionally apples product upgrade cycle trying to get everything ready for the holidays and and yeah and I do also think that my attentions gonna be on some of these new content distribution services there's still things that we don't know about Apple TV plus pricing the clues would suggest that they're they're gonna charge something I think there were some people thinking that how are they going to compete with something like Disney and all these other direct consumers streaming but anyone with catalog content right exactly I mean you're gonna have Apple come out with a pretty limited amount of content launch how is that going to impact pricing and I think the big question is do you see some type of bundle because right now if you are engaged in the Apple ecosystem you're starting to have a lot of Apple subscriptions here you know different renewal dates you got to keep track of everything that argument the case for an apple bundle is getting stronger where you just your whole family can subscribe to all of these different bundles you could throw in a discount in there too you know if you subscribe to multiple bundles so I would probably I will be watching that in the coming months to see if there's any clues and of course Apple arcade we don't have pricing for that you yeah so yeah as it stands now it's shaping up to be a pretty busy September into October and that's the other thing when you look at guidance for the first quarter let's see for the fourth quarter 2019 guidance was pretty decent so that would suggest that I think my estimate is Apple is probably expecting overall iPhone sales to be maybe down a little bit just by five percent of course the timing is a little bit different I mean last year you had one iPhone model launch in October that threw things off from the quarterly financial perspective but things do appear to be shaping up that you're gonna have a pretty decent September in terms of new products so so that I think a lot of people are probably gonna be waiting for that thanks again you'll really appreciate it you can find Neil at Neil side Bart on Twitter and subscribe to his site and newsletter at above Avalon and if
