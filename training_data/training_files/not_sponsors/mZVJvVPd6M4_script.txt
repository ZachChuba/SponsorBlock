my iPad has been my favorite productivity and organization too lately it's small enough to carry in my bag and it basically allows me to work anywhere I am as well as being a great tool to learn languages during my lunch break it also acts as a great overall organizational tool it's basically a planner calendar and a ball journal all in one and today I want to walk you through my favorite organization productivity apps and show you how I've been managing most of my projects before we start just a quick reminder that one not all the apps listed today are free if you're only interested in free apps I will link down below some videos I've created featuring free apps or apps with solid free versions and two of course that this is a 20-19 update of my favorite iOS apps which means that although some of these will be new to some of you I still work with most of my favorites so we can expect some repetition when comparing to previous versions of this video so the first app I want to show you is a new favourite of mine and it's time page by moleskin time page works is a calendar app that first of all has an incredibly stylish look and secondly uses a tiered interface to combine events Maps contacts and weather information in one place only it syncs with your Google or I calendars so there is no need to set up the app individually or worry about created events not being transferred over to your pre-existing main calendar you can customize the app with the light and dark mode as well as the main color of your preference for the main interface time page features multiple views that can be accessed with different gestures and it's basically a very solid app that I find very fun to navigate and organized with time page cost 199 dollars monthly or 1199 dollars yearly and the great thing about time page is that it's an app that seamlessly connects to another app Bimal scheme called actions actions is basically a dashboard that compiles tasks into color-coded lists and allows you to schedule them for specific days and assign them a reminder these cards are then synced with the time page so when you open the app you can find your tasks right below your list of events for that day the good thing about having separate apps is that with actions you are able to see all of your tests at a glance and reorganize them according to their degree of importance while in time page they are listed according to date inside the actions app you can also check your past log and take a look at all the tasks you've completed recently which is basically a pat on the back for your hard work actions costs 199 dollars monthly or 1199 dollars yearly then a free app that I'm completely obsessed with is Google Spreadsheets I use spreadsheets to basically organize anything that either involves numbers like multi-purpose budgets or information that is more complex and needs a structure of a spreadsheet I update these documents so often that I prefer to have them stored online since everyone I share them with will also have immediate access to the latest version despite not having the entire list of features that for instance Microsoft Excel provides Google Spreadsheets provides a solid enough version for most of my organization needs for anything concerning PDF box below but my favorite organization app of all these is still notion and I won't ramble too much about it since I have a lot of videos also linked down below that cover the essentials I use notion for anything that needs more complex databases it also acts as my major brainstorming app and it's also the place where I write my scripts for YouTube brainstorm for future videos and organize my workflow it contains in-depth planning of long-term projects and lists that I want to access and edits on the long term as well like a bucket list a reading list etc also most of my notes and project planning related to my job is being managed via notion the app is currently free for students and educators so you can get access to your free version by following the instructions down below it also has a free plan available with the limit of 1,000 blocks that you can manage by creating multiple workspaces notions personal plan costs four dollars a month good notes 5 is the app that I use for complex document creation involving mostly handwriting good notes mimics a natural henry chan experience for your tablet especially if you are using in an Apple pencil you can easily add text and highlight as well as typed text images charts and other types of information meanwhile the different tools featured in good notes allow you to highlight and comment your own text while your edits and even insert images files that can resemble sticky notes for that added visual enhancements the great thing about this app though is that you can create your own notebooks rearrange the pages edit and add external documents and choose different page types and formats this allows you to customize your digital notes as much as possible to mimic the same experience with traditional notebooks or notepads good notes 5 is a one-time-only purchase and the last time I checked it costs $7.99 dollars if handwriting notes is not entirely possible or simply not adequate to the situation at hand I simply rely on Google Docs for all of my document creation I like it better than Microsoft Word because first it's free and 2 it has simple tools that work very well and most of all it allows me to share the document easily with Windows and Mac OS / iOS users and it can be edited in collaboration in real time for email productivity I still think that EOG Gmail app is the best thing out there it does a fantastic work of automatically separating your mail to different inboxes during all of your promotional marketing emails in one place social notifications in other and keeping your most important messages nicely highlighted in your main inbox Gmail also allows you to label messages accordingly and has a great view that index is shared documents your inbox so you can see right away of the files attached to your mail finally Gmail has almost seamless support of different email accounts that you can switch back and forth in seconds you can find links to all these apps in the description box below I hope you've enjoyed today's video and I'll see you next week bye guys
