what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you guys at long last loop from 100 chambers of zarok also known as raids starting at KC 125 overall and of course ending the video at 225 overall I really hadn't been to raids 1 in a very long time on my main at least a couple years I was at raids earlier this year on my iron man and I did get about 1 item through about 130 KC so I was familiar with it and for the most part in this video you guys will see this whole entire 100k see done in groups of 3 and 4 and I did end up reading with the same group that I was reading with months ago on my iron man accounts so everyone knew each other and we didn't have any problems with splitting every single drop that we would get so yeah keep that in mind once you guys do see the price check that all of this was basically in splits and all of the drops you guys will see in this video were under my name as well as all of the people that I was with so you might see a difference in drops if you do decide to solo so that is something to keep in mind but with all that being said let's go ahead and get into today's video but first we have some quick words from our sponsor raid shack now I'm just kidding just kidding how to do that to you guys now as you all have probably seen by now I did decide to invest in a scythe for the making of this video and this was the first ever time that I bought a scythe on my account and definitely the first time making a video with it it was a lot of fun to use but it did cost a lot in blood runes but you know the price was hovering down at 650 mils so I just couldn't pass up that opportunity and since I did buy the site I couldn't afford ancestral or twisted bow but later on in the video I did sell some things and I did manage to buy myself a set of Pagadian boots so I was trying for the most part to use pretty good gear you know not the most best in slot gear in the world but something that was good enough in order to do a hundred raids with and it is important to note that before this video began I did make a promise to a friend of mine that if I did get a twisted bow or a pet during this video that I myself would go for an inferno keep before the year is over and well 15 raids in you can see that we're off to a great start arcane a prayer scrolls certainly not an inferno cape attempt or anything close to it but it is an item nevertheless and I was you know at least happy to see that now we did end up selling it for 4.3 mil and the original split of that was 867 K of course I was the only one that did take a split from that because I would say most of the time if you're in a team and you do get an arcane prayer scroll the go-to thing is to just stake it not speaking from experience but I do hear that's what a lot of people do there's another prayer scroll that you can get in raids that is called a Dexter's prayer scroll that's the prayer scroll that unlocks the prayer rigor that is definitely the one you want to see because the price of that is currently 56 point 1 mil compared to the 4 point 4 mil that the arcane prayer scroll is worth and speaking of Scrolls they also have elite pou Scrolls from chambers of Zurich so that is pretty cool you guys know me I love doing elites and I did do four out of the five that I got during this video I had one elite step where I had to do some quest and that's not gonna happen so yeah other than all those scrolls and all of the other rares that you can get from raids the normal drop table is something that's always intrigued me because it was really beneficial back in the day when I would do raids on my iron man's who always get the herbs and the gems as well as the ores the planks the runes and the fangs the arrows I mean there's just tons of resources and supplies for iron men accounts and of course four main accounts as well because if you happen to be someone that that prioritizes all the points in your raid then that will only mean that your reward goes up in value and all those ores and all those materials and supplies that's just gonna add a lot more value to doing raids over time and that way you know you get to pay off the amount of supplies that you use maybe you're using dragon tarts maybe you're using a saying staff a lot of blood runes or a scythe even just a blowpipe and a trident always cost supplies is important to try your best and raids try not to die try not to lose too many points for your team or yourself and that way the potential of your reward can be at its highest me personally I was getting about twenty to twenty five thousand points per raid if there was no deaths or anything like that and that was pretty good you know there is people out there that get a lot more than that but it all depends on you know how you raid and how efficient and how good you really are now speaking of good things ladies and gentlemen here we go with drop number two what is it gonna be what is it gonna be does it start with addy absolutely it does dexterous prayer scroll second drop of the video and the first drop in my name that purple color looks so good and yeah it was a really good price like I mentioned before you know was hovering around the price of anywhere from 54 to 56 Mildura ng the video so the split on that was pretty decent compared to the arcane prayer scroll and everyone ended up getting just about fourteen mil from that so yeah I was pretty motivated at that point that was the 43rd raid I believe in the video so far towards the 100 goal and it was a very late night around two o'clock in the morning and I decided to do two more raids that night as that platinum stack was growing almost at 15 mil from the splits so far didn't get the back-to-back but on the very last rate of that night I did actually get another item and to my surprise I did a see the purple light again and the item ended up being none other than dragon claws second in my name of the video third drop overall and a pretty similar price towards the dexterous prayer scroll just about 1 mil more and since there was one iron man in this trio I only had to split it with one main so that way I did actually get to walk away with more money than I would have originally so the split ended up being 28.5 mil per person which was awesome it really did help that platinum token stack out a lot 28 mil into the bank and now we were at 43 overall so pretty good amount just from the splits at that point now a quick fun fact about rage you know not only can you bring your friends with you but you can also bring your pets too and they can actually help you out as you can see in this clip I was using my cat to kind of direct me in order to run the head at home and you know my cat did help me out a lot with that so it's something to keep in mind you know maybe you're needing a little bit of assistance guide isn't helping you your friend isn't helping you maybe your pet can moving on from that we have our next item coming in at raid number 54 out of 100 another drop and I was you know pretty happy that this also was in Atrio not a 4-man because this as well was a dexterous prayer scroll this time not in my name but that's no worries I did end up selling it in the grant exchange for just around 55 mill this time and we did split it three ways and we all ended up walking away with a nice split of 18.5 mill so it was really happy to see it Dex and not in arcane I'm sure everyone can relate to that except of course that one iron man that has ten Texas and no archeins you know there's always that one guy you know there's another drop that rates does offer that it's actually untradable and it's called a dark relic and it's one of those things that it kind of reminds me of an ancient effigy back in runescape 3 it kind of just gives you a lot of XP and any skill that you train while doing a raid for example mining agility fishing something like that I would say all these raid items in general are pretty fascinating you know looking at the price of the top items that you can get from raids you know the luckiest of people do end up getting the twisted bow which is at a current price of 1 billion 30 million and if you are the unluckiest of people then you'll just be seeing that or of course the Turin version but either way it is important to note that if your luck is somewhere in the middle you know not all the way at the bottom next to the arcane scroll or all the way at the top next to the tebow then there is a lot of items that you can potentially get while raiding there is a twisted buckler which is currently about 6 mil a dragon hunter crossbow which is 110 mil of course any of the ancestral pieces which range from 14 to 60 and of course the reason that I wanted to name some of the other drops that you can get while doing raids is because you obviously won't see all of the drops in just one video loop from 100 maybe in the future if I do loot from 1000 you guys will see all the rate drops however for now you guys are just gonna have to deal with the consistency of the arcane prayer scrolls now for the record if you guys do enjoy this video and you're just a big fan of raids in general feel free to leave a like and a comment below and let me know if you want to see Luke from 1000 the only reason that I didn't want to do it this time was because it would have to be a commitment of about two months minimum so I figured since I just committed a month to the Pecan video another two months of no vids would be kind of outrageous and honestly pretty stupid so yeah I didn't want to do that just yet but maybe I can think of something where I do it like slowly and increments over time and it doesn't take that much time in one go so let me know you guys think about that but as we slowly approach and make our way towards 100 we do have another drop to show this was obtained at raid at number 85 overall was not in my name again but that's okay to our surprise we did see an arcane prayer scroll and the split from that was a 1.3 mil have you guys think that is unlucky just wait a few more seconds because I got to say what happened next was pretty weird and also pretty annoying at the same time so I did get an elite clue scroll and as I mentioned earlier on in the video I had to drop it because you know I just didn't have the quest complete then I got another elite and luckily I was able to do that one so it was happy and I was smiling but quickly my smile faded away because as I was approaching the end of a raid I finished it and I didn't see anything I didn't think that we got anything you know my game wasn't set to filtered and I just didn't see any red in the chatbox but little did I know we did actually get another yes another arcane prayer scroll and as you can see it there and the chat was very unfortunate but you know at least I wasn't the only one walking away with a prayer scroll from that raid so with all of the splits at this point nearing the end here only had 10 left to go ending at 225 as I mentioned before did end up getting another elite clue scroll a couple more relics towards the end getting some more XP and for the most part I pretty much chose mining as the main focus for all of my relics and I do think I ended up getting about 100k mining XP or at least close to it but the platinum tokens were not impressing me at this current point we had 65 million see the drops we're adding up a lot you know all the supplies and resources but I really wanted to see at least one more item before the video finished so I had a good feeling and I said you know what cheers to making account and there you go the last item of the video and my name with four left to go dexterous prayer scroll yet again this time it was a four man instead of a three man but nevertheless it was a fourteen mill split for everyone and it was a great way to in the video was really happy that I got to see that purple light you know it's kind of my light at the end of the tunnel the long arcane prayer scroll tunnel that just seemed to never end and overall that platinum stack went up to meet my expectations and make that price check spectacular so as we come to a close here and reach 225 overall to meet that 100 mark I just want to say a huge shout-out to everyone who did raids with me a lot of friends that I've known over the years even some real-life friends that got involved and it was a lot of fun with you guys doing things solo in this game is enjoyable to an extent but you know at the end of the day this a community based game and it's all about making those memories so let's go ahead and get into this price check loop from 100 chambers of zarok I gotta say I enjoyed every single second of this probably should have had this video done three days ago honestly but I've been in the process of moving so you know we got a bear with me get to that later so anyway let's go ahead and price check all of the normal drops first this is the herbs the ores that dynamite the planks the gems as well as the fangs and the arrows now all of this stuff does come out to be a decent amount 17.8 mell keep in mind that was all kind of averaging around 20 to 25 k points per raid and then of course we have to add up the second price check to the first which is the runes the blood runes the Soul runes deaths as well as all the pure essence 79,000 pure essence for you iron men and that does come out to be just about four point four mil so we go ahead and we add the four point four to the first price check and we end up with just about twenty two point three mil in normal drops and now of course we have to open all these Elite clue Scrolls and see just how much we made from these and as we open these up the very first one we do get a master clue but I'm gonna save that for next video I don't want to open it for this video mainly because there's one part of the video that maybe not all of you know about and I did want to save that till the very end overall we did get about 700 K from the elite clues Scrolls so if we go and we add that to the original price check of the normal items than without the rares involved we made about 23 milk just in normal drops and the elite clues but it is about to get a lot bigger than that so 23 mil is what we made from just normal drops but if you take into account all the rares and all the splits that we did see throughout this video 0 to 100 then we have another 80 mil to add it to the price check meaning that we made 103 mil from 100 raids now I did say in the chat box that I probably spent about 5 mil on supplies but I did not account for the site so probably make that about 10 mil and supplies overall but that doesn't really matter about the profit what really mattered in this video was just how much we were going to see from the raids themselves and now that we've price checked and now that we know that we made 103 mil over from my calculations it is time to see if anybody guessed that number on 1700 comments I figured I would do something fun give away a 90 day runescape membership card to you guys if anyone could guess how much money I would make from this video and it turns out that the number came out to be just about 103 mil but let's go ahead and ctrl F as you can see we have loaded up 1700 comments from about a week ago total and let's see if any one guests 103 let's see ctrl F 1 0 3 looks like we got two hits one of them is down here and one of them is up here let's go to this one up here let's see where could this guy be he guessed 103 mil here it is 103 oh I think he guessed Oh personal gain 372 million six hundred and eighty-five thousand 103 yeah you're not there man but almost all right we have one more reply could this be someone who guessed 103 mil it's only one more let's see here it is right down here Zack Smith three days ago 103 million seven hundred and ninety two thousand four hundred and fifty five Wow somebody actually guessed it well congratulations to that guy he will be contacted it shortly for his 90-day runescape membership card just wanted to do something different for you guys you know maybe I'll do that more often in the future but yeah as I mentioned before I am in the process of moving from Florida to New Jersey and I might be a little bit busy until the first of next month but nevertheless I still have two really good videos coming out for you guys to wrap this month up and I'm gonna have a whole lot planned for the months and the years there's a lot of things that are gonna change very soon and they're all gonna benefit my work ethic and things like that so with all that being said thank you very much for watching I've dragged this video out way too long until next time mr. no sleet out
