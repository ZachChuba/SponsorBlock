get into today's story with just a rock and a torch I was prowling the landscape searching for fortune and glory I didn't know what would bring me both of those but I was excited nonetheless you're all my friend Yolo Yolo I was playing with my friends suspect and was examining the map when I heard a distant explosion there's someone booming stuff yeah oh I hear that I'm right next to it okay all right let's team up is that you no that's not this dudes raiding or something no wow I already yeah he's bullying me why are you bullying me all right uh he's raiding something right here what's he doing here yeah he was where was he what was he what was he actually writing Oh what oh it's right here oh it's almost down yeah yeah he's in the roof another tree my lord I farmed up just enough materials to craft a bow and then headed back over to the raid okay oh yeah I spared him Oh a most at you he's got a rope up I hate you I'm so sorry can I make it if you hit him again you down nice gold go you like him form a ball get it he's got a horse maybe I can make it are you up are you dead full dead oh you're all right I'm gonna finish it real quick he's got three bean cans god that's scary that's probably the move I got it Oh load it load it okay I'm just gonna Y everything I think yeah face mask one man with all the loot from the counter raid I hightailed it out of the area to meet suspect farther inland I see an airdrop anything in here I bet it's uh yes an unloaded airdrop our luck would this start was only increasing oh you got a four I got yeah he's very angry all right here here you take I met up with suspect and we kept exploring together can't believe that just didn't get going that he was lurking we started building our base in a small clearing by some rocks four to five right we did it what a lovely little vice let's just starts pouring oh I kept check that out we heard people raiding with a shotgun in the distance so we headed over to investigate definitely a definitely a spazz rate this time we'll say hello my friend ill or two of them I see them okay they'd be there flame-throwing yet they're like just I I got a DB one down one down 100 he's right there he's right there and healing up cleared out with all the best loot this was a big come up gonna go back yeah yeah we ran back to gather everything that was left at the raid got mp5 don't mind if I do we then returned home and added a couple things to the base ago headed back out before dawn to keep exploring we'd been trekking for a bit when we came upon a small shop what the hell you can get a K for 600 sulphur so in my excitement of seeing what I assumed to be these guns for sale I was making quite a large oversight so they can buy the sword yeah yeah cos got how much sulphur do you have what suspect had made the trade and then we realized our mistake they weren't selling guns they were selling sulfur oh my god what frontally it was our exuberance that had cost us a rifle but we still felt tricked by this shop owner and they were terrible traits destroying this shop and taking our rifle back was the least we could do but there was much to be done and many things that would complicate this goal whose shop is so weird for now we headed back out on the map to see if we could get some more gear it is an ache a you give aku get 600 sulfur feels bad man feels very bad heli heli oh oh he's empty man well I see him I see him I'm over I think were you for the turret was sort of we did a bit of sulfur farming after avoiding the m2 wielding group and then heard some distant explosions guys lived Oh beam can read baby yo thirteen edible with the gifts up okay yep I'm coming back with the m2 I was the one with the m2 real he's coming back with the NRA get the m2 I want you to get my own two men lying about them too because I don't think he was gone he was loaded check his body okay okay I was a lot of stone left he's got um looks like a tiara stars I missed I missed so Tommy I hit him with the okay yeah that might be the Raider Ella I got a horse I'm coming Tommy I'm on the body got a bunch of stuff for our basement gonna be nice we returned home placed more furnaces and started smelting sulfur we were gonna need a lot of this to make gunpowder for the raid this is tight even make it gamer moves when morning came we saw an air drop in the distance and headed out I was gonna say if you made an instrument out of a dead body would it be a necrophile fine this is very fun fun think so maybe somebody diluted and scooted okay guy up the hill straight ahead hit him twice three dead dead dead dead versus silence custom I think lots of ammo let's do one thing K my friend oh thank you perfect for you oh okay alrighty we need to get to a two - hello this guy has no idea what's going man this your basement yes bro what oh he's got a little farm up here hey hello dude get raided brah I don't know how to read Englishman he said yes no English in yer a good luck man you picked the mushroom as our furnace is smelted at home we kept wandering the map searching for a scuffle hit him once missed every shot of my life I missed you can't get anything good behind us bolt I miss okay he's still here chillin he's like pretty kind of far yeah more people running up naked I think oh are you okay yeah I'm pretty sure easing that bass up there oh I'll get him I got tagged I got tagged don't be beer you ran away to escape the roof campus I'm about to pull a fast one on these gamers faces though I don't think it is Oh guy then that full full game you need to get out of here yep let's go we should probably tank this feller up a little bit we haven't really gotten a big scrap load yet now I had the explosive ammo blueprint on this server that's what we were gonna raid the shop with but to craft it we needed a tier two and then a tier 3 workbench which would require a lot of scrap I'm gonna put a silencer on my a K get a little a little true chat experience that fireworks oh I was like oh my goodness this is amazing I think I came up here just at the end of the fireworks display come on more we needed to gather scrap so we went to farm barrels by the road cuz this is miners mask drop it buddy drop the gun all right this crap drop the loot this is a robbery yeah keep it coming Johnson I'm doubting him I'm gonna see if he's lying oh he was lying he's a liar while shaking down a traveler for loot we were ambushed and killed but we hadn't been far from base we geared up and raced back over top so a heli so he's got a que he's um 60-70 you full send him I'm gonna loot any guns that are left is there anything here what little bit of stuff he's close oh wait I'm good I'm good I'm still alive he's gonna push me Sun is in my eyes but you

just closely close close ladies ladies lit hey down here that one matches your sound take a OH you know how to make return on here anyway oh we only know we don't we just need the tear to like I'm just gonna roll as he I guess I've got green card fuse we could go do a puzzle with all the loot stored away we headed over to loot the sewer branch to get more scrap oh okay I see him north due north folky or top of him even though we had all the loot from the sewer branch there was a fight up the hill we decided a risk it to potentially get even more gear every time see that I'm done that dead dead dead dead nice nice can you pick me up guy inside base we're not going to do anything to you man okay bro come on oh yeah I put it on I'm down dad you good yeah let's bounce oh I'm sorry I'm down

the area and met back up with suspect okay we found a helicopter by the road and headed home with all the loot all right there's a lot of stuff we could go recycle some stuff we went out on a quick recycling run to scrap some components a lot of most couple I recognize those names Oh Bolton I'm dead okay wait help someone outside though someone was where are you uh I think it yeah this music I think he's coming down to Luke where are you [Music] next to me with the pipe kill Tommy on the roof towards this room okay kill the killer okay my only hit but Judy's a little bit angry next we headed up a train yard to loot more scrap or mini hey looks like a generator 3:20 fine he's gonna go for it oh he might be jeez dad he's dead he's dead okay close guy close in there right in there combat log see if you killed a bathtub I definitely killed here who's gonna be in will infuse flip the switches first this is a way better suspect went to pillage the puzzle rooms while I covered from the scaffolding hit him yeah there's a somewhat similar Gears guy oh he's sneaking up hit him I heard that he's not dead he's not dead I'm coming down have another tier 3 by the way with what we'd gained on our expedition we could finally put down a tier 2 workbench and almost had enough for a tier 3 we were inching towards our goal of getting back up a terrible shop-owner sounds good up 6 we opened doors exactly the same time right there best friend I then headed out to farm a broken scrap helicopter two guys northwest I'm sorry Lois miss miss miss 290 hit him [Music] hit him up one stop by the gas station hit him I don't see the other Oh once hit him he's down once inside and he has two HP is up he's in there he's got full metal van de Kamp in it it'll Bend deep though we needed to recycle the components we had so we headed to the Bandit camp which was fairly nearby deserve a little bit of stuff Oh Bucky you're never run uh to get very geared down the hill miss miss Oh straight ahead of you so closer a headshot one but under the under the electric he's one shot if it's got three times he's dead I think I miss the other ones running okay missed missed missed he's close right next to you kill them both okay I pretty much got most of it yeah that's the kinda job man crazy game slap it right in the middle yeah now safe at home I made some base upgrades and we finally had enough materials to put down the tier 3 workbench we needed to make explosives you want this full honeycomb with two more doors on it well just outside our base we saw two air drops nearby likely called in by a group we went to go contest them has he uh out in the open like a shot yeah do it do it take the shot him again it's our boys we're gonna make it blue [Music] yeah you run back head shadow this house he got across your booth camping buddy hit his friend he's like it's me that shot him again no no no thanks sorry I'm gonna come back no no we're good you're like screaming at each other Demi's now roof roof roof hey Kay I hear them running around inside scurrying got him at the window oh look at all these little rats I'm full buddy holy that's a dead naked yeah I'd say he's down no scoped across see welcome to the combs oh hey we had our workbench but now needed more sulfur and metal to craft the explosive mmm so we headed north as night was falling to the frigid tundra we're resource nodes would be plentiful a little parent right here ow [Music] though we expanded our base with the resources we gathered and then we started a planar raid now the shop was rather small but it could be quite fortified there were garage doors inside it would be worth it to break through the walls however if they were vulnerable sheet metal doors we would want to go through those and there would be no way to tell which it was until we were inside hopefully we'd have enough explosives I crafted all our gunpowder and metal into explosive ammo I'm ready to go [Music] that's a fine spot we had the explosive ammo ready hopefully we had enough you ready yep [Music] ah unfortunate it was a garage door and they would likely be two of them so rating through a stone wall would be cheap checking it 178 and 248 we're not gonna burn out now the Splash Damage on the walls have been very minimal so we were gonna need more explosive ammo than we anticipated wait I'll fly back just stay here I'll be back suspect flew back to base to scrape together as much explosive ammo as he could while I held down the raid whichever's of the lowest one would you see that the back is lower because watch this corner maybe this side regular door I think you're the only one they got we'd broken in and it was a double door on the inside here easily writable I'm just like sneaking in the trees the Sun was rising and we were about to throw everything we had left at this shop all right TC locked boom secured this base so that they could never access their terrible shop again there's slight against us it costs them everything not of retail ends with the crumbling ruins of a vast fortress or the pinnacle of justice but sometimes just one step in the right direction one less scam eShop taking advantage of people here take your sour back oh thanks man with the shop permanently out of commission we headed out to return home triumphant let's get the flip out of here dude I hope you enjoyed the [Music]
