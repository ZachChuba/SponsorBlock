sponsored by Monday comm okay hello follow me like carpools Riley and he's usually in front of me we walk in the building in the morning and he does this thing he says good morning like exuberantly I think it came from the roast mornin mornin Anthony it's dumb but uh that's all Riley not everyone likes my mornings planning and tracking and stuff so and I have my dashboard set up so I have all of the tasks that we need to complete for tech linked right there when I when I get there they actually Auto populate every Monday Wednesday and Friday so that's pretty awesome Monday is production or marketing or sales so got to start out with finding the actual sources for the video so I start searching for news aggregator sites that have kind of like they get all the big stories for the day and then I will just open every story in a new tab and just max out my tab count telling is for people who don't have enough time to watch the full news story they should enlist concentrate everything on one pack put that into your face and you have to suck it hey Jake and note seven is the one that exploded right we're not at all okay so once I've gathered all my sources and I decide what today's stories are going to be for tech linked I go to Monday comm and I click done on gather sources and because of the automation that I've set up that will actually send a notification to Dennis and then he can start screenshotting them and putting them in the timeline it's one click and it's all finally rally's always late from writing scripts but when I see him don't even kitchen pop-up makes me want to kill him less okay so I got older sources but we have no time to waste he's still I don't know what he's doing he's still writing a script but like a whole the sources I got here I label them all in different colors and now what I have to do is I'd put them on the timeline first and do all those workmen see I almost done doing all the movement for the pictures my rallies not even done writing who's the real hero gathering all those stories and getting the script ready can be a bit of a challenge to do quickly so sometimes Dennis starts to panic a bit and come to ask me where the script is Dennis I'm going man I'm sorry okay like 50 50 minutes so once I've written the three main stories and then I've gotten to the quick bits section I let the shooter know that I'm gonna be done the script in about 15 minutes because that's about as long as it takes me to write the quick bits they're quick bits exactly okay you set up in a moment it's a little late I'm sorry wait don't say sorry to me I say sorry yeah Brandon I love everything you do you do good work please continue Thank You Riley you too yeah I know I know Dennis we're going we're going I so much more convenient are you ready for tech news yeah tackling 69 it's not 60 teklynx is a new show but it's also just kind of a you know a place to hang out you know oh that's cruel we'll be stuck inside my IOT network that's like a black mirror yeah it's like it's like a special hell baby monitors our belts I just got the exit radio job now it's time for the pork barks I would describe tech linked as the tech news but we don't care about the tech news we're just like her so yeah as a tech news but like I've actually really checked out of this job at this point and I don't really care if you fire me because that was really where a lot of the attitude of the original net link came from because I had three feet out the door at NCIX and I just didn't care so it was like it's one take because that's all I have time for and if it's kind of weird and Goofy or I missed something or I don't like the script I'm just be like yeah it's a stupid joke forget it more tech news don't give a tech news tech news for more tech news tech news tech news one of the coolest things about tackling is that anyone can host it because we're not actually trying to do a very good professional job of reading you the news there's a lot of room for people to experiment have fun or even learn and just get more comfortable on camera on camera there's no going back for me okay thumbnail time yeah okay wait oh my gosh I can't believe it now yeah give me straight at the camera like you're pissed perfect I love that I love those faces you make okay thank you thank you very much once I'm done filming I ingest the comm which will send a notification to Dennis that he's ready to start editing okay so at this point of the day now that the script is shot and the footage is safely in Dennis's very capable hands it's time for me to finally eat my lunch usually pretty late in the day it's very intense challenging for me everyday and they try to be funny so hard but as you can see in what most of my editing time I'm not really laughing because I just I don't notice because the jokes are not funny or just because I was under really high-pressure these jokes are horrible so while Dennis is editing it's time for me to make the thumbnail so before I can do the thumbnail I need to find a face the Linus is making that is suitably grotesque for the thumbnail and usually that means I have to scrub through the video the end portion of the video where Linus makes a lot of crazy faces and I find that trying to make the face that I'm looking for helps a little bit with that hello was he pranked okay a few time yes pretty closer so I'm so ready so ready go you love that you that's the fun this joke is falling asleep is the funniest joke you've ever seen in tackling yeah what are we even doing that's a tech link-up zode right there yeah that was it that's how you do it bye and that's the end we're gonna do more right vortex very encouraging so after we've reviewed it's a matter of Denis rendering the video and then when that's done he marks done on Monday comm I get a notification that it's ready to upload I upload and publish attach the thumbnail and that's how you do a tech late
