this video is sponsored by audible this is the defenders rewrite part 5 if you haven't seen parts one two three and four or you just haven't seen them in a while I would highly recommend giving them a look again the links are in the video description but maybe you don't have time maybe you're busy or maybe you just love recaps so here's a quick recap of everything that's happened so far in the series if you don't need it you can go to this time in the video okay Matt finishes off the rest of the hand in New York City with the small assist from the iron fist Danny Rand and the daughter of the Dragon Colleen wing Hogarth does a favor to Jessica Jones and gets Luke Cage out of prison Luke finds out that a business woman named Alexandra bond is developing Harlem into oblivion because of economic displacement caused by Alexandra everyone notices an increase in street-level crime Luke goes to a protest where he learns of a vandal calling himself the wrecker who has become the people's champion Danny destroys Iran to deal with Alexandra later that night Luke investigates a mysterious lightning strike and is knocked unconscious by an unknown figure after she hears about what happened to Luke Claire calls misty Jessica Danny Colleen and Matt for help misty and Jessica worked together to try to figure out who hurt Luke since they're the two best investigators in the show Danny uses his Chi powers to heal Luke Danny tries to track the energy signature of the weapon that hurt Luke Matt tries to figure out if there's a new weapon in town he goes and shakes down Turk Barrett and Justin Hammer finds nothing Jessica and misty run into Danny and Colleen at the crime scene and because Danny and Colleen both partially matched the description that Jessica and misty got of the person that knocked out Luke Jessica and misty tried to bring Danny and Colleen in for questioning Danny and Colleen refuse and get into a fight with Jessica and misty and right before either can hurt the other Claire and des now healed Luke arrive and tell everyone that he remembers what happened he met someone at a construction site who was struck by lightning and it turns out that person was the wrecker when Luke tried to take him to the hospital the record refused and knocked out Luke with some sort of magic crowbar Danny Colleen misty Jessica Claire and Luke all come up with a plan led by Danny they're going to use Danny's magic sensing abilities to find the wrecker and then they're going to fight the wrecker and take the crowbar from him Claire calls Matt but he refuses to help he still doesn't want to work with the team after what happened to Elektra she tells Matt where to find the group the team tracks the record to a warehouse Luke ambushes the wrecker and Danny and Jessica steal the crowbar from the wrecker but it is revealed that not only can the wrecker summon the crowbar with his mind like Thor does with his hammer the wrecker has also assembled a group of three super-powered criminals they are calling themselves the wrecking crew the first member of the group is someone who we will not name yet but eventually will be called Thunder ball his strongest member of the crew he picks things up and throws them at Jessica the second member of the group is someone named piledriver he's the fastest member of the wrecking crew and he fights Luke Cage the third member of the wrecking crew is named bulldozer he is the least vulnerable member of the group he wears a helmet he's kind of like the junk or not bulldozer and the wrecker fight Danny and Wright as a group is almost lost Matt as daredevil shows up after a pep talk from stick turns off the lights in the warehouse saves the group and they retreat the team meets for the first time and talk there is friction between the members of the group Matt comes up with a plan Matt as daredevil and Jessica go investigate the construction site Danny as iron fist and Luke hang out and Danny trains Luke in harnessing his Chi at the end of the episode Matt and Jessica make a discovery using that super hearing that there is a cave hidden under the instruction site where they find a bunch of ancient markings and a pair of safety glasses let's do this [Music] all right wreck shop this is the episode where we finally figure out what's going on with the wrecker and while this video isn't super long I want this episode to play out a little more like one of the episodes from daredevil season 3 that focuses specifically on Lund characters past even though in this video one of our characters is going to be narrating this I want this all play out pretty slowly on screen getting invested in what the wreckers doing is very important in selling this entire series so we're back in Jessica's office that night the team's assembled again this time by Jessica Matt as daredevil Luke Claire misty Danny as iron fist and Colleen as the daughter of the Dragon meet Jessica at her office slash apartment Jessica asks if anyone wants a drink Danny says I could actually use one Jessica says not you there's a knock at the door it's Malcolm he hands Jessica a file she says is this everything Malcolm says everything I could find on short notice it's a lot jessica says good then she looks over the files Malcolm talks to the group let's have him be a fan of Daredevils he's confused by the iron fist but Jessica tells him not to pay him any attention Jessica says I knew it this is good Matt says so you know this guy and now jessica is going to tell us the story of the wrecker which would play out on screen with a little bit of narration from her jessica says so a woman came into the office last week saying she thought her boyfriend was cheating on her wanted me to follow him but it didn't seem right relationship was going well no likely mistress I've seen a lot of cheaters and I can almost sense it he wasn't one on top of that his girlfriend couldn't afford me so you turned her away I run a business iron hand it's shut up anyway I didn't think anything of it but then I found needs Jessica holds up two classes so I had Malcolm look into it a little more his name is Dirk Garthwaite he's born in the Bronx he was a construction worker went to prison for a few years from a robbery but then it seems like he turned it around cut a 3-year sentence down to one with good behavior Matt cuts in that's some pretty good behavior he's everybody gonna interrupt me sorry so he turns his life around gets a job at a construction company in the city wine construction she's tough for an ex-con and Dirk does well eventually gets promoted to Foreman but then who shows up bond and she starts buying up all of the construction companies in the city including Dirk's the owner Sal sells the company but Alexandra keeps Dirk and the rest of the crew around now Dirk works for Alexandra and that's where things get messy turns out Alexandra is a pretty shitty boss first she cuts everyone's pay some quit but Dirk can't ex-con needs to take what he can get so Dirk stays on and then Alexandra starts taking over Harlem knocking down buildings evicting people and Dirk is the one knocking down the buildings he's the face of bond he sees the protesters he sees the people getting kicked out of their homes it gets to him and then one of the buildings Dirk needs to demolish is his own where he lives with his girlfriend rent controlled only place in the area they can afford that's the last straw so here's my guess Dirk comes up with this wrecker character and goes after bond vandalize his construction sites Luke says of course that's how he knows how to get in without being seen Jessica gives Luke a look you too sorry so yeah he knows how to get in he knows when the site's gonna be empty he cuts tires tags walls nothing crazy becomes the people's champ and this part is a real stretch but when I went to the site with the devil man we found a cave under the site had all kinds of magic carvings and whatever might have been aliens or so or I don't know but I bet that's where he found the crowbar one day during work he didn't tell anyone about it plan to come back that night and take it maybe he can sell it or something make some money so he can find a new place to live so he goes back that night the night you found him does his usual wrecker stuff and he searches the cave and finds the crowbar and you think the power comes from the crowbar Danny is silent Jessica says you could talk yeah I could feel it whatever that thing is it's where he got his power so that was the lightning strike him getting the powers Jessica gives up on controlling the conversation whatever so he knocks me out and then runs away where did the other three come from they weren't there that night what if he gave to them like he shared the power with them Luke says well why would he do that he could stop me without them what does he need a team for now Claire comes in strength in numbers I guess he knows that he can get more damage done as part of a team they can look out for each other it's how they beat you guys then Matt so who are they the other three Malcolm I'm not sure the descriptions you guys gave me don't fit any people who's worked with in the past no friends relatives they could be anybody luke says check the prison records anyone he spent time with if I was forming a crew of super villains that's where I would start Malcolm says good idea Matt so how can we use this can we find him Malcolm I checked with his girlfriend she hasn't seen him in days Luke says you think she's telling the truth Malcolm yeah I do I told her to call me if she hears from him Derk also doesn't own any other property he must have known that the warehouse you found him at was going to be abandoned so he's probably hiding out at another abandoned property in the city I'm working on getting a list together Claire gets an alert on her phone guys Claire shows the group a news report disaster at Harlem construction site officials are investigating the cause of a collapse at a Harlem construction site reports indicate multiple injuries and one casualty it must be them and people are starting to get hurt Jessica why didn't you feel anything your magic radar thing Danny I don't know maybe he didn't use the crowbar it's not an exact science Jessica well can you find him now Danny concentrates uh no Jessica useless Danny listen naps has calmed down we need to figure out a plan we can't wait any longer we need to find them now before they hurt anyone else well they're gonna hit another site what if we catch them in the act there's a bomb site on every block all over the city you could never cover all of them and what about bond herself they're okay with killing people now why not get her well she's tough to find doesn't make a lot of appearances especially with the protests I think I can get her Danny looks at Colleen Jessica's shocked get her are you gonna just call her up Danny says yeah and then Danny takes off his mask feeling himself to be billionaire Danny Rand everyone is shocked Colleen takes off her mask too misty says wait your yep while everyone thought I was dead I trained with monks got this Danny shows his tattoo but I'm still Danny Rand if I call Alexandra and tell her that Danny Rand wants to make a deal she'll listen we can schedule a public appearance there's no way the record won't bite because and not to nitpick not unlike my podcasts mostly nitpicking I think the group should react to the fact that they are hanging out with Danny Rand he's a super rich person who came back and claimed his family's fortune and company after being thought dead for most of his life that's a big story everyone would know it everyone would know who he is and yet in defenders when it's revealed that the Danny Rand is the person that's working with the rest of the defenders none of them seemed to really care none of them see this as an advantage none of them are even interested by the fact that they are hanging out with a billionaire this just like the Luke and Danny relationship is also brought up in episode 10 of season 2 of Luke Cage where Luke tells Danny that his real superpower is being rich and that's really interesting I want this season to play with that a little bit so jessica says hearing this plan well and then what happens I don't know if you guys all got hit in the head that hard but we didn't beat these guys last time we almost died well they took us by surprise and they didn't have me thanks for that by the way if we can work together we can stop them this is our best shot but we also need to make sure nothing happens to Alexandra we need to protect her so we're her hit squad now no we're just defending her for now I don't like this well does anybody have a better idea everyone is silent that's what I thought Danny get the meeting scheduled at 4:00 tomorrow we'll be ready Danny calls Ward sets up the meeting Matt starts talking strategy he doesn't get more than two sentences in before he's interrupted by Danny tomorrow 10:00 a.m. Columbus Circle everyone is shocked they're putting out a press release now he'll hear about it and it'll catch him off guard Jessica you can't make it later I haven't been up before ten in a long time says well that's the plan go home get some sleep points to iron fist do whatever you do we need to be ready for tomorrow everyone show up at Columbus Circle by 8:00 jessica says this week sucks Malcolm says to Jessica I'm sleeping over somewhere tonight but I'll be here at 7:00 to check in on you jessica says not a child everyone leaves they each go back to their place Danny and Colleen Luke and Claire Matt Malcolm misty they all get a good night's sleep the team is ready but then last thing Jessica wakes up to someone knocking at her door she checks the clock it's 6:00 a.m. she walks over to the door what did I save last night I don't need a wake-up call Jessica opens the door and finds two police officers Jessica Jones yeah you're under arrest for criminal trespassing you need to come with us [ __ ] end of episode so that's episode six it's the Recker origin I know it seems short but you can stretch this out really give the wrecker some characterization the team knows who he is they have a plan that they think they can use to stop the Wrecking Crew but a monkey wrench was just thrown into the works and Jessica Jones got arrested again na ng o V MOV IES - 500 500 as always I have to say a huge thank you to
