hello this is chef john from
foodwishes.com with rocky road that's right i thought i was going to
show you how to make a famous candy based on a famous ice cream but as it
turns out it's actually the other way around
the ice cream flavor was actually inspired by an australian candy that
goes by the same name which used the same signature
ingredients of chocolate marshmallows and nuts
and probably a little touch of vegemite but regardless this is super easy to
make and would make for an absolutely
wonderful edible gift for the upcoming holidays
so with that let's go ahead and get started with a bowl full of chocolate
chips and please do me a favor and use dark
chocolate okay i think the only way to mess this up is to use milk chocolate
and of course we always want to taste a little bit to make sure it's okay
and then to our chocolate chips we will add some cubed up unsalted butter
at which point i do like to give this a quick mix since we're going to melt all
this over hot water and i feel like some of the butter
should be underneath and not just sitting all on top
and then last but not least we'll add a couple teaspoons of maple syrup
which i believe is supposed to be corn syrup except i don't stock that
so i'm going with the maple syrup which seems to work out just fine
and then what we'll do is place that over a saucepan that has about an inch
of hot water set over the lowest heat setting you
have okay a few tiny bubbles here they're okay
but we don't want this boiling or simmering and that's it we will just
leave that to gradually melt and please do not try to stir this too
early okay you might see some of the butter and a few your chocolate chips
start to melt and you'll get all excited and you want to give it a stir but don't
we want this all melted before there's any movement
and while we're waiting for that we can review our two other main ingredients
which would be some kind of nuts plus mini marshmallows
and as far as the marshmallows i'm going to use two kinds some little white ones
that are basically white sugar flavored and then i found some pink ones that i
cut up which i believe are pink sugar flavored
and then as far as the nuts go i like a nice roasted whole salted almond
but of course if you'd rather use something else go ahead
i mean you are after all the highway patrol of what goes in our rocky road
mixing bowl and things like peanuts or walnuts or
cashews will also work beautifully and then the other thing we should prep
ahead of time is to plastic wrap an 8 inch by 8 inch cake pan
which i've done here and that's it by now we can go back and check our butter
and chocolate which as you can see is nice and melty
and once that's happened we can take a spatula and give this a mix
okay going a little bit slowly at first and then as all that butter emulsifies
in we can go ahead and stir a little more quickly
until we end up with this relatively soft sort of shiny fudgy looking mixture
and that's it we'll go ahead and remove that from the heat
and quickly stir in our nuts and marshmallows
and don't pull a mussel but we do want to mix this up fairly quickly
since as you know when melted chocolate cools it thickens up
and by the way pink and brown is a very very underrated color combination
so if you can find those i think they do make a nice addition as of course with
anything else you decide to throw in this
all right other kinds of nuts dried fruit etc okay as long as you keep the
same proportions between the chocolate and the chunks
really anything goes and then what we'll do once we're confident everything has
been completely coated is quickly transfer that into our pan
and while we do want to make sure everything's pushed into the corners
and then we end up with a nice consistent even layer we do
not under any circumstances want to smooth out and press down the top
all right this stuff is called rocky road not uneven pavement
so we want to try to preserve a rough as possible texture on the top
and that's it once that's been spread out and definitely not smoothed over
we will simply let that cool down to room temp before covering it with some
plastic and then popping it in the fridge until
it's very very well chilled and firm which is going to make it so much easier
to cut as you're about to see so once our rocky road has been
thoroughly chilled we'll take it out of the fridge and remove it from the pan
and i'm not sure how familiar you are with actual rocky roads
but having grown up in the mean streets of shortsville new york believe me i was
around my fair share of them and they tend to be very dusty and dirty
i mean come on you can't run one of those street cleaners on a road this
rocky which is why before slicing i like to
sprinkle some cocoa over the top and then what we'll do once we've
dirtied that up a little is take a long thin knife
and we'll carefully cut this up into 16 pieces which as you can see i like to do
right on the plastic although there are pros and cons to that
method right the main pro is it's going to be a lot easier to clean my cutting
board but the main con is you might get some
plastic stuck underneath the candy and people spitting out pieces of
plastic is never a great look so once you cut this be careful to look
for that and if we use the perfect proportion of chocolate
and nuts in marshmallows you should get some beautifully clean cuts
all right check it out i find this stuff absolutely gorgeous
not to mention incredibly addictive to eat okay i'm really not a big sweets guy
and almost never eat candy but once you start with this stuff it's hard to stop
and i think the secret here is that play between the really sweet marshmallow
and then that bittersweet dark chocolate of course elevated texturally
by those salty crunchy roasted almonds rice so simple yet so satisfying
so i very much enjoyed that first one and then i went ahead and arranged some
on a platter so i could take some pictures
and of course eat another one and i don't mean to surface shame people
but here you can get a great look at why we really do want to leave that top as
irregular and rough as possible i mean to me that just completes the
proper visual effect speaking of which after i finish that
second piece i went ahead and stacked these up for
some more pictures as is required by the food blogger commandments
okay when it comes to cookies or candies or bars thou shall stack but anyway
whether you're going to make these for yourself
or maybe to give as an edible gift or hopefully both
i really do hope you give these a try soon so please follow the links below
for the ingredient amounts a printable written recipe and much more
info as usual and as always enjoy you
