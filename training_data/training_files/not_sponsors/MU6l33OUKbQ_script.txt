give me some of that sweet yeah [Music] aha I will enjoy this as I always do really we are gonna declutter this place so I don't know if you guys have noticed but over time shot has been picking up trinkets left right Santa and now it is time to realize whether we actually need them in our life or not yeah Shawn's gonna make that decision she's gonna clear oh I'm gonna relax and eat cheese well we need to do the entire house I saw this video on like BuzzFeed or something I was like about living a minimalist lifestyle that's not happening but I want to adopt some like minimalist values in that keeping things that we use keeping things that we need and kind of like donating the rest if we can rocket would love that here's a very neat boy I'm the messy messy messy one you want to do my sponsorship do I want so enjoy thank you Squarespace let us go to the clean uni it's already messy also got a lot of stuff so even if we tie it up it would look quite nice but I want to really get to the heart of it all and take out stuff that I don't need especially this thing I don't need that get out of here I think the best way to do this is maybe go section by section I haven't really like right up on Manila Muslim because I don't really want to be a minimalist I just want to declutter the house like oh oh oh oh Roku got this cupboard for free off the internet how cool is it look at it he got it and he's cool and we don't actually have a lot of closed storage space so this is gonna be really really good for the the ugly things in our life oh my God look at the studio it's like pretty bad yesterday we picked up this sideboard that's gonna actually go into my shear which is some more closed cupboard space which is really really good we're gonna put this sideboard thingy into my studio but first I want to full-on decide what needs to be there and what needs to Lou you I do this section let's do it read a study [Music] by anyway rocket is gonna date this little cupboard it's filled with those little trinket e cameras it's gonna organize the stuff and then figure out what is needed or what needs to be real I think everything here is gonna be kept mostly I think this is will be more of a display cupboard for like cool things and then all like the what the the chains and the twines extension cables that can all go maybe in a drawer over here or something [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was going to do some more cleaning this morning before he went to Chris's birthday party does that smell weird when I hear birthday party for a full-grown person the Christmas party we made a pavlova for it last night but it tasted like chicken for some reason because we used one of those little carving mixers so rocket bought the ingredients feel like a fresh par this morning I was sleeping I would have woken up earlier but we accidentally stayed after 3:00 a.m. playing um overcook which is a cooking game which means I should be pretty good at this pavlova thing I think transformation got wearing a boo-boo so they can fit all of Chris's food into my stomach are you gonna wear a muumuu - no I'm wearing sparkly sucker for the occasion and the path really good baby look at this path sweet path so come some limes off a Rando tree ah now straight didn't but doesn't belong to anyone does it honey you guys we made a lot cut and we didn't even have butt up we we just improvise whoops I forgot to clean yesterday so I'm thinking I start with underneath here so I need to store things I can put them underneath the bed I'm sure I have things that I haven't touched for years and so they're gonna go into the box for giving to people or donating I think I'm gonna sort through all my brushes and pencils as well because I just have so much that I don't use and then I'll pop all the jars in there so that it the desk is more decluttered I mean I like having a clean space but cleaning for me so freaking exhausting I hate it okay this is a lot more stuff than I thought it was gonna be this is only like 2/3 of what's under there and this I thought was organized but looking at it because I don't go onto here as much this is not good this is all packaging stuff such a hoard oh my gosh okay so I'm going to sort out this half of the stuff first I mean just to see what's in these especially this side because I think this is old paid he's actually am i interested or am i terrified I don't know and then hopefully get to the top today but I'm such a slow cleaner all cleaning [Music] you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] QA time time okay so lots of people have been asking apparently according to this little Q&A question Anthony peach hashtag there's one that I really like it's like dude let me get you a dog yet I guys it's not my fault it's constantly like there's people starting petitions feel really constantly commenting me like what the hell rocket why have you even shot a dog yet I am NOT responsible for the lack of dog in our life it's true he just seems that way because I always ask for one and he has to say no because he knows we can't guess right we're renters so it's hard to get places if you have a dog so then we thought we could foster so we went through the whole process after out who was subleasing off said that we could have animals and then we went through the whole process of filling in the phones all that stuff and you know it was really sad cuz he just did a backflip was like actually just don't feel like you should have won and then I was like just my life goal just thrown out into the trash just I feel like living ready anyway this is Remy we're just looking off there for the weekend yeah it's not actually a dog we tricked you I wish she could look she's so sweet she's such a little gentle she's she's just she's so sweet you know so sweet this is our little Duggar for the present time enjoy why you can't what was your worst travel experience rocket has really had a bad one I've had a few hiccups I was once held up at gunpoint in my own hotel room and had a gun like a big big like ak-47 looking thing kind of pinned against my head and I was in a corner and they stole all my camera gear and Rockets favorite detail they threw a brick at hey hey they throw a brick at me I was experiences when this lady paid on the plane next to me in the seats like she was complaining the whole time because I was a bit of a lay Jews well I was like that's alright whatever because we had government a free trip to Tasmania so I can we chilled up I'll just like dipped it oh she's like how can you be so relaxed I was like yeah well we can't Chaney tea like usually I'd be like ah I think we cannot change anything so what's the point of getting mad and then she was like oh okay and then she drank like three bottles of wine because they gave extra drinks and so she basically got up at the end of the flight and there was just a puddle of piss what artists do you admire and who inspires you in your own work it always changes but for a long time and at the moment I really might Rebecca green she's so good she's amazing she's so good and she recently like I read rocket a post today that she posted yesterday and it was about like how she has creative blocking oh my god it's so real and just so nice yeah I think that her work is incredible the way she documents it is incredible she's written her first debut book is apparently amazing and also the way that she like documents projects on her journal the her blog is really really good too so I'm just like goals yeah looks amazing she's great check out Rebecca green bang what is a medium you have yet to try and would like to link Teddy's gouache I've only done a couple of gouache painting so far but I'm hoping to explore them and I actually have a group show in at the start of the year where you have to make something in a medium that yeah I'm familiar with oh that you're learning so that's gonna be what I use how do you get all those speed customers how do you start I would say they come when you look like you know what you're doing so basically fake it till you make no no I don't even mean that I mean they just just don't focus on that side and just share your work all the time because if you're not sharing what you're capable of halel anyone know what you're capable of and if there's a type of work that you want to create create it for yourself put it up and then start interacting with brands on so you could even just say message them like their photos or something I don't really do that but that would be I think a good way especially if there's smaller brands hmm and then once you do work with smaller brands larger companies will probably trust you more because they've seen that you've actually done commercial and it isn't necessary but I thought I think that when I because I have experience in like an agency setting I work really well with clients and that I know what they're expecting in terms of presenting ideas in terms of like contract in terms of all this stuff it's good to get a business understanding about things as well when working with larger clients what about you work with big clients to what about like um so this is a good example how did you get your your your Sydney Film Festival like yes if they just like worked with them as just like a run-and-gun sort of photographer okay so they're shooting like the little bits and pieces like nothing that was like the the special hero imagery I was just like filling in like socials and just like yeah kind of boring stuff was like yeah it cool just just getting it done and then after that they're like wow like he's a movie it's like really good let's get him on this stuff and then I was just like kind of estoppel of suit maybe like maybe don't be afraid to do the still work while at the same time showing what you're capable of like don't be afraid to take on the the not ideal commercial jobs while at the same time excelling in those jobs to show people what you're really really capable of yeah I understand do you have any tips on how to make my art more noticed out there so more people can see it also how did you come up with your username that you use for your social media there are some all things you can do obviously like hashtags and like whatever maybe the most important thing is sharing good work like people are so Slyke obsessed with like how do you get a following blah blah but if you're putting work out there that you like and your interaction with people you admire eventually people will find you I just really feel like the best way to do it is work work work work yeah and I think as well like you can sort of see when somebody doesn't fully like put their heart into they work like if it's just like you pursuing something that's really odd and you're like no one will really be interested like you'll find your needs you'll eventually find any like it's like like putting everything into it I'd rather follow someone that's like really different than something I've not seen that's a little bit less technically able than someone that's doing that same thing as everyone else exactly because why not just follow the other person like the biggest person in that field yeah and to get to the point of knowing what you're doing there's like thousands of hours of work behind it so work work work it's a very indirect way to get noticed but it's like the the purest way I mean you might be able to make it work with doing like hash tag this hash tag that whatever although like and everything you can still do time pushing that but I mean you're gonna get more of a genuine sort of base yeah also how did you come up your username I just needed a tumblr URL so I like the word peach and the rest is history so where is all your angst the art it's like you skip the emo phase or what she did not skip the emo and you didn't even know me but every day there's photos swoopy friend didn't like colored hair kay and I really like emo music and I still isn't every day anyway Emer face I feel like they mean like Doc or something yeah yeah maybe this thought it was a little darker no but I feel like lately I'm just fully embraced like screw it just do happier just do it if I'm gonna do it might as well just do it full on instead of just being like oh I'm not cool yeah there's been like a few phases where Sean's like challenge me immune like oh you're saying about happier how you just it's just like not cool and it's like edgy art is yeah like you you concerns that people perceiving you is it is more like not taking meat my work Susie it's not like depressed but then in the end I'm just like I'm never gonna be able to make like really doc work that's good and it really conveys like something that people can relate to so I'm just gonna make my own world of happiness and that's fine yeah which kind of goes back to that previous question if just like make what you want and then don't get too caught up without like what you feel like should be made yeah I don't know how you met rocket and tell us a bit of how your love story started basically we we ended up going to the same Senior High School which is year 11 and 12 here I'd spotted him in the playroom but I didn't really know as him I just just like all that men's wearing jeans is cool he's cool and I spotted her and I was like oh that lady's got dimples she's cool and we were in the same visual design class that Friday I think you just missed a few days of school or something I don't remember anyway so I came in and then we were doing color wheels I still have that color that's over there well I try to throw it away but you forced me to keep it yeah rocky didn't have any blue great paint even though you could have totally mixed his own blue gray paint from blue and green and it went to the teacher who was standing next to me I don't have any blue green paint and I was like I have some and then you use something like a scab that you are and then we ever going to the zoo two days later and then that afternoon we'll like yeah that's that's not it all right next question so any kids for learning art from scratch some ideas on getting started would be great love you peach he's a dog I for learning a new medium is that what the question is learning from scratch without learning from scratch so I would say just get some cheap versions of that medium and start hmm like even if you have no idea like see what the consistency is like see how it dries see what the colors are like at the same time is doing that you can look up YouTube videos like you have so much of your disposal and I think people are overwhelmed with the amount of information that they have wore they're overwhelmed with wanting it to be like the conditions to be absolutely perfect before they start but this like the first watercolors I did with the freaking worst and I was using the watercolors the ships of paper just start making stuff you can read a whole entire novel about doing gouache and you won't know how to do it unless you actually start doing it can I also add my little two cents Esmond I know that you are shown Esmond Esmond no I think it's also really good to find fine artists that inspire you but then look at their stuff from years ago because it's so discouraging just to be like oh my god my work is nothing at all near as good as theirs but it's like well like Shonda said she was using really suits and she's using really stupid I'm sure if you find her work from when she was 18 and like you're 18 as an example you'd be like whoa that's not too far off and then you can progress just like she did and you totally can because my old my work is on the Internet embarrassingly I feel like it's not as easy to find everyone's work but for me it's like all on the internet so it's like pretty bad go to tumblr very embarrassing when is your working hour do you prefer to work day or night okay being nocturnal though I like to work in both I like the day light of day but I work so much better at nine times annoying yes true I wish I could take sprinklings of eight yeah like your visual is all like bright yeah super bright and then like you've got this big bright space but she stays up for like four am I can pal it through the night really easy I think I also like it just cuz it's so quiet there's no planes there's no drilling next door yeah it's just nice and quiet and there's nothing to really distract me it's Jade I know let's go to a cafe oh it's just so strange because I really like the daytime like I just wanna be awake all the time how do you keep yourself in projects organized you use planners or journals at all I hope you will hope you're also well outside designing my eye well there's a little journal behind us the cheese's it's very cute yep I prefer I'm writing down my to-do list so if I'm on the girl use wonder list to write down things that I need to remember fit in the studio I've already talked about this one another Q&A but basically about a 12 code with like a really big goal to do this so for example second book is where the Gaza it's really like huge goals and projects and then I've got my journal every week I write down the list of things I need to do that week and then every day I'll drag over what I'll do that day doesn't seem that like efficient but to me it's like a way of working it out in my head yeah yeah you know Esther again would you love to get a wood sorry I would love to get a print on my wall like the one with the West are you focusing more on client book deals etcetera the moment the end of last year was focusing so much on client work like the the last three months of washy was crazy like I almost had like several breakdowns yeah just too crazy so my main things a client work my book solo shows and my stuff so basically just do everything yeah kind of continued as as you wear with 2017 but really trying yeah to keep your eyes peeled cast because that still will be restocked and a whole bunch of awesome ideas uni flow and right through it and he's my advertising agency that's me you can contact me rocket and rocket could do you feel that your travels influence or inform your artwork how so I feel like not directly I feel like my work is is like a mixture of places I've been and like in places I want to go but I feel like my truck travel influences my work in the way that when I'm away by the time I'm back I'm like ready to go and I've thought I've basically not been able to work and I've only had time to think if like you say that and I just remember when we're in the States and every time we've ever traveled it's always been like the last like two to three days of the trip you're like stress freaking out being like I just want to do this I can do this I want to make this this this is gonna be in my store I feel like it takes a week for me to get really itchy paws where I want to go back to the studio and then two weeks is like going a bit crazier than three says like get me back home I don't want to be here anymore yeah in that late indirectly it drives me to work like I feel like I need to travel if I'm burnt out to be able to come back and be fresh like with London before before you get to London I was so burnt I'm like so create creative blocky but then afterwards I felt so inspired mmm so anyway that's the end of the Q&A hope you enjoyed it I just want to thank a 10% discount Thank You Squarespace woo Willis I hope you like this video I like watching people clean because then I don't have to do it so I hope that it made you feel motivated and like you achieve something because this was oh my gosh this was like four days of absolute hell for me because I hate cleaning I hate cleaning the whole today I was just like oh my god what am i doing in my life I feel like I've been cleaning forever it looks good that looks so good yeah it looks nice I'm excited to get into the new year ruin it [Music] you I hate Queen
