all right here's the situation I asked you guys for some hypixel challenges and basically the concept is quite simple if I win a challenge cool awesome but if I lose a challenge I have to give away money on hypixel Skyblock sounds good before we get into so have fun earning join the giveaway and enjoy the video ok so here we go Romney or on solo skywars because I don't have well you get the joke right now it's a Christmas map apparently that's cool so I can only use a wooden sword that doesn't seem like it'll be too much of an issue I don't have my nickname on so people are gonna see my youtube link and assume that I'm better than I actually am alright let's do it so we've only got a wooden sword to start with that is fine I guess we need to play bed Wars yeah that's it . would you come to play bed was like normal we just can't upgrade our sword i don't think this is gonna be too much of a hassle to be honest see my usual bed willis strategy is just rush people i don't even care about protecting my bed to be honest so this could technically be a protect your bed challenge as well because I just like getting getting my the items and going for I should probably get some tolls though should probably get at that can't afford Ava doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo what kind of both gold both yeah arrows yeah they would come in handy we're gonna start with some shears we don't  have stuff on you know whatever we're not even gonna upgrade at the minute we're just gonna try to build to the nearest person he's probably over there the Green Team or we could go with the Aqua team now we're gonna go green so let's do it yo this guy's building out as well he's got the same strategy rush someone I should have bought a bow and arrow that would be in sick I would have smoked this guy so I'm hoping he doesn't see me oh he sees me nice it's fine if he wants to build over to me he can build over to me I got a wooden sword what's he got really a stone to be honest okay let's get a bow let's get a few arrows I don't have enough money for any hey at least I can get she is and a pickaxe I just need one gold how long does this freaking take to spawn Jesus a few moments later nice okay cool alright so we can buy our arrows which is what I want and we can also get an axe because why not alright now we're good to go so let's build over to the green team and smoke him he doesn't have a bloody bow he can't get me from range I don't know what his plan is I mean I'm glad I picked up a pickaxe because he has clay down I think it looks like he's buying a bow to be honest so I'm gonna have to protect myself this isn't really protecting myself I'm gonna build upwards that's what I'm gonna do come on build over your flock see what happens see what happens where you got to go now poor home where you going where you going full are you he dodged that I can already foresee he's gonna jump on to me that was such a stupid move on my behalf I don't think before I do things in Minecraft anymore where do you even go did he fall out the world oh he did I could have man so if I was a good player I would have played that a lot more strategical why am i using my hands when I have she is this is what I'm talking about now I've just got to break his bed and we're good to go he's gonna try build out go for it see what happens what I might do is I might break some of this behind me but I'm not gonna catch it my he's up there now I can see him fooled across one I can see your ma I can see you down there I need one more block from from here maybe put a bit of a staircase yeah that works now I've got two more blocks and I can see the guy right there so what what the just happened old Jesus oh Jesus no he thinks I've I've left he thinks I've left as he really think I've left see you bed see you bed see you see you wooden sword challenge too easy epic gift yeah alright where's the shopkeeper can I use this guy here I don't know what that did bring - any shot Wow 53 iron is that what I got well someone broke my bed so that's not cool wait no they haven't I thought someone broke in my bed okay um that's fine then I can upgrade my armor why haven't I yet Jesus so anything else I can upgrade while I'm at it um get a fireball why not that might help probably go over a few more arrows to be honest that would be nice and I need a little bit more wall while we're at it okay who's our next victim how I'm gonna go with aqua he's all the way down there no it's not he's right there I'm gonna go to my base first and just get a crap ton of wall now the items are coming through look at that I'm gonna get as much wall as I can possibly get so I can pull it over to him or nearly oh yeah I can easily take out this guy come on let me just collect my resources that have been gathering up yeah I'll give me give me the gift whatever it is bring two shopkeeper I just got an achievement is that just some coins and some XP whatever I'll take it might as well protect my bed extra I guess no this is really protecting bed but okay has so the easiest way to get to the Aqua team is just to build straight across I'm just saying aqua team's here I'm gonna go to him before he goes to me thanks mate see you mate and his beds gone and White has taken care of him no it's just what do I do it why does he have diamond armor oh my god he's gonna be so good at this game don't know what to do against him and I can't even operate my sword it's fine it's fine we can take him guys don't forget I'm not your average bed wolves player I am a lot worse he's just he has doesn't he I'm gonna take these diamonds and I need to get myself a diamond pickaxe apparently he's put down obsidian that is incredibly annoying looks like we've already lost a challenge I mean I've done I've done pretty pretty well I must say made it to the final two without without an actual sword or with a weaver wooden sword might I say tools how do we get a better one upgrade upgrade upgrade nice right now it's just a matter of taking him out so he's so he's gone well he's responding I'm going to go ahead and mind that obsidian it's just a matter of taking him out actually don't know how I'm gonna do that but we'll see oh wow he's got like a power 20 bow yeah well we tell yo yo yo alright there's not a lot I can do against this guy to be honest he's got strongest bow in the game that was almost a land beds gone easy he's gonna take out my bed as well oh god it's fine you can take home my bed you little piece of Oh while he's distracted yeah the snake attack no it's okay it's okay he's gonna come back he's gonna come back to me I'm the ace side here he's easy has to run back to me quick quick quick the potions I don't want potions I want utilities just give me fireballs and an interval I don't even have a minutes where you at what are you gonna do from all the way over there that is my question he's got a power 20 bow that's what he's gonna do from all the way over there all I need is him to get on this bridge and then I can throw my fireballs and good night that is my plan in the meantime though I can oh I can use the your your bow against you do you want to wait till dragons no sorry I don't know what that is and I'm frankly I don't I don't doesn't want to not that is it sounds too too dangerous for me he doesn't want to wait till dragons evil he just wants to come straight for the win oh oh oh he's backing up a bit oh we missed Oh nearly killed him okay I've obviously got the pvp advantage over him you know I'll play his game I'll meet him in the middle come on I've only got a wooden sword mate what are you scared about fair fight I'll let you come in you have a diamond sword night he wants a fair fight but I'm not buying it man I I know his kind he's up for a trick speed to potion oh yes ah even better invisibility oh here we go this is this is going to be sick I can pull this off I'm the best Dead Wars player of all time he won't see me Willy what if I can I take my arm off I can't I can't okay that's fine we drink this what happens to us I go invisible and I'll get some speed ah he is done he is done I've gone I've gone right alright so we're here on non Skyblock with our 93k purse now the first thing we need to do is go to our auction master because I'm pretty sure if I if I'm not mistaken I sold a rogue sword for 3 million coins so let me let me collect the auction and how much did I sell the melon for three hundred and sixty-four thousand so that's also also kind of good thank you my boy all right we've got 2.4 millets let's let's go for I guess see the issue is you can't just send people money you have to bid on an auction so what we can do is just say something like who has an option I can bid on just keep it nice and simple now obviously I lost the challenge so I need to give away more money the first person was ACORN /h acorns doesn't okay you're a liar then is there any unranked players how about slush this guy here he does he has 64 bone let's place a little bit of an amount shall we let's bid how about a million coins on some bones that sounds like a fair bid let's let's do it yes I was waiting for that but there we go we've just given away 1 million coins losing a game of bed wars so next challenge I guess I pick subscribe block but you actually play like a normal person no no I can't do that one madam x7 bid on my watermelon watermelon two coins alright let's go let's go 100,000 that's pretty good I'm happy to bid on a watermelon for a hundred thousand that's a pretty fair price well a bomb out Dana I just want another bid you know what whatever whatever we'll go for it I mean what's the worst that could happen now 150 thousand cool cool submit nice alright that's enough for this dude let's let's do another another challenge nearly impossible challenge win a game of blitz oh let's do it then no such thing as an impossible challenge when it comes to mad mecha 7 I just can't win them parent we're gonna go to wet where is it where is blitz of rival games anyway oh my god is it that hole now there we go blitz SG right down the bottom diamond sword let's play so blitz survival games if you've never played because it used to be very popular but I don't then I wouldn't call it the most popular high pixel mini game at the moment a lot of people still play but it's basically like imagine what high pixel has done to sky block but with survival games luck survival games but RPG and alright let's let's pick a kit I forgot I had all of them now because I'm gonna I'm a youtube rank but I don't know which one to choose you know I'm gonna go I'm gonna go random because yeah I can't choose so apparently this is the impossible challenge if I lose I'm gonna give away a million coins that's it I won't be left with much but I don't really care someone else will find a better use use for them coins than me I'm pretty sure I'm still on the random kit yeah I'm I'm happy with that it will affect selector speed I guess it's the only one I have alright let's run let's rush to the chest mid and grab ourselves something we got arrows and a present somebody's already killing me are you serious you  we're back on Skyblock and we've lost the final challenge of the video so I guess it's time to say goodbye to my purse and we're gonna say in the chat nice this will get everyone going all right guess I'm hot going and let's  I need to think of a question I think we should do something minecraft related nice and simple oh who was it who was it it was not Ellie is alive nice one they they have one they have 1/8 H Ally is live nice one pretty good and Sean at quartz I could go as some in China quartz I'm gonna put down 1 2 3 1 million coins pretty fair

Christ Jesus crust cheese Jesus Christ the winner is xbq be simple cool 100k nice alright guys so that is going to do it for our hypixel challenges and if I lose I lose money on Skyblock I guess if
