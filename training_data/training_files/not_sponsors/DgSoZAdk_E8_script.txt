these are the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video and now finally we can talk about ricin 3000 boost results it took me quite a bit of time because I had so many results in the survey that it took me 2 or 3 days just to go through all the results to sort them to put them into graphs to clean the data because obviously you have some trolls in there and also I'm reading all the comments in total we had almost three thousand submissions actually up to now it's over 3000 submissions but I stopped taking submissions on Sunday which means that all the data I have write on my table is from Sunday and all other submissions were not taken into account simply because I didn't want to give vendors too much time to react on this survey you never know what's going on behind the scenes we want to keep this data as clean as possible we will talk about some of the aspects of the survey in detail in a minute for now we will just talk about the submissions themselves and just to give you an insight we had 2726 submissions Sunday evening with 40% the 3,700 X followed with 27 26 % by the 3900 X 21% 3,600 followed by only 7% 3,600 X and only 6% 3800 X which was kind of expected actually I expected to have even less results for the 3,800 3,800 X but it's cool for 3,700 X we have over a thousand submissions and for 3900 X we have about 720 if I remember correctly so that's a lot of data obviously I went through each single result and checked it if it's in line with the agiza the main board if it was stated correctly and some of you also put into the comments for example that they were not sure about the agiza version but then they stated for example BIOS version included screenshots I checked all that every single one and sometimes if for example you were not sure which BIOS version it was then I'd went to the main door website and checked with the BIOS version and then edited it mineral many to fix for example the ease abortion so that took almost three days to just go through all of this and put it into graphs to make sure that all the data is correct before we continue I will just reply to some comments which I found interesting or some comments which I used to filter out results for example I had one comment where somebody was saying that he was using a chiller with ten degrees Celsius water temperature for example I removed this result because it would simply not be in line with the normal application then I also had results where people were saying they used PBO so precision boost overdrive and I specifically asked not to use this feature but because it can influence the CPU in both ways it can for some CPUs caused a lower boost it can for some CPUs cause a higher boost therefore it's giving us measurement errors and that's something we don't want that's why I excluded comments or excluded submissions which stated that PBO was active in the comments then I had the question multiple times why are we using Cinebench r15 single threaded load and also hardware info for monitoring and for example not Rison master that simply because I got the recommendation from a and B to do exactly this AMD asked or said I should do Cinebench r15 single and then also use hardware info monitoring adjusted to 500 milliseconds per polling period and also disable an unnecessary monitoring and that's exactly what we did so that wasn't a recommendation from AMD side and yeah we were just following what AMD recommended one more thing I would like to address before we start with the analysis is the hardware unboxed mainboard analysis video a lot of you commented in my previous video that now hardware and box was investigating that or just basically found out that the boost might be mainboard dependent and that it would probably or that each CPU can probably hit a maximum boost but it just depend and depends on your main word from what I know it's unfortunately not that easy it's also it's not only mainboard dependent it's also a geezer version dependent what you obviously know but then you also have the SMU which is something for example with the Intel management engine it just another part you have when you're flashing the bios there's a g√©za inside and also the SMU and you can for example have the same aqui subversion but a different SMU version and the SMU version is mainly important when it comes to the boost clock itself so it's very difficult to just compare a mainboard when it comes to boost you also need to know for example what a geezer version and what SMU version if we if we are looking at the hardware and box the day time I mean it's very good investigation what he was doing for sure but I was looking for example at the x5 70 hours extreme and I thought in his case it was boosting with the 3800 x2 four point five four point five five four point four seven five so it was boosting really really well but if I was just extracting the x5 70 hours extreme data out of my survey it didn't look that great but we will take a look at those numbers in a minute two more things I would like to address before we start with the survey and those things are coming from AMD directly as a response to my survey some questions they had and one question was how am I going to control the people are using the correct Windows version and that's a very difficult question from my opinion it shouldn't matter what kind of Windows version you are using and if it matters if for example the CPU boosts only on a very specific Windows version then AMD has to state that you should only use this specific Windows version and for example it should not be compatible to Windows 7 but some people are still using Windows 7 these days but they don't know that maybe they have less performance so they should be aware if that's the case if they can expect only 200 megahertz less then AMD should state if that's the case then a me also said how likely is it that people are probably met or some people are experiencing a low boost and therefore they are more willing to participate in a survey simply very similar to what you would have for example with Amazon reviews it's very likely that somebody who's unhappy with the product is more willing to just put a negative review on there while somebody who's just happy with the product will sit at home and not care about yeah writing a review about that that's a very solid point and for sure that's likely but I think from what I've also seen in the comments of my survey and from I can see on the comments on my youtube channel we have a lot of I would say hard core AMD fanboys to be friendly and for sure they are also influencing this survey so there are a lot of people who are happy with the products and they want to put in AMD in a better light and then we have people who are hating on AMD and they want to put them in a bad light and I'm pretty sure that there is a certain balance to that so of course it's always possible that people are mad and therefore more willing to participate in a survey but that's nothing I have control on but that's something you have to keep in mind when we are looking at the data let's start with the analysis risin 530 600 comes first if you just take a look at the top left corner you can see that we have we had 568 results that was after I cleaned like the troll results which was typically four or five results per CPU so it's about 1% that's something we can completely neglect then if you just look at the graph itself all those individual bars are individual results for the given clock for example we had 245 results with a max boost of 4.2 gigahertz which is also what the CPU was advertised at now if you look to the left and to the right you can see minus 2 Sigma and plus 2 Sigma and if we do is kind of Gauss distribution the Sigma values are extremely important because typically you calculate those values minus 2 and plus 2 Sigma and everything that's below minus 2 and above plus 2 Sigma is considered measurement error and will not be taken into account that's mainly because they are either measurement error or they are just handed in wrong into the survey that's why when you do this kind of analysis that's something you learn at University you always even if it's like a technical analysis if for example you're doing some CNC work and you're manufacturing a thousand parts and you're measuring let's say the tolerance of the parts then you will also get this kind of gauss distribution and it's very helpful for analysis for example for mass production parts that's something you always do and that's why we're also in this case doing the minus 2 and plus 2 Sigma because it's really important for a 3,600 X we had the minus 2 Sigma hat 4015 megahertz and for the plus 2 Sigma we headed at 4300 megahertz exactly so everything above 4,300 for example we had one result you can see on the bottom right with 4400 one with one result with 4375 those are considered measurement tolerance but it's not only the positive results but also the ones that are extremely negative where I don't know like a main board is doing something wrong or you have some obscure biospark looking at the result itself we had 270 out of 542 results which were within spec and so they were hitting the advertised boost clock of 4.2 gigahertz so basically 50% of the CPUs were hitting 4.2 and 50% were not hitting 4.2 the thing is what we have to keep in mind is that this is the maximum singer core boost which we were seeing if you participated and if you did the measurement for this survey you also experienced this that for example one CPU is pushed in to 4.4 but only for a second then it goes back down to four point three five four point three four point 35 maybe for a second back to four point four but the maximum boost is not what we have during the benchmark typically all of the time but we're still only taking a look at the best-case-scenario but even in the best case scenario only 50% of the 3600 we're hitting the advertised boost or above and now it's getting more interesting because we're taking a look at the 3600 X and we're ramping up because all the following CPUs will have an even higher advertised boost for 3600 X we had 190 results minus 2 Sigma 4143 plus 2 Sigma 44 97 you can always take a look at those charge charts but just pausing the video 180 out of 190 results were considered a valid because 10 results were below or above the minus and plus 2 Sigma if we're taking a look at the boost itself only 17 out of 180 results were hitting the advertised boost or above 3 were above with 44 25 and 44 50 14 CPUs were hitting the 4400 and yeah 90% of the CPUs for the 3600 X were not hitting the advertised most of 4.40 Hertz 3700 xyn probably also the most important results for this survey because it's with the most results over 1,000 results minus 2 Sigma 42 11 plus 2 Sigma 42 77 you can see a lot of results which were underneath like two results at 40 50 which yeah you can see that something there is wrong but above the plasto Sigma we only had very little amount of results like one at four point six seven five and those results are considered invalid 1036 out of 1087 results were considered valid going by the Gauss distribution and looking at the boost itself 153 out of a thousand 39 CPUs that's only fourteen point seven percent were hitting the advertised boost or above we had nineteen CPUs hitting above that root has boost still within the plus 2 Sigma if we were stretching the plus 2 Sigma a bit there would be five more results so four point five years maybe that's still valid but yeah the majority 85 percent of the CPUs were not hitting the advertised boost for the 3700 X most of them were hitting 4375 which you can see it's four hundred and fifteen results and some people might argue but isn't that already 4.4 gigahertz no it's not you cannot do that you cannot just round up and argue that this is four point four especially considering that we're taking a look at the max senior core boost in typical application and even doing single threaded load like Cinebench r15 your boost is lower so all those people who are saying okay 4375 is what we saw max most of the time they will have like forty three twenty five or forty three hundred during Cinebench r15 that's why we cannot simply round up that's not how it works next cpu is the 3800 X which was my biggest hope mainly because aim D is saying it's a higher wind 3700 X so I was assuming that yeah it has still eight course it was a higher bin than the 3700 X so I had hope that more of those CPUs would reach the advertised boost however we all so only have 159 results with the 3800 X which was obvious because it's kind of useless CPU I wouldn't recommend to buy 150 out of the 159 results are considered valid you can see some down below like forty one fifty forty one seventy-five megahertz clearly there's something completely wrong for example with the mainboard piles but everything above seems to be kind of in line with what we've seen previously thirty-nine CPUs hit that wood has boost or above equalling about 75 percent not hitting the boost again a lot of CPUs were really really close 4475 you can see forty eight results but again most of those CPUs will not maintain the boost during the benchmark so we cannot just roundup lasts if you 3900 X and this is probably also the most critical if you were talking about because currently this is the CPU with the highest advertised boost for point six and also considering that 3950 X is coming up with advertised four point seven boost not so sure to be honest we had 722 results - two sigma 42 38 + 2 a plus 2 Sigma 47 11 I think there was no result above because the highest max I can see is 4700 but that's just how the gauss distribution works you can see a lot of results were underneath like 40 25 40 50 obviously there's something wrong with the BIOS or I don't know with a set up itself that's why those results are considered invalid 685 results out of the 722 are within the Sigma and looking at the boost 38 out of 674 CPUs and that's only 5% are hitting the advertised boost or above everything else is way below and again they're below like below below you're hitting for example 4550 but that's still only the max you get for a second and then it's going down to like 45 40 475 something in this direction that's why we cannot run up again I think I already said it four times but I just want to repeat it once more which means that 95% of the 3900 X out of the survey are not hitting the advertised boost and that's much worse than what I initially expected you know when I did my first video about this whole topic when I did my first rise in 3000 topic I was kind of mad that for whatever reason I could not get what the CPU was advertised at and I thought that I was doing something wrong that's why I had this small table small chart in my video and said hey none of the CPUs were hitting the boost in my case and I was not sure if it was just me doing some mistakes or I don't know and looking at the other launch we use from Rison 3000 nobody else was addressing this problem and a lot of people were saying a Roman it must be your mistake because nobody else is reporting this problem but looking at this data that 95% of the 3900 and 900 X are not hitting the 4.6 pretty sure it was not my mistake one last thing we're doing is doing a specific mainboard analysis because again harder unboxed did a video where he was saying that in his testing the x5 70 hours extreme was boosting really well and it seems to be made more dependent that's why we're just looking at the x5 70 hours extreme with the 3900 X in our case five out of twenty seven results were hitting the advertised boosts or above doesn't look good to be honest one more comparison with the x5 70 hours elite 37 results I just picked this because I think this was the highest amount of boards I had in combination with the 3900 x2 out of the 37 results were hitting Dara Ty's boost doesn't really look that simple to me doesn't really look like you can just buy an hours extreme and everything is fixed I don't think that this is solution solution seems to be more dependent on your individual CPU the SMU version the Geezer version and I don't know the back of rice that's just that just fell over in China I thought I really don't know what the problem is and you know that there was this statement from shamino who is also working for asus and he's working at asus R&D and he also stated that from what he knows aim D has no idea how to fix this or has no intention to fix this and what he thinks is that due to their perspective and longevity aim D might not increase the boost because they think if they're increasing the boost maybe they have to really push weak or extremely high to get this boost they think they might damage the CPUs that's what he was saying it's not an official Asus statement but that's what shamino is saying was working at Asus our D and from experience he's an extremely talented and intelligent guy I would trust what he thinks and I would trust that this is nothing that can simply be fixed by one BIOS update and we have the boosts across all CPUs that are used out there I don't really know what to say to be honest the result is much worse than what I expected again keep in mind what I said at the beginning when we were doing a public survey what can be the negative influence about this but I'm pretty sure that I was not wrong that yeah the CPUs in general just cannot hit the boost and probably it's just the silicon quality is maybe not good enough again I clearly want to state I absolutely recommend buying those CPUs if you're especially like a content creator and you don't have that much money you're going for a 3600 if you have like unlimited budget then you should maybe consider the 3900 eggs over ninety nine hundred K simply because you get so much more mostly studying performance for the money but that's nothing I want to criticize that's just I simply want to make here I absolutely love those CPUs they have an absolutely great value for what you get but why did AMD feel that it's necessary to advertise boost or give the people false expectations and false hope for something they cannot get why did they have to do 3900 X at 4.6 when they probably clearly know that most of the stall CPUs will never maintain this speed it's clearly it was never necessary to do this it's a completely unnecessary the CPUs are good enough the way they are they deliver and they're good but those frequency values are just completely wrong let me know what you think about those results if you want to see more data I should pull out of the survey like very special analysis let me know down in the comments below see you soon [Music] [Music]
