hello this is chef john from food
whooshes calm with Pizza Rustica that's right I am very happy to be sharing this
traditional Easter recipe which a lot of people describe as an Italian meat
filled quiche but to me it's way closer to a savory cheesecake so if you've ever
been enjoying a slice of that and thought to yourself I wish this wasn't
sweet and also had salami and pepperoni in it are gonna love this but no
matter how describe it it's definitely not like pizza although it is
pretty Rustica and very very delicious so with that let's go ahead and get
started with the dough for our crust which will begin with some all-purpose
flour a little bit of salt and then some very very cold butter that we've cut in
slices and as usual the colder the better and I will also add in a couple
tablespoons of olive oil which as can see I'm measuring very carefully and
then what we'll do is take one of these wire pastry cutters and we'll go ahead
and blend that butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs and by
the way if don't have one of these tools can just use your fingertips
to rub all this together which is how between 90 and 95 percent of Italian
grandmothers would do it and then what we'll do once our mixture resembles
something that looks like this is stop and make a little well in the center
with a fork into which we'll pour one beaten egg and then we'll fork late
that for about a minute or until we think that egg is pretty well mixed in
at which point we'll stop and add the last ingredients a splash a nice cold
fresh water and I should mention most of the dough recipes for this call for just
eggs but I think a combo of egg water is a little easier to work with and what
we'll do is give that a very brief mixing with the fork before switching to
our hands with which we will attempt to press this into a ball of dough and if
it seems dry and it's not coming together
definitely sprinkle in some more water like a teaspoon at a time until it does
in fact if I'm being completely objective I think mine was actually a
little too dry and I couldn't used one more splash but anyway it worked just
barely but the point is had enough water so it does come together nicely
and once it does come together we can transfer that onto the table top to
finish it off and then what we'll do once we have manipulated that into a
nice disc of dough let's go ahead and wrap it
plastic and pop in the fridge for at least an hour alright these type of
dough's are always easier to work with once they're cold plus it gives our
flour time to hydrate and if you're not filming it in a big hurry make sure you
press those random crumbs I left that in a table into your dough and then what
we'll do while our dough is resting in the fridge is go ahead and make our
filling which is gonna start with 1 pound of drained ricotta cheese and all
that means is we left it in a strainer over a bowl the night before so that any
of the excess water could drip out and not to brag but I was using a really
good one so now much came out but with your average supermarket variety you're
gonna be surprised just how much moisture does leak out but anyway we
will transfer that to a nice big mixing bowl and add a half a pound of low
moisture mozzarella that we've cut into small cubes and by low-moisture
mozzarella I mean inexpensive and then the last of our cheese additions will be
a couple ounces of finely grated pecorino romano or if want some
parmesan that is up to and since this is an Easter video I think it is
appropriate to say are after all the Jesus of your cheese's and either would
work and then to that we will add a little touch of salt as well as some
freshly ground black pepper at which point we will add 7 large beaten eggs ok
because 6 is not enough 1/8 would be too many and then once the eggs are in it's
time to meet our meats and what I'll be adding is some cooked and crumbled
Italian sausage and I went with the sweet variety but of course a spicy one
would also work we will also toss in some cubed up smoked ham as well as some
type of cubed up salami and then last but not least some pepperoni which I
basically just sliced into strips since it came already sliced but if can
fight it and stick form can go ahead and cube that up just like the salami in
the ham and that's it we'll go ahead and take a big spoon or spatula and give
this a very very very thorough mixing until it's extremely well combined in
fact if you're not sure keep stirring until are and then stir it for
another minute and that's it once thats mixed we'll go ahead pop it in the
fridge until we're ready to use it and then the only other thing we need to
prep would be a 9 inch springform pan that we've rubbed with olive oil and
dusted with flour and while it is true can cook this another large deep
taking pans or dishes this really is what want to use so call your friend
that does all that baking and safely borrow one from them and that's it once
our dough is rested we can pull it out and unwrap it and cut off about 1/3 for
the top and we'll reserve that while we roll out the rest to fill our pan and of
course as usual we will only use enough flour as needed and we're gonna want to
try to get this to about an eighth of an inch thick and hopefully about 15 inches
wide and remember when I said I thought my deal was a little dry or a see how
it's really splitting around the edges that is one of the tell-tale signs so
next time I'll use a little more water but the good news is because of the way
we're gonna place this in that's not really gonna matter but what does matter
is this is not sticking to the table so I made sure that was not a problem
before carefully rolling up the dough on my pin like this and we're doing that so
it's easier to transfer into our pan and then what we need to do without
stretching the dough out is tuck it into this pan so it's evenly distributed
across the bottom and up the sides and if like me have too much on one side
and not enough on the other can always pull that extra dough off and
dampen it very slightly with some water and then push it into the areas where
it's needed okay in a perfect world roll that out uniformly and then placed
it in absolutely centered but know what I've never lived in that world and
probably haven't either so for people like us we're gonna have to do a
little bit of patching and by a little bit I mean a lot and ultimately what we
want to end up with is that dough coming up just past the edge of the pan which I
finally achieve like 10 minutes later but anyway once that's accomplished
we'll go ahead and transfer in our filling and as we do this we want to
make sure there's no air pockets so make sure you're pressing that firmly into
the corners and once that's been transferred and we will smooth out the
top and that's it we will take our remaining dough and roll that out into a
circle that's ideally slightly wider than our pan and then just like the
bottom we'll go ahead and roll that up on our pin and transfer it over the top
oh by the way in the written recipe I'm gonna suggest double the dough
recipe so that have plenty to do this with since this amount did work but
I had like absolutely zero despair which can make it a little trickier and
stressful especially if you're new to baking okay
it's a proven scientific fact that pastries can sense fear and anxiety but
anyway we'll go ahead and get that top cross properly positioned and pressed in
at which point we will take an egg wash and we'll give this a nice brushing and
if you're not sure what an egg wash is it is simply one egg beaten with a
teaspoon of water and then once that surface was sufficiently moistened I
decided to take a knife and go ahead and trim off any excess which is totally
optional but it will give us a little more uniform and cleaner edge and once
that was done it was time to start folding our dough down from the edge
with the crust from the bottom going up over the top of the top crust and thanks
to our egg wash is we kind of push and press that together it should seal
nicely at which point it is time to crimp which can be a little challenging
in this situation because our dough is lower than the top of the pan in fact I
think there was even a song way back when that was called crimping ain't easy
about this very thing so all we're really able to do is sort of go around
poking making indentations like this which is fine because once this is baked
it's gonna look great no matter what did to that edge and that was actually
going pretty well until for some reason I switched directions and proceeded to
slice my finger open on the sharp edge of the pan and at this point I became
much less concerned with crimping and much more concerned about not getting
blood on the crust so I stopped and gave the top one last brushing with our egg
wash after which it was ready to transfer into the center of a 450 degree
oven for just three seconds because as soon as that's in we're gonna
immediately reduce our heat to 350 and let it bake for about an hour and 15 to
20 minutes or until our top is beautifully golden brown and it looks
like this and then very important we need to let it sit just like this for 10
minutes before we carefully remove the ring all right so don't rush that it
needs to cool down a little bit before we proceed alright so let it rest for 10
minutes before spring the ring and if everything's gone according to plan
that crust should be a beautiful light golden brown and fully cooked all the
way through and despite the massive amount of patching I had to do it
actually looked pretty good if I do say so myself which is why I transferred it
onto a cake Stan even though I was too chicken
take off the bottom and I took way too many pictures but that's okay
because after Deering this thing definitely want to let it cool for about
15 minutes or so before slice in otherwise it still might be a little bit
loose inside so like I said I'll let mine sit about 15 minutes before cutting
out a nice big wedge which for the first piece taken out of this went
surprisingly well and that my friends if you've never seen
it before is what a proper slice a pizza Rustica should look like at least
according to me and if you're wondering what it tastes like I have some great
news it tastes exactly like what it looks like just an absolute
embarrassment of riches of Italian meats and cheeses with just enough egg to
somehow hold this all together and of course I'll state the obvious until you
can make this with whatever combination of meeting Jesus want or can add
different cheeses like provolone or fontina or different meats like Coppa or
prosciutto or of course gabagool as would several other Italian meats I
can't pronounce and I was just about to start telling how nice and flaky
this crust was but know what when it comes to Pizza Rustica nobody cares
about the crust it is simply here to hold all this massive amount of goodness
together and then it's fairly light and flaky and tender is just an added bonus
but anyway that's it my take on Pizza Rustica which like I said earlier is
nothing like a quiche so if you're one of these people please stop describing
it like that okay it's way closer to a savory cheesecake containing dangerous
quantities of meat and whether end up making this for your Easter Sunday
celebration or for some other occasion special or otherwise I really do hope
give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the

as always enjoy
