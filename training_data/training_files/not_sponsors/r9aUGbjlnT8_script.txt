don't worry I'm not starting a vlog it's not too bad actually this is the first installment in a series called something something where I talk about what it takes to make stuff and this online store make it with Squarespace I feel like this would be better served here I'm still getting it all figured out sorry so it's been about three months since I released a video entitled I made a movie it stunk it's since become a rather noteworthy part of my online presence for a number of reasons first off clocking in at a little over 30 minutes it's the second longest video that I've ever released on my channel it's also managed to accrue over half a million views which is quite unheard of for a video centered around original content and not like the latest blockbuster film franchise and of course I consider it noteworthy because it's an intensely personal video that covers an important time in my life and has vicariously hit at many of its viewers more intimate and private vulnerabilities I've received more messages emails and correspondence from this video than any other thing I have ever made period these messages are like the video that inspired them intensely personal for whatever reason people have felt completely comfortable baring their souls and these messages telling me things they've likely never told anyone else I've struggled a lot with determining how I should respond to these messages I had originally planned on making a follow-up video the month after I posted the retrospective but these emails kept coming and they're still arriving in my inbox every day as the original video slowly but surely spreads across the internet well over a hundred of these messages now sit in my inbox and I have responded to absolutely none of them how could I some of these emails are several pages long and they seem to cry out for artistic and personal advice that I am in no way qualified to give ultimately I've decided to make this video three months removed from the original posting detailing a few of the messages and then offering what advice I can I'm only human just like you I've had my fair share of shattered dreams and small successes but no amount of these things will make me perfectly capable of providing solutions to the complicated life problems that you or anyone else for that matter faces but you all were kind enough to write me so I'm at least going to try so here are a few of these messages as I said lots of these emails contained very personal information and as I always will I've redacted a lot of things and altered a few names here and there so as to not embarrass anybody who decided to write in this is gonna seem like a really weird video for my channel I have never tested this format before and I'm not sure what to expect so I think it'll be best to just start reading and let the messages speak for themselves first I want to read you this from Jay hi my name is Jay I'm a pittsburgh-based filmmaker ish finishing my last year of film school I'm sure you can understand the uncertainty that comes with that I have a production company that's going nowhere I've had enough failed projects that I'm starting to lose people I could count on and I feel my work doesn't live up to the level it needs to for this industry I've been going through a tough professional time lately I've been editing a music video and facing technical difficulties every step of the way culminating in multiple hard drive failures and losing the project along with two and a half years of work it's been tough I love filmmaking it's the only thing I can do with my life it's my passion my blood it's the only thing that really I wouldn't say makes sense but feels right being said I was at the end of my rope I was dreading waking up in the mornings because I'd have to face everything again losing most of my professional life as well as some personal stuff have left me depressed and just fighting to try to get back up on my feet but it's not working despite everything I try I felt beaten your video today has been quite frankly inspiring it was everything I needed to hear and a reminder the struggle is worth it it was a reminder of what I love and why I'm willing to fight tooth and claw male 4 this pipe dream it was like looking into a mirror only the mirror could be introspective for the first time in close to a month I feel ready to get back in the fight not that I left thank you for sharing your struggle and your passion I can't properly express just how bloody thankful I am for this today well hey thanks Jay I actually got lots of emails just like this one people who were sort of on the back end of film school and they didn't really have any kind of hope about filmmaking going forward you talked a lot in this email about struggle and failure what was that quote from Benjamin Franklin I haven't failed 700 times I've succeeded in proving 700 ways how not to build a lightbulb it's the one thing that you learn eventually is that failing isn't failure because along the way you're still gaining information and experience right in a video game before you can face that big boss you've got to fight a bunch of smaller battles first a gain experience and level up and then where you level up the stronger you grow and eventually you're able to take on the big boss and win so you know I guess the trick is fail as quickly and as often as possible the vast majority of emails that i dontÂ´t were all about the fear of failing like a lot of them were from aspiring authors lots of people emailed me and told me that they want to write a book and publish it and they wanted advice and the advice I can give is spend six months writing the very best story you can throw it away and then write something better than that repeat that for like a decade and then you'll probably start getting offers when you send your manuscripts into literary agents and if you're not willing to do that then you probably don't have the temperament necessary to become a noteworthy author as for the uncertainty about what you're feeling with film school I wouldn't worry about it you're going to find work as long as you're you're willing to take what you're offered I had a friend who went to a very expensive and fancy sort of marquee film school and he graduated and he got out and he just couldn't find work anywhere in New York so what he eventually did was he moved to Nashville and he got a job as a photog at a local news station and he worked hard at that job produced wonderful news packages eventually won a local Emmy because of his work and then he was able to use that work experience plus his education to eventually get a job with National Geographic and now I think he works for like the Discovery Channel he's a director of photography for a couple of shows so the moral I guess is that you might not end up where you think you'll arrive but if you'll stay humble then you will be happy when you get there here's a letter from H dear Austin this morning I watched your video on your feature film debut which blew my mind on how much passion and love you have for the industry and for filmmaking and by the end of the video I was in tears hearing you describe how you now view your film your video moved me so much that I thought about writing you this email as I'm sure many other people are doing right now as I am an aspiring actor director and writer your video really resonated with me and made me think more about the problems difficulties involved with modern amateur filmmaking and for that I am extremely thankful I just wanted to conclude by saying that if you do decide to make another feature or even a short film and you ever need an aspiring actor please give me a call I would fly anywhere in the world to work for you because of your evident passion and skill in this industry alternatively if you ever find yourself in my neck of the woods hit me up we'll grab a few beers thanks again kind regards well I don't drink but I would be very happy to grab a coffee if you are an aspiring actor director or writer like you say then the first step I would say is to work on the writing because with writing there is literally no entry barrier you can open up notepad right now and get started and then the writing will likely lead into other areas that you're interested in my advice would be to read read every single day and get to know people and listen to them tell their stories some of the other stuff in this email that I couldn't include for the video seems to indicate that you are young you're probably still in like high school so my advice would be finish out school be the best person you can be and then take out the camera that you have in your pocket and start making stuff and set no expectations for success if you find that you have no stories to tell that your stories aren't worth telling or if your only drive to be an actor director or writer is purely based in vanity in other words you just want to be famous stop what you're doing and go do something else because you will not succeed and even if you do it will be short-lived and ultimately meaningless here's another one hi Austin my name is Matt and I've been subscribed to you for about a month now I liked your style had a few laughs with some of your other videos so I subscribed tonight I'm watching your newest video I made a movie it stunk and I'm not sure I can accurately express with words how much it resonated with me since I was five years old I felt the desire the passion and the calling it's cheesy but it's a fitting word to tell stories on screen I shot silly backyard movies with neighborhood kids and kids in my family from the time I saved up money for a tripod when we got a computer I was freed from editing with VHS tapes and component cables and had a miraculous little piece of software called Windows Movie Maker anytime a project was assigned in school I asked and pleaded if I could turn it into a video project I did some professional work in both television court TV remember that and live video I eventually came to the place I'm at now about to graduate with a degree in what is essentially film production and I am scared to death the filmmaker part of me resonated with the story of making your feature and the lessons he learned the ups and downs and the process the part of me that really made the connection to you as a person was some of the darker and sadder things you reveal the ugly concealed demons that I to have felt thoughts of ending it all and in a moment of desperation more than a thought in film when thoughts become actions beautiful things occur but with depression there is nothing more terrifying than when thoughts become actions I'm writing this to say thank you for your video in a weird way hearing that someone in a very similar place in life as me but just a couple of steps ahead with some wisdom and insight to share as the same struggles the same insecurities the same doubts is comforting the first time I ever had a short screen in a theater I walked - I was not embarrassed by what we made so to speak but it was like standing on stage naked full of people ready to laugh or judge every inch of me but - no one to hear that I'm not alone in this means more than I can express I feel like I'm rambling so I'll wrap it up by simply saying thanks thanks for sharing a part of your heart with us on YouTube and thank you for showing me if there's something deeper and magical to all this than the pains of production or heartaches of post there's stories to be told and there's people to meet people to love and it's what I'm on earth to do if it means anything to you if you don't feel like sprouting orchids had anything to say or fell flat with its message I must disagree it might have taken a few years but your latest YouTube video would not have happened without it and I cannot thank you enough for what it's done for me this evening hey thanks Matt I appreciate it I too grew up making backyard VHS movies the very first Film Festival Award I ever won was made with Windows Movie Maker technology has certainly come a long way I don't think you need to be scared to death there's plenty of work out there folks if you're willing to do the grunt work for at least a little while you seem like you've got a lot of experience under your belt you know and if you want to do something like a feature then I guess my advice would be to use the resources you have and be okay with your wildest dreams not working out that was probably the best lesson that I learned in creating sprouting orchids but I have confidence in you and I wish you the best of luck you're Austin I'm writing to you from the other side of the world as a young 24 year old with a little over ten dollars in his bank account and half a month to my next payday I just saw your video about your first feature-length film at a point in my life where it feels like I'm in a pit my mother has moved out into a place with my youngest sister and everyday I worry about them as I sit here alone in a city that I can't afford to go out and make friends in I'm the promising prospect in my family my school my town and from the outside it looks like I have it all together but every day I feel my goals are running away from me I've tried and given up on so much and my failures seem to follow me I find myself missing everything from the farm I grew up on to the father that no longer speaks to me unless he asks for money or delivers mail I just want you to understand and I apologize for using this medium to contact you but tonight is the first time I haven't felt truly alone in some time in the crazy dreams and wild ideas that have got me this far feel as if they've just been recolored I can do this and you've helped me to believe that again this is my favorite part the video found me wedged between a screen junkies and nostalgia critic post this is with the sincerest thanks kindest regards a so these are the ones that I got the most so I was basically in a very similar situation at the start of production on sprouting orchids with the exception that I was about a year younger than you are now and I still had a little cash left to blow on a crazy movie project the family stuff can be a the family stuff can be an albatross to creativity I get it believe me in time you will learn how to shrug it off moving away from home certainly helps it certainly helped me most people find that it is a good way to get away from the what would you call it the psychological suffocation that family can sometimes cause so generally speaking when you move away from home especially if it's the first time don't pay attention to how you feel for the first year because you're still getting adjusted and you're still trying to you're still trying to find your rhythm right you're still adapting to the terrifying reality of adulthood do your best not to become bitter towards those who would seek to trouble you and know that in time you will find your footing so what I made sprouting orchids it was at a time when every personal problem possible was reaching this huge climax and that contributed a lot to what it ended up being but it also sort of oddly served as a landmark or I guess I'm I guess a grave marker for the first quarter of my life so I guess take comfort in knowing that that the way things are right now are not the way things will always be and there will come a time if you keep the right attitude where you will actually be happy that you went through all of this because what you're going through right now will strengthen you and it'll make you a better person and it will actually equip you to help other people when they go through a similar experience which I guess in a weird way is what I'm doing right now for you next one I stumbled upon your videos today and the one where you talked about making your first movie it was amazingly honest and open and I'm glad I found it at this time in my life I suppose I'm at a crossroads I don't know what I'm doing and I guess it's nice to know someone else at least my age didn't really either or at least made mistakes and that it's okay to as long as you learn from them I'm 21 but I guess I feel like a failure because I haven't really been active in pursuing anything film wise even though I feel I have some potential I guess it's this lack of reaching said potential that gets me down anyway I made a movie it stunk was one of the most moving videos I've ever seen I would say I've watched a fair amount of videos but nothing has really stayed with me a lot and I can tell you that one will I hardly ever let people know how much I appreciate the work but after seeing your video I just wanted to say thank you and I wish you the best in your filmmaking journey let me buy you a coffee one day thank you I will take that coffee and don't worry about the fact that you haven't accomplished anything by 21 most people don't I didn't you say that you feel like you are at a crossroads and I guess I want to say that you should really consider that maybe that's not a bad thing you have endless possibilities stretched out before you and the good news is is that you can cut across to other roads if you find you don't like the road you're headed down if you want to try your hand in pursuing making then start small make a three to five minute film and enter it into a local festival and if after that experience you realize that you don't like making movies then it's okay to explore other options you may just find that the most boring career path is actually the most rewarding so the next email ie included an attachment that was three pages long and told a very personal story that I didn't feel comfortable putting into the video the best summon up he is an aspiring writer who hasn't really found any kind of success and through a series of unfortunate events had a very serious falling out with a muse that he spent two months with a falling out that was so bad that he stopped writing altogether and had begun to seriously rethink every decision that he had made at this point in his life he sums up with this the reason I'm telling you all this is how I feel now seems to be similar to how you felt at the end of your first movie and you look like you're doing great now granted I don't know you but I have followed your YouTube page for some time I've seen skill with editing and storytelling I've seen you do something with your life how I watched your video during my shift as a security guard being paid below minimum wage with no breaks or worthwhile benefits to sit down and watch Life pass on by it made me remember that I was still falling I was forced to open my eyes and see the cliff face rushing past me I just don't know how to grab hold if you have time I would really like to know how you did it so here's the answer in short I put the art aside for a time and I got myself sorted out some people have this really warped view of art and creativity they thank you make your best work when your life is a mess and you're the quintessential starving artist I have found that that thinking is to put it bluntly stupid the best work that I have made came only after I sorted myself out and I got my act together and I and I started focusing on being a good and a helpful member of society so to be honest you might actually be benefited from seeking some kind of professional counseling but if that's not something that you're interested in then probably the best advice that I can give you is this focus on being the best employee that you possibly can be it sounds like you don't very much enjoy your job and so the solution there is to either get a better job or to change your attitude about the job that you have and coincidentally both of those solutions start with the same step which is be the best employee that you can be show up to work on time volunteer to do the dirty work become the most trusted person in the workplace and if you invest time and doing that then either one of two things is going to happen you will either learn to love your job or you will have developed a reputation that will actually make it easier for you to get a better job also from what I could tell based on the composition of the email you sent me you probably haven't found success as a writer because you just don't write very well nobody has probably ever told you that because it's likely that they just don't want to hurt your feelings but I am going to tell you that because I think that you're a grown man and I think that you can handle it fortunately there are ways to become a better writer you can take writing classes there are rules to composition and writing effectively spelling and grammar are two big ones and you'll need to learn those if you want to become an author at the very least you need to read read real books by professional authors and read them every day but the truth is and I think you do need to hear this even after writing your book your life is not going to magically get better and it's not going to be fixed most published authors that I know make about $10,000 a year a lot of them not even that in fact your security guard job it probably actually pays better so you know think about that most youtubers I think I feel safe and saying this will lie to you they will fill you with false hope and they'll tell you to follow your dreams and all of that my advice is to buckle down do your job get yourself sorted out be a responsible adult and pursue your dreams wisely that way if your dreams don't come true and by the way most don't including mine you'll have learned to be content with what you have and you can brighten the lives of people around you by the example that you set sorry that's probably not the advice that you were wanting to hear but it might be the advice that you need to hear next is a letter from Joe hi I know you don't know me but I had to tell you personally that your video I made a movie it stunk is absolutely outstanding I can't express to you how much it resonated with me man genuinely bawling my eyes out after watching it you made a glorious piece of heart and you should be massively proud of yourself thanks for sharing it thanks Joe I include this one because Joe is a guitarist in the United Kingdom one of the things that I actually found fascinating was the variety of people who related to the video it didn't matter if folks were aspiring painters musicians writers or filmmakers hearing a story of a failed passion project was something that they could relate to including cat who like most aspiring writers sent me a very long and detailed personal story writers tended to do that removing most of the private stuff cat is a young woman who has stumbled upon what she feels like is a dynamite story idea for a book but after her first crack at it things stalled out I had to take a hard look at the writing itself and realized it was my long-winded way of organizing and outlining my thoughts as I went and that a good portion of what I wrote was just exposition it was me telling myself how it would all work so it was dead either way as I mentioned I'm a bit sensitive I've never poured myself into something like that before never to that extent I've never invested so much never felt my work is so vivid and real intangible and now my manuscript had died in an instant I completely understand that writing is rewriting and rewriting again and rewriting some more and then some more but I was am grieving for this dead thing I had given so much of myself to and trying to rewrite it felt like trying to make a corpse dance while it was still warm I felt disgusted by it and even thinking about the main character made me feel sick even though I missed her so much can't believe me every writer has been there I wanted to tell you that you have rekindled a bit of courage within me I'll write that novel or I'll learn to animate or I'll write a screenplay and take my chances with the most difficult artistic industry in the world it may take my whole life but this story will live and breathe before me so here is a young woman who is ready to hop back on the horse cat good luck to you along with the advice that you will have probably already gleamed from the previous letters keep in mind that stories come and stories go I've had plenty of ideas that I was passionate about and I slaved over only to fall out of love with them two months in so the only way to know whether this story that you've drummed up is a fling or true love is to write it and find out I don't think you need to go to all the trouble of learning animation or writing a screenplay and trying to sell it as a film you know learning those disciplines they they take years and by the time that you actually do learn them you might find that you've fallen out of love with the story that you're currently and raptured with so my advice for you is to just write the story just write it as a book shop it around and if nobody bites after a year or so you can always go the self-publishing route and if you handle that right you you might actually find other people who love your story too but you should be careful not to become attached to every story that you come up with because stories come and go and more often than not the story that you think is amazing isn't really that good after its put to the test so be careful and set realistic expectations so two more and then I'm done tarik sent me this kind message hi and good evening my name is tarik I'm from Belgium and I just wanted to say good job this sounds both positive and sarcastic and that's exactly how I'm trying to convey it I enjoy your publications but I made a movie it stunk got to me which is exactly what you were aiming for I can only guess the amount of letters you received praising your journey but perhaps you will read one more even though you made a mediocre movie at 24 which I saw on TV we have this weird channel that presents foreign movies not paying rights due to our small economy you managed to produce a sign of extreme competence at the age of 27 your angles are thoughtful you don't shy away from being present in the production all work and footage is tastefully used and you do tell an emotional tale with heart but also with the right amount of script what I'm trying to say is that the irony bothers me but also provides me with deep respect for you I made a movie is beautiful but only exists through your past incompetence which turned you in my eyes into a promising director you could be a jerk for all I know but you have shown to have a spark within yourself that I haven't seen in a long while especially via YouTube I hope you do well in your career despite your possible personality and life may torture you so your work can flourish and be sincere kind regards from Belgium thank you very much tarik it actually really made my day to read this I don't think that I would call life torturous but I understand your meaning hardship and failed expectations can actually make us better people and I think the reason that I made the retrospective in the first place is partly to sort of to sort of close that chapter in my life and also maybe to help other creatives deal with their failures or to guide them through the trials that they're facing and I hope that it I hope that it's helped I really do and it's interesting that you caught the film on on television although I am NOT surprised I made this short film called this vale of tears of years ago and I'd kind of forgotten all about it until a friend of mine who was visiting Paris he actually saw it playing on a TV at a McDonald's so you never know so just one more and this is a tough one near Austin my name is Sam and I'm one of you YouTube subscribers I just finished watching your video on the movie sprouting orchids by the end of it I was in tears I'm also from Springfield I graduated in 2008 and have only lived long term in Springfield once since taking care of my mom after she had a stroke I've done a lot of world travel and strange jobs particularly in the last five years and I always find it difficult to explain my hometown to people abroad in 2013 I met my South African boyfriend working on board a cruise ship and after the denial of a visitor visa he has still never met my family or seen where I grew up I've tried showing in videos from YouTube of Springfield but they're lacking and don't paint a real picture of the town I don't know if he'll ever be able to see it I'm currently living in South Africa doing post-grad so we can be together watching your video and recognizing so many places hearing you tell your story in a context that I could completely picture from the Moxie to the high V to Brahms it hit me very close to my heart at the end when you brought up the palace where I took my mom weekly after her stroke just so she could enjoy a movie for a short time before forgetting about it entirely an hour later and Andes where my family got blueberry custards every time they were in season nearly growing up I broke down completely when you began to cry I cried with you feeling similar emotions saying through your story a part of my own life that I miss I want to thank you for putting this video out there not only because it was a fascinating retelling of an important period within your life for creating it in such a way that I felt genuine emotions that will linger with me long after finishing your 30 minute video if there is a way that I could purchase a copy of sprouting orchids I would love to do so I could watch it with my boyfriend and not only show him the first movie of a talented filmmaker from Springfield but share with him memories in some of your shooting locations it could see them in motion instead of on Google Maps if it isn't possible I understand but I thought I'd reach out additionally if you ever need story inspiration I'll be happy to tell you stories from my life involving Hawaiian jungle communes living history museums heavy metal concerts in Japan and living below sea level again thank you for your content please keep up the amazing work you do on your channel and I wish you nothing but the best for your career you're going to do some wonderful things sincerely Sam everybody's got a story right I'm Sam thank you for sharing yours I might release sprouting orchids online eventually I don't know maybe if I hit a big milestone or something but the palace is gone now those Wehrenberg which hurts too I'm starting to learn that home isn't something that you can ever go back to it's something that you remember and something that you try to make for others like I said before I've gotten well over a hundred of these kinds of messages almost all of them about about this length or longer if you've been hoping to receive a letter back from me please accept my most sincere apologies and know that I just can't there are far too many and I don't ever want to respond to a private message has been lovingly crafted with something generic or something lackluster and while I haven't responded personally to all of your stories please know that I have read all of them and I am eternally grateful that you felt enough confidence in me to share them life is hard enough without the tacked on baggage of being an artist yet often artists aren't able to see life without their art and to that end I appreciate every one of you who have been supporting my channel and giving me feedback and sticking around for the past year while I turned these videos out I suppose the greatest gift that you can give an artist is an audience and you all have done just that in fact over 300,000 of you have subscribed to my channel up to this point and your encouragement has inspired me to keep going I've got a lot of irons in the fire as the saying goes there are projects in the works that I I can't quite talk about yet but they are slowly but surely coming together including yes another film never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that my first failed feature would result in a retrospective several years after the fact that would strike a chord with so many people but I'm glad it did and I can't wait to see what comes next for all of us before closing I want to thank the sponsor for this video videos like this generally aren't very successful on this platform they are long and they are not very entertaining for the average viewer but I think that videos like this are necessary and necessary because they keep me grounded as a creator and they helped me to connect with you in a way far more meaningful than if I just became another youtuber chasing after the next viral hit Squarespace the purchase of a web or a domain thank you guys very much for watching let's go make stuff [Music] you [Music]
