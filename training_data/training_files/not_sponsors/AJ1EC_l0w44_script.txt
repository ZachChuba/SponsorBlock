the link in the video description I'm finally on hands with the Nubia X and I gotta say I am really impressed by a lot of aspects of this device given that this is from a brand that I have personally never actually been hands-on with before so everyone's got a different sort of concept for how we move towards an all screen phone whether it's a foldable device or a pop-up selfie camera or a facial recognition scanner or whatever the case may be their solution is the one that I actually personally think makes the most sense with the technology we have today they just went and put an OLED display on the back of the phone so instead of having to have a dedicated selfie camera at all you just use your rear camera in order to take a selfie you go ahead and hit that selfie button and boom now you're on the OLED screen on the back ooh I'm in pretty mode you know what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go full not pretty yeah we all knew that wasn't gonna be pretty anyway then you go ahead and flip it back around and there it is now the cool thing is that it would have been a lot of added cost to put a 5.1 inch OLED display on the back of the phone just for the sake of taking selfies but they've actually built some really interesting other functionality into it as well if you are into it for whatever reason you can actually switch to it and use it as the primary display of the phone just by flipping it around you can configure that to not happen automatically though if you want so you can put a add a gesture where you just press these two buttons and it'll switch it around or you can actually set it up instead of in mirror mode to be in a mode that they're calling multitasking mode so obviously this is a bad example but I went to lunch a game and I think it was looking for a data connection it didn't work it's okay don't go oh hey it did work so here you can have the game running on your primary screen and then you can flip it back over and go yeah I got a reply to a quick message but you don't actually have to do that drag down minimize your game whole thing and you could use it for really like any number of things that is an absolutely incredible idea another thing that you can do is you can configure it as an additional input so you can set zooms here that you can use as for example this is also a gaming application as triggers for firing a weapon or whatever the case may be that's pretty neat too so as shocking as this feels to me it's actually more than just a gimmick as far as I can tell now I'm not crazy impressed with the quality of the rear camera so we're not necessarily solving the problem of taking the best selfies ever by putting the screen on the back of this particular phone but the overall fit and finish of this thing is just surprisingly good in the specs are great too so snapdragon 845 up to 8 gigs of ram 512 gigs of storage they're quoting 6 hours of screen time 6 hours of continuous use with a 3,800 milliamp hour battery yeah that's right a 38 hundred million power battery and there's even one more cool thing that is kind of up oh hi oh hi did nobody else ever think of this thing you look at the front you go ok there's no room for a fingerprint sensor there obviously it's not in screen unfortunately at this time if you look at the back you can go oh well there's no fingerprint sensor there either so they've done a side fingerprint sensor like we've seen I mean Sony's done that in the past that's not particularly new but this is new they put it on both sides so I initially thought oh it's ambidextrous I can do it this way or this way and use my thumb every time but what they're actually using it for us to increase the security of the device so it now checks not just one fingerprint but two fingerprints so that you can instead of having it what is it whatever it is like one in a million or 1 in 100,000 or whatever the chances are of an accidental fingerprint match now it's checking two fingerprints increasing the device's security pretty freakin sick finally we've got a feature that's less futuristic and more of a throwback but definitely one I'm happy to see it's got an IR blaster on it hell yeah so there's gonna be the guys that are like huh what's that who cares and then there's gonna be you guys that are like it's amazing so if you're into it you're into it and if you're not you know and I totally get it but there's one thing things at the link in the video description so thanks for watching don't miss any of our CES 2019 coverage you guys by making sure that you are subscribed to line this tech tips it's really responsive too especially compared to the foldable phone earlier mmm it's like fidget gyroscope screen switcher doodad
