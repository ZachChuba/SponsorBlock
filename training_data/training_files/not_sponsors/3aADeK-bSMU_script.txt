do you long for the days when your phone would last for a week on a single charge well do we ever have the solution for you introducing the linus tech tips battery expander just slap it on strap it on plug it in and enjoy yeah that's pretty ridiculous isn't it and yet here we are 11 years after the introduction of the original iphone and pretty much this legitimately is basically the solution being pitched both by apple and by third parties to address their shoddy a whole day asterisk as long as you don't use it too much battery life has anyone considered that there might be a better way you know maybe we could i i don't know just put a bigger battery in the phone in the first place well that is exactly what eulephone did the power 5 is an android smartphone with 5 times the battery capacity of the latest iphone 10s and they claim this thing can last for a week between charges look at it i might just believe them that radiates beautiful rgb check it out at the link below [Music] 13 000 milliamp hours that's the advertised capacity of the power 5 and in a phone that is utterly massive like to put that in perspective the latest iphone 10s battery is 2600 milliamp hours the pixel 3 xl weighs in slightly thicker at 3 400 milliamp hours and even the note 9 which samsung advertises as all day has a mere 4 000 milliamp hour battery in it that puts the power 5 at five times 3.8 and 3.25 times larger capacity than these phones respectively that's a lot of juice it really is basically like carrying around a regular phone and a pretty beefy battery pack which translates to some interesting results but let's talk a bit about the rest of the phone first it's pretty much your standard affair budget offshore android device with a six inch 1080p screen that manages to be unremarkable both in terms of image quality and feel a relatively slow eight core cpu somewhere around the level of a one plus three and north american cellular band support that's a little bit limited as for aesthetics some people are probably actually gonna quite like this but i think it suffers from kind of a dated appearance jake got lg g4 vibes from the back and as for me i'm reminded of those leather cases that people used to get for their really old brick phones you know like the really old ones the ones with the little like flip out mouthpiece and the antenna that comes up brandon do you see that at all yeah right yuck other than that it doesn't really seem like anything special that is until you pick the thing up the sheer girth and more notably the weight of it is like nothing that i've experienced in a modern phone again we need context for this the power 5 is exactly twice as thick as the pixel 3 xl and the phone weighs almost three-quarters of a pound that is 330 grams for the metric folks out there like it's kind of funny because on the one hand it will be actually impossible for many people to operate one-handed and it's not even top-heavy it just kind of feels like it because there is so much weight hanging off the top of your hand on the other hand though it actually gives it sort of a like premium feel that you wouldn't expect from a 250 smartphone that and if you got in a fight like you hit someone put this in your head no i'm serious the speakers or i should say speaker there's just one are what i would describe as usable unless you listen to something decent first and realize how much you're missing the dual front and rear cameras are actually not the worst thing ever but they use a sony sensor from 2015 so that should give you some idea of the era of smartphone camera quality to expect it's a far cry from a pixel 3 but honestly would probably be fine for most people that is unlike the fingerprint sensor which only seems to work a fraction of the time no matter how many times we tried to set it up and even with all five fingerprint slots and software used by the same finger with that said at least when it does work you are in for a treat just kidding it's really slow but to be honest i think a lot of people could probably make those compromises for the added stamina that this phone affords if that's important to them like let's say you're the kind of person who regularly flies between washington dc and moscow for work even if you were to watch videos during that entire 12 or 13 hour travel time the eulophone wouldn't break a sweat during our testing it lasted for a staggering 31 and a half hours of continuous watching youtube videos remember that's with wi-fi active by comparison the pixel 3 xl slummed it with just under 14 hours and hey the power 5 even supports glonass russia's version of gps so you won't get lost while you're over there okay but how about something a little more indicative of regular phone use let's say a combined workload of web browsing photo and video editing writing and data manipulation well pc mark's work 2.0 benchmark hits the phone with this sort of mishmash of common workloads without any standby time in between and again the eulophone impresses with 3.6 times the effective battery life of google's latest and greatest so with some quick napkin math here let's say you know four hours of that kind of load per day you would end up with more than nine days of battery life like obviously you'd still have some standby usage but to say that a week of battery life on this thing is possible would actually be pretty safe alright now let's talk about gaming imagine for a moment playing a mobile game on your phone literally all day going to sleep then doing the same thing all the next day without having to plug in that's possible and then at the opposite end of the scale what about going on a week-long backcountry camping trip using just your phone for navigation like the possibilities that this thing unlocks are freaking bananas so much so that i actually kind of wondered if the thing would even finish charging overnight but it actually doesn't take that long so the included wall board here is spec for their own style of quick charging with a slightly odd although oneplus has a similar scheme five volt five amp output that juices the phone from zero to a hundred percent in a rated two and a half hours although your mileage may vary slightly so bottom line yeah we know battery life isn't a problem for everyone you might have a place to plug in at your desk or in the car or on the plane and honestly speaking for how much heavier this phone is it might actually be more convenient for folks who don't want to get their phone arm all like jacked to just carry a battery bank in their purse or backpack or whatever but we'll let you guys be the judge of that in fact we'll let you guys be the judge of what the best way forward is in general leave a comment is the convenience here worth the compromise should we stick to the status quo or should we maybe try and find a middle ground like i personally have wanted for a long time to see a 6 000 or 7 000 milliamp hour phone with like an endurance edition from a tier one manufacturer like samsung or apple or google am i ever gonna get that probably not party go check it out so
