okay in this video let's talk about one of the most controversial topics in math why is 0-2 a serious power and divide first of all disclaimer this video has nothing to do with calculus so do not leave comments regarding to limits whatever we are not going to do any limits at all in this video this is just meant to be at English watching 19 sites rather evil anyway zero to the zero like an algebra equation this is just purely computational yes nothing to do with calculus I will do the 0 to a 0 in determinant form for limits next time not not today ok so seriously do not but you know what when I say this people are still going to a comment down below with limits whatsoever this is YouTube I understand so up to you guys fiver anyway first of all it's a good idea to review the exponents definition so let's take a look of 2 to the 3rd power of course as we all know when we have a pasty whole number for the exponent for example history it will tell us to drive down this to three times and then multiply them together so you see we have three tools right here and once you have this go ahead and work it out of course sweetie at 8 and this is nice when we have passed the exponent right past the whole number for that but we are going to run to chop what's this do total phoenician when the exponent is not passed the whole number anymore for example when we have 2 to the zeroth power as you can see this right here you wouldn't make sense for us to drive down to zero times for test I mean I'll just put down equal to empty space cannot call and this is how can do math you see if you just leave nothing here on the test you can't I want to percent how cool is that right of course this we don't make sense now let's see how can we define the sewers exponent for this situation to do so maybe we shall follow a pattern let's look at the next one which is 2 to the 2nd power in this case of course you write down the 2 2 times those two times two of course this is going to give us 4 and then of course you can keep on going that's to care 2 to the first power this one if do make sense we can write down the 2 1 time and the answer is just by itself is to and as you can see I am following this pattern three two one zero but on the right hand side I have eight four two so what's the pattern on the right hand side of course from here to here with divided by two and from here to here with divided by two as well and would it be nice if we can keep the same pattern on the right hand side by dividing by two if so two divided by 2 will be one and as you can see to make sense of the zeros exponent the best definition is just to make it equal what and this right here as I mentioned it it's a definition this right here is not a proof at all in fact the zero exponent you can now say I'm gonna prove that exponent is 1 no it's at the venetie because you have to first give a meaning to the zeros exponent before you can do anything else right so don't call this the theorem statement whatsoever this is just that definition and by showing who has this I know some people are going to debate in the comment sections already up to you it's due to I understand in fact if you follow this I can keep it as another definition because we can go to a negative exponent for example if I keep on going I will end up with 2 to the negative 1 power and of course this right here it wouldn't make sense at all ok to drive down to negative one time how can you even do that right well to define what this is of course that's follow the pattern on the right hand side and divide this by 2 want if I were to of course that'll keep us 1/2 so perhaps the best definition is to define 2 to the negative 1 power to be 1/2 and once again this right here it's just a definition when you have negative whole number power all right so once again this is just another definition and in fact can keep going for example 2 to the negative 2 power we defined out to be 1 over 4 because you had to be padded back to again on the right hand side and you do this so that you can actually graph 2 to the X as a continuous function which is very nice alright so that was just a nice review now that's getting to the main dish today which is zero to the zeroth power and to do so I'm going to consider this equation first name dy it's equal to X to the zero power let's talk about the graph of this right here real quick for example as we all know already when we have to the pace when want to for the base and then it breaks that to a thrust power with your one so that means for this equation if X is 2 right here the one for you should be 1 so we have this point here that's nice and similarly if you have speed right here of course to the serious power should be 1 as well you can follow the similar thing so we can also have 3 here and then 1 and likewise we can put down let's say 0.5 and then to the zeros power thou shalt give us one as well that's very nice maybe we can also work with negative number if I have negative 1 right here for the base to disrespe in fact you can also work this out right here and you still end up with what so I will just give you guys this right here negative 1 for X and then the Y value is 1 and of course right here we have a bunch of dots already if I don't just connect the dots and everybody is on the horizontal line right so it seems that I should just connect the dots like this everybody is you could want that's nice so based on this it seems like when x is 0 the Y power should also be 1 as well isn't it so let me just indicate that right here seems like when x is 0 okay I'm putting 0 for X and then 0 for the power it seems like 0 to a serious power should be 1 but have you ever thought about what if the base is you're wrong instead so that take a look right here let's go ahead and consider another equation which is really similar when you have 0 to the X power when X is 2 we are talking about 0 squared well that's going to be 0 that's nice so you have a 0 right here right one from zero and likewise when X is 3 the Y values through it with their power is 0 likewise 0.5 right here that's 0 to the 0.5 power that's actually the square root as I mentioned earlier you can see row and you have this right here right so since everybody joby just that on zero but if X is negative one when you put negative one right here you get zero to the negative one power and by this you see this right here should be one over zero and this right here is undefined hopefully by now we don't need to have a little like topic discussion why I wrote in the denominator is not defined so just keep it as a surface and this right here is actually true for all negative number for X in this case in fact we don't have the left hand side at all so it seems that we just have the right hand side which is just like this all right like that and now based on this picture if X is zero when you put it here what does it seems like well I have the zero for the base if I put X equal zero in here in pink it seems like I should have make this equal to zero in order to make this continuous likewise that and as you can see of course that colors right here the co2 as you draw versus this root or zero they are the same but we end those two different answers and that's troublesome of course we don't like that math so the conclusion is that let me just cross this out no let's just don't deal with this at all conclusion which is the one that we have the operator when you see zero to the zeroth power to avoid any kind of this kind of contradictions whatsoever this right here is the find if you want can also say and be found also joke by anyway okay now if you want annual premium subscription hopefully you guys all like this
