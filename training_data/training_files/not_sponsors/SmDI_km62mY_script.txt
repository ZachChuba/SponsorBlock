well they were able to do I think in disguising coverages and stuff like that's what NFL they're an NFL offense all you're playing against college defenses right even in the SEC with great athletes they're College defenses which are very vanilla very bland because if you can't get everybody to know what the hell they're doing you can't disguise coverages because all you need is one towel right that Clemson defense was doing a great job disguising what they were so Joe burrow whenever sending people in motion and coming back they're trying to figure out okay is a man is its own but they're passing it off and I think Isiah was just man on Thaddeus and then they were zone everywhere else so it was it was a big done chess match for Joe burrow which leads into even more of the thought of how much success he's gonna have any NFL because he ran an NFL system and here against Clemson he had a chance to play against what is gonna be like an NFL defense where they're disguising it took them a little bit to figure it out but I didn't know if they were gonna be able to I didn't know if they're gonna be able to honestly I cuz all people kept talking about was how great of a D coordinator that guy was right like this guy's great T Corday is great too coordinator well if that's the case then he's gonna be able to continue to disguise these coverages and disguise these blitzes and it could confuse Joe burrow hasn't had to face this I I said this earlier in the year and I was sort of joking but not really the way college defenses are I think if you can just throw a football and you get right sister you could potentially win the Heisman I mean I did the virtual reality thing at Stanford and it was just the defense's are just so easy just if you know football just a little bit it's very easy just to be like oh okay this is covered to bang this is what works against covered to oh this is a soft three all right bang this is what you do if you have a football IQ at all because there isn't enough time to study I guess in college now because they limited the amount of hours you're a lot of film study not everybody is a high football IQ that is playing football in college right kids kids don't have an IQ level up for football enough that haven't played enough football so you have to keep it very dry you're just hoping that your athletes can make play in the NFL they disguise defenses you have no idea that's why when Sam darling said I'm seeing ghosts that's because Bill Belichick made it look like it was man than he was dropping in to cover three with the Blitz and it's like oh my god the guy oh my I wasn't anything that I thought it was and you're dead and before you could even go because you have to make these decisions all posthaste you don't I mean so it's like it's one of those things where did I use that right yeah oh yeah it's one of those things thank you it felt pretty good but it's one of those things where that's why whenever you see like oh that guy can get through his progressions that because he knows the defense and he knows where he should go with his progression whenever you see a guy look one place and then get scared that's cuz he has no idea what the defense isn't he has no idea where he's supposed to go that was a knock on Baker this year well hello seeking now back to the magic does he'll get one read and then he would get outside the pocket to the right and then he would just try to make a play so I think as Baker continues to learn NFL defenses and disguises and be able to figure things out and tells he's gonna get better but that's the difference between college defenses in NFL defense we talked about that on a mega cast a little bit so I didn't know if LSU was gonna be able to figure it out I honestly don't know cuz it is it's a puzzle you're trying to figure out this puzzle and it felt like the puzzle piece that they figured out was that one guy they were gonna go after that one guy number one number one that it's almost like they went to the sideline and they're like we don't know what the hell is going on with everybody else they seem to have a good disguise on this they have good coverage on this but we think we could take a shot on this guy with our guy chase with our number one guy and it felt like that is when it really started to turn and also etn he's they're naughty Tian Edwards he'll air yeah he's Darren Sproles he is Darren Sproles he might be even thicker and Gary he's physical yeah he's thicker than Garrett's right the the the thing that I enjoyed most about him running getting hit not going down like even going out of bounds still standing three dudes at his feet like that is just a mad angry runner which I respect I like that a lot but his ability to kind of be an option out of the back to just a little dump I think that's why Joe is gonna do good because of his ability to break down what the defense was giving him last night which was probably the toughest defense and I mean that might have been one of the best disguise defenses and maybe college football like maybe in history of college football that they were doing because of what that number 11 guy he's a weapon so you have no idea what he's gonna be out he was lined up at line but inside linebacker at one point then he was a outside linebacker DN then he was a safety at one point so whenever you have one particular player who is your game record playing for different positions it's hard to get a tell on what the hell are they could possibly you could be like okay if Isaiah Simmons is at safety they're gonna do this but instead they had him at safety and he came down to the line it was like it looked like an NFL defense last night and that's why I think I enjoyed watching Joe and Joe figure it out and get it done because that is what the in-game adjustments are all about and if you're what Jon Gruden are you going to get them Connor oh yeah trade everything for borough hey you guys want Derek Carr you want like just a brown hair Danny dog Derek Carr into first they probably do it I you know I hate I hate their cars brother mm-hmm what's his name David I don't like David card all he blocked me on Twitter too so he knows they don't like me I like Derek Carr a lot but boy I don't think that's the right parent right like I've no know their cards right back
