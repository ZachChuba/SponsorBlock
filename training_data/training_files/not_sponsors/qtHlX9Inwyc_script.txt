classes for free link in the description apples got some brand new air pods air pods pro to be specific and I'm not just gonna give you all the details and tell you how they compare to the regular air pods and powerbeats Pro but I'm gonna unbox them and go hands-on right now oh yeah I'm Renee Richie and this is vector air pots are the best-selling headphones in the world and based on all the memes alone I have zero reason to doubt them they're all so far from perfect in my own reviews going back to the originals I've asked about better sizing from my grappling mashed ears water resistance for rain and sweat while walking out or working out noise cancellation for in the world is just too loud and colours for when I want to be loud air pods Pro are the answer to most if not all of that now they don't replace the current second generation air pods the way those did the originals instead they join the lineup as a higher-end option like MacBook and MacBook Pro iPad and iPad pro iphone and iphone pro you get it air pods pro have been designed to be water-resistant and our ipx4 certified you can't use them in water and they probably won't survive dunking like a donut but they should be fine with sweat and rain the standard air pods come in one size fits most certainly not all they're molded pieces of unabashedly plastic and while they fit great in my left ear they've always been just a little looser in my right they fit great in both for a lot of people and neither for some and until now you've had no options except for power beats Pro which use a lot of the same tech as air pods and fixed it by not only going around the ear but into it with a few different sizing options air pods Pro do the same with the in not the over they come with three different sizes of silicon ear tips that yeah make them look like a video game character but also let them create a far better fit and a far better seal as you'd expect you don't peel them on or off like some commons Alec and tip out let's come up with their own unique system to snap the tips into and out of place to make a good fit great they also use a vent system to equalize pressure and minimize discomfort resulting from that seal I'll report back on just how well and for how long that really works the reason for the seal isn't just fit either it's noise cancellation standard air pods don't have any they just sit inside your ear and let a lot of the ambient sound through powerbeats Pro go further inside but their noise reduction is purely passive its isolation it's the seal air pods Pro go full-on active with their noise cancellation adaptive even they've got two microphones on each pod one listening to the outside world and the other listening to what's bouncing around in your own ear then 200 times a second they cancel all that noise like cure Wonderwoman hitting her bracers together so it just never reaches your ear that means don't hear the engine in the plane the conversation at the next table silence the verge of the party not really not fully you just mainly hear the audio you're playing the book the podcast the music if you do want to hear the world around you for example to avoid cars while you're running or to ask for another tasty beverage while you're flying you can switch to transparency mode that uses the vent system to let in enough noise for you to listen and talk if and when you have to but without assaulting you with the unwashed unfiltered universe all while yeah you're still enjoying your audio to provide for that audio air pods Pro use adaptive EQ which is basically Apple flexing their computational muscles again the ones from the giant lab near Apple Park it automatically Tunes low to mid-range to shape it for your specific ear Apple says they have a custom high dynamic range amplifier inside that doesn't just provide clear sound and power for a custom speaker driver but for extended battery life as well air pods have never gotten raves for their sound power beats pro and the just-released beats solo pro both of which use similar tech have gotten far more praise I'm gonna have to listen for a while to see how these really sound but if Apple's managed to combine higher quality with the air pods legendary experience that'll be something to hear air pods Pro use the same custom Apple h1 that debuted with the second generation air pods non Pro and have since turned up in the powerbeats Pro and beat solo pro from tips to chips indeed it and it's 10 audio cores are what's doing all the heavy listening for everything from adaptive sound to voice-activated Siri Apple says each pod gets up to four and a half hours of listening time and up to three and a half hours of talktime per charge and the case can charge them up for 24 hours of listening and 18 hours of talking that's compared to up to 5 hours listening time per pod for the standard air pods and up to 9 hours for the beefier power beats Pro the cases are all rated the same power beats Pro though come with an inductive charging case with the standard air pods that's an optional additional charge and with the power beats Pro it's not even an option and you know it I'll be testing the battery life and getting back to you about the only thing air pods Pro don't solve for our colors despite rumours to the contrary always rumors you can get them in any color you want as long as what you want is white same as standard air pod it's just Apple being all about being iconic so for now at least if you want colors in your Apple ears you'll have to go with power beats Pro and white black navy blue and moss green gonna test out the microphone quality I decided to ask all of you what you wanted to know about the air pods Pro and here are the answers to your question there's a big difference in sound between the air pods Pro and the air pods because one there's noise cancelling and two these are actually using something very similar to home pods that they're doing a lot of computational audio and that means they're measuring the sound inside your ear and then adjusting it continuously to make it sound as good as possible for each individual ear all the time with noise cancelling off they sound like noise isolation earphones in other words just the tips are filling up your ears cutting out a little bit of sound with transparency on thanks to the vents you can hear your own voice and it doesn't sound exactly normal it sounds a little bit enhanced and a little bit digital you know like the way cher believes in love actually no plastic tips no plastic or anything at all inside the silicon they sit flush with the surface of the air pod so it's just the silicon that's going into your ear and that's what lets the mold as precisely as possible to your ear if you lose a tip or one just gets all gross you can go to Apple and get a set of replacement tips for 395 if you're not sure whether they're gonna think you or not you can also go to Apple and try them on the same way you've played on regular air pots they'll have the air pods Pro available for you to test drive the h1 chipset inside the ear pods Pro is the same age one that's in the second generation air pods and in the recent beats headphones the only differences are this ones aside a system in package and also for the first time it's using all 12 audio cores no device has ever done that before there's no u 1 spatial positioning chip inside these alas it's just the h1 headphones yep air pods pro r2 49 in the US and go on sale October 30th 2019 that's the same price as powerbeats Pro but $50 more than a $1.99 us it'll cost you for standard air pods with the inductive charging case are they worth it I'm gonna have a full video review up for you just as soon as I spent some quality time with the new air pods Pro in the meantime I'm gonna pop these bad little bail sprouts into my ears and learn how to make some damn fine coffee to review them with courtesy of blue and start learning today thanks Gil share and thanks to all of you for supporting the show okay now before I jump back on another plane and turn noise-canceling up to 11 I want to hear your first impressions of Apple's new ear pods Pro hit like if you do hit subscribe if you haven't already transparency mode that Bell gizmo so you don't miss the next show and then hit up the comments and let me know and if you have any questions or anything you want me to focus on for the review let me know that as well thank you for watching see you next video
