[Music] hey guys with that being said let's get into the video over time you've probably seen some mentions of people getting obscene amount of kills some clickbait and some very real I even made a video a while back about of zigs who managed to get a hundred and sixty six kills at the time of making that video a hundred and sixty six kills was the record of most kills in a ranked game aside from people who used exploits and hacks but quietly while no one was paying attention a player in Taiwan went on to achieve the new record of most kills this historic event happened on November 10th 2018 in a 300 minute game the massive legend hood business is named to geo for 66 and was bronze 3 at the time of getting these kills he's currently iron one though now before anything what makes this even more fascinating is the fact that this is actually a solo queue game usually these games with high kills high deaths etc take place in ranked flats so that you can get your friends to facilitate you with some free kills but hey unfortunately I searched everywhere to see if there was a recorded gameplay of this and unfortunately there isn't regardless of that though we do have the analytics from League of Legends calm and one of the things I noticed that is kind of weird is the fact that a huge majority of his kills came from just being in the found it would seem that dr. mundo and Azir were running it down mid just to get him some kills also the more probable scenario is that somehow mundo in Azir are vague ours friends IRL and they agreed to do this once they found each other on opposing teams like maybe they made some sort of deal guys keep searching for a game until we find each other on opposing teams and then run it down mid so I can get the record of most kills whoa okay but what's in it for us oh don't worry I'll get you a guaranteed victory but how would it even be possible to lose after getting over 200 kills yeah dr. mundo I don't know how that's possible either but despite playing for 300 minutes and getting 210 kills this veigar and most importantly his team they'll manage to lose the game now although go4 66 has the most kills he may not even be the most interesting veigar player in this video meet Lin sweet foster who on the second day of November 2018 he also participated in an insanely long game this game lasted for 280 minutes and although this player was only capable of getting 51 champion kills and didn't get the record for most kills Lin suite foster did get the record for the highest amount of minion kills in 280 minutes this veigar killed 5,000 407 minions to put this into perspective geo 466 only killed 2,000 71 minions in 300 minutes alongside the record for most minion kills a Lin suite foster also obtained a record for the longest time alive and most gold all in one game also while we're here what about the flip side if this veigar from Taiwan has the most kills who has the most deaths well this record currently belongs to Douglas the fourth from the EU West's server now unfortunately this also happened a while back so there's no way of obtaining the replay but for your viewing pleasure in the background you can see a detailed recreation of what I believe went down the game lasted 73 minutes however Douglas somehow managed to die almost two times per minute all while not getting a single kill or a single assist but he did at least leave his team a whole 10 Awards but all right guys let me know what you thought about this video in the comments down below as always thank you for watching and if you liked what you saw and you want to see more videos like this in the future make sure to drop a like subscribe and hit the bell button to be notified the next time I upload special thanks again to pro guides for sponsoring this video and most of all thank you so much for watching and have a great day peace
