ah October the month for skeletons scares and spooky stories just kidding by the time this video is out it'll probably be in mid-november but November's still a pretty octobrush month - so I'm still in the clear anyway to the actual video the hollow it was one of the first campaigns that I ever ran and strangely enough the only campaign I ever finished now I know you read the title of the video so you're probably expecting to hear some spooky Halloween stories but bear with me aside from a few smaller reveals I haven't really described who the main characters of the hollow actually were or what the plot actually was well we gotta start somewhere so there were two powerful deities in this world the goddess of light heaven and the god of chaos hell these who didn't like each other all that much which led to countless wars of her territory and power many of heavens warriors had died bravely in battle and fearful of running out of soldiers she created a fountain capable of stitching Souls back into bodies mimicking the resurrection process at a fraction of the cost using her now infinite supply of soldiers having managed to reclaim a large portion of her territory and forced Hell's retreat to the rival nation of e-news hey eNOS quiet you our party story however began around a hundred years after this conflict as the tie fling yes tie fling cleric Akita found herself newly resurrected stripped of her memories she stood before the goddess heaven and to the Assam our fighter Ingrid this girl was a van and cleric in her day she should do you well on your missions together welcome to the group miss I'm Ingrid died two wearing some cursed jewellery I was resurrected I run a week ago thanks to the fountain you're in and you I um I think my name's Akita I used to worship one of the gods yes most likely me yeah and something killed me and stole my soul it was really dark for a while at least up until now by the way where am I well you're in my fortitude you've been brought back to life for the sole purpose of protecting our nation from the creepy crawlies that live outside it our job to find evildoers and kick their butts I think he'll do great is my assistant so in the world of the hollow souls could be manipulated to do a bunch of pretty cool stuff from animating armor to enchanting weapons the drawback though would be that the only way that you could obtain souls would be to kill mortals and steal them in the black-market souls who are currency for power and the more you had the stronger you were so curious to uncover the mystery behind her death and fearing divine intervention if she refused now I could start at the beginning of the story so we could get some proper rising action going you know how a normal story is written but it's Halloween which means I need to start right in the middle during the campaigns Hallows Eve festival trust me I'll go back and explain everything but I just want to tell a spooky story so months begin to pass plot begins to thicken and eventually a special holiday called the Hallows Eve festival begins what made Hallows Eve so important were the rumors that on this very day one tree in the entire hollow province would be enchanted with powerful magic the first person to find and touch this tree would be able to find something valuables as they've lost be it wealth love or even people up until now a key turn Ingrid will work down to the bone fighting to keep Heaven's assets safe on a regular basis was becoming a full-time job but today would be a day where they could just put down their weapons and relax the festival reminded them or rather me as a DM then it was fine to take a break and just have some fun foreshadowing heavens fortitude was the place where the Hallows Eve event would be hosted and the citizens were informed to stay safe while they explored the nearby woods meanwhile the protagonists ran off and messed with all the Carnival festivities Ingrid managed to break the test her strength machine Akitas somehow won the costume contests she didn't even change her outfit and both girls got to view the fortitude from above as they took a ride on a train to drag him throughout the night sky how could this day get any better a breeze in my hair the moon shining in the sky the only thing that could ruin this would be what is that without warning a huge I just opened up on the face of the Moon and began to direct its reflection onto one point somewhere in the center of the nearby forest a few hours go by and everyone at the festival begins to freak out people realize that the moon wasn't moving and that the giant rock was now locked in place if anybody wanted to see the daylight again someone would need to go investigate wait you want us to go do it fine come on Ikeda so a katana Ingrid followed the moonlight trail eventually stumbling through a dome of magic turns out there had been a creepy as all heck church built like ten minutes away from Heaven's fortitude and this illusionary bubble kept it under the radar the scent of ketchup masked the entire building fresh corpses lined to the pews and near the far end of the church a group of cultists surrounded a pentagram where the moonlight was shining suddenly yeah a bright light filled the room and in the center of the circle now spawned a beholder my Maya seems the prediction was right they sent you to write towards me once the ritual began this will make things a lot easier my name is seer and I've been watching you both for a long time what are you talking about you creep we just wanted to enjoy Hallows Eve let the wind go or we're gonna have some trouble whoa Ingrid how do you know him I have no intention of keeping your moon hostage this was just a very elaborate plan to lure you right towards me and you fallen into my trap I have been stuck in that bone for eons with the souls of those three robbing imbeciles I finally gained a physical body kur to help me test it out initiatives were rolled and the battle began Ingrid and Acuto worked on slowly blasting fear to pieces while the beholder shot a few light beams out himself it was clear who was the stronger team though and after a short fight the beholder like spawn was eventually cut down with a wide smirk and maniacal laugh Zia promised to return but next time it'll be the two of them who are crushed to the ground she's what was that all about um Ingrid oh [ __ ] let's get out of here getting the heck forest before the cult is stout number them Ingrid and Acuto were celebrated for their victory back at heavens fortitude but on the days leading after Hallows Eve the eye on the moon would appear for a few seconds at a time to observe the party coupled with an intense heartbeat that could only be described as unsettling whoever this guy is he seems hell-bent on being stronger than us Akita so we just need to keep getting stronger right yeah well so here we're not pushovers next time he fights here okay kiss I in twice as hard but before rushing back to train the girls went to visit a close friend of theirs who lived in the neighboring city of Kane more if anyone had inside information on this new foe it would be him morning Jake I'm here oh good morning Ingrid how can I help you once anime dispels calm link in the description [Music]
