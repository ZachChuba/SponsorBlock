it can reverse out of here really really well guys look at this so that time you actually reversed which is harder welcome back everybody to test drive out hope you're doing very well today we're gonna be testing out smart summit here in the UK and we're gonna be trying it on private property so this isn't actually in a car park which means there's no map data for the area we're gonna test it out and we're gonna see how well it does before we do that though I actually started filming this yesterday in a car park and this footage I got was pretty incredible what I'm gonna try and get the car to do is actually come all the way around and then go around this kind of verge now it couldn't reverse here so it's gonna have to go all the way around that way all all the way around to the left I'm not sure which way it's gonna pick so this is gonna be quite interesting let's give this a whirl so I want to go all the way around and hopefully yeah so look at that it's giving itself space because it knows that there's hedges there and oh look at this on the map it's giving us a totally different route that it wants to take us around and you know what that is correct this is a one-way car park everybody so the car actually followed the one-way system and correctly navigate itself around the carpark if likes I will do that this week but for now let's see how it works on a driveway in our little car park that is just just a dirt track last time I used to come to me feature I showed you a little trick where if you had two iPhones connected to the same tensor account you can actually leave one in here and the car is trick to thinking you are next to the car so you can go further away and some in the car to you does that still work in twenty twenty twenty 18.1 let's find out so you can clearly see that Holly's phone is down there it's connected to my car it's all on the car knows everything we're going to close the door and lock it so there we go we've locked the car and now this is where previously if you went further than six meters which is probably about here from the car it actually wouldn't drive itself at all so let's go all the way over here and give this a test I've pressed the come to me button is the car going to come to me or is it going to stay over there you can see that actually on the phone it says waiting for phone to come back in reims so they fixed it they actually saw the video and they have fixed the bug so what we sadly have to do is pretend there were a dog walker and hopefully if we get close enough it should start following me I don't know how close I need to get it's just like it's like wiggling its wheels is saying waiting for phone to come okay so now it's driving but the problem is I am right next to it so I don't really know where it's where it's like trying to get to or what it thinks so anyway I'm gonna hold down coming to me still all right come on car this way come on let's go on a little walk waiting for phone to come back in range as you can see this is pants that was a complete failure then so the come to me feature is just absolutely rubbish on the car at the moment and again that's because of the UN regulations all you have to do basically is be within a meter or two of the car so that it's connected by bluetooth and then the car won't drive over 20 meters but the problem with that as you can see is you literally have to be next to your car and if you're next to your car why would you need it to drive itself this is how close I have to be next to my car to make it there we go okay so it's like three meters waiting for pedestrian this actually might be easier if I get in the car and do it we're now in the car and this in theory should solve all issues we don't need to be tethered because obviously we're right in the car bluetooth shouldn't be a connection issue let's see what the car wants to do so we're gonna try and drive this out I'm just using my phone and oh okay interesting so it's gone forward a bit says waiting for path to clear or stopping again waiting for path to clear just waiting for path to clear there is nothing absolutely nothing in the way as you can see and okay now it's it's doing it it's doing it we go in we go in will it go around here oh it's a tight one so as you can see it is pretty tight the car is now okay it now says it's been completed so what we're gonna try and do is get the car to go actually just around this corner that's all I wanted it to do was actually to be able to go around this corner cuz it's quite tight so let's try it again so it's now reversing us back out yeah it's reversing us out for some reason come on you can do it there's a there's a good gap Oh God you can see how quickly yeah no Auto Park aborted so apparently this here is a bit too tight for it to figure out again not great because all I really wanted to do in this situation I wanted to stand at the porch way hold the come to me feature and have the car come pick me up so I didn't get wet and it can't do it for such a big plethora of reasons that's why I just don't use this feature let's try the same corner but in Reverse so I've come forward a little bit now and we're going to try and reverse back around that corner and I really can't see except for actually the cameras down there are quite nice to be able to see yeah this is looking pretty good look at this so it can reverse it can reverse out of here really really well even with Holley there it didn't have a problem it's still going still go in so I mean guys look at this so it's still going I'm not sure why it stops ok there we go so that's the maximum distance reach so that time it actually reversed which is harder out of the space I wanted it to drive that with reversing working so well let's try something totally different I'm gonna be behind the car I'm gonna ask the car to come to me so in theory I should be close enough waiting for phone in reverse here we go so what I'm gonna try and do is just walk my car into a car parking space oh I don't know where it's going here reducing speeds in revert what I don't know what it's trying to do here but all I want it to do is follow me backwards but look it's really struggling and again this this is hat it has to be because I have to be so close to the car then I'm a barrier for the car and you can see it's no it's still going still thinking about it reducing speed until visibility improves I'm not sure what visibility it needs improving but it's just a bit stuck currently it's not doing what it's really meant to be doing all I want to do is stand at the door and hold my come to me button and then the car should come to me pick me up so I don't get wet and then I can go off or I can jump into the house get out the car and tell the car to come park itself with smart summon but as you can see in the UK we can't do any of that this is the one case I have used smart summon and it works well so imagine here that we're gonna really tight car parking space and I actually can't get into my door now what I want to do is I'm gonna stand right there I want the car to come out and basically reverse and then just drive up here and pick me up and save me from trying to scramble through and get past someone else's door so we're gonna do is set that up on the app and this hopefully should actually work without issues so far it's not been great Oh someone can't start at this time I really really want to show everything obviously that the Tesla can do and this is completely unedited just so you guys can see there are still lots of teething issues okay here we go so the car is coming out it's thinking about it waiting for paths to clear okay so I'm not sure what path is is it okay so Holly says it's gonna take out the cone on her side still says waiting for path to clear waiting for paths are clear again there's nothing if there's nothing in its way oh is it is it the comb so I think it's a little bit struggling with the Tony doesn't want to hit the cone we've got one there and we've got one on the other side yeah so I don't know why it's not reversing it's not reversing all the way back and I just don't understand why there we go there we go there we go did it hit the comb no it didn't hit the comb perfect and now ya see so it should have just done that straight away reversing waiting for phone to come back with him range it just drove itself out of range come on come forwards it literally just needs to drive up there waiting for phone to come back into range again this isn't an issue this isn't Tesla's problem by the way this isn't because of Tesla this is because of our stupid regulations there we go job done so it actually did do it but again we've got so many issues because the car you have to stand so bloody close to it but then it drives itself out of range you have to then chase it and it's just a little bit of a nuisance honestly I don't know what else to test because these UN laws win literally so tethered to the car so what I've done is Holly's got the phone in the car this time I'm gonna be there a pedestrian and I'm gonna step out from here when the car is summoning so while he's going into smart summon now I don't know what else to test guys seriously let me know what I should do here it comes hopefully it comes down smoothly this is unedited of Holly just asking the car to come forward oh my god it is slow I can't see what's going on so what is it doing what it needs to do is drive to here that's where we've set but it's literally what's happening to what does it say release the button to stop your vehicle you can see where she set she set for it to go so far ahead and it's just not going for it can't find a clear path Oh can't find a clear path in conclusion then smart summon here in the UK it's really not good it's not Tesla's for it is the UN's for we need this law lifted because with with that law seriously it's just pointless to try and use it it doesn't work it gets confused ah it's such a shame because it's such a cool feature as well and I can't wait for it to be actually D restricted and properly usable in here again if this video hits a thousand likes I'll make sure to go do another video in actual car parks and we'll be able to see the difference of how it reacts on private land like this versus already registered car
