hey there holy homies trace here and I
have been thinking about the new iPhone because of course I have haven't you why
haven't you I'm definitely getting the new one I have a bunch of Apple gear and
different products but this one is different somehow because of trypophobia
some are claiming that the triple camera design is triggering their trip of
phobia and I definitely have questions before we kick into it today welcome
hello I'm sorry for the hiatus I have been working really hard on a couple of
things one I'm going to announce soon but firstly I relocated to LA for
several weeks needless to say I missed you all while I was doing that and I'm
sorry I was gone but now I am back and I am so excited to be here
okay so trypophobia if you've been on the internet over the last decade or so
you've definitely heard of this condition if you google it you'll see
pictures that illustrate trippa phobia but for the sake of everyone who
actually gets triggered out there by this stuff I am gonna show exactly two
images in this whole video ready here's one tres dos uno Oh God oh okay it's
disgusting I feel that did you feel that it wasn't fear it was disgust disgust is
a super strong emotion it likely evolved to protect us from pestilence disease
death and food that would harm us the cool thing about humans is that we do
have some built-in firmware and discussed as part of that no one has to
teach a baby to feel disgust but around three or four years old it just starts
feeling it that little bit of their tiny emotional experience gets activated
disgust doesn't just make us pull that face that
we all recognize it's also paired with involuntary physiological reactions it
decreases our heart rate the opposite of fear and anger and it can cause nausea
and a few other physiological responses as well which we'll come back to in just
a second so this time I'm going to show you another image and I want you to
really drop in to yourself like what are you feeling when you see this photo okay
you ready here it comes tres dos uno Mita
yeah I'm not gonna do it again I promise but what did you feel fear disgust you
hungry you're worried trip a phobia is a
portmanteau or Wamba nation you know word combination of two Greek words trip
a meaning whole and phobia meaning fear the phobia part doesn't really seem to
work though does it you're not feeling fear of holes but disgust at holes yeah
cool right note you might be afraid of the feeling
of disgust but fear doesn't come with nausea so when you think about it that
kind of means that trip a phobia is a fake phobia I mean at least the name is
see in a 2018 study of trypophobia researchers put people in front of an
eye tracker and they measured their pupil dilation they then showed people
images of known triggers for the trip of phobia condition as well as threatening
animals like snakes and spiders fear causes pupils to dilate but disgust
causes them to constrict they're both connected to a version but they have
different purposes the open dilation in fear is to suck in more information prep
for running or fighting or freezing whereas constricted pupils it's so the
eye can focus on a specific thing blocking out light and other extraneous
information to indicate the exact thing that is disgusting us if trippa phobia
was a fear the pupils would dilate and in the study they didn't trip a phobia
isn't a phobia at all it's a phobia you know you know phobia the Greek word for
disgust is idea so it should be trip idea disgust of holes except that's
actually not even about holes either everything you know about trip idea is a
lie in another study of the images that trigger trip a phobia slash trip idea
they looked only at these shared characteristics of images that
definitely trigger the trip of phobia reaction they found that holes don't
actually trigger it but instead it's small repetitive patterns with stark
contrast or high contrast that means the difference between white and black is a
lot poppy seeds on bread could be a trigger as noted in one study closely
clustered polka dots and animal prints cheese aerated chocolate and even
honeycomb are all considered triggers for some so it's neither holy or a
phobia high contrast in Greek is Yip CI ent and these--
so I guess this means trippy phobia should really be called anti FA
the idea sounds real enough to me the prevailing hypothesis as to why these
high contrast marks cause disgust is because of their passing similarity to
the marks of infectious diseases mold and skin infections and that is
supported by a 20-17 study in the British Medical Journal they talked to
over 1,500 people about their history with skin diseases and those who had
been affected experienced a higher likelihood of the miss named trypophobia
so in the end as it turns out once you put some science into it trip a phobia
isn't a fear of holes at all just regular old disgust at skin infections
and it wasn't named antitheses yeah because trippa phobia wasn't discovered
by the ancient Greeks or Victorian scientists but instead has a prestigious
beginning on Geocities an old build your own website spot from the World Wide Web
in the 90s sadly I can't show you the actual post that started at all because
Yahoo just straight-up deleted geo cities in 2009 with no regard for
historic preservation and I obviously have feelings about this but that is for
another video ultimately trypophobia or antitheses
yeah doesn't appear anywhere in the diagnostics and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders version 5 put out by the American Psychiatric Association and
though it afflicts perhaps 16% of the population more research is needed this
discussed based explanation makes so much more sense to me than a fear and
animal seedpod based explanation what about you and even if you're skeptical
just Google Image Search trypophobia because most of the images you're gonna
find our Photoshop and almost all of those that are photoshopped involves
skin or human surfaces it's triggering you because it's about us humans evolved
to protect ourselves from infection and yes some plants and animals mimic the
patterns taken up by those infections but if nothing else
research shows yet again that we are a work in progress
evolution got us over the threshold to notice an infection but not all the way
to fully recognizing exactly what we're seeing so now we're left with this
half-formed disgust reaction that's easily triggered by high contrast
patterns it sucks to be human sometimes I guess but at least now we know as
someone who suffers from trip a phobia / right thanks for being a good human okay
friends new video coming next week just like always I am back I love y'all share
this video with someone who has trip of phobia or you know just tweet it because
I'm sure there are a lot more people out there than you think thanks for watching
I hope you learned something I'm trace
