use the code rll to get 10 off at checkout the indian subcontinent is huge not only in terms of sheer land area but also in terms of the region's population and cultural impact on our world currently seven different countries exist in the region india pakistan bangladesh nepal sri lanka bhutan and the maldives so what would it look like if all seven of these modern countries united overnight to form a new and larger country that we'll be calling for simplicity greater india well for starters the new country's population would be gargantuan 1 billion 728 million 904 000 people or about 23 of the entire world's population almost one out of every four people that is more people than live in north america south america the caribbean and europe combined india alone has more people living there than the entire continent of africa does and that's only going to increase as time goes on this can also be seen by taking a glance at the biggest cities across the new country the top three being delhi karachi and mumbai all of which have higher populations than even new york city does in the u.s of the country's top 10 largest cities seven of them would be located in india while two would be in pakistan and only one in bangladesh from this it's obvious that india is basically the jupiter of the indian subcontinent dominating the region's gravity and the smaller countries that orbit it by its sheer size but what happens when we quit looking at the subcontinent divided by current political reality if we look at an ethnic map of the area it's confusing to say the least there are over 2 000 different and unique ethnic groups present inside of india alone in addition to 22 different major languages only the continent of africa has a higher diversity of cultures genetics and languages than india does but most of these indian ethnic groups can be divided between two major families indo-aryans which account for 73 of hypothetical greater india's population and dravidians which account for 19 with remaining eight percent being a mix of other smaller groups to expand on that the region's linguistic diversity is every bit as diverse as you would expect about one third of the population would be able to speak hindi fifteen percent would speak bengali another 12 percent would understand urdu while the punjabi marathi talugu tamil and gujarati languages would all have significant representation as well four of the world's most significant religions were born inside india hinduism buddhism sikhism and jainism all of which continue to have a significant presence hinduism would make up the vast majority of hypothetical greater india at 63.6 percent of the population while islam would be a significant minority at 31.4 percent christians would only make up 2 buddhists would be represented by 1.7 percent and 6 would make up the final 1.3 percent with other religions only having a tiny following about 34 of greater india's population would be living in cities with the remaining majority of the hypothetical country residing in the countryside perhaps the most challenging problem for the new country would be the region's economy hypothetical greater india would have a combined nominal gdp of 3.4 trillion us dollars which would make it the world's fifth largest economy but considering that india alone is already the world's sixth largest economy all of the additional countries added in would only make it surpass the united kingdom's economy while remaining just behind germany and japan in terms of gdp per capita measured in purchasing power parity the average citizen of this country would be earning seven thousand two hundred sixty-five dollars per year far below the global average of seventeen thousand three hundred dollars per year citizens on average would be earning more than citizens of uzbekistan or vietnam but earning less than those of bolivia or the philippines the economy would however be capable of supporting a very large military budget of 83.8 billion us dollars the third highest budget in the world but significantly behind the budgets of both china and the united states adding in the soldiers from all seven modern countries the hypothetical greater indian army would have an active duty force of 2.6 million soldiers the largest standing army in the world with an additional 2.1 million in the reserves which combined would give the new country the world's fourth largest total military size behind vietnam and the two koreas in the event of a war however greater india would have the largest manpower reserves in the world to pull from some of the new nation's greatest problems would be its high unemployment rate currently hovering around 10 percent and the very young age of the average citizen just 27.6 years old this might not be a huge problem now but as india and the rest of the region develops further it's almost a guarantee that the country will face the same kind of demographic problems currently plaguing places like japan where the average age is a very high 47.3 years somewhere around 50 years from now when india's population has likely begun to stabilize around 1.7 billion people their population will thereafter begin to shrink just like it is in japan and other developed countries around the world perhaps india and the entire region at large can learn from how currently developed countries are handling their demographic issues to prepare for their own future at checkout thank you for watching and i'll see you again next week
