hey i'm alex and this is finally functional if you're new here i'm making more shoes that you'd use in a vr game in this video i use the shoes in a game for the first time keep in mind that these shoes are a work in progress they need lots more of improvements but it can only get better from here with that in mind here i am using the shoes in a game for the first time on this channel i only have forward walking implemented right now to get to this point since last video i had to write a bunch of code all the code is available on github and i'll leave links to them in the video description i've created a sample on how to connect an esp32 microcontroller to a windows 10 pc over bluetooth esp32s are what i'm using in the shoes right now i've also created a sample on how to make a controller driver for steamvr and there's also a wiki page there with lots of details on how it all works so then i took the two samples and i implemented the code that i need for the vr shoes themselves i might in the future make some videos on how those samples work i also had to build a gaming pc because i did not have one before the build was actually pretty easy all i did was follow a guide on youtube and i'll leave a link to that guide in the description as well and after all of that work since last video here we are if i had to describe the shoes right now in one sentence it would be they have potential but they need a lot of work as they are right now they're pretty awkward to walk around in with a vr headset on in my previous videos i didn't have my eyes covered i could see my feet and i didn't realize until this video how much that actually helped so i'm gonna have to go back and make the shoes smoother and have better controls for them so that they're still easy to walk around in and smooth and not awkward when a vr headset is on and like in the last video the shoes aren't fast enough i need to tune them more and this results in the tether that's connecting me to the ceiling pulling on me frequently there are also a few points where it seemed like the shoes just stopped responding it only seemed to happen when i was looking in this direction and i'm not exactly sure why i have a feeling that it might be that the basement floor that i'm using these on isn't perfectly level so there might be some problem there to try and see if i could fix that later on i put a wood sheet on the ground and i used the shoes on that but the wood sheet is also not perfectly level it has a slight bow in it so i did have the problem at the same spot even on the wood sheet so i'm just gonna have to look into that later and figure out what's going on one thing i was happy about was that i didn't feel motion sickness in this game very much at all normally when i play this game i feel a little bit motion sickness but even as the shoes are now being awkward i didn't feel that there was one spot though where i did feel motion sickness but it was not the shoe's fault it was this part in the game where there's this bubble thing that launches you in the air so despite the issues that these shoes have i consider this an accomplishment i got the shoes to work and to end but now i need to go back because every step in that end-to-end process needs improvements first i'm going to go back and redesign the shoes to fix that skinning issue that we saw in the last video then i'm going to work on making the shoes as smooth as possible handle faster speeds and just get them to feel as close to natural walking as possible this is an incredibly challenging project and i just want to thank you guys for your encouragement and the kind things you say while i try to figure all this out if you guys want more frequent updates you can check out my discord or my twitter video so youtube knows that this video is actually good and with that here are a few more minutes of gameplay and i'm gonna stop talking thanks guys i'll see you next time attention zombies are approaching in five four three two one attention zombies are approaching in five four three two attention zombies are approaching in five four two you have less than 20 of electricity so there is no more electricity you need to pull lever to regenerate the power there is no more electricity you need to pull level to regenerate the power attention zombies are approaching in five four two one alert you have less than 20 percent of electricity attention in five four three two one oh wow [Music] you
