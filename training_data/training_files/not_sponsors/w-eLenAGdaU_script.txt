Jiwon, Seoyeon, and Gyuri
are the youngest people now! Sure~ What did you say, Jiwon? That was rude (The penalty for losing Mafia
was to speak formally!) We don't need to be the youngest,
we just have to speak formally Losers for next round
will be the youngest people! (Next game is World Chain!!!)
(First word to start the game is “spring picnic”) Strawberry! Sorry! Spring picnic is warm~ Warm is banana(?) It's hard! I can't come up with anything~ My brain is not working~ Make it work! There are 2 black holes sitting here~ Should I go first? Strawberry is good~ Good is banana! (???) Wait, I can't think of anything! Let's make it slower~ (This is how you play games!!!)
Banana is long~ (Jiwon shows how it's done)
Long is Nagyung~ Nagyung is short~ That's how you play it! Song Hayoung is stupid~ Stupid is you~ You are smart~ Smart is Nagyung~ Nagyung is short~ Short is Jisun! Jisun is long~ Long? Jiheon! Jiheon is pretty! Pretty is Jiwon~ Jiwon is foolish~ Jiwon is stupid… It's neither fun nor moving! What's going on~? 1! 2! 3! 4! Let's go again! Go! Go! Go! Clouds are soft~ Soft is cream bread~ Wood is hard~ I don't think she understands it!… She was thinking! What should we do with her…? Cherry blossoms are pretty~ Pretty is Nagyung~ Nagyung is stupid~ Stupid is Chaeyoung~ Saying the members' names
is prohibited! Teasing is prohibited! We just keep saying
each other's names… Sky is blue~ Blue is Chaeyoung… I'm leaving~ "Wood is hard" was better~ Spring picnic is gimbap! Gimbap is strawberries! Strawberries are good~ (“Gimbap is strawberries…?”
Hayoung is silly hahaha) That makes no sense~ Unni! Why is gimbap strawberries? Strawberryflavored gimbap! Why!!! That makes no sense~ Yes! It does~ It does not~ You are out! (It makes sense! It doesn't make sense!)
(Gimbap is strawberries?! How will this come to an end?!) Gimbap an strawberries… We'll believe you
if you eat them together!!! I can't lose… (Ahhh!)
(fromis_9's spring picnic got chaotic!) She has such a big pride! It's fine! (Game resumes!!!)
Practice room is big~ Big is my house! My house is small! Small is Chaeyoung's house! Chaeyoung's house is big~ Big is? My heart! My heart is good! Small is our room~ She said good~ Let's let it go just once! Again…? This is the end of our ideas~ Air-conditioner is cool! Cool is ice cream! Ice cream is bad! Good is… She said it's bad~! She said it was really bad! We are playing a game right now~ Finally giving up and 
getting ready for the next game We'll play a new game~ Good~ Are the strawberries good? Wearing heal inserts
make you taller(?) Let's win!!! (Saerom & Hayoung's team chant is “Ha-Rom”) (Listen to Ji-won's singing) (And guess the song and singer!)
This is hard!!! Practice round! IU! I guess they don't know~ (Hahahahahahaha) It got more confusing~ Sing more! Sing more! EXID… Night Rather Than…? I know! EXID's Up&Down! IU's Twenty-three! Correct! That was hard~ You are a good singer~ (Jiwon's) singing was bad! You have to sing like that~ WINNER's… It's the… WINNER!
REALLY REALLY! fromis_9! Glass Shoes! Correct! Good job! We got it right!!! Maktub! To You My Light! Kinetic Flow! Psychedelic Forest! Correct!!! I remembered just now! Jisun is a rapper, you know!… There's rapper's blood in her~ She has that blood in her~ 0 points… I got 0 points... but isn't feeling
happy what's important? It is! Taeyang! Eyes, Nose, Lips! You're out! Let me sing now! (G)I-DLE… Uh-Oh! You're out! (G)I-DLE! Uh-Oh! Red Velvet! Dumb Dumb! Correct!!! Wow! She's good! She's good! Let make the last question
out of 10 points! Let's make it out of 100 points! Is that okay? 100 points? Give the chance to Ha-Rom!!!
Let us turn the game around~ Wait! I forgot how this goes… BtoB's… Only One for Me! Kim Jongkook! One Man! Wrong! Davichi's Do Men Cry! BtoB! Only One for Me! (Chaeyoung & Nagyung got the last question
right and turned the game around) (Saerom & Hayoung will get penalized
for not getting any question right) I'm so glad to be out here away
from the practice room at the tulip festival and enjoy the scent of spring… After this, we need to get
changed and dance here… Be quiet~ This is the practice room, but it was so fun
how it felt like we went on a spring picnic~! You can fun too, right~? It was fun~! You had fun too, right~? It was so fun~ There are flowers in the back, it's sunny
and the sky is clear, it's so nice! I got the spring fever just now,
so I shall go and sleep now~ Bye~ We loved the food~ Yes! It was so fun today~ See you later~ Our flover~ We're cleaning up right now! (The members are so nice, helping
Saerom & Hayoung cleaning up as penalty) We came all the way here to Netherlands
today and had a chance to film ourselves I feel so happy right now The tulips are seriously so pretty,
so I took many pictures of them I'll keep them in my memory as well I want to come back some day! Oppa~ Buy me a cheeseburger~ Rhythm… Soul… Stop it!!! I was playing along with you~ Thank you, Gyuri! It would be so obvious
if Hayoung becomes the mafia… That pink shirt made you so cute~ (Stay tuned for next week's FM_1.24~) Strawberry series!
