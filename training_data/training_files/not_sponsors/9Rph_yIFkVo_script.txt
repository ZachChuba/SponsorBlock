this video is brought to you by Squarespace so some context last month I was invited to speak to plotline a non-profit film and media school in Springfield Missouri they educate and empower aspiring creators through weekly classes camps community events and scholarships they're all about one thing which is teaching people how to make movies specifically the youngsters among us and originally intended to post a few highlight clips of this talk but the day of the event a massive snowstorm rolled into town and although we still had great attendance lots of folks who wanted to come simply couldn't make it because of the road conditions so I decided for the folks who missed it I just go ahead and post the whole thing if an hour-long lecture /qa about YouTube and the future of online filmmaking isn't up your alley no worries I'll catch you in the next video for those of you who are interested buckle up special thanks to Jim bolt is everyone a plot line and the staff of the Springfield Art Museum for putting on the event enjoy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thanks guys is this on no how about this yeah you see I turn it on mute so that when I was noodling around backstage I wouldn't embarrass myself and as a consequence of already embarrassing hey thank you guys for coming out I really appreciate everyone being here it just kind of goes with my luck of things that a snowstorm hits the day of the venue but the last one of these things that I did we had one person show up so this is a vast improvement I really appreciate you all being here and I really like what plotlines stands for I only met Jim a month or two ago told me a little bit about plotline I like what it stands for stories that matter and all the work that's being done here in Springfield I'm a Springfield native I was born and I was raised here and I still live here and this is where I've chosen to make my life and make my work and we are living in a very interesting time with filmmaking specifically online filmmaking to where you don't necessarily have to go to one of the two big cities in order to be a filmmaker and I like to think that I'm a little bit of a living testament to that so my name is Austin McConnell I run a YouTube channel youtube.com slash Austin McConnell and on that channel I do all different kinds of videos and I do all different kinds of films and I've been able to find some success over the past really the past year or two so let's just get into it and talk a little bit about the success that I've had and what I want to maybe in part to some of you all who are here today so I have this channel I've got about seven hundred and sixty five thousand subscribers at this point across my channel I've had around 61 million views I think I've uploaded probably just about 70 videos probably only 50 of which are actually public at this point in time I was nominated for the breakout youtuber of the Year award at the 10th annual Shorty Awards and did not win but it's an honor just to be nominated I'm primarily known right now for my work in YouTube and in the online filmmaking space but before I really focused on that I was just your run-of-the-mill wannabe filmmaker from Springfield how many here have heard of the saito 48 challenge a few of you so Springfield in the Ozarks 48 hour film challenge you're given two days to make a five-minute short film and I I guess I got started making films through that challenge I started when I was in high school and during my run of participating in that event I managed to collect about 16 different saito 48 awards from a variety of different categories so cinematography sound design editing acting 2014 I won the award for best film I also produced a web series in conjunction with a Los Angeles based company called equal entertainment they produced a web series called lonely girl 15 which was sort of this pioneer web series web series weren't really a thing in the early 2000s I guess we could say mid 2000s but they started it and I was fortunate enough to be able to partner with them to make a season of that show called lonely girl 15 outbreak I was a photojournalist at ky3 kspr 33 I was in Springfield I was trying to figure out a way how can I make money pursuing my passion of telling stories through motion pictures and I found myself at ky3 and at kspr trying to do just that I eventually left and attempted to create a feature film well I did create a feature films called sprouting orchids I produced it in 2013 and it was released in 2014 it wasn't nearly as successful as I wanted it to be but I learned a lot as any filmmaker does when they make their very first feature so I was trying to find my footing as an independent filmmaker in southwestern Missouri which is a pretty tall order but up to that point for whatever reason I just wasn't finding success you can tell I'm a millennial because I use emojis in my dog so I decided that I would turn to the online space through YouTube I actually started a YouTube channel in June of 2007 YouTube looked a lot different back then this is what the YouTube homepage looked like back then there was no such thing as the trending tab back then there was no such thing as integrated sponsorships or anything like that you were really lucky if you knew how to put together a 50 second to 90 second video and have enough processing power to upload it and be entertaining enough for people to watch it and to really follow what you do things have obviously changed quite a bit since that time now people make their living from doing online work in realms like YouTube I want to show you this slide right here this is the view count on my channel after 8 years of being on YouTube so from 2007 to 2014 you'll notice for a long time absolutely nothing was happening these little spikes that you see here are when I would upload my saito 48 short films I would post a short film and maybe I'd be lucky to get a thousand views that day but is really just primarily other people competing in saito 48 who are just trying to check out the competition for that particular year not a lot of success on a worldwide scale around about 2013 I got the brilliant idea what if I put video game footage online for a new game and I did that and it got me a little bit of interest for a couple of days and then you can tell that it staggered out and did eventually went back down to these levels in other words the levels of nothing so this was what it was like after being on YouTube for 8 years in total 8 years of trying to figure out what kind of methods can I use to make movies on YouTube here's my view count now if you look at it today so remember that big spike I showed you just a second ago on the previous slide this is that spike right there and so it continued to have nothing happen and then something happened clearly right here on my channel that caused things to really take off I mean one day I got almost a million views in a single day and so it's what happened here that I want to spend just a few minutes before maybe we take some questions and talk about because I like to think that if maybe I can tell you what I did to turn my channel around maybe you can apply it to some of the things that you want to do and some of the stories that you want to tell through online video so how exactly did I turn this channel of obscure short films into a successful channel the channel that it is today I had to ask myself a very sobering question it's one question that really I want you to ask yourself and the kinds of motion pictures that you are putting together and making as well I had to look at my channel I had to look at the content that I was making and ask myself why would anybody actually watch this if you had looked at my channel up to that point it consisted of some short films that I had made and then I guess what you could describe as camera tests I would buy a new camera and I would want to play around with it and so you'd go on my channel and you might find like a bunch of 30-second videos of leaves on trees because I got a new 50 millimeter lens and I could rack focus and I thought that was awesome so I did a bunch of tests on that and those are the kinds of videos that you would find on my channel but a question obviously was well who out there really cares about that why would anybody want to watch a bunch of glorified camera tests why would anybody want to watch these kind of weird short artsy films from some noble in Missouri that wasn't working so I came up with a new strategy I was gonna make videos that people wanted to watch I know it sounds earth-shattering but you'd be surprised how many people out there who are trying to find success through online video things like YouTube even straining services like twitch who'd haven't asked themselves why would anybody watch the things that I'm making right now and haven't come up with this strategy yet and really I think what this goes to that I think you can learn a lot from organizations like plotline is that I was trying to find stories that were worth telling stories that people would actually listen to pay attention to and become invested in and so from that point forward I decided I'm gonna try and make videos that people will actually watch so I started telling stories and I started examining the popular stories that were out there in the world and before too long I began to have an audience millions of people for some reason began paying attention to some of these videos that I made some of them were a little bit more of the parody nature some of them tackled tackled some real-world subjects and before too long I actually had an audience film criticism I found there was a community of people who were invested in older films and wanted to know more about them and so I started covering a variety of different topics I don't want to spend too much on all the different videos that I and topics that I cover but I'm just gonna do this one because it's a cool story I was on that I was that is my honeymoon I'll get it out eventually my wife and I were in London and we went to this small obscure comic shop and they had some Star Wars comics in the corner and I pulled one out and it was this comic book called tagging I had this small series called really weird Star Wars on my channel or I cover obscure weird factoids about the Star Wars universe pretty popular franchise and I try and make it as entertaining as possible I found this comic these two obscure sort of parody characters and I decided to make a video about them before too long over a million people watched it and one day after uploading this there came a tweet from Ron Howard the director of solo Star Wars story he decided to put tag and in that film the Internet's pretty weird and he shot scenes including tagging in solo a Star Wars story and they were deleted scenes but if you get the whole movie version of it you can check out some deleted scenes and you'll see tag and  in the background I started covering more serious topics I started creating what I'm starting to realize now were basically documentaries about various things that happen throughout history and I slowly but surely found an audience I started talking about the film that I made and it wasn't successful and this retrospective about the film I made is wildly more successful than the film itself ever was I started talking about obscure factoids like traffic diverging diamonds in Springfield Missouri it turns out 2.1 million people in the world for whatever reason want to hear about that and I kind of had this weird viral video about what to do if your parachute fails actually we've got that let's just play this this is like one of the shorter videos I do it's only four minutes it's kind of goofy this will be the only audio-visual presentation [Applause] yeah so a thing I made in one afternoon is wildly more successful than things I spend months on but that's easily the way it goes half a million people click thumbs up on that that's crazy to me the other thing people ask me how I come up with jokes on my channel what I tell them is I first tell the joke to my wife and if she rolls her eyes I put the joke in so enough about me how can you do it there are a lot of you here who are probably interested in online video or telling stories through online mediums like YouTube or other platforms like Twitter or Instagram what I want to do is I want to share with you some of the tips and some of the advice that I can glean from what I've been able to do to grow my audience we don't have a whole lot of time and I want to get to some questions so I'm just going to kind of speed through these first five are pretty general and the second five are sort of specific to YouTube but you can maybe use your imagination and cross apply it to your particular online platform so ten ways that I grew my audience from that flat line at the beginning to where it is today if you follow these techniques I can promise you in some form or fashion your online audience will grow might not grow immediately but you're going to see a lot more growth than if you continue to do the same things that you do that aren't finding any kind of success so ten ways to grow your audience ten ways that I use to grow my audience the first was that I needed to learn to upload consistent and quality content so that brings forth two interesting questions what is consistent and what do I mean by quality on YouTube consistency is the key you need to have some form of schedule in which you upload my problem was that I uploaded maybe once a year my saito entry for that year and it's hard to have a recurring viewership if you're just uploading once a year maybe once every three months people want to know that you're going to create videos regularly and that they're going to regularly be able to watch things that you produce that's going to encourage them to subscribe and stick around because they know that once they hit subscribe they're going to have regular content in their subscription box the second thing is quality one of the questions I get asked a lot and I'm gonna answer it now so that I don't have to answer it in the QA is what kind of camera do I need to buy if I want to start making movies and here's the answer you don't need to buy a camera you need to buy a microphone nowadays we have really high quality cameras in our pockets you'd be surprised how many successful youtubers who are wildly more successful than I am we're talking millions upon millions of subscribers shoot all of their stuff with their phone the difference is they have attached to it a high quality microphone in fact you may know this you might know this when you click on a video on YouTube the first thing you notice is not the visuals it's the sound if videos hurt your ears or they have terrible sound quality you click off one of the things that really helped to me was that I started paying more attention to sound design now it's at the point where I will literally spend a week doing sound mixing making sure that the sound is of a good enough quality and consistency to where people will at the very least enjoy what they're hearing a good audio overcomes a multitude of video or visual sins I've found a large portion of my audience will never spend a second looking at the video portion of my video there are so many people who watch my channel who they just listen to it in the background they open it and they're working or they're doing schoolwork and they're just listening like it's a podcast that kind of hurts me to the core because I think of the weeks and weeks I spend on the video and the visuals but all the same if you're looking for what kind of camera that you need to use for your videos if you want to get started it's likely you already have a good enough camera your pocket if you focus more on the sound quality you'll actually be able to increase the quality of your video more which is weird to me I'll never understand why people will spend $2,000 on a really high-quality camera but they act like it's pulling a tooth to spend 200 bucks on a good microphone when you'll actually see more of a quality jump from that microphone than if you had spent two grand on the camera anyway you know I said I was gonna be fast with these but you know that's how it goes when you get on a roll second thing I needed to develop personality and I needed to connect with my viewers nobody knew who Austin McConnell was it was just a dude shooting a bunch of camera tests nobody knew anything about me and as a result if people don't know anything about you or they don't feel any kind of personal connection to you they're probably not going to subscribe to your channel and so I needed to learn to showcase a little bit more about myself and the way that I did that was that I started telling some personal stories I started telling some stories that meant a lot to me in my life and it turns out that other people could relate to that and because they could relate to that they felt a connection they were willing to follow the things that I make even to this day need to give a viewers your viewers a reason to subscribe to your channel so what's the one thing that every youtuber says at the end of their videos don't forget to don't forget to Like and subscribe well here's the thing everybody says that so it means nothing what you need to do is give them a reason to subscribe a reason to click like a reason to be invested into the stuff that you are making and so for me it was telling better stories and telling them why they needed my videos in their subscription box and the best way to give people a reason to subscribe is to is to tell them stories that they can connect with and stories that will actually move them whether it's make them laugh make them chuckle make them roll their eyes or make them feel something deep if you establish a connection with your audience you can grow your channel another small thing is that you want to invest yourself in the online community and so I started commenting on other youtubers videos that were in my niche people who were making videos like my videos I started interacting with them and commenting on their videos and investing time into making a connection with them now I tell this piece of advice to some people usually younger kids and I say well one of the things you can do is comment on other people's videos and then they go and they comment check out my channel that's not actually talking to them that's spam and people don't like spam engage in the community and develop relationships with people one of the great things about online video is that you can have a one-to-one connection remove the middleman you can do that yes even though it gets a bad rap through comments and so why not utilize that embrace your small size I know a lot of people who start out and they they want to be the next big streamer they want to be the next big bloggers and they just make cookie cutter copies of the already popular fan already popular creators don't act and sound like you're a big YouTube channel because you aren't and when I stopped trying to act as if I was bigger than I actually was and embrace the small size that I had in the close-knit community and the intimate stories I was telling I began to see growth these next five as I said are sort of YouTube centric and I'm going to speed through them fairly quickly understand the algorithm there's this term that goes around on YouTube all if you want to be successful you've got to figure out what the YouTube algorithm is it's like some kind of code that once you crack it all of the wonders of work of the world are open to you so here's what the algorithm is the algorithm is the audience you might say what do you mean by that well here's essentially how YouTube determines the algorithm by the way they tell you this once you go on their site and just go to the Help Center ask them how it works the algorithm is YouTube tracks what people watch and what they don't watch and track how much time they spend watching it in a figure called watch time and then attracts whether somebody likes or dislikes or says not interested on the feedback maybe some of you've seen this when you're on YouTube on the desktop it'll occasionally pop up and say we saw you watch this video how did you like it and you can either say it was great it was good it was okay or it was not interesting if somebody says your videos not interesting YouTube usually bumps it down on the list YouTube wants people to stay on YouTube and so if you make good quality videos that actually keep people engaged and on the site and a longer watch time the algorithm is gonna move your videos up on the rankings if you Google or search KFC right now on YouTube I think I'm probably like the fifth or sixth video on the entire site because I did a video about Kentucky Fried Chicken a lot of people talk about what is watch time what is YouTube considers watch time well it's people who are viewing your video but also the view duration so if somebody goes on your video and they watch it for two seconds and then go yeah and click off it's not really gonna move things for you if you're telling a great ten minute story and you have a long view duration you're gonna have an increased watch time they also track something called session starts session time and session ends I'm going to say this very quickly because there's a lot of confusion about it YouTube will also track how long a session is here's what a session is if they if you open up your YouTube app and you see one of my videos in the feed and you press it and you start watching it they count that as a session start on my channel and the session time is how long you stay on YouTube after having watched that video of mine a session end is when somebody's watching a video and they then leave YouTube as a platform that's a session end YouTube's algorithm likes you if you are a lot if you trigger a lot of session starts and you trigger a lot of session time if you trigger a session end in other words when someone was watching your video they were so bored that they actually left a YouTube all together and Wendon did something else YouTube doesn't like that and so you know that's something you should think about if you're doing long-form storytelling and long-form content and also say this just is a little bit of inside baseball you have the way to link to other things through your YouTube videos sometimes people link to sites that are not on YouTube and so maybe in your video you say hey go check out this website and people go and they check it out right after having watched your video and they leave YouTube that's still technically a session end so you got to be careful sometimes about the things that you link to but on the other hand if I link to some other youtuber who has like an hour long great video that's amazing and you're watching my video and I suggest it and then they go click on it and they go when they watch it for that long span of time that still counts as my session if you started on my video and so if you collaborate with other creators you can actually begin to find success in that particular area so understanding a little bit about it helps somebody sent me this online it's a web series and they this is what they had to say they had made this series and then they said here's what we need to do folks we want to trick YouTube's algorithms and make our show number one so in order to do that everybody needs to go to youtube and search for our series and then click on the first episode and the more our friends fans and followers do this it'll make youtube think that our video is the most important thing under that search let's make it happen invite everybody so my friend sent me this and he just had a simple question which was why not just make a better show like why try and trick the algorithm into thinking your show is important why not make a good show and so what I've learned through this is that it's not something you trick it's not some kind of code that you need to crack you need to think about the stuff that you're making and whether you're telling stories worth telling you're creating things that people will actually watch here a big one fix your title and your thumbnail optimizing your title and your thumbnail will facilitate growth for your channel so here's a quick thing one on the left one on the right which one would you click on left exactly you know I know why the left because it's way better this is the exact same topic exists almost the exact same time just two different thumbnails and two different titles and as a result ones barely breaking mm and the other ones almost at a million - star wars films they don't want you to see well I'm gonna watch him and so you click on the video right what's the other one video review - the Ewok adventure - caravan of you gonna click on that probably not first off the films called caravan of courage his titles so long that it doesn't it fills up the character limit and look at his thumbnail it's an unlit you know dark image of the guy with his eyes closed I mean who's gonna click on that this one it's a Star Wars logo right on your face shifted to the left you've got one character you recognise one character you've never seen before you think who's that you look at the title I'm a Star Wars fan what's this all about you click it boom they're invested you can get a lot of people on your channel if you think about the title and the thumbnail a lot of you are aspiring filmmakers think about it like this when it comes to marketing you want to make sure you've got a good movie poster something that's eye catching right well the thumbnails are basically the movie poster of your video there are literally times now when I'm working on a video I will spend a couple of days going through drafts of different thumbnails and drafts of different titles and I test it out with people which of these two would you actually click on or which of these four is the most clickable before I ever put the video out that's a little bit of learning marketing you learn all kinds of tricks and trades an online video especially when you're doing it yourself such as I do and I did when I first began noodling around on YouTube on YouTube you have cards and end screens you can link to outside the videos this can increase your subscriber rate you want to encourage discussion in the comments section I have a rule on my channel which is that if somebody leaves a comment on my channel that's insightful whether I agree with it or not if it's got people talking whether it's positive towards me or negative towards me I pin it to the top and I'll let everybody see it because the generating discussion and you can ask prompt questions in your video to facilitate a conversation now hey let me know what you thought about this video is not a prompt question you want to actually get them engaged on something that has to do with the subject of what you're talking about in the video and this is the big one is develop a sustainable workflow and how you create these things create a routine for making videos and be dedicated you youtubing didn't become a job for me until I started treating it like it was a job and I started putting myself into it and I tried to make it work as best I could and I now have a workflow to where I know I've got a video coming out every week on my channel and if I miss a week then we're gonna make that up on the back end the next week or the week after that we're gonna try and have at least four videos out on my channel every month when I first started out I could only do one every two months but just like weightlifting the more you begin to carry a certain load the easier it becomes the stronger you get the more skilled you are you can up the weights and so I could only handle one video every two months maybe you can only handle one video every three months but if you get started the more you work that muscle the better you'll become at creating these stories telling these stories creating this content making these videos putting them out there and you can start to have a sustainable and consistent workflow and you can find success as well so I have a lot of success going on right now and I've been really fortunate I've been really lucky and really blessed that it's happened but I want you to notice most of all at least ten long years in the wilderness where nobody cared and nothing was happening if I had submitted my feature film to the Orlando Film Fest three years ago nobody would have cared that if rejected it was not a good movie but now I've been able to find success in online video that they literally invite me to come speak at the festival to other aspiring filmmakers so the face of filmmaking is changing and it seems to be that the future is through online filmmaking and whether that's true or not I know this the entry barrier is lower than it has ever been to tell great and interesting stories and the best time to start is right now for me because of the success that I've been lucky enough to have through online video I've been able this past year to finally start a legitimate video production company I've opened a studio and we're working on projects and we're working on another feature film that has a way bigger budget than I would have ever thought possible before I started doing any of this I kind of had a ten-year plan of if I get started in 2016 then by 2026 I can maybe scrounge out enough resources to start a studio I've been very lucky and I've been very blessed and that I found success through online video to where I got it started just this year and we've got a lot of things in the work and I can't wait for you all to hear these stories and but most of all I'm excited for you all to get started and tell your stories too so thank you guys very much for being here and I guess we'll do some Q&A right now [Applause] I don't know how we're gonna do this Oh before you say that I've got a when I do Q&A is I have three rules number one it's got to be about the topic we just talked about so it's got to be about filmmaking your online video or something like that number two you've got to be able to tell it in 30 seconds and number three a question ends in a question mark so you know haven't formulated and if it's if you just asked me to shout out your channel you know come see me afterwards and we'll see if we can work something out what app do I use to open graphics okay so the question was what app or what program do I use for graphics primarily I use the Adobe suite so when I do my straight cut editing I use Adobe Premiere when I do motion graphics I use Adobe After Effects I learned Adobe After Effects when I was like 13 years old and it's changed quite a bit since then but I use the Adobe suite for most of my stuff now I also use other things outside of the Adobe suite most of my audio I record in audacity which is a free program you can go download now so motion graphics it's After Effects and there's plenty of online tutorials to learn how to do things and it's so supported nowadays that you can even get templates to do flashy graphics and change those around and customize them yourself one of the ways that I get over stage fright is I just don't have my glasses on so now that they're on I'll do my best thank you for telling us a little bit about YouTube sure mine I'd like to hear a little bit more about what your vision is for this video production company like what to use what would you like to achieve within the next like five years so right now we're focused on making the feature film that I would like to have out by you know sometime in 2020 while at the same time facilitating the continued growth of this YouTube channel one of the things I really want to focus on is trying to find sort of a middle ground to where I can use the audience that I've been able to be lucky enough to gain through YouTube and channel it in a way that helps to promote other creators as well and so I was able to be lucky enough to meet some up-and-coming creators through various means and I'm talking with them to maybe bolster some of their projects but right now I'm focusing on finishing pre-production of my feature film and move into production later this year have it out by 2020 the long-term thing of that is that I'm just going to try and tell stories that are interesting to me through it and we'll see what kind of opportunities lie within that the other thing is that online video is quite volatile people will probably stop caring about my channel in like three months and so I always have that like hanging over my head so I try not to plan out five years you know you have a vague idea of where you want to be in five years but I don't have like a milestone like I'm a failure if I haven't hit that goal I just want to keep focused on the here and now and what I have the resources available to do right now when you Mason's how do you add music when you make animations so I use a program called Adobe Premiere it's what's called a nonlinear editor I don't know if that's something that plotline talks about but essentially it's computer program where I import all of my footage and then I do some animation and an animation program I export that as a video and then I put that video into that program and I put it on what's called a timeline and then I can bring in external audio that I've recorded through a microphone and I can plop it on top of whatever I want I've actually gotten to the point where I can record video and I can you know I can I do a video like the the skydiving thing and everything was very fast-paced and really hyper it didn't sound like that when I recorded it I did probably like 16 takes but I've gotten so tricky to it now I can take multiple takes and kind of cut them in such a way that it sounds like it was all done in one smooth take are you planning on doing Sato this year no I will never do say two again no because the thing the thing is now I've you know when I did say - I love Sato because it was opportunity for me as a young unproven filmmaker to work on my craft and to have a goal like I wanted to win an award and so you know when I was doing Sato there was like 40 people 40 teams competed a year and I like won six awards the first year that I did it you can't really do that now you got over a hundred teams competing it's really tough nowadays - everybody's got really high quality stuff and you know what I am transitioning to doing now is more than behind the scenes helping that event to grow and to encourage other creators to take part in it if you're an aspiring filmmaker and you want to have an event to test your filmmaking ability in and you haven't done it yet there's no better venue in Springfield than Sato 48 you've got the best upcoming filmmaking talent and you've got two days to put your skills to the test I wasn't getting bored when I checked my watch I just wanted to see how much or how little I could ramble with each question hi thank you thank you guys for having me yeah so I wanted to ask you have your channels extremely random subpoena buddies from the video to video and yet you still have a core dedicated audience on HD video I see like the same people that are talking about it so what would you say that the core theme that each of your videos has that keeps that audience connected to your content that's a good question I get asked that a lot I cover a lot of random subjects one day it's Harry Potter the next it's diverging diamond to interchanges then it's Kentucky Fried Chicken all different kinds of topics and subjects I've got a ghost story I'm going to be telling later this month or a ghost town story that I'm really excited about so his question was what would I consider the common theme of the channel somebody asked me that in YouTube comments he's like dude I can't figure out what is the theme of your channel and I said I am the theme if I tell the story then it goes on my channel and maybe it's a funny story maybe it's a sad story but stuff that I find interesting I try and put on my channel or highlight you said that my videos are very random my personality is pretty random so that's a pretty accurate reflection one of the benefits though is that what I was sort of subtly doing was that I would cover one kind of popular subject and one kind of popular subject and I was kind of pulling people from different corners of the web together and kind of putting them all under a single single basket and then I slammed that basket on top of them and trapped them no but you understand what I'm saying if I focus too much on you know there are some people who have watched collection channels what have you what if something happens you don't want to talk about watches a week for one week you talk about something different bring back the watches me what's going on so I've been able to free myself up to if people go on my channel it's something it's a video in which I am presenting it that's the theme unless it's not who knows I think you've learned with my second question they have to wait for your there we go now my second question I've learned I have to wait because after you're done with the question you have one final comment sorry I'm really bad about like awkward silences so I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you've learned about good script writing what I've learned about good script writing yes with each video anything mentioned you have to prepare where you're going to present so every script I write I approach it as if it's a movie that I'm making you know you have a defined beginning middle and end there's pre-production there's production there's post-production on everything I make if I'm telling a real word world story I will have to spend a month or two months sometimes half a year researching and trying to figure out all the details and how to condense it into something that's not too long because everybody has a certain attention span I might be stressing at this evening being here but I try and figure out how can I tell the story in the amount of time it needs to be told and then get out and not tread too much water so sometimes the story takes 15 minutes sometimes the story takes half an hour I basically view it as I would any other film eyes try and see if there's any chafa in it there's any fat that needs to be cut out stuff that's boring and sometimes I will literally just sit with my assistant or I'll sit with my wife and I'll play a of the video and if I can tell they're kind of getting bored I know okay how do I condense that how do i how do I cut that or how do i reword it in a way to where it's better so trial and error I guess you know like anything screenwriting is a muscle and the more you do it the easier it becomes it took me a long time to write a good ten minute YouTube video for a really long time but the more I did it the easier it became and a good thing about YouTube and something you don't get from a traditional movie theater or traditional TV show for that matter is that you can go into YouTube analytics and you can click on a videos analytics and their watch time and you can actually see a bar graph of the video on what they've watched and it'll dip and that's when people have stopped watching and YouTube will actually tell you on average how long people will stay on a video for me I've learned that most audiences stay on a video of mine for about seven to seven and a half minutes and so I've tried to do better about getting a little bit over that's because I have some more diehard followers who will watch it for longer than that but I try and tell the crux of the story or the best bits of the story during the time period I know people are watching I mean sometimes have you ever seen those presidential debates and they've got that like ticker on the bottom and if one of the candidates that's something that people really don't like it just any all they messed it up they did something wrong so I can literally watch my video and there's a ticker on the bottom I can literally see the point in time in which I become boring and it helps okay so I'm a part of a business program and I was asked to do a promotional video for the program for like the schools in this area and I was wondering how you stay focused on project to where you see it through instead of getting bored so that's my kryptonite right I fall in love with a project until I get 66% done with it and then I just want to be done and work on something else because something else has caught my attention is really really hard you've got to be really dedicated to the material and sometimes you know sometimes I'm working on something and I fall out of love with it and I want to be on something else but you know I've got to finish what I've started it really helped when I made my first feature film it really helped to have a project that I had to work on that entire year with YouTube I'm onto something after two weeks and so the more projects you work on then the easier it becomes to know when it's okay to kind of let off the gas or shift your attention to something else I had something halfway intelligent to say and then I forgot it as you continue to create videos and you cover a wide variety of subjects as I do you learn to not fall totally in love with every idea that comes along the way and it becomes easier to it becomes easier to not feel so guilty when it's time to move on to something else really weird Star Wars is a great example I wanted to do six episodes of that because there were six movies and there still are only six movies but the audience has moved off of it I did three in a row and people like alright we get it you like Star Wars go back to talking about traffic I mean come on anything different than that and so sometimes the audience is ready to move on I'm not ready to move on I've got to not be so proud and humble myself and and say okay maybe I've talked this topic to death and so now I'll release a really weird Star Wars every six months or so and so you know having the variety is important but there is a danger in you know constantly wanting to move on to the next thing for me it really helps that if I don't get the video out I have a lot of sponsors who are really mad at me and so it really helps if you've got that like overhanging consequences of not doing your job so you know have it also helps if you work with other people if you have a group that's working on it together and everyone needs to get it done you can feed off of each other's energy and stay focused I have a question when I talk to you and actually you mentioned the KFC video a few times yeah we had coffee that one day you told me this story I wonder if you could share that theory about that it was really interesting so I made this video about what went wrong with Kentucky Fried Chicken have you guys been to KFC recently it's disgusting right now every KFC I ever walked into was absolutely disgusting when I was an adult but it was like Disney World when I was a kid that confused me so I was like let me make a video about this and I had just released my first video essay and it was it had kind of popped it had over I think a hundred thousand views which is like whoa I can retire from making videos online now this is as good as ever gonna get I've been working on this kind of goofy video about KFC which was an in-depth look about the failures of the franchise in its current state but still taking a more humorous approach to it I released it on Christmas Eve if I was like this is a goofy video is VI I'll just release it on Christmas even maybe people like I woke up this Christmas day and boy was it Christmas Day had like 800,000 views is crazy like it was my first viral video that was like on trending like everybody was watching it I went to the comments section there's just a bunch of Japanese what is happening so I learned that in Japan there's this thing called kurisumasu niwa kentucky which is roughly translated Christmas in Kentucky just as we turkey on Thanksgiving if you're in Japan and it's Christmas Eve you go to Kentucky Fried Chicken I don't know it's a thing I released that KFC video on Christmas Eve so on Christmas Day to my great surprise one third of the internet was googling Kentucky Fried Chicken and I had the most recent and apparently most entertaining video about KFC and so it shot up the YouTube charts and so every now and then the Czar's kind of aligned in something fortunate like that happens just like the parachute thing the thing you think will go viral is not the thing that goes viral and so you can't become too proud but I worked so hard on this thing for three months like a hundred thousand people have watched it and then I do this one thing and I spent a day on it it's got nine million views what's up with that you can't you just have to accept that that's part of the online thing some things will pop for seemingly no reason and you've got to you know you've got to roll with those punches and and be happy about it because although that's kind of weird that led into other people watching the other videos I make and to this day I still get people who watch the KFC video and that's how they know me I'm like the traffic guy to some people I'm the KFC guy to some people I'm the ink cartridge guy to some people and then I'm that boring guy that's pretty brilliant so I have another question since I don't see any hands I and this is gonna humble you bar which you'll appreciate because my feeling that is also part of your success is especially with the you know like you said the spreading orchids that you kind of humbling yourself to that movie and talking about your failures is about brought to you success and I want to tie that back in to what you said about you know it's moving to the internet and we were just having a conversation earlier about how you know paramount is kind of struggling because Netflix and online movies are going up and up and so for your journey as a filmmaker how how was that struggle of what you expected your life as a filmmaker to be and how instead you ended up on YouTube and maybe that's not what you expected to be as a filmmaker was that a hard process it's good it's a good question so when I made sprouting orchids or was making it the idea in my head was I was gonna make this movie and I was gonna take it to Sundance and I was gonna be like the next Quentin Tarantino this is gonna be like this indie film or the next shane carruth this is gonna be this really low budget film that was so profound that it would launch my career as the next great independent filmmaker and so I made the film and I submitted it to Sundance and they were like yeah this is this isn't good it's not getting in and then I was like okay now what all this YouTube stuff started happening and I thought all right let me put this to bed and kind of finally put the last plot of dirt on the carcass that is sprouting orchids and let me make a little video about it because I've got a few thousand people who are listening to the stories I'm telling online let me tell the story that was my one of my big disappointments in life and as a result the story about the making of the failed movie is way more successful than the actual movie and it's launched this kind of career as an online filmmaker so it's not exactly what I was expecting on the other hand if the original dream had happened I would have been making movies and theaters and I would have only had connections through these nameless faceless critics maybe I got a fairly good deal and was able to make a motion picture for a big-name studio well I would have made it and then people wouldn't have liked it and then they would have written bad reviews and then you know that's the only interaction I would have now I get to make movies online and I don't have some studio that's lording over me I don't have this entry barrier I can literally talk to you one-on-one if you like something in the video you can comment it on it and say hey I really enjoyed this and I see that and it puts a song in my heart and I don't know that I could have gotten that if things had turned out the way I was hoping them to turn out and so sometimes in life the dream you think you want isn't the dream that you end up achieving but the dream that you end up achieving in some ways is is profoundly better than what you had originally hoped would happen or something like that does that make sense all right you have any tips for someone you'd save 10% on your first purchase of a website or domain next question I see these kids in video as you know Mike does a little baby with the hair yeah you got the Fantini but now is that the parents that's actually putting out the video it's going through the parents happened so every now and then you get these viral videos of the parent filming their kid on the cell phone and the kid does something absolutely adorable and everyone in the world loves it and it's great and if that happens then usually what happens is a TV studio or something will call them or contact them and try and license that footage to use on a TV program like America's Funniest Home Videos or something like that and the play paid them a little bit of money sometimes they can just put an ad on YouTube and they can make a little money on the back end by people watching a 10-second ad at the beginning of the cute baby video that's how it's supposed to work but what really happens is that some studio found some baby actor it's obviously a government conspiracy sorry I've been up here a while yes ma'am conspiracies in your answer to their question um you talk about not have essentially not having bosses not having people to answer to but how much do sponsorships shoot your video so my role with sponsors the question was I talk about not having corporate overlords but I seem to have some corporate overlords and some of the stuff I make so the way it works for me and for a lot of youtubers is that if you have a sustained audience sometimes companies will approach you and they will say hey people seem to watch your videos for some odd reason we'll pay you a little bit of money if you give us a 30-second shout-out or a 30-second ad at the end of the video and so what I do this is not what everybody else does or what a lot of people do but what I do personally is if a company approaches me and they say we would like to advertise our product on your channel I say let me try the product and if I like the product and I think other people should try it then we can work out a deal and so if they don't let me try the product I just I don't advertise their product and if I make it known that if I'm gonna advertise for a particular company my audience tells me about issues that they're having with that product I'm gonna go right back to them and I'm gonna tell them about the problems and I'm gonna see if there's some way to get it resolved sometimes I'll advertise for like an online company and somebody will tell me hey look I've had a horrible customer service experience and so I'll go to the guy I know who works at that company and also hey here's what I'm hearing what's going on and if the company you know is willing to have some leeway and work with me then I'll continue to support that company if at any point it just becomes this nameless faceless corporate overlord who doesn't care about their product they just want to push it to as many people as possible I don't put their ads on my videos so to answer your question the other here's the question I think you were really getting at do the companies have creative control over anything I'd and the answer is no if a company says we don't like that you say this particular thing in a video then they don't get to sponsor that video I make what I want and if they are happy to sponsor a different video there was one instance in my entire time of doing this where I had to change something which was that I did a video about YouTube sponsorships as my first sponsored YouTube video and so I was talking about the process of the company Squarespace that I was working with and I was telling my audience hey I'm gonna have some sponsored videos on my channel maybe here's what this process was like so they sent me this contract and they wanted me to sign right here and squares this is like we really don't want you showing you that contract to people it's really really highly confidential and I honestly thought well maybe I shouldn't do this but then after discussion with me with them they explained if you show people what our actual contract is and looks like then nefarious people will pretend to be us and they will have legitimate looking fake paperwork and contracts that they can entice people with and I was like yeah that makes sense so instead of having the contract I had a three year olds rendition of the contract hand drawn onto the paper I hate before for you so I'll tell you one other thing I did it just popped into my head so I was doing this video about mail trucks postal delivery trucks and how they're literally catching on fire and they needed they're trying to update them to a new model and part as part of the deal I contacted USPS delivery place and I said I'm working on this video with mail trucks about the future of the mail truck delivery industry I need some footage of the inside of a mail truck can I come out to your facility and film some b-roll of a mail truck and she was like sure just send us the script and so I sent her the script and she's like okay you can come film here but we really really you can't tell people that our trucks are literally like catching on fire randomly you can't say that if you want to film here and I was like but they are catching on fire and so the answer was I just said hey look no hard feelings never mind I'll just go out and I'll buy some stock footage and acquire the footage myself through some other means and so it's really important that I you know I don't compromise in that way because if you do it once it's easier to do it the next time and you know you don't want to betray your audience's trust that's the one thing that I really really like is that if I advertise a product I want the audience to know I'm actually you know thought about these things and if the product stops being good then I'm gonna stop advertising it and I have that understanding with every company I work with oh I'm sorry yes please guys okay so how many subscribers would you a person have to have for sponsors to come I have no idea it it depends entirely on the company [Music] question maybe thirty three thousand maybe that could be wrong though is there ever so does there a point where yeah I mean you can approach somebody Wazir oh you can approach somebody with any subscriber base you want I'll tell you an interesting story I know a guy who is a huge moped like nut like he's all about mopeds and you know he doesn't have I think he's got like 15,000 subscribers but its 15,000 moped heads and so a moped company was like hey if we send you this free moped would you review it and put it on your channel because they value those 15,000 moped people over some generic youtuber who has a million you know they're looking for a targeted audience in that thing so if you have a channel that's a specific niche you might be able to approach companies that serve that particular niche and find some six things some success there I hope it's not one question the two more questions have you considered taking over okay take taking of youtubes offer apply a Vista the using the facilities I think that if you're all UT spaces yeah yeah exactly if you're we have over 5,000 viewers you're well over that threshold if you frequent projects or your future yeah so YouTube has this thing called YouTube spaces which is they're basically glorified studios they've got them in some hotspots around the United States and around the world and I think there's this entry barrier I think uses 5,000 or 10,000 subscribers if you have a certain amount of subscribers you can sign up and go to that facility and use their resources they've got like big green screens cameras and all kinds of resources that you can use I've looked into it the places near me or places that I've been it's really packed because that's a kind of a low entry barrier so you have to schedule out time in advance and I'm fortunate that I have a background in video production as opposed to a lot of youtubers at my own studio I don't need to go to YouTube space although if there's a particular project that I need something that they have specifically I could you know always stop by there so one of the benefits that I've had is that I have a background video production and filmmaking so I can you know I can create those resources myself as opposed to having to go to a third party you'd be surprised how many 10 million subscriber youtubers there are who have no clue how to edit they hire a team of people they shoot everything on their phone they give them the footage at the end of the day and they cut all the stuff together and all the graphics as well so it's helpful to become a jack-of-all-trades which if you're in plotline don't just be thinking that it just is limited to screenwriting you want to learn all different aspects of how to make these things is the more that you can do yourself you know the easier it's going to be to put things out to an audience didn't we have one more yeah I this was kind of related to the discussion that was happening a couple minutes ago but I watched a lot of YouTube and it seems like there was that whole at pocalypse thing oh we have a years ago it seems like youtubers used to be able to make a living with just YouTube ad revenue for the most part but now there's a lot more sponsorship sponsorships and like patreon and stuff so my question is I haven't heard as much news about that so the ad pocalypse kind of came and went and it'll come back again is this the clicker yeah okay so a little bit of inside baseball so some big-name youtubers made some big-time poor decisions and YouTube ransom big-time company ads next to those poor decisions and those big-name companies were big-time mad you get the idea of that and so as a result they said we're pulling all of our ads from YouTube and that's a pretty big deal because a lot of youtubers need that stuff to support themselves and when you have a set amount of income you think you're going to get every month and then the rug is pulled out from under you it's tough so there's always this push and pull with advertisers and YouTube especially some advertisers set their own guidelines they want only family-friendly content and you don't want to violate that so it's tough as youtubers for a community to make good decisions because sometimes one poor decision not just doesn't just affect them it affects other creators so nowadays there are other forms of ad generation I have I have a patreon as well that doesn't have a whole lot of support but my patreon fans are the closest knit fans that I have people who are willing to I was supposed to put that up things and I worked on that question mark animation all night I have a patron if you go to patreon.com/scishow stan mcconnell you can pay me certain amount every month and you get behind-the-scenes access to some material I'm making you get early videos you get all kinds of perks and that's one of the ways in which I can make some some money to facilitate the online videos that I make but I also have other you know avenues of making money I make it you know I make products and I you know sell them and so it helps to not put all your eggs in one basket and if you're gonna put all your eggs in one basket you need to be aware that somebody could come and take that basket and so be wise in you know everybody who does this is incredibly incredibly lucky and you don't want to squander that and you want to be able to remain humble through it and I'm very thankful for the support that I've been able to have from average everyday people who just like the videos I make I hope that continues and I think you guys all for coming out as well I really appreciate this a whole lot and it's been a pleasure to be here [Applause] a partnership with us and both weak Mostyn here thank you for your time and we wish you continued success and like you said a tree on I just joined up for patreon for supporting Austin so yeah keep on keepin on to keep making movies everybody do it look the more you do the better you get and thanks for coming thanks guys you say so there you go thanks again to plot line to Jim bolt Asst the staff at the Springfield Art Museum and everyone who came out to make it a great event and thank you for watching and by the way you hey you are your first purchase of a website or domain you
