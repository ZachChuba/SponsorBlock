...Don't even think about it! It's perfect! It's way outside our budget! Hey, look. It's my hard-earned money. It's... not your money. It's the people's money. [Dealer] Buying a new tank can be pretty overwhelming. For many leaders, it can be one of the biggest purchases of their tenure. We're just browsing, thanks. Actually, we're having trouble deciding. We're starting an army soon, and we need something that's practical for our troops. Well, we've got plenty of options. Come on! Alright, first things first. What are your highest priorities? Well, we're looking for something that's fast, gots lots of cannons, and shoots big missiles. Oh, and besides that, it needs to fit two troops, and we might be expecting a third Congratulations. Infantry? Airborne? Well, we're hoping for airborne. Now, this here is next year's model Filled to the brim with firepower. Lean, mean, fighting machine. What do you think? Ah, twin machine guns, cannon... Yeah, I don't think we really need one... ...Rocket pods, radar, antenna, doesn't hurt... Oh yeah, definitely not. Look in there. So? Well, where are, where are the troops gonna go? Not in there. You flip them right on the side, right on the... Absolutely not! We're not putting the troops on the back. That's so dangerous. Whatever. Hey, uh, I don't think this one's gonna work, bud. What's wrong? See... one of our troops is Special Forces so he has to wear a helmet, equipment, you name it. Maybe something with a little bit more... head space inside? Have you seen our latest troop carriers? Ah! I gotta admit, it's pretty spacious in there. Yeah, and well within the budget! Um, the general said he wanted guns. Should we be a little concerned there's no guns up there? No no no no, of course not, of course not. Oh, well, then it's perfect! All right. Sir? Sir? [Grandiose music] This is the coolest tank I've ever seen! Does this thing shoot? Does it shoot? Please! When are you ever gonna need a cannon this big? I mean, sometimes! And you're telling me we've got room for all our troops up there? No. The whole point of getting a tank is to get one for the troops. Yeah, well, what if I...what if I didn't want any troops? [Gasp] What did you just say? I mean, I...I...I don't want to spend the rest of my life in the Chair Force! So what? It's just over? Maybe it is over! [Thunk] Look, I... I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to say that. It's just... I've been a troop most of my life Even... and even till this day, I still feel like a troop. You know, only concerned about myself and the tank I drive. You're not a troop anymore... You're a general now. You're right, I'm a general now. And generals have troops. They do. [Dealer] You guys still want the tank or what?
