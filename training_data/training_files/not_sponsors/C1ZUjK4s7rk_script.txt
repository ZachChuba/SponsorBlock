this is which based news for Friday the 19th of June 2020 I'm commander burr in this week's news elites player numbers surge Odyssey details are confirmed in a PC Gamer interview these changes to frontiers community team there's a new elite dangerous podcast from two prominent streamers and much more if you enjoyed our future videos that stuff really helps us smaller channels with the release of fleet carriers and the announcement of the odyssey expansion to the game the number of concurrent players in the game has surged in the last week to surpass a previous post launch high that was set in 2015 with the launch of the horizons expansion it's currently impossible to garner absolute player numbers across all platforms as frontier don't currently release that information publicly however we can gain a broad idea of what the numbers in the game are doing via the websites steam charts calm that monitors and tracks player numbers for games played via the steam platform on PC according to the website the number of concurrent players last peaked on Steam at around the 18,000 mark at the end of 2015 when the horizons expansion launched there's been a few peaks since then but that was the highest they all changed however with the launch of fleet carriers and the announcement of Odyssey this month when that number surged at one point to over 21,000 concurrent players since that day it's consistently hit the 16 to 17 thousand mark to reiterate again this is just concurrent players active in one part of the PC platform at one time it doesn't account for the many players that have purchased the game direct from frontier and it doesn't account for players on playstation or xbox so what we're seeing here is an indication of a trend rather than an abyssal number the data has been further backed up by reports we've received from the fuel rats that the number of rescues they are performing has similarly surged fuel rat and streamer sky the shark told us the fuel rats have been hit hard with the surge in player numbers with at one point sixteen rescues happening simultaneously according to the fuel rats stat tracking website there has been on average around 200 rescues daily in the last week that's a four-fold increase over the daily average for the previous 12 months once the hubbub from carriers settles somewhat it's only natural that the number of players connecting with the game will settle down but you can expect those numbers to surge very significantly again when more details on Odyssey are released and then concurrent player records will almost certainly be broken yet again with the launch of Odyssey next year there was a brief PC Gamer interview last week posted on YouTube with Piers Jackson a game director at frontier working on elite dangerous whilst the interview has no solid new details it does confirm a couple of things that we'd assumed about the upcoming expansion firstly that the expansion will allow players to land on and explore planets with thin atmospheres whilst that seemed a fairly obvious detail from the odyssey trailer it oddly hadn't yet explicitly been stated by frontier secondly the existing airless worlds in the game will be getting a visual makeover from the new tech being deployed with the Odyssey expansion again this is something we'd assumed would probably be the case but it hadn't yet been explicitly stated I've linked to the five-minute interview with peers in the description below longtime community manager at frontier will Flanagan announced this week that he's leaving the community team and moving on within frontier to become a product manager with the company wills dark sense of humor trademark kimono and mug of hot water will undoubtedly be missed within the team and the community in the game thanks for everything will it's been an absolute pleasure on the back of wills departure comes the announcement of the arrival of new lead community manager Arthur told me Arthur is an avid gamer and has been playing elite dangerous since its launch on the xbox Arthur joins the existing trio of Tim Stephen and Bruce welcome to the galaxy and community offer a new collaborative podcast from the
