see psychic the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new and also update video again about risin 3000 boost topic you probably saw already update videos from like gamers Nexus or Hardware and box where they were testing the new Abba so the one 0:03 a bb-8 a new egg is a version from AMD it's not really out yet in the public but there are some beta bios's flying around somewhere behind the doors and we also had the chance to test one of those BIOS versions prior to release and I think in about two or three weeks you should expect to see like final BIOS versions available for download at your mainboard manufacturer website but in today's video we will take a closer look at some of my testing results but before we get to my testing results we will quickly talk about the AMD statement that was released on Wednesday in general if we read through the statement you can see that AMD says you can expect 25 to 50 megahertz increase by the new agiza version considering that some of the CPUs were missing like 100 and 150 megahertz I'm not sure how much this is really going to help overall if I was checking gamers Nexus review about a 3700 X for example it looked promising because that CPU was not so far off but 3900 X I'm not so sure how much it's going to fix overall for all users I can already spoiler that we will do an update survey but maybe like in 4 weeks or maybe in 5 weeks I just want to wait want to give mainboard manufacturers a little bit more time to tune things doesn't really help anyone if we're just rushing things out if they are not really final yet let's give them a little bit more time and see how things evolved in like a month AMD also stated after especially my survey that yeah a single bench performance or single bench boost is kind of expected not to hit the maximum boost which is kind of interesting because originally a.m. he recommended me to use cinnamon or 15 for testing but now he is saying that you need like as a bursty through a single threaded app to PC mark 10 which is a benchmark I never used before I use PC micro 4 and PC Mac or 5 back then in HW bot times but that's a long time ago and back then PC mark was more like data transfers I was testing your HDD SSD and was doing some web browsing so depending what kind of browser you had installed it was just measuring how fast your website was building up and then like Skype conference and all those kind of things so we will also test this today with PC mark 10 and we will take a closer look because this will be really really interesting Amy also said that they don't expect any influence or negative impact on longevity by this update because you know shamino from Isuzu stated in a private or a public comment but as a private person not as an employee on overclocked or net that he thinks that yeah further agiza updates like the Abba version might have a negative impact on longevity of the CPUs but AMD says that is not the case and I'm kind of with AMD there because I think yeah if it's only 25 to 50 megahertz increase by I don't know maybe if they're just increasing weak or slightly I'm not even sure if they did but if they did I don't think it will have a massive impact on longevity so I think that's fine let's start with some simple Cinebench r15 singer threaded numbers I know those charts seem really really confusing and you don't really know what to look at first let's start with the temperature curve which is what you can see in the middle the thick line you can also see the temperature on the right axis and the clock on the left axis and everything is plotted over at the time looking at a temperature curve you can notice that the CPU usually hits about 60 to 65 degrees Celsius during the whole test the last quarter there's a small peak up to like 75 degree Celsius not entirely sure what happened there but didn't really have an influence and impact on the performance to make it a little bit easier for you to know what you're really looking at a zoomed into this chart so you see the left axis changed from four point two to four point seven so that's everything we see and you can see most of the time the zip is boosting up to almost four point five eager Hertz typically 4490 megahertz sometimes we have some spikes going up to 45 15 and that's obviously due to the b clock being at ninety nine point eight megahertz if we're rounding that up we're talking about four point five and 4.25 gigahertz in this case and this is the old agiza this is a BB so you can see zoomed in pretty much hits four point five all the time in the end once the benchmark is over you can see the temperature is dropping then the CPU is in idle and boosts up to four point five five for a split second now this chart is showing a BB a so the new agiza again this is the zoomed in version of the chart you can only see like the high clocks that are really relevant when we were talking about this so the chart is again going from four point two to four point seven and gigahertz what is really interesting is that in the old agiza version we had four cores for individual course that were always going up to like four point five going back down and we had four cores doing that in the newer Geezer version it's only two cores that are boosting and all the other cores are much lower so I think power saving an idle changed so that all the other cores are lower with a BB a then it was before with a BB I think they might be able to save a little bit of power and temperature by dropping the other cores a little bit lower because obviously if the other cores are running at a lower speed could be that they can save a few Watts and maybe yeah they can gain a little Headroom for this but now let's talk about the clocks again we are just hitting about the four point five gigahertz mark we have some more spikes than before at above four point five so four point two five we have a little bit more spikes and what's really interesting if you take two the total left and total right side so before the benchmark is launched you can see the CPU is boosting twice to four point five seven five and once the benchmark is over in idle on a total right you can see the CPU was boosting to four point six five but that only happened after the benchmark and that's something that's extremely interesting so during the benchmark it really by 25 to 50 megahertz that's what MB promised we were still far away from the 4.6 in Cinebench r15 but after the benchmark is over once there is no load anymore it's not relevant for calculation cpu is boosting to four point six five and is it's always the same I repeated this test like ten times every single time I see exactly this behavior before we continue with PC mark 10 a quick look at 3d mark times by you can see a full 3d mike times by ron again with the temperature curve of the cpu added on the top left side or let's just jump straight into the zoom version on the top left side before we really start the benchmark just opening the application you can see boost to four point six two five four point six five then running the red application which is after like sixty seconds you can see the CPU typically boosts like four point three on all cores but then once in a while to four point four or four point five most of the time but times by as a synthetic benchmark has a much higher multi-threading load therefore does not allow the CPU to boost to like the maximum single core boost that would be possible but it's also kind of expected what I find interesting again on the total right side when the temperature is dropping again down low you can see the CPU for some reason again boosts to four point six to five megahertz more real-world performance with shadow of the Tomb Raider it's ten minutes of gameplay again the CPU temperature is added on the bottom it's the dark line and it's ten minutes of gameplay in the first minute is just launching the game going into the menu loading the last checkpoint and then after like sixty seconds when you see there is more load this is the real gameplay where you can see most of the cores are sitting at like four point three once in a while a single core is boosting to four point four four point four five which is also expected and that's mainly because multi-threading load is so much higher in this game then it would allow the CPU to really boost with the singer threaded boost what is again interesting is when we are in the loading time of the in the menu you can see the CPU is boosting on the very first seconds to four point six five if you are wondering what kind of performance increase is expected from the Abba update I would recommend you to just check out the videos from gamers Nexus and Hardware unbox because they already performed the performance testing that's why I will not repeat this we will just take a look at the frequency numbers and how they changed let's finally get to PC mark 10 and the most interesting numbers and results in my testing because I was just following the AMD statement checking what PC mark 10 is really about I performed one run with ABB and run one with a BBA or I performed multiple runs to double check but we're taking a look at two of my runs if you're checking the child of ABV you can see again it's a zoomed in version so boost is most of the time 4475 across most of the course or you can pretty much draw one line there then you can draw a second line at 45 25 megahertz and then you can pretty much draw a third line at 45 50 megahertz and then we have four or five spikes that go to 45 75 but I think we can ignore them because yeah over 18 minutes four seconds I think doesn't really count and could be any like idle scenario when the benchmark is loading or anything like that now taking a closer look at a PPA it's getting really interesting because everything is shifted up by 100 megahertz 100 it shifted from what we've seen as a peak before from 45 52 46 50 megahertz and that was when I first checked it I was like damn that is impressive just a BIOS version update and we get 100 megahertz boost increase in a PC mark 10 so I took a closer look at PC mark 10 and what it is really doing so out of those 18 minutes we're now assuming into four minutes of random testing it doesn't really matter at which period of the benchmark assuming and it all it looks pretty much the same but now again you can see the temperature curve you can see where the load appears and where the load is dropping back down I think that's a very very good indeed cater of how the benchmark works or how the benchmark is performing calculations and whenever the benchmark just finished the calculation so we have this ramping up temperature we have the peak and it's going back down when it's going back down into idle or like low load or no load then the CPU is boosting to 46 50 and I'm not really sure what that means I'm leaving it open for discussion because if you're taking a look at let's say during the benchmark during the calculation when the CPU is getting warmer when the CPU is getting loaded most of the time we were seeing 4300 to 4500 on the best two cores on this chart you're only seeing the best two cores that are boosting up all other cores were lower anyway so I removed them from the chart to make it easier for you to visualize and understand what's going on in this chart but you can see in every situation when the CPU is going from loads to idle the CPU is boosting extremely high but it's not doing a calculation in this time so I'm not really sure how much it means or helps that a CPU is now boosting to 46 50 you can call me a hater or whatever but I'm just a little bit reserved when it comes to seeing 100 megahertz improvement by a BIOS update and yeah I mean most of the time AMD is right 25 to 50 megahertz is completely correct but yeah on my CPU it increased to 46 50 at least the number I'm seeing in hardware info that is reported but going deeper into it the result is that this number is only appearing or occurring while the CPU is not really under load so I'm not sure how much it helps I can confirm 25 to 50 megahertz but the boost I'm seeing or over 4.65 is really really sketchy let me know what you think about those results and we will give the vendors as I said before four or five weeks time to fix things to improve things and then we will do another survey to see how it shifted and yeah let's see how it turns out and let me know what you think about those results see you next time [Music] [Music] you
