Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of buy release we're starting today with a fun fact on June 6 2005 master farmers were put into runescape and players could pickpocket them to get seeds seed what are these seeds for I can't use them for anything what's going on here that's right seeds were put into the game way before farming was jagex teased the boys and eight girls of runescape for an entire month by letting everyone collect these mysterious seeds and everyone was very very confused I don't know if they actually were I was 7 when farming was put into the game everything I've ever told you may or may not be a lie that I made up on July 11th the game was introduced to farming a skill for the chillerz farming is pretty straightforward you rake the weeds fertilize the soil and stare at the plants anywhere from 10 minutes to 15 hours as they slowly grow but if you're intelligent you'll just ask the overseer of each patch what kind of [ __ ] they hoard and they'll watch it for you so you bet your ass I'm gonna be doing that too quests from now is forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf which was the first quest with a farming requirement I barely know how to farm on my main account let alone on a time era restricted Ironman so I'm getting a head start hands down the best way to train this skill is to plant giant ass trees in the ground they give fat exp and as long as you pay the gardener you can do literally anything else for hours while it just grows couldn't help but notice there's a splasher I also couldn't help but notice this is a multi combat zone in this person's an idiot but a lot of people don't realize about me as I have way too much time on my hands not all of its spent productively Exhibit A here we go if you're gonna splash that's fine do your own thing but there are countless places to splash that are not multi combat I consider myself a teacher maybe even a professor ah yes there they go again this one's a stubborn one gotta respect the Ducks of the Park range me Drake you might know me from my music I was also a wheelchair Jimmy under grass he got shot like who who's countin that stuff I'm gonna make it painfully obvious this time for silly overs what's happening I finally been caught red-handed they're just hopping worlds they're not even gonna switch spots well they're 17 that's what I needed four dwarf quest I have so many more trees all right I just finished my first tree run ever 21 from that I'm awesome thought I'd change up the pace so I did some skills over the last couple weeks here's some leaked footage of me crafting here's a slayer level I got and that's that's my progress video thanks for watching today we continue the elf storyline with mornings end part 1 the way less terrifying part of mornings end here's a quick recap of the entire elf story so far the story began long ago very long ago with counselor Hal Dr who assigned us to kill and incinerate this colored sheep that were apparently carrying the plague after we did that this led into the first official chapter plague city we helped this guy Edmund rescue his daughter Elena who was being held captive inside West Ardoyne where the plague was going wild in the meantime we bullied a child into telling us about the treasure underneath backstory and falls we didn't get any treasure though instead we returned lost jewelry to the graves of elven King backstory and his wife clariel then biohazard we helped Elena get plague samples from inside the city only to reveal that the plague was fake we confronted King Laius and told him about it but he already knew it was a scheme to stop his brother king tyrant who ruled west are joined since he was corrupted by the Dark Lord whoever the hell that is after that we became a man by doing underground pass navigating through the depths of Hell to find a pathway for an army so King Laius could get his boys over to elf land we fell 50 times made my favorite song a date and killed the demigod Ivan rather than send an army of trained soldiers and doing the logical thing the King sent us to kill his brother we went into the big forest and met Elf leader Lord Isleworth and he taught us how to launch barrels of explosives into camps on our way back we ran into Ariane win' who was a rebel elf he revealed to us that King Tyrus was not evil at all we just murdered a very good guy King Laius was actually the guy in cahoots with the Dark Lord he wanted to take back Camelot I didn't know he ever owned it but he wanted it back apparently finally we met up with it sold win and Illumina these names are so stupid for roving elves we planted a crystal tree for them and in return got a crystal bow that I still can't use and now ladies and gentlemen we are here out the gates of errand are apparently that's what this place is called which is a lot easier than hating our lives going through the underground pass this is great so Julie shortcut can I use this 85 you need 85 to go up there what kind of rocks are these why is that so difficult oh what a Jody level you train in 285 why to go up a 60-degree Hill that toddler could climb hey Luna do you look more like a Trixie to me I think I think that's your name would I like to start mornings in part one ah you know what I really like we're gonna do something else okay she's thick as to let eeeh I don't want to brag or anything but I just got a teleport crystal I can come back right here in front of them anytime I want Oh Luna just logged out all right well I'll teleport in front of this guy anytime I want wait a second is this lore that is this a freeze-frame it sure is this guy was just letting us know that lord Isleworth and King Laius are definitely working together he doesn't know why King light.this is doing it I don't [ __ ] know either so you know me I like to dress up as people I'm not and go undercover so that's exactly what I'm gonna do I think it's so cool that the runescape Elf storyline inspired the entire Game of Thrones series look at those guys look familiar to you yeah they sure do I have to disguise myself as a mourner and there's one now I'm gonna Jack his stuff hey man she's leaving do I have to like catch him oh [ __ ] oh just keep coming this way hey come here I want to talk to you for a second oh gosh it's through a pokeball at me all my stats are at 20 now this is good I like a challenge you know what lower room 210 you can shout at me all you want but I'm taking your pants so the top is bloody and the pants are ripped I I don't understand why I need to get them fixed could I not just be a battle-hardened mourner or is that not what we're all about yeah death guard the blood and rips make for better RP I don't want to fix anything why do I have to do this I'm gonna try something here is a game theory I'm gonna keep the plague jacket and pants and see if they're the exact same player model because if they are I'm gonna be pissed cuz I I just found a loophole uh-oh is it is that laundry guy hey man how'd he remove blood stage portal or remove blood stones show me horrible birth no blood stones so he's not letting me have his special soap and I mean his whole life is devoted to laundry clearly oh yeah you steal the soap you're an [ __ ] jayson's can no longer do the only thing he's meant to do the plague jackets a lot more practical that's got the gloves built into it the mortar thing just the top shot I can tell a plague jacket from a martyr jacket from a mile away wherever I'm going back to elf town get my pants fixed hi ma'am I broke my pants can you do anything about that you see that oh you didn't see that oh that's crazy because they're the same [ __ ] thing she's hot me she shot me Destin go crazy my house alright the HQ is up here it's very important that I stay in character I am a new recruit trying to prove himself to the bad guy elf leader I take it you're one of the new recruits I'm very excited as you may know part of what we do here is keep the people believing in the plague why I feel like that was the one thing I shouldn't have said to this guy if the plague is fake wouldn't it be better security to have everyone down here take their masks off there'd be no worry about anyone being undercover if everyone was just chilling down here with no masks on what does that make a little too much sense I'm pretty sure I spoiled this back when we did sheepherder but yeah he just revealed that he died the Sheep different colors to make them look like they're plague basically he just confirmed we killed innocent sheep and now we have to go do that we have to go read I the Sheep with this device he just gave me it's broken and this no okay I tickled this gnome and gave him cookies so he fixed my rocket launcher I forgot to mention it doesn't launch rockets it launches obese frogs that explode I just realized that since I'm the one dying these sheep I'm responsible for the next guy who mindlessly does sheep herder and incinerates these things master Fisher don't tell anyone what you saw here all right I'm just always doing [ __ ] I'm not supposed to for a little too long going a little too far wants to know if I know a trustworthy biologist oh they're very trustworthy the biologists I know are nothing but the most trustworthy in fact so you know yeah I here I go don't watch me leave take this rotten apple here I guess I should explain things I'm gonna make this whole town appear plagued by poisoning food supplies with toxins from rotten apples and elena my trustworthy biologist is gonna assist me with that it's rebar loose see my movie Elena's so terrified she knows it's me but I'm holding a bazooka she's like I'm not poisoning people that's messed up okay I've got to make another barrel of naphtha but first I need to get a [ __ ] ton of rotten apples excuse this old stomping technique you all owe me five bucks if I get this on the first try work it over all of you all of you owe me five bucks and then we use the sieve on it god I'm such a scientist I think I'm one step away from making meth we're gonna use that on range nothing could go wrong oh yeah baby baby okay let's get out here the door was just open to their food supply there's no security whatsoever yeah I'm just gonna poison this right in the church I'd sure hope God's busy doing something else right now hey that guy's done eating by now get him back up there this dudes talking about sarin the Dark Lord goddess thing and about the Great Temple beneath the city if you don't know what temple he's referring to don't know very soon when I'm crying myself to sleep because of part two yeah I should probably report this to Aeryn wind why am I saying this to him what was that I said I said you're really [ __ ] hot I'm going back to elf land smells good here yeah see look the elf Warriors are 108 the mourners in the basement weren't 108 there's some sketchy [ __ ] going on this rosetta rosetta you want a stone como esta baby Aryan wind I need a couple days off I've done a lot of bad things I need to chill out good god that is fat XP I like that until next time auf bye and remember don't trust anyone not even yourself I'll bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose what I look like an idiot we're about to embark on our 85th quest that seems psychotic I cannot believe I still have all of you fooled that this is a good series you stupid idiots forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf our final quell de grim story commander Vale the band wants to see me I don't blame him I'm a legend around here nowadays have you heard you mean half the world has suddenly become a farmer 2005 jokes that no one except for me would pick up on cool he's telling me that the red X a company far less superior to a purple pooter that's how it's pronounced by the way all of them including the old boomer dwarf left the city there's a drunk dwarf that knows some sketchy things about them so we're gonna pay him a visit these intro cutscenes are terrible I don't even understand how this got to prove like yeah that's good enough just when they start at play that yet you know what I'm gonna show you how they could have done this take notes Jagex the perfect cinematic for a quest about making beer all right here's the drunk dwarf I think drunk might be an understatement this guy has blacked out he has no idea what's going on I like his hats like The Fresh Prince of bel-air you're a cool guy so now he's screaming like he's a homeless guy outside of a gas station I'm getting out of here he requested a beer I brought a beer but he doesn't want this one so I have to go down to the bar and get the one he actually wants oh yeah yeah I can see the difference he wants the really good stuff killed us doubt if I want information from this guy I have to brew him a beer that he's craving right now how valuable is this information because that sounds like a tedious process he gave me one seat and said I need four I guess I have to go find three other people that have these seeds conveniently laying around their house suspect one rowdy dwarf right outside the bar it looks like he's working for the bar he's got a sign that says pub but it's pointing to the beer that somehow not spilling out right now that's amazing he wants a heap of ashes let me get that from the bank I like how my guy knew I had that in the bank already that's cool here you are sir two more to go and then I guess we could start the quest I guess this jolly ole guy has one too he wants me to have a toast with him drinking's bad for you I say well it's a bold statement in the city Cheers huzzah I like that guy the last dude who has a seed is under white wolf Mountain so time to take a ride hold on tight didn't someone shoot you out of a cannon Oh God apparently me shooting out of a cannon was the greatest thing to ever happen in dwarf history yeah he has a seed he's just being an [ __ ] about it but if I offer you a drink are you offering I just thought I'd save myself the trouble of waiting for you to ask me this time they still acknowledge it they still make it a part of every plot here's a dwarven stout take it you alcoholic all of you my guy's losing his [ __ ] we got four seeds now it's time to put our farming training to use it's gonna take like 15 to 20 minutes to grow I guess this gardener has like a side task we can do in the meantime I'm not not doing anything else so he gave us a letter to deliver to that one dude who's near the farm outside falador can I read his letter would have had some juicy crazy stuff no it's just some boring [ __ ] he definitely did that on purpose they knew everyone would look in this letter they could have had so much fun with it just some random optional sides to easter-egg where you deliver a disgusting sext from one farmer to another the most beautiful love story in all of runescape but no no it's cool this quest is exciting enough else things like man that's it it's are you sure there's nothing on the back you that's all Hey look at that they're done growing we've got the hops had delivered your letter he was very disappointed Oh more seeds thank you so much and love farming yeah a little bump in the road it's come to my attention that I need barley malt to brew this beer and the only way to get it is to grow it myself which is an additional 40 minutes of waiting I love this okay 40 minutes how do I spend my time wisely with 40 minutes wait a second I've got the perfect idea Gabe's room that's right I got a challenge your ass is going pretty well for me my first time playing checkers in years prizes there's a little child let's see it let's see the big guy moves it's not impossible except one yeah [ __ ] you you always gotta be 70 steps ahead of your opponent I'm leaving on top I'm [ __ ] oh yeah and look at that I've played this game for 14 years this is the first time I've ever done anything with barley apparently I need to go put this over a range and cook it so I'll go do that and then go to Celtic room oh I thought I was ready to brew this thing I need an empty pot though I guess I'll go to the bank and get a pot I release episode 23 the hunt for pot so having to mix it all in and get this over with a little bit of this a little bit of that you know I'm saying drop that in there see if that does anything oh my god did you [ __ ] it up no look it's on the table right there yeah no I see that I have to wait with this guy for another 20 minutes he's either a train conductor or a rapper from the late 80s he did ad-libs for The Beastie Boys before that he was just a backup dancer for Spice Girls you know that song intergalactic by them it's like a mural acting my mom and me he was that guy he was the guy doing the robot intergalactic oh my god it's John Adams John Adams the beer is done oh yeah what if I accidentally drank it what I have to restart the whole quest just got actually scared for a second all right you [ __ ] just doing this weird cutscene thing where it fades to black he's telling me a story that makes zero sense right now he's clearly lost his mind he was mentioning this blocked-off area of the minecarts whoa hey I'm good at moonwalking look at me go we're gonna see how to get that back open we can go and investigate this dude doesn't have the authority to open that part of the minds up but I know the guy who does yeah it's open now let's get after it doesn't look very open to me am I gonna crash uh hello well we found a crazy cavern looking thing essentially this whole place is just a back-and-forth puzzle I get these green and yellow blocks I map out the left and right turns to get two different chests around the rooms and eventually I'll have enough blocks to get me to the exit here we go first exit whoa what wait what is like I do it well I do what does this pose blah blah blah well they're just too lazy to put the text above their heads they discussed a very vague evil plan that they plan to go through with it would appear that I have to continue through the puzzle to continue learning about this evil plan of theirs the question shut the [ __ ] up no duck oh look another puzzle be right back let's see what's going on nothing like a blocked-off storage room that tell me every detail of who's undercover and working with who mr. e conveniently solved the old guy that stormed out of the room last quest is planning an invasion of the world he's a real bad guy I never would have guessed something crazy like that oh boy you should have brought some runes start raising hell in here take all these guys out one by one problem solved they had some test subjects they're making an army this gnome guy wants to approve of them first why's it always the dwarves the gnomes the little guys always causing a ruckus uh-oh chaos dwarves look at those guys there's their army I didn't know they were test subjects I thought they were just [ __ ] behold the power of zamorak level 48 bow down the ogre found me okay why would they bring me back here so that drunken dwarf from earlier his memory was wiped and scrambled and that's exactly what just happened to us but good thing I'm always recording I can show all this footage to Commander Valda ban the spell not only screws our memory but makes us crave beer and kebabs all the time yeah I'm talking to the commander I can't remember anything I'm just saying how much I want to drink okay I bought a beer and a kebab from the bar and now the cutscene ensues the scene here is great it's me telling a wacky story to everyone in the you might notice the drunken dwarf random event guy is right in front of me having a good time which is what makes this sad with the game originally being backed up from 2007 this is the final chapter of the red axe story since it wasn't continued in the old school universe I won't spoil anything but there's three more quests that were put in a runescape three that continue this and if you look into the lore you'll see how awesome it'd be if old school put their own twist on this cliffhanger I bet you by release would love that sort of thing but until then it's been real cal de Grimm again thanks to Squarespace for being today's sponsor if there's one thing I've learned no one including your own family will
