[Music] today's video sponsored by Warner Brothers ah did everyone and welcome to today's video I'm here with little miss pink so as you guys know obviously we have the puppies and it's been tough to know what puppy we're going to keep so inspired by the movie of dr. sleep I'm going to bring a psychic to my house to kind of face some of my childhood fears of living in a haunted house but also at the same time figuring out which puppy I'm going to keep at the end of but you guys on tickets link is down below and do you dare to go back for me like I mentioned my biggest fear is living in a haunted house so I want to make sure that this place is not haunted and I also want to know a little bit about my future what's to come so I feel like bringing a psychic here will help determine a lot of that so I actually did find a psychic who's been in my friend Colleen's videos before and I was like oh my god she'd be so perfect for this so she's on her way over right now and we're gonna get to the bottom of this do we have evil spirits in here are you the one I'm gonna keep I don't know let's find out okay so I think Araya so she's gonna be here at any moment I'm so excited [Applause] Joey I'm hearing something nice thanks for coming sure so welcome spiritual work and kind of seeing the space and I don't have a reading of leisure but I guess let's just do initial yeah haunted this area okay so there's a few reasons why I wanted you to come here sure one of the main ones is the fact that one of our dogs had puppies oh and I am struggling with which puppy to keep so okay at some point the video I'd love for you to gather their energies and kind of see which one maybe it's the best better now let's go take a peek yeah let's go take a peek okay so now that we've had a little taste of the puppies um I say we go back and play because I want to know more about you and your process okay I'm kind of your back story so we'll be back you guys we'll be right back okay we're gonna go guys promise we're gonna get the realty right now let's go man I'm in love okay so I'm very excited I've seen some psychics in the past but I've never had a second come to my house oh okay so you're that person why on earth so I've seen don't call it yeah and absolutely love those yeah just want to get a few things answers so at some point in this video I have a buck to get your oh this house okay but I want to get to know a little bit more about your history with being a psychic and where it all started so let's let's start with where it all began like how did you know that you had these powers and by the way yeah in the shining and the doctor suit they call it the shine okay is that what you call it ah you mean just like these the ability to no I just call it intuition okay yeah cool yeah so when you realize that you have this intuition so I've had it my whole life absolutely my mom and my sisters and my mother's mother and so I was also raised very open to it so when you're raised open sweet young - hi we sing you know just kind of do the thing yeah and then does that mean like your ability is able to I guess grow more because yes you don't have to hide yourself or repeat yourself small so yes and there are there were all these things happening I remember my first so sleeping in medicine I felt like the covers being on top of me and I mean this is like I'm a kid right so it's scary and so I sat up in the bed like well I think it was just one of those moments where I just had rabbit assault with a veil like this any world between worlds it's actually only about six inches between here in the afterlife what does that mean so that means wetness it gets complicated but when the soul detaches from the body it's only about six inches where it's into the afterlife so currently you're in the 3d physical right now and your soul is in your earth suit so you are technically right now in the 3d physical world of seeing touching and hearing that was that seat engineer so when the soul disconnects from the body when it loses power in other words when it's time for you to leave your earth suit yeah it's really only about six inches to the other side to the other realm the after legs the ethers whatever you want to call it we can't necessarily see it because we're in the 3d physical world but it's really only like this far 26 inches I'm terrible at math like this six inches maybe this far from us which is why our loved ones will come and interact with us this is support of it okay never I've seen like a lot of like shows and whatnot about this but I've never heard it explained in this way so this is really fascinating no okay so what really engaged me into this whole idea is I saw the movie dr. sleep I'm so obsessed with it it's the continuation of the shining and he has the ability it's called the shopping which you call a change wishes okay so with like these ability he's like does it ever be like a burden to you the answer is yes until you learn regulate management control in the question that I've always been curious about his sidekicks meaning other psychics like just anything happen like yeah usually it shows up in like electrical appliances doing wonky you know you're dealing with a lot of energy okay I get right into it you want to read me first or the hell it's like do you want any room nobody do that Mouse first if I get information okay so the other thing I feel and see here's the thing so here's the thing the beautiful thing about the scared world is that they can go everywhere anywhere at any time so they don't have to stick to one particular location because for some reason in this area and it's probably just because there's so many corners carry and capture a lot of energy not bad but I feel like this particular area there's so many corners that I'm just able to like kind of information from here and so I also do feel and I don't know if you guys know this is there were animals that were buried on the property so I'm seeing like kids I'm seeing two in particular a durian a girl it's more like a feel that's when I say see in or whatever sentence or feel information I don't feel like a lot of dark dire bad stuff just sadness butter okay we'll just in general but I like my channel just like this area because to me this I love children's energies so for me personally I just really love this but I do feel I don't know if you know this that like the surgeon and though and his wife maybe have had some marital issues I don't know if you know it or not and I feel like there may have been some arguing you guys are you'll have to wait and see so when you ask me what my process is it's mostly clear sentient that shows up in my mind's eye or in my mind's ear I'm hearing arguments and I actually just felt like he might have hit her ears so but again this is not this is and I don't want you to feel it's more like residual energy which is just like think of a scene that plays out in a movie or I don't feel any danger in this house I feel a lot of love in this house actually that's from us sure for sure for sure for sure yeah it just feels good also really like the backyard like backyard feels really fun you guys have a lot of fun out there yeah yeah there's a lot of laughter that goes on out there you understand yeah no this is okay so there was something weird that happened yesterday so I was leaving this door anyways we're heading outside to check out my feet though I swear I could have sworn I saw someone in the background on my video I'm seeing things okay that was really scary I genuinely thought someone's behind me oh yeah I don't know what maybe that's normal well I don't I don't want to discount what you might see especially really quick yeah again everybody has an intuition and insight and especially when you're not in your analytical mind people can see people or think people around or even hear like their name being called that is very common it's not about my mom does she's a gypsy so it's not uncommon okay it is not and I do feel like you are sensitive to energy yeah so you know that doesn't surprise me but it shouldn't scare you so house check there's no evil spirits here you're good okay just a few kids running around should we check and see I'm an evil spirit yeah okay so do should we do my everyday yeah does that mean like what is what's the process of reading me so I'm typically a psychic reading is for guidance so I can just tell you a little bit about your past present future what's going on potentials and possibilities of what you might encounter okay again you are always making your own choices and decisions so life is like a choose your own adventure books so nothing I say he's ever since don't but if you don't questions or anything I can tell the answer mine okay so I don't do anything traditional I go rogue oh okay so I use a regular deck of playing cards that you might see in Vegas and I also use litter Riya cards which is like Mexican bingo okay and then I do have a traditional rider-waite deck that people use but I don't read in the traditional like layout okay because I'm just using these as tools but I'm really just reading your energy okay so first thing I'm gonna have you do is I'm gonna have you shuffle each deck so that you're putting your energy into each deck I cleared them before I always say as long as you keep them on the table you're good feeling looks like reoccurring selfish uses and I guess I'm just trying to figure out what direction I need to go to not okay so first of all just you know I'm not a medical doctor so I'll give you the information that I get but ultimately you do what you need to do do you understand I'm starting to feel like a tightening in my stomach you understand that so I mean I'm doing a scan on you right now what's showing up to me is not anything dire like like there's anything like that it feels to me like stress okay she also understands like back pain - that's me was that you so I'm like I'm feeling because I'm feeling back they may be you're getting your reading right now uh-huh the back pain I also feel like having the need to always be in control that's him that's definitely not you so talking at both of you just so you know that which doesn't surprise me y'all know together rather in relationship together I don't know if you're on medication but I feel like you don't need to be on medication okay so if you were questioning whether you should go to medication and don't feel like you need to go on medication what I do feel like is to be more physically active okay okay I feel like you need to get into more cardio okay because the body is smarter than we are sure and it holds a lot of trauma it holds past experiences from even past lives and stuff like that and I feel like it lives in your body okay and so for you it comes up it's like stress and even anxiety I understand that so there's a lot of worrying about the future yeah so your time traveling to the future but that means to be like ah and the reason why you're having that anxiety is because you feel like you need ferb you don't actually have the tools that you would need to take care of something in the future so you have to learn to be more present because you there's no way you could take care of what you're worried about right yeah okay you don't have the tools yet one of the main questions to why we want to keep one of the puppies is the ones that we have I'm sure like yeah I were just like how they're gonna take it cuz we have one in particular the first dog needs wolf and she he's obviously gone through getting to two puppies out into the family he's like are everything yeah this is our number one boy yeah always so and he's is he here no no okay they're all at daycare yeah okay give it to a piss yeah yeah okay so this is it's not we haven't had that for - no we've had that one for a long time halfway yeah he likes the bottle inside of it okay well him and storm they all kind of share the toys or sharing family does he and it's me it kind of feels like can you let me know if I'm right or wrong I'm not a pet communicator exercise I'm gonna make sure I'm connecting yeah um and do you understand he likes it well I mean granted the weather right now is a little bit warmer sound but do you understand that he likes to go under covers well he likes tomorrow okay that's time yeah that's storm storm likes to be under the bed dark places is this also stores they all share the toys yeah which is I mean he's doesn't he's not a 100% tie-off but he likes the bed ball okay that's okay he's a lot of white oh my god like that storm because that's his name storm damage a storm and thunder oh my god that's so weird okay so I'm picking up on storm okay so let's just go see what else we ain't saying so storm even though storm feels to me like a little bit more judgmental weight to me she's kind it's coming up okay yeah everyone says when they see him it's a woman so pretty and we say that she's a pretty girl so I feel like we should maybe bring the three puppies inside I'm doing okay so I've got an inkling of who I think will be best but again ultimately you've got a you guys but I'm taking in consideration that energy the house do you consideration you guys an empty game separation really it's more storm for me it feels like to me that someone yeah we made something all Oh their color oh that's why Pete okay so this is red oh but you know that's how I'm making the assessment but really ultimately it doesn't matter what I think it has to be what and you're very sensitive yeah so it has to feel right to you so if that doesn't feel right to you and do not take my kill what was it like his Bible he feels cozy he feels comfortable and secure - that's the other thing and he feels to me like I got this she's also very independent I was able to see that when she went there so I do feel like she would complement him I do really like this one I think this one might be a little too dorky for you guys I don't know why I'm saying that but that's just what it's coming out to be um the thing I do feel like though with all of the dogs is like you might want to see them more like dogs and people we and I say we could I'm so like this - so I am just as guilty because I'm such an animal lover but I do feel like sometimes we might forget that they actually are animals and we treat them like human and we get upset at our you know it's almost like we blame ourselves really it was like no they're just animals so there's just a little mindset shift well mr. Teel but it's like it said herself she thinks you're the one well actually since he was a baby like since he was like tiny tiny tiny yeah and also it makes kind of sense because he'll is your favorite color Oh righty so your decision has been made you feel strongly about teal which I agree with so we'll make that final decision very soon you guys don't you worry but I think we know where we're going to work I'm working online oh I do readings all over the world actually cool online and on the phone so where can my viewers like you sure sure so - Booker reading it would be at Terry humor men calm and I also do coaching also I do a two ative coaching where I help people get into their intuition so they get out of this indecision and they get moving forward in life all right well I will link her website down below go check her out go up and get a reading with her mission accomplished we dare to go back and we pretty much found out that the Holy Spirit's here are little children running around we have a man who I guess beats his wife maybe we don't know no but a huge thank you also you will still love this movie so go check it out and also a dare to go back to something that scared you when you were younger and go face those fears so that's it for today I love you guys until next time I'll see you next time good down [Music]
