since gigabyte launched their gamer focused a or a sub-brand back in 2014 the company has expanded the product line from laptops and peripherals to motherboards and video cards and now finally to what is apparently the world's first tactical monitor whatever that means the product page is actually ADA fascinating specimen the bezels are portrayed as unrealistically thin there's a couple of I think somewhat misleading statements and then there's this what is active noise-cancelling in a monitor are you kidding me well as it turns out they're not and we're gonna find out exactly what that Android device use offer code linus to get 25% off glass wire at the link below [Music] i'ma be upfront with you the active noise-cancelling feature is the reason that this monitor made it to our studio it just it just raised so many questions for you when it hit my inbox so we're gonna start with what's up with that the monitor has three microphones on the front that actually listen to the ambient noise in your room so then my first thought was maybe it would use them to try to add ENC to whatever headphones you happen to be wearing if they were plugged into the audio pass through port but no it's actually kind of the opposite the anc isn't there to help you hear content better it's meant to help others hear you better so what you do is you plug your microphone into the monitors three-and-a-half millimeter jack no dice if you use a USB mic by the way oops and then you use a horse's sidekick software to specify what kind of mic setup you have and how much noise canceling you want to apply so then does it work actually yes the monitor was able to cut out our offices HVAC noise and it actually sounds pretty good with my HyperX cloud twos but other mics I tried had a significant trade-off to voice quality regardless of whether we set it to very low or very high so whether you'll end up using this feature probably depends on your mic and your room but I'm guessing a lot of people especially the ones that watched our budget Mike round up a little while back are gonna end up leaving it off that doesn't mean this review is over though because as it turns out the noise cancelling is only one of several gamer focused features that are actually pretty cool mostly like the sidekick software itself which provided you have the monitor connected via USB gives you access to all the options that you'd normally find in the on-screen display except way less cumbersome so yes the monitor still has the joystick nipple which still is a lot easier than discrete buttons on the back with no labels but if you're watching this channel I probably don't have to explain to you guys why a keyboard is just plain better than anything else and there's also added functionality like being able to bind just about any setting to a hotkey it's super cool and something that I hope gains mainstream adoption even if there is a slight input delay this is also where you find the rest of the gaming features like another one that's done right the on-screen reticle now you might think that using one of these counts as cheating and you'd be correct but hey at least if it's built into your monitor you can get away with it and what sets the 8027 QD apart is that unlike other monitors with this feature the stock crosshairs are visible without being distracting or blocking your view plus if you're not happy with it you can actually draw your own completely custom one and go ahead and put that on there so it could even just be a tiny little dot if that's what you're into next we've got a couple of more maybe features so there's screen overlays for vital stats that you can customize the displays refresh rate and timers and counters that you can bind to hotkeys and then use for things like tracking an opponent's attack cooldown in a MOBA or reminding you to Scout in an RTS or counting your headshots and an FPS or I mean a million other ad hoc things a gamer could do but that I suspect few would do maybe I'm wrong hit me up in the comments and then there's the aim stabilizer which appears to be yours his name for motion blur reduction now the marketing claims that it removes in game motion blur like from weapon recoil to help you see better but in practice it appears to be simply the same backlight strobing that's been present on gaming monitors for years now and like those features it effectively reduces smearing but it also reduces maximum brightness introduces some strobing crosstalk and it can't be on at the same time as free sync then finally there's some features that are just bad like super resolution which is just gross sharpening and black equalizer which claims to increase visibility in dark areas without over exposing the bright areas but appears to be the usual crank the gamma approach to this function one that we wouldn't recommend let's get back to free sync though because all these tactical gaming features aside this is actually just straight up a solid monitor in its own right it's 2560 by 1440 144 Hertz and it's got a free sync range of 48 to a hundred and forty-four Hertz with low framerate compensation which you can actually see it work right here so the frame rate is below the free sync range which means that our low framerate compensation inserts duplicate frames and the panel refreshes at double the FPS this does improve the perceived smoothness oh and by the way yes that is the Nvidia pendulum test thank you for asking because even though this monitor is not at the time of writing on invidious new white list of free sync monitors that are g-sync certified a quick update of our Nvidia 10 series graphics card drivers to version 4 17.1 7 does allow us to turn it on and it appears to be working pretty well another pleasant surprise is actually the color accuracy now this monitor isn't designed for professionals that do color critical work it's still an 8 bit panel plus frc nor is it a top-of-the-line HDR monitor with full array local dimming but it does have vasa display HDR 400 certification so it is technically an HDR monitor even if the peak brightness is just 400 nits and perhaps more importantly it has excellent coverage of the DCI p3 color space with Wow like really Wow color accuracy that's just about as close as the human eye can discern so that is a total bonus for something that's being billed as a gaming monitor as for the industrial design it's got a sharp kind of aggressive look with a matte black anodized finish The Stand assembles with just one screw and is very robust articulating on all four axes and we even saved the best for last it's got RGB panels on the back that you can configure individually I mean so what if the user can't see them in most people put their monitor against a wall they're gonna know they're there in conclusion then for $600 Horace's first foray into monitors delivers performance commensurate with other offerings in this price range and with a handful of extras for gamers that push me into yes territory we recommend this monitor even if the product page did lie about the thinness of the bezels though we are not endorsing that behavior it's gross we've dollarshaveclub.com - we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome
