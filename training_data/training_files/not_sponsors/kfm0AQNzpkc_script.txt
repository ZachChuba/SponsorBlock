hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian like most of you guys know i love a david and goliath story which is why we're covering the polish soviet war m22 locus tank more about world of tanks at the end of this video in the aftermath of the first world war new countries emerged as quickly as old ones fell apart the russian german and austro-hungarian empires collapsed all at once the russian civil war which had started in 1917 was in full swing by 1919 and the communist red army in russia had largely rounded the anti-bolshevik white army fearing the revolution would continue spilling into neighboring states poland sent forces to the russo-polish border though no one really knows how exactly the polish soviet war started most believe it was a gradual escalation eventually leading to a large-scale polish offensive after several skirmishes with communist partisans by the end of 1919 the poles had pushed as far as vilnius and minsk in the north and had taken a large suave of western ukraine all with very little resistance as the russians were simply not prepared to defend themselves against a polish incursion in the midst of civil war the polls under leadership of yusuf politsky quickly formed an alliance with what was left of ukraine and launched yet another offensive in april of 1920. they again encountered very little resistance and even took the ukrainian capital of kiev in early may but then they stopped polish forces had no capacity to move further the polish and ukrainian forces had to walk hundreds of miles with almost no vehicles and barely enough horses to carry supplies the new occupiers of kiev were exhausted barely equipped and hundreds of miles away from reinforcements the poles in the northeastern end of the border were not much better off they too had stretch supply lines with only 120 000 men and 460 artillery pieces spread along an open and indefensible frontier they were extremely vulnerable by now moscow had had enough after months of a slow buildup the red army had about 300 000 men with an ample supply of artillery that were ready for deployment red army commander and eventual ice pick repository leon trotsky ordered a two-prong attack he sent joseph stalin to the south to retake kiev and then move further west into ukrainian territory meanwhile tukuchevsky was to attack from the north and retake belarus total numbers are hard to come by but soviet forces in these two attacks numbered around three hundred thousand and were split evenly between stalin and tukachevsky tukichewski's army of 160 000 men pushed west in early july 1920. he brought along more than 700 artillery pieces and almost 3 000 machine guns far outgunning any polish defenders meanwhile in the south most of the fighting was done by the first cavalry army comprised exclusively of men crazy enough to still fight on horseback even after world war one they swung around kiev and captured the city of brody far behind the polish in the first week of august they then planned to move quickly to levive stalin's infantry was slower but they made great advances as well but how did the russians turn the tide so quickly well the initial russian attack was successful due to a combination of three major factors first was superior numbers second was the fact that the polish were at the end of their supply lines and third was the disorganized state of the polish army having received most of its equipment from other countries while the russians weren't extremely well organized either they were at least able to supply most of their troops sufficiently at least for now while the original russian plan was to just take back the ukraine and territory that poland had occupied tukichewski pushed on the energetic and opportunistic general believed that the proletariat would rise up wherever russian troops arrived he planned to destroy the polish army in the north take warsaw and then spread the communist revolution into germany the political leaders of moscow were a little more cautious fearing retaliation from non-communist european powers on the other hand they were also afraid of confronting tukachevsky lest he turn on them chugachewski was relentless and kept up a murderous speed never allowing the polish army to rest regroup or organize a defense but poor logistical consideration took a toll on tukachevsky's force large numbers of casualties were sustained and many soldiers who couldn't keep up with the advance were simply left behind the soldiers who did keep up had to defend a long and outstretched perimeter while still pushing west by the time the attack commenced on warsaw tukachevsky only had 50 000 men ready for the assault of his original 160 thousand what's worse stalin after receiving contradictory orders refused to send the first cavalry army to warsaw keeping them stationed in leve more troops were siphoned off when tukuchevsky was ordered to send reinforcements to crimea as stalin was hung up in levive and the entire fourth army was cut out of the picture as they were fully committed to the westward push in northern poland after their communication line was broken with headquarters this left the area around warsaw extremely vulnerable and huge gaps in the line appeared meanwhile yusuf polutsky had managed to gather all available troops in warsaw for a last-ditch defense fighting was fierce and the polish forces stationed across the vestula river were gradually pushed back but polutsky noticed a major gap in soviet lines just south of the city that allowed him to break through and flank the 16th army isolating the 15th army it was a resounding success after 10 days of fighting polish forces had inflicted around 60 thousand casualties and captured approximately 60 thousand more by contrast poland only suffered around 30 000 casualties by the time of tukichewski's retreat he had at most seven divisions left that could fight but no worries the first cavalry army was finally on the move to help tukochewski take warsaw yeah they were a little out of the loop by late august the cavalry was completely surrounded and realized they were invading poland all by themselves what followed was yet another russian defeat at the battle of kamarov europe's last major cavalry battle just a month later in late september politsky launched a new offensive relentlessly driving the russians back ultimately bringing the soviets to the negotiating table the piece of riga was signed on march 18th of the following year granting poland parts of lithuania belarus and ukraine poland would hold on to this territory until 1939 when they were defeated by germany and the soviet union that invasion is more well known for a number of reasons but we shouldn't let it eclipse the importance of the events we've talked about today in the early days of communist rule in the ussr it was genuinely unclear how far the new movement might spread especially in europe's chaotic interwar political climate if the polish had not stopped the soviet's western advances the course of european history in the 20th century might have been vastly different if you use my link in the description
