Oh oh my god dude you got the pen oh Jesus like to Casey in tonight wow that's insane damn bro grats on the frickin tent that's the third pet I've seen oh my god dude we saw the tool see another one oh man damn bro number seven dude holy [ __ ] oh my god targaryen brother to H Pina are you joking and you died oh and your pet dude see you later man you just lost the mill okay I just hit 1,300 Casey damn trying to go for like you know 5050 Casey a day right now damn bro yeah it's so good bro oh what's going on eggs are you kidding Wow my second onyx Oh Michael you got the pit bruh wow that's just I just saw my fourth pad Oh baby a hundred more and we are 2 X ok it's already been 5 years you know I waited long enough Fitness Oh yo what the what's yo what's that actually happened dude holy [ __ ] boys I'm out I'm sorry boys I'm out well we've been grinding quite a bit of pets you know on the side I've gotten pretty try and some of them $5.00 Wells Devils we just hit like 3000 necro test guardians and yeah all that all that good jazz and we actually got lucky on a pet that I was not expecting to get like you know for a long time I was gonna get the seed and dip as insane dude our first unique pet in quite a while is crazy yes okay I'm sure the pet right so we'll make sure to pet number 18 yo okay I double-checked she's insured so yeah let's have a discussion what I call you Sol Cana well is it because you're like a faux don't say it why don't why not why not why not all right we're gonna have to put away the puppet Dow for a bit you know he's not enough of a wok so so I'm pretty content on just getting one Tulsi just cuz I don't do a whole lot of scaling so now that I also have to pet yeah once I get the tool seat I don't think I'm gonna make a second return unless for some reason there's gonna be a bunch of scaling happening in the future which I don't really see any any reason for that so just to fill oh oh my [ __ ] god actually got this [ __ ] Cygnet you're going first okay no are you joking oh [ __ ] actually did that Wow you know I was thinking I would get this while I was making cannon balls I was about to go and do some so okay you know do you and I got this [ __ ] I saw that crystal in so the oven Signet we'll have a chance to save charges on your crystal items besides the blade of salad or it is mainly used for when you are skilling with the crystal tools like the pick ax the ax and all that so it's actually really good what's killing ya best in slot so really cool I don't have excited to see what we have caught Toto damn dude we've passively cost sixty-four crystal imps all the time I spent making cannon balls here all the times I spent coming back to Sookie no you know for the grind I've managed to passively collect 64 of these guys I've never camped these and of course there it is the official to x-ray did I baby we did it again we're so good at those oh my god noodle what bro you just got here knife tool see boys wow that's crazy he literally just got this pet - holy [ __ ] hey grats man but but first we must oh my god that's the saying I just saw my 10th crystal tool seed I just saw - crystal tool seeds in like a span of I don't even know less than 10 of attended the most shine grind might not be the worst grind of the entire elf City grinds because we are definitely being tested quite a bit here yeah it's not and use my promo code right scope to get 10% off everything oh my god I just got a big fat armadale test how can I say no to that the only issue is I don't have any more Chin's so I'm actually gonna have to catch some Chin's okay so I'm a TAS I got that last night and I was like yeah let's get some chins but I still didn't get the chins your name but you know what this gives me a good opportunity to try some other methods you know so yeah imma try some Armadale methods basically twisted ball camping with Sheol swamp so the mask cape can give me a free bronze crossbow a few times a day so that's really good because that way I can use those to get to the are middle room and drop them once I get in for more space okay this one sitting pretty good I hit 70 that's pretty much my max okay that was a really good kill oh nice yo that's say I'm gonna do a chest plate yeah so how did the Tebow method only work at armored oh it worked out actually quite well I was getting about 20 ish kills an hour once in a while you'll get some insanely fast kills with the table it just pops off sick DS like all the time but most of the time the kills were a bit slower than chaining for sure cuz yeah the Tebow was only hitting about 35% you know all the time but overall not bad so the first strap was to use the shield flick method which meant that every time my t-bones in Kota I just have a shield warned so I can reduce damage it worked out pretty well but I realized that I only do about 20-ish kills a trip if I don't / flee and what I realize also is that I was able to upkeep the food anyway so I quickly just abandon shield flicking out together and went straight to pro flicking so / flicking a little bit riskier because you're you are taking a bit more damage but you are able to last a lot longer though because I'm free flicking I can conserve my prayer most of the time and I was able to get actually more kills a lot more kills then using the shell method so I actually preferred just camping the Tebow pretty much the whole time inflicting my prayer if you're really unsure of your perfect thing abilities Geo flaking is pretty safe and yeah you can definitely get 20-ish kills no problem anyways yeah Tebow methis definitely verifiable I underestimated it for sure and I'm really glad tested it because I definitely don't plan on using chins anymore at armadale because yeah that evil is just really sufficient no I was a good speck on the melee guy i frickin killed a nail a guy that worked out pretty well come on alright okay this is the last of this trip because I want to know someone with a slaughter bracelet so yeah we mentioned you over 30 kills this trip so here is the rough strategy that I'm using currently with a t-bone method I hope to perfect this in the next task but for now the framework is mostly built so the main strategy is to freeze the melee guy I don't want him to hit me when I am just shooting my you know tebow at the boss because you're very range armor so the mainly guy hits really hard so try your best to freeze him as much as you can so he doesn't hit you I usually cycle around the room while freezing the main guy and tame the boss simultaneously I'll still have a blowpipe so the blowpipe spec comes in handy if I need a heal mid-fight I usually just SPECT the melee minion whatever minions near me and yeah I usually get a lot of HP back make sure to just keep aggro on the boss so because he does like to melee if you're nearby so just make sure your time that correctly same way like you timed the chins and yeah just freeze the mag I attack the boss eat up when you need to you know I try to keep myself above 50 HP and you'll get the kill eventually that's pretty much it and of course if you're not gonna be prayerful again than just she'll switch instead oh I just got an army Hill dude this is taxes sake nice hey look I've achieved the average amount of hills that I should have by this amount of KC so yeah finally I just finished my first ever armor don't ask what T was a prior weapon and I gotta say it worked out really really well average kills per trips was like 20 to 30 it was my first try ever so I can definitely see improvements as I get better and better with a setup and whatnot there's still some things I want to perfect but anyways we managed to get about 90 kills it was about 20-ish kills an hour and normally to do that many kills I would need to use at least probably a thousand red chins which would take about close to 2 hours to catch but obviously with the t-bone method I don't have to catch ins at all so I saved myself almost two hours having to prep for this task so that's huge every time I do an armor task I save you know somewhere between 1 or 2 hours every time compared to getting rich in so it's massive massive difference really good on an Ironmen oh I just got a leak clue from this myth or giant-ass sake nice I got a master food to do after this then Oh shoe bone nice okay alright I'm gonna pick that up right now to be honest alright let me check my bank after this this could be a big one dude this could be the one wow that's insane dude I got another delete clue to masters to do back-to-back first match the crew of two here we go they make again I swear I just get these all time I knew it I predicted it bro I knew it dude here we go oh wow here we go boys second master clue brah I just got it obsidian came our dude holy Sh it's so freaking cool dude I don't even have that that is it's not an ornament kid but you know unique item is a unique item nice that's awesome dude hell yeah all right so we can put this in the house let's go look at my master stash here there we go I'm seeing KB versed and yeah we got a few random uniques here in there that we haven't filled yet getting really close to filling this up though I just data I think the samurai gloves or something and we're done with that oh my god that's speaking of the devil dude I was like if I don't see anything past someone's Rex feed rod it's not a 70 70 but holy [ __ ] we almost hit that day we almost did it pretty much reached a jog right now for this boss next task is gonna be over the raid damn crazy all right so I have two Hydra claws and to save some bank space I might as well just turn these into some extra dragon hunter Lance all right let's do it three dragon hunter lenses in my bank all right it's time to actually make some stamina it's been a long time since I've actually done it but yeah I've kind of ran out stammers finally so I still have a crazy amount of marks of grace recklessly can't all our potions oh that's crazy I haven't had this many stamina four doses it's such a long time 927 all baby I am all set all right this is big number 5000 god damn 5000 is insane but it feels so fast dude 5000 Casey felt way fast again like two dollars a target okay see I'll tell you that Oh yo I got it holy [ __ ] that's insane okay so I'm I'm a hundred cents sure I have nine two bones in my bank right now so oh my god another one holy [ __ ] nevermind I got 11 shoe bones to burn tonight let's go okay all right so it says I'm 21 Casey done I finished this I'm gonna have 31 and I'm pretty sure I've done 20 so we're at like around 40 kills yeah along 48 kills time gonna go all right guys the last bone so I'm pretty sure that around 20 before they kept track of the chew bones so I'm around 50 Casey still way too early for dick Shawn but it's gonna take a long time for another ten of these bones since I'm passively just doing this so last video got a lot of support and I obviously know why so thank you guys so much for yeah keeping up with nature staff ground we finally finished that one so it's amazing and also regarding the twitch vlog I'm gonna
