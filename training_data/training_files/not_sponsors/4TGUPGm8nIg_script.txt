tarkov is brutal and cold but once in a while a light can shine through look at this guy bears and musics can get along scabs around it's rare but sometimes boundaries can break and friendship can prevail he was my friend just kidding welcome to another escape from tarkov video just like always I have been having a blast playing tarkov it's rolling away I can't I've been having fun and thrilling PvP engagements I just kill the guy right here looting with the door open like a little monster well they're usually fun I've also been dabbling in crypto currencies learning a lot about my finances I've also been vigilantly completing tasks oh there I got survivalists to headshot no ice that's what I needed and actually for once having pretty decent luck and finding what I need that's a hard one to complete found all that [ __ ] in raid the prospect of acquiring the kappa container is actually feeling more and more achievable believe it or not I've even been ratting around a little bit under reserve in the new tunnels with general Sam wait there's someone here I can smell them but most importantly I've been commanding my dominance all around and through the acquisition of this over-the-top gear set I learned a very valuable lesson on labs man when you were a good armored scam is a lot easier now I know why everybody wears this [ __ ] anywho the first thing I really want to talk about today is directly correlated with this [ __ ] who lives in the tree house Jagr surprise surprise he wanted me to kill a bunch of scabs and a bunch of PMC's using a measly shotgun I reluctantly accepted realizing that me and shotguns have had a very turbulent past I love this game but let me tell you something due to jaegers unusual request I learned something very valuable and that is that shotguns are absolutely insane good night one more for the quest I am not kidding around Hey [Applause] cuz they're fat I was having an absolute blast and during this process I even figured out the best type of shotgun ammunition Magnum buck more like Magnum before I knew it I had blown through this quest and this one guess he was flashbangs shotguns are great and all but if you miss you're in trouble around this same time prompt or was also putting me to work by having me killed twelve PMC's with nothing but a grenade this was an easy feat for me because I throw grenades in almost every encounter are you dead now I throw a grenade oh so today he's over here easily he's dead he's dead oh look at you go don't birthing oh no they're going oh [ __ ] he's right here I got okay got another nade killed nice like the others before long this task was completed nice no he's you really got him that yeah we just wiped a three man in like half a second pretty good because I was flying through these tasks at such a rapid rate before I knew it it was already time to face the scab bosses once again oh I got it I'm up to killing Rochelle already dude fortunately I had already killed him once I said I already had his Golden Gun to just turned that in nine just gotta kill reshawna given my prior experience this was not the most difficult task no they're not all dead because I would have gotten the subtask I started tarkov four days ago because of you I hate it and love it goddamn mates I was much more concerned with this [ __ ] me and my friend boob nervously loaded into interchange in an attempt to hunt down killer hey bud no backpack hold on I'm just now loading in and like being born into this world on it sometimes it's all Christ III don't know if you heard or not but I'm getting PC upgrades some serious ones very soon mm-hmm our stay in the mall was quite brief oh there is he got me I'm dead you didn't get him poop oh my god he's a maniac yeah but before I went after killer again I decided to go on woods worst map ever like you know I actually liked woods deep down actually like woods deep down and I had an experience that I was not expecting oh is that I had managed to weasel my way into a shirt Kousaka I managed to escape having killed Sherman before I needed to for the quest however I still very much needed to take down killa i entered interchange with my friend brian Ultra nice huh some hit this let's hit the letter o latex I take it you sure yeah I used mine for the upgrade for the hideout like I've said before Brian is one of the biggest tarkov Chad's I know we escaped with the lead X and I happily gave it to therapists we then immediately went back into interchange in an attempt to find killer once and for all okay he's in here he's in here we're gonna have general general where exactly to the left when you look in there that's going out get the helmet let's get out of here because you need to find a hedge taking his rig quick down that's right let's go we made it to the extract but I now needed to fight German even though I already had a key card yeah I already got Germans key so I just turned that in boom easy just got a kill Sherman easy enough I entered woods solo and quickly heard the unmistakable sound of Sherman's SVD cracking in the distance [Applause] they got his guard [Applause] there's this little weasel always like somewhere over here there he was some running there let's go back around this way [Applause] [Applause] at first I thought this would be a normal Sherman kill with his normal loot his normal ki and his normal SBB I was mistaken there it was a red rebel icepick one of the most sought after items in the entire game an item quite fitting for yours truly oh my god oh my god oh my god [Applause] and yield myself up and want to do more looting yeah I know I know and I need a water and [Applause] the scabs will provide all right here it is I've kept the season it's our exit take the cliff dissent oh I don't know what is it UN robot okay I made it to the extract and left woods alive with a completed quest a tunnel loot and my very own red rebel [Applause]
