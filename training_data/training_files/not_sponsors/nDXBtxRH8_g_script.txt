Armstrong by attending what else but FARC school these opening cutscenes are kind of strange because there's no real audio going on no music no spoken dialogue or anything just run around or suddenly Jimmy jams the tutorial is pretty quick and simple but I need to put a big ole asterisk all over the screen right now if you're familiar with any of the 3ds Sonics and particular Sonic Adventure 2 this is gotta feel real familiar it's to the point where the first split-second you're like is this a mod but then you start punching things and it's like ah okay cool a new game I think considering how clean and good spark one felt with two emulating the 3d variants I was happy to see some of that gooey Hedgehog jank cleaned up although spark 2 feels a bit dated to play albeit by design it's like lake tempered was like hey let's triangulate the jank recreate it with pinpoint accuracy reduced the amount of falling through the world deaths and here we go so let's lay it down bark actually has a much larger moveset than good old sanic if you've played the original or watched my video on it you know that you have the ability to absorb weapon abilities and take them as a new melee moveset like kirby unlike his inspo not every enemy in spark 2 dies when you miraculously hover crash into them you're gonna have to learn combo firk has a standard move set but he can hold three additional ones that you can switch between at the press of a button and the original you had a plethora of weapons like magic hoverboards and my favorite edgy spark to lowered the overall amounts of them but you know three dimensions you got like a huge sword a Kamen Rider outfit Amy Rose mode and of course the return of edgy this time he does the Shadow the Hedgehog thing good the whole shebang all of it why not however farc also inherits a lot of Sonic's abilities besides the whole run fast thing similarly to the original spark you can also tap right trigger to get a little dash going that's how you do this you're gonna do this a lot I mean what can I say it's basically a Sonic Adventure clone well without the Chaos Emerald segments tails segments big the cat robot Amy open-world oh wait so it's basically everything Sonic fans wanted the series to be oh [ __ ] except there's no Chows the one thing we all want while spark the electric gesture to might lack a bit of the variety that the 3d Sonic games that's totally okay with me and probably everyone else except for the five diehard big the cat fans pieces look it plays like Sonic Adventure 2.5 or something what do you want from me it didn't go in the direction of like sonic forces colors or generations wear it on Rails you for a lot of the experience there's a lot of slowing down for platforming manually picking routes and making tight jumps you don't just press bright bumper too quick - right yeah got a go for it yourself the unreal nature that modern Sonic games have adopted might be an extreme spectacle but it kind of destroys the replay value you just kind of watch the same thing over and over in spark you gotta like use effort and stuff so maybe you fall off the cliff sometimes maybe it's the Jencks fault maybe it's your fault whatever it's fine but you know what Sonic Adventure doesn't have a confusing story yeah yeah it does so the narrative in spark - like its predecessor tries to be a lot beyond the initial identity crisis which is your typical Megaman X or Astro Boy thing it kind of builds up into this destruction of the world plot for some reason there's an organization that's out to stop you led by sparks fake robots fake robots its name is EJ and it says vaguely questionable things where's the doctor yeah I don't know maybe inside your but there's a bunch of potentially melodramatic cutscenes hampered by a lack of audio like the beginning but there's also a couple of neat moments here and there as well but eh that's not what you're here for you're here for this oh hey they even cloned the music [Music] well you got me there video game spark the electric gesture to set out to do one extremely specific thing and I think it did a pretty good job of that it feels like at least in the gameplay just like the original lake Peppard knows exactly how to emulate the feel and expand upon it without simply being a ripoff however similarly to the first one spark 2 isn't without a couple of issues one of the major problems in 3d sonic tends to be managing the length of the levels since Sonic worlds are designed to be tight and compact they end up running short at times but also having this irreplaceable spectacle who could forget running away from the giant Orca or the truck snowboarding down a huge mountain ur trying your best to scale a rocket only to use a piece of metal to surf out of there you don't forget things like this unfortunately spark the electric gesture to doesn't excel in this while it may have captured the feel of the 3d Sonic gameplay a lot of the level design leaves some to be desired it has moments absolutely for sure there's this level where you scale a massive space elevator if you take a second to smell the roses and look around you can see just how big it is or if you fall off the side of the level you can see the entire thing and it looks awesome but also you fall for like ever and eat any day now a lot of the levels are visually obfuscated by the high amount of colors and things on the screen a lot of worlds are just floating blocks in the sky and when there isn't a cool set piece like a train or a Space Station it becomes easy to get lost like the snow level here hello at least a few of the levels have an early goal option which has literally the pity button taken too long come in here fake smelly gamer and that's like the only really negative thing I have to say about spark because it was made by one person you know it's not like awesome possum which was made by a team a [ __ ] team awesome any other issues I have can be boiled down to a really dumb nitpicky stuff audio mixing a bit crappy by default solo indie game it runs poorly and resolutions above 1080p solo indie dev also unity I guess I just wish there were Chows but that's a pipe dream not even Sega I've said it before and I'll say it again dude mobile ciao guard and Sega you listening you will become the gamer kings and queens after all everyone knows that people only like Sonic Adventure for the weird crying egg babies you could eat they got yoked I don't remember this game run of this fast yeah you ever got a Google Sonic running too fast while spark the electric gesture too may not be the best thing ever it certainly has an extreme amount of character after becoming a really big fan of lake peppers work with the original I'm really happy to see him pull something off that I thought was impossible I feel like there hasn't been a truly quality 3d Sonic game since generations and to see a single person pull it off feels great maybe perhaps like pepper it is the Christian white head of 3d Sonic of Dark Souls I mean of Sonic Adventure who knows but what I do know is that spark 2 is pretty dang fun is it gonna appease fans of 3d Sonic absolutely if you don't like 3d Sonic are you gonna like this probably not be one of those people who says things like Sonic is and will always be bad will you like it dude I don't know maybe you just hate Sonic because of his freaky all-seeing double Irish to eyeball yeah well okay you know I'll get out of here someday
