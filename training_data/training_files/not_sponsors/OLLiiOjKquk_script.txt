this video is brought to you by skillshare what's up guys salu this is alex welcome back to the mother sources series now if you remember when in the previous episode i basically got knighted by a three michelin star chef who said that he liked the little jew that i made i think i've done my homework with reduction sauces but today's episode is about emotion sources so think millionaires for example or think baby the real reason why you love eggs benedict so much sauce hollondes hollandes sauce yes sauce holidays is that mother sauce that star of your sunday morning eggs benedict sexy tricking of a poached egg down on salty smoked bacon never ends to be honest sauce hollandaise is a mother sauce and if you fully want to understand it there is no better place to learn from it than in the mighty escoffier cookbook which i have been extensively using since the start of this series introduction blah blah blah ground sauces basically mother sauces sauce espanol that's episode four veloute that's episode six huh [Music] that's weird oh there you go sauce hollandes it's classified in the uh small sauces like daughter sauces i thought it was a mother sauce that's that's what i've been reading online everywhere it's very weird anyways that's not going to stop me sauce hollandaise the traditional way that's what we are doing right now so even though that sounds should be called a a suspension we won't damage it by just calling it more simply an emulsion okay so that means just tiny droplets of oil swimming in an ocean of water so as you may already know oil and water don't mix the two phases separate oil is sitting on top of water you could shake it vigorously or whisk it vigorously but the mix is never going to be stable unless you use an emulsifier egg yolks they're going to hold the whole mix together and they're going to allow it to remain stable ish because so still is a bit finicky okay let's start the recipe first you need to melt and clarify 250 grams of unsalted butter clarifying is getting rid of the foam on top and the residues at the bottom now separate 4 eggs as we just need the yolks here place a heat proof bowl on top of a saucepan to create a double boiler as known as a french banamari now whisk the egg yolks over low heat until they start thickening and getting paler very very carefully add some clarified butter in please please don't stop whisking otherwise this is gonna happen let's stop for a second because there's no recovery from what i just did the sauce split the hollandaise sauce is not a sauce no more it's just a pool of melted butter with little blobs of cooked egg yolk yes i am mad but no this did not happen for no reason reason number one heat control i'm using a double boiler as long as a bar baby and it's supposed to protect whatever food you cook however it's not magical you still get loads of heat especially if the water is boiling underneath if you ever pass 65 degrees celsius or 149 degrees fahrenheit the egg yolks are gonna cook that's basically game over the second reason it requires your attention you can't just go and faff around on your desktop looking for whatever bike you want to buy next you need to stay there like the lion cook you are and keep on whisking keep on whisking keep on whisking keep on whisking that's the only thing you gotta do but if you don't do it this is gonna happen i'm glad i did that mistake i might have done this on purpose you'll never know if this happens to you take this discard it and start fresh and that is exactly what i'm about to do okay back to it butter egg yolks double boiler yeah now very carefully add the clarified butter in and keep on whisking when you get the texture you want just season it with a bit of salt the final touch is a generous squeeze of lemon which in my eyes is the keystone to a great hollandaise sauce it's a beautiful sauce so as much as i want to taste it like straight away i want to just dump my face into this beautiful warm silky smooth lemony sauce i can't do that this needs a ship to just land upon the worst metaphor ever anyways i need to make eggs benny to go with this okay because i think eggs benedict might be the best way to showcase that sauce let's just make eggs benedict video [Music] to poach an egg i usually leave it for four minutes in boiling hot water but off the heat the only thing you need to keep in mind is use the freshest organic egg you can get your hands on it's gonna make the difference now fry up some bacon and toast an english muffin not a cupcake assembling the eggs benedict is very straightforward but you can top it off to make it pretty with a bit of chive or cayenne pepper and basically that's it that's the dish you want every sunday morning salty bacon and juice poached egg lemony silky hollandaise sauce these little chives having a little naughty garlicky hint there's no question about this dish it's an amazing one eggs benedict oh one of the most indulgent one of the absolute best sunday morning breakfast you could ever dream of problem is who has time for this on sunday morning so that is basically the traditional method is it amazing yes does it taste delicious it does but it doesn't come without problems i've been doing a little math and five plus four at least at 42 minutes just to make one egg benedict 42 minutes second it's messy one two three four 12 to 15 things that i need to wash up afterwards the bloody mess feels like it was british for a second it's just a bloody mess and the third problem is that this method is not even foolproof anyways i think you do get my point the process required to make sauce hollandaise and so eggs benedict is just old-fashioned cumbersome and so temperamental i want to turn this process into something foolproof something reliable and something very very very fast so that's basically the plan for the next episode i want to set up a new record take care bye [Music] and [Music] you
