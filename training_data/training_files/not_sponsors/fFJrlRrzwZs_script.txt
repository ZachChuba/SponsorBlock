Hello. Today's challenge is Get an HGV license challenge. In order to get it, I came to 
an authorized driving school. (TA-DA) For some reason, I think that's the 
car I will have to drive. Heh... Oh geez... This is trouble. A question here. Q. Why are you getting an HGV license? [My dream]
I want to drive a camping car I heard you need a special license for it.
(Depending on the vehicle, standard 2nd class licenses are possible, too!!) (Good tip) There's a special license for small
vehicles, so they say you can get that But the driving school I came to today said you can get the HGV license without that So, I've come to getting that somehow. It feels like I've gone a bit too far [into it] That car earlier... I think that's the car for the HGV licenseㅠ (Dignity of the HGV license) Hello.
[>>Came into the office to apply<<] Yes. (Yongsunie) But, this HGV license... Is it an automatic? (It's manual...) (Ah...) Oh hohoho... Will I be able to get it? Why do you think I won't? I drive well; They said I have to do a physical checkup, too. (There's a lot to do...) Department classroom. >>Enter<< >>Exit<< [Feeling it for the first time in a while] [Real hakwon atmosphere] It's a hakwon. (Quiet) (Omniscient_Desk_Point of view) [HGV driver's license handbook] I will now start my class. I listened to today's lesson and came out. Because I have a class 2 license I need to take 3 hours of classes, do the required 10 hours of driving practice, And then they said I can take a test right away. Today, I took the 3 hours of classes It was a really useful time. It would be nice if I pass right away I'm confident that I will pass it right away. I'm doing this challenge being confident. But, I could fail it. I will attempt it, at most, 10 times. Really, I'll reach 10 times, And if I fail, then this...
 Will just not be my path. Hwaiting.
(Mind that would have succeeded in anything) This is the car I will be taking my test in. It's great, right? (Proper greeting) (What is she doing?) [Hwaiting!] Getting a class 1 HGV driver's license challenge! Starts now! Hwaiting! (Zoom in) Right now, I'm at the
Gangnam driver's license test center. (Zoom out) If I want to get an HGV trailer license I need to get a physical checkup, proof of my workout experience, and various paperwork needs to be done. So I came to get my physical checkup. Large tow truck. Driver's license test, (class 1 large-special) exam ticket I need to fill this out and submit it And then I can take the test. I will try my best and come back. Leggo. I got my physical checkup done. Ta-da. [Normal] I'm a very healthy adult female. If I take this to the hakwon and submit it, I really can take the exam. I'm really scared! Getting an HGV license. It's really scary. But, this Solarsido. This challenge!! It's a challenge! I never imagined I would do a challenge like this. But I really want to get it! In one try! Hello. Solarsido, this is Solar. [Get an HGV license challenge]
This is the second day. So, today, I'm planning on taking 
the functional course for 4 hours. This car is even manual. Will I be able to drive this car? My dad has an HGV license. So, I asked my dad for some tips. And he said... Just, everything the teachers tell you at the hakwon, those are all tips. [Engine ON] [Safety belt OK] I took the brake off. (Rolling) Stop. That's right. Push the side brake. Is it this? (Yong-scaredy cat) Push it? (Pushing it with her facial expression) I pushed it. (Nervous) (Okay!) (Nervous) [4 hours First practice over]
I took my first practice. [Today's practice]
Forward, reverse. Go out to a T and come back as a T. (Seriously) It was so hard. I'm out of energy. - They said it's really hard to pass in one try.
- It looks like it... Today, I have 4 hours of class I've scheduled a test date. So I'm going into the office to set it early today Is it going well? Yes. I feel like you'll do well. I think I'm going to pass. - You do, already?
- Yes. You only practiced for 4 hours? For some reason, I have a good feeling.
[Positive power] (Until this, it seemed like she was just bluffing...) (To be continued...) Right now, there's someone taking the exam before me. So I'm watching right now. They're doing the T parking right now. I'm nervous.x2 (Empathy 100%) They succeeded.
 (Driver's license get+1) From here The trailer is detached. (Quick tutoring from someone who
 knows how to drive well) [Then, you attach this first, then you turn a rod and pull it out, then, it starts when you put it in gear, then, you go forward, and like that car, you do the T parking, go forward again, and then come back here] And then it ends when it detaches again. (Quite easy, right?) [Relaxed facial expression]
[Confident handling] I came to finish my 9 hours today. I'm doing 2 hours today. For 2 hours, I'm going to detach
the trailer, then attach it. I'm going to be taking that kind of class. Then, tomorrow, Finally, it's the long-awaited exam. [Nervous] [Excited] Please take care of me~ Before taking my exam tomorrow
I have 2 more hours of practice. Will I be able to get in after 12 hours? Yongwangnims, please look forward to it. Wow, the tire is this big.
[Just the tire is 1m] This is the engine container. (Not) They said it's not. This is... The wheel. (Correct) This is, the thing that removes all the bad things inside. (Doesn't seem like it) They said it's not. This is painted on. (?) The columns that fix it in place. And this... Moo. (Radish) (I love moo) There was an air conditioner there? (The back of her head clearly would have been cool) Now, I need to set up a camera inside the car. (Skill learned at indoor rock climbing) This is how I set it up. It happens through my own self-work. (Bye now) [Solar is riding it] A car isn't standing here. When you're actually taking the exam, this is detached. (Explaining this and that about how to attach the trailer) (And, this was self-service...) [Jjasik, hwaiting today, too...] [Burned it up] [Handling without hesitation] [Focused mouth sticking out] Subscribe, like. Hello~ (Third greeting) Solarsid-ddo! This is Solar. You see this, right? You see it growling? Today's challenge!
I came to get an HGV driver's license. Today is D-Day, it's exam day. Will I be able to pass it in one try? I'm really nervous right now. (The teacher) said there hasn't been a female recently who has passed it in one try. It has made my confidence drop a lot. But I will get it in one try today. Yongwangnims, give me strength! [Strength] Now, after practicing for 2 hours, it will be my exam. I will first practice fully and hard. Leggo. [Confident] (Final practice) (You can do it!!) [Practice over] I think I'm going to go crazy. I'm nervous~ [Sublimating with a song]
(Unknown) I'm shaking~ I'm trembling~ It's a song I learned in high school. In my English class. (Not forced) 
Do you think I'm going to get it in one try? (Nod) Really? (Nod22...) Really? (Nod333...) Okay. (Satisfied) I also think I'll get it in one try. I think I'm good at it. But, you know how you feel nervous for some reason. Since it is an exam. I'm going to rest a bit. They're setting up right now for an exam. I'm waiting. I'm nervous x5 I'm trembling!!! I'm nervous nervous! [Real reaction] I'm nervous. I'm going crazy. [Real reaction22] (Loss of rationality) What do I do, I don't want to take it!!!!! I don't want to take the exam!!!!! (Hard-working person mode) No, I need to take it. After everything I've done. [This what trembling when you're nervous is] [Last minute practice] Teacher!!! [Last minute questioning] 
Was it counter-clockwise? - Put it up...
- Place your foot- And then [pull], then counter-clockwise? I'm scared... 
[Solarsido first Challenge that Solar is afraid of] 'I want to get it'
