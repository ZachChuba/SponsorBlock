[Music] this is a supersonic baseball cannon we built it because it's awesome and it can make baseballs go supersonic what have we done look at it we initially just wanted to see if we could make a baseball go past the speed of sound and we can 1050 miles an hour mach 1.38 so now it's time to figure out how to use this thing as a tool because i want to do a lot of cool stuff with it here on smarter every day so let's have a brief discussion here matlab is cool but have you done plywood check this out so this is a graph of a smooth sphere and this is a plot of drag force versus velocity or speed and so you can see what happens here is as the ball goes faster and faster and faster it ramps up in terms of drag and then at some point it breaks over a little past 200 miles an hour and then it drops off and then it tapers up into infinity as you go past that well see the thing is with our supersonic baseball cannon we spend a lot of time on this side of the curve so we don't really know what happens here this is for a smooth sphere this is done by a guy named weston we're going to see what we can do with a baseball the way we're going to do that is we're going to characterize this thing and that's a fancy way of saying we're going to figure out how it works check this out so this graph is a graph of pressure and velocity and what i want to do is i want to figure out how much pressure to put in the pressure vessel how much of a vacuum to pull in the vacuum barrel here and what velocities we get as a function of those things so it's actually going to be like a 3d surface but we're going to stick to the plywood method for now because we're in the field we'll record all the data later here's the thing though i've rented high-speed cameras and i've actually called in a favor from gavin this is a v3610 i'll get you in the light here this is a super fast high speed camera 36 000 frames per second that's really really fast over here we've got gavin's 4k high speed camera that's amazing that's a phantom veo 4k trent's running all the data here so uh he's a little stressed we've got four high-speed cameras patched in to a network there here's george george is helping with all kinds of stuff here this is the v2511 this is the smarter everyday camera and what we're gonna do with this is we're gonna look at the overall view and as the baseball comes out here we're going to track the velocity over time till it gets to the target for target effects we have this it's a v7510 this is a new high-speed camera 75 000 frames per second that's like stupid stupid stupid here is what we're shooting i don't care what we hit i just care about the velocity from there to there so i asked the patrons of smartereveryday thank you very much for your support patrons what to hit and they came up with some really strange things i don't know what's wrong with the person that uh said we should do that we've got five pounds of silly putty we've got cake sprinkles and we have more things in the back of my truck i'll reveal those slowly as we go that's just like the sugar on top but this is where it's at check this out this is a boresight tool very important note here removed before firing what we can do with this is we can look down the shot path of the cannon and we can aim in terms of inches now that's really cool so i don't know if i can view this it's very hard to line up but as you go down in here yeah look at that so you can see where the baseball hit last time that's cool we're gonna be able to aim much more accurately now okay so this is the goal we're gonna shoot the cannon we're gonna get the velocities as a function of pressure and we're gonna see what happens to baseballs once we get it into really weird aerodynamic regimes so we're gonna point the borescope there you gonna look through it yep okay so the question is are we gonna hit that so that'll tell us if we're able to aim this thing uh this is our datum this is the beginning of the cannon right there and then every five feet we've got it marked out we're gonna put our target at about 30 something feet when we do that first shot no target just a camera check out got a checklist today on the phone time to load a baseball i forgot how tight that is [Applause] all right we put the plastic over here just so we can pull a vacuum start gh5s confirm focus battery and card you happy on gh5s george uh i am confirmed phantom buffers set correctly on all cameras okay all right time to pull vacuum here we go so we've got pressure here we've got vacuum here um we've got an offset of 0.8 as we start this one minus 0.8 oh god it's pulling it fast it's so great okay on the first shot we're just gonna do a check out of the whole system nothing downrange we're just gonna fire the thing and make sure we can hit what we're aiming at so we could do 300 psi yeah i should do 300. okay game time decision first calibration shot 300 psi at about a minus 7.2 psi vacuum ears on if you want them i'm good i'm good final pressure on this 300 psi a vacuum of minus eight on the gauge which is about minus seven point two firing in three two one two one one okay we've got our v2511 shot here from the side it's 90 degrees to the flight line which allows us to do some really cool measurements the way we need to do this though is we have these little flags on the ground we have 5 10 15 20 25 30 feet on the flags so we can do this really cool thing where we measure how many inches each pixel is worth so if we say from there to there is 30 feet which is 360 inches that gives us a pixel calibration of 0.344 inches per pixel knowing this we can now make measurements so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say distance angle and speed from two points i'm going to play until the ball exits the barrel i'm going to take a first point here and then because we can know how far this thing travels now and we know how much time is in between each frame we can get the actual speed of the baseball it was going 917 miles an hour oh we can chart data now oh where's all right oh data wow it's exciting all right so so that was 300 psi and we did 917 miles an hour what i'm excited dude there's this was so happy about graphics it's i mean look at my graph it's amazing okay so oh did we we didn't yeah we did record the temperature and humidity right so 1.195 mach so mach 1.2 so we've got 300 psi mach 1.2 we have our first data point [Laughter] look at it it's right there that's our data point all right that's a good data point that's a great it's one of my favorite data points and that was at uh minus eight uh psi on the barrel so if we fire this thing again with no vacuum in the barrel we should get a lower velocity so let's fire 300 psi with no vacuum on the front and then if it does that then we're starting to define the graph okay so i'm gonna say oh i need to say that we had vacuum do you have do you have a little pencil or something i can i can already tell that we're going to put this on the wall like i can already tell we don't have a pen no that's a blank all right you can use this but just for this that's my pen okay i'll give it right back so that is that is uh about minus so it was a minus eight on the vacuums to be about minus minus 7.2 psi barrel cool 300 psi tank feels legit all right that's great man all right so now let me put that data in the spreadsheet and then if i keep playing if i keep playing this thing down here it should be at a different velocity down here so that should be lower which would indicate drag 831 miles an hour so we just defined the drag coefficient of a baseball from 917 miles an hour to about 825. oh i need to make another i need to make another thing so yeah so what i need to do is i need to draw one of these and and go out here and so we define the baseball curve out here there's something funny about riding out zero to 2 000 miles an hour knowing that you might actually be able to do it on a piece of plywood and so i'm just going to draw a dotted line and then we'll go back in and we'll we're trying to get all the data here so we can get the complete drag of a baseball can i please see your pen again i'll be nice to it the curve shape means nothing i just kind of drew something and then i'll just fill this in as we go we knew from before that uh from zero to 600 miles an hour has been done and i'm assuming that was a spinning baseball who knows this is not a spinning baseball this is a knuckle ball okay it is time for the first smarter everyday patron target suggestion this is from andrew maxie who suggests sprinkles andrew has been a patron since april thank you very much for your support andrew and what is this what are you doing you do not want to be here this is not no come on come on oh you're beautiful i shall name you sprinkles all right why don't you stay over here and become a big beautiful butterfly that'd be great also the lighting is incredible right now on you whoa oh yeah super sonic baseball cannon forgot oh dude it's so silly it's like a weapon aimed at sprinkles all right here we go all right that's our sprinkle situation we need to move it a little bit dustin your audio is rolling for sure yes my audio is rolling pickle switches in your hand in my hand everyone is in a safe location correct goggle time everyone goggles always we've got sprinkle goggle issues this time everyone be careful yeah that's true i wonder what it's going to smell like it's gonna smell like ants okay here we go pressurizing 270 going to 300. dude this is supposed to be awesome my heart's beating faster uh teen honey oh this is gonna be great george you ready yep 300 no it's gotta be 300 i want you hey everybody ready rolling rolling rolling i'm good okay here we go shot two say 300. all right here we go sprinkles how you get ants three two one oh there's the baseball all right i got it there's so much happening right now all right the sprinkles slowed the baseball down okay we didn't have a vacuum oh it smells like burnt sprinkles look at this oh oh that's that's phenomenal look at that okay that's interesting it just made candy hold on oh it's like confectioner's sugar oh look at that gotta eat it right have to this just tastes like icing it's the sugar is so uh finely ground oh interesting look at this oh this is pretty look at this very interesting come look at the sugar the sugar you got your knife you gotta do a taste test dude get your knife right here taste that is it real good that's 100 pure sprinkles but it's been treated with mock one treated with a shockwave oh my gosh that's good this is unbelievable look at the 3610. wow that's a lot happening [Applause] look at the look at how there's nothing around the ball like it just creates this cavity think about this this is crazy momentum is conserved right so the ball is going straight in and so the total momentum after the collision is equal to the total momentum before the collision i mean there's some inefficiencies there and it raises the temperatures but that's why the ball goes to the right and those sprinkles go to the left so all these sprinkles that are slowly moving to the left the sum of that velocity to the left of the parting line is equal to the sum of the veloci the velocity times mass to the right parting line right yes this is a beautiful like galaxy collision simulation is what this is only sprinkles if you pause it it almost looks like it's still moving [Laughter] it's wild all right so andrew's sprinkle idea was pretty good i must admit yeah good job andrew oh man i almost want to do that again and do it super super tight we have another one don't we we have another one i don't know do we do that or we go to the next thing let's do the next thing say we shoot a jar of mayonnaise dude have you looked at the wide i'm just curious oh yeah yeah we gotta do the data i'm sorry yeah that's right i care about the data that's the only thing we're doing here so yeah i got graphs yeah yeah what are we doing here we're graphing velocity versus pressure there's drag data time all right all right here we go math is happening doing some math i'm trying to sound like a calculator calculator okay muzzle velocity any guesses this is no vacuum my guess is that it doesn't affect it my guess is that it's lower my guess is lower what was the last shot at 913 miles an hour this time is 849 yep so it's lower so mach 1.1 right here can i see your pen again oh yeah i didn't you know where i had to it wasn't returned last time oh i'm sorry 300 psi tank black means no pressure on the vacuum and so that's mach 1.1 the velocity at target is 746. okay filling in the graph all right i just plotted this uh we were able to fill in 746 to 840 on our velocity chart now it's time i say we shoot faster now all right so we're doing well on our primary objectives on our secondary objectives is starting to get weird uh joseph robinson i don't know what's wrong with you but uh apparently we're gonna shoot a gallon of mayonnaise thank you for supporting on patreon it's extra heavy mayonnaise shooting a gallon of mayonnaise with a supersonic baseball is weird but i'm excited about it we need to move that way move it up oh i can move the mayonnaise what am i doing we need to move the whole cannon or i could just do that supersonic baseball cannon versus mayonnaise so just to be clear three two one okay turn the vacuum off okay i'm on your on your account okay three two one five two one good gracious oh there's so much mayonnaise out there it turned white there's a mist of berries oh joseph robinson what are we done oh dude it's on the camera it's on the camera no mayonnaise on that camera no mayonnaise on that camera do we have any mayonnaise on the drone drone looks good oh golly i cannot describe the smell it's like oh no oh no no no no god oh the grass is slippery look my my shoes are oily okay i hope it looks cool oh so we got the the sprinkles mixed with mayo well i guess this will keep our plate from rusting did the ball survive i don't know i don't know why this made me sad you sound like upset what's that you sound upset i don't know why it's so upsetting oh man go down there and look at it and you'll figure out why it's upsetting i got mail on my drone did you really yeah it stinks oh golly and then so the mavic gets the mayo i did not enjoy that i just want my data does it explode in an interesting way it's quite interesting dustin where does it hit did we aim correctly we hit dead center did we really dead center so three right here oh i'm hanging oh god oh god is it visually stunning yes yes it is something about that just felt weird you feel a little dirty all right all right you want to see this oh no hey how about this look oh good old ken's extra heavy mayonnaise all right are you ready i don't think i am actually okay i'm gonna fast forward and stop it there's a shockwave dude you just see this fire oh my gosh that is amazing did you see the shockwave go over the top of that oh yes did you see the shockwave before it got there we saw a shadowgraph i'm in your lap i'm uncomfortable with this look look at that is that the plastic what is this the shockwave that is amazing so we made fire we dieseled mayonnaise is on fire this is the best advertisement for ken's extra ever every mandate ever dude okay you got to go back look at the shockwave first oh i saw it what is the red is that the this is the paint is it the stitches or the sticker ripping it's a sticker stuff 86 degrees fahrenheit 52 relative humidity 29.86 inches of mercury okay so that was 75 36 10. [Music] that is incredible it looks like lips yeah really big lips look at did you see that no it did not wow look okay so everything is coming towards the camera right yeah and then when the gas hits oh i see like a wall watch look at that watch it just and it's still doing it yeah it all stopped yeah it's all just like it's no longer moving towards you that's where it goes oh they're popping they're like they're hitting the back the backstop oh that's right what's happening they're hitting the back stop and popping look right here yeah yeah yeah have you smelled it down there yet oh i know right that's just nasty i know it is like i don't want to touch it you have to i know [Laughter] that's awful that poor backdrop that was so like it was all like rainbow you see why i'm sad now i do you came back and you were so deflated i get it date a time math happening all right so the muzzle velocity is 1074 miles per hour target velocity 968. we didn't quite overlap so may i please have your pin again i know so that was 500 psi thank you 1.4 mach 1.4 one two three four so that's what happens if you hit a jar of mayonnaise with a baseball at 1074. yes now we know obviously that question has been answered finally all right everything is happening according to what you would expect so anyway that's our that's our new data point right there feel good about that we are trending up which is expected obviously so good this episode of smarter every day is sponsored by audible and i love that fact because i get to tell you about an audiobook that means a lot to me you might not know but in that tire swing right there was the first time smarter every day was ever sponsored i told you about a book by a guy named c.s lewis called the voyage of the dawn treader well i'm going to tell you about one today that's even cooler than that it's called the screw tape letters and this book's crazy it's about a demon who's teaching a younger demon how to tempt a human that sounds crazy because it is and the book is awesome you gotta check this out you can get this by going to audible.com smarter or texting the word smarter to 500 500 here's the deal though if you do that you're gonna get an audible subscription you get a book a month but this is a part of the plus catalog there's this whole section that are like extra and you can pick whatever you want the screwtape letters by cs lewis to my surprise this audiobook is in the plus catalog so you get it audible.com smarter text the word smarter to 500 500 i go through this book with a bunch of dudes from my church we listen to one of the screwtape letters and then we talk about it for an hour we do that every week it's incredible go check this out the screwtape letters by c.s lewis you will not be disappointed with this audiobook it's very very deep all right so obviously we only did a few data point shots in this episode it was just really interesting so this is like a way to get started we've got some more data points coming up some patrons have suggested some more things to shoot at it's fascinating we got that silly putty i mentioned we have some stuff i didn't tell you about so please consider subscribing if you'd like to see that also if you'd like to be a patron i'd love to send you a baseball like this and if you have been a patron for a while i've got something cool i'm gonna send you as a way to say thanks for sticking around and being a patron for a while anyway that's it i'm destined you're getting smarter every day have a good one you remember this glove look at that yeah anyway have a good one bye
