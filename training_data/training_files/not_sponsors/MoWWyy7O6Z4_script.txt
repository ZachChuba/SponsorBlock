platform to build a beautiful online presence and Jordan why don't you come over here we loved making videos growing up we were homeschooled so it was just a fun way to hang out with each other I don't remember a time when we didn't have a camera in our hands I'm just really glad that our parents gave us the permission to just run around and be crazy all the time right try and think of all the memories that we have most of them together are filming videos if you really think about it yeah we just made home videos for years until one day YouTube came along and suddenly you could post videos on the internet and we were so excited about that idea yeah it was a novelty to our friends that they could go online and watch something that we made so we continued to make videos for years and years and then one day one of them happened to blow up so I'm in college now but before that I was home-schooled so we already had like a hundred videos that we had posted on our channel over the years now tens of thousands of people were watching our videos each week and we were worried that people were gonna think we weren't very professional because most of the videos on our channel were just shot in our house with the prank video camera do you like my hair just Jesus called that's the worst thing he's ever seen but as we kept making videos and getting more viewers we would go back and watch our old videos and realize just how special they were to us and it felt wrong to delete them I think we realized that the only reason we would delete them is because in some way we were embarrassed by them and the more we thought about it the more we realized no we're not embarrassed by these videos we love these videos we wanted other kids that watched our videos to see that really anyone can make it on YouTube and the cool thing is that we've heard from a bunch of kids that have said that our old videos remind them of the videos that they grew up making with their families anyway so that's why we never deleted our old videos because it was a part of us and it sounds stupid really but if we deleted the videos it would feel like deleting a part of ourselves and our memories really yeah sounds kind of cheesy but it's true maybe it is cheesy it's true though [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you liked hearing about how our channel got started and you want to read a complete history of blimeycow even maybe hear a song that me and Josh wrote together before any videos were made yes then you can go to blimey cow dot-com website or domain that squarespace.com slash cow [Music] thank you thank you [Music]
