move with Squarespace hi peep-peep hello human this will make more sense in a minute some of you may have noticed that lately I don't feel like painting waves honestly I started my whole channel with the intention of just using it to promote my wave painting so what happened I say it's really not that video I thought I would tell you guys because we're gonna be making some art today and it's not going to be waves so why not explain basically here's what happened when I was in high school my art teacher push me to do realism my mom loved it I got a ton of validation and I got a high from seeing my working crews but sometimes I felt this nagging desire to just make other things sketch weird creatures doodle paint random colors I always have a lot of fun doing it but I've also never considered it my real art I think on some level I'm afraid of branching out and have some subconscious idea that my art is only good or worthwhile if it's skillful in a traditional way but I want to push myself to try new things and not hold myself back and just see if I find something I love so today I'm going to make some art and talk about the dark side of being an artist scams ways we get tricked manipulated and squash the pond so let's enter the voiceover a magical land where you can learn from my mistakes welcome to the voiceover the first scam we're going to talk about is mailing scams about a year ago I got a letter saying I need to renew my web domain name this is a web address you type into your computer to reach a certain site for example Robin clonks calm or you-tube calm the letter specify to reply deadline and sent me all the paperwork I needed to fill out in order to not lose my domain so I was responsible and I took care of it immediately fast forward a couple weeks I saw my bank statements that I was getting charges from a company I didn't recognize it turns out I hadn't been renewing my domain with original company I registered it through like I thought I was and now I was paying substantially more to use my web address this company carefully worded their letter and to me it definitely appeared as if I was working with my existing company when in reality I was signing up for a transfer of the service and going to be paying a much higher cost when I called in to cancel I was upset I was very level-headed though and tried to be kind because they had my own e and I wanted to make sure they were willing to work with me and issue me a refund now the ancient I called is already extremely defensive and literally hung up the phone in a fit of rage I called back I talked to the same guy actually but I was able to cancel and I definitely learned a lesson from that next are sketchy contracts okay this is story to where I'm going to encourage you pay attention to your bank statements I guess this is just an overall lesson in adulting in general but it's important to remember so recently my husband asked about a high monthly charge he was seeing it was from my payment processor on my website so originally I didn't question it but as I looked back through statements I realized I'd gone from regularly charging me around $3 a month to $25 to $45 and then to almost $60 monthly I called the company and I had a bunch of transfers talked to multiple different people eventually I was told their contracts legally allowed them to change the monthly rates without any notification to customers which is exactly what they've done so I immediately cancelled the service but I was only able to get back a portion of the charges meanwhile now my shop page is down and I'm still looking into alternative ways to sell paintings and prints but I yeah learn from my mistakes and watch your bank account I wasn't planning on talking about this but while we're on the subject of contracts while I haven't had any bad experiences with us yet if you are making a commission for someone and it's above a certain pay grade right at the contract it seriously makes it so much easier for you you can just Google one online make any small alterations you need to fill it out so it specifically is detailing the information about the piece their contracting you to make it just makes things so much easier in the long and and gives them a way of knowing what the protocol is if things go wrong or if they need to cancel it it gives you some insurance if they decide they don't want it later anyways look into contracts for commissions I think it's super important okay this is my third story email scams okay I literally just scoured through my spam folder looking for an example to share with you guys and because I couldn't find anything I just started googling examples I saw coming up a very common theme something about how a person saw their wife had left up your website and they were interested in buying something for her and all of a sudden that just rang a bell in my head three days ago I got a scam email and I did not even realize it I got to be honest I thought I was kind of beyond the email tricks of scamming at this point so this is a good reminder to be on my toes but I'm just going to read it to you and I'm going to bleep out the random name they used greetings my name is blank from Ohio I actually observed my wife has been viewing your website on my laptop and I guess she likes your piece of work I'm also impressed and amazed to have seen your various works - you are doing a great job I'd like to receive further information about your piece of work and what inspires you kindly confirm the availability for immediate sales thanks and best regards okay the main thing that turned me off was definitely the word matching from the scam emails I was looking at examples of but my top tip for you guys if you are skeptical just immediately copy/paste your emails into Google and attach the word scam that's actually how I confirmed that this was a scale other things to look out for are number one vagueness about your work or about you as a person something showing they don't actually really know you aren't talking specifically to you you're just kind of a copy pasted email that they're sending out to other people with small alterations number two excessive grammatical errors you guys couldn't hear it from me reading it but there were tons of commas in very weird places lots of run-on sentences in this number three weird mistaken information a lot of the times for me it'll be like gender pronouns being wrong or they won't know anything about the type of work or details about the art I mean if you even look at the email I just got he said his wife has been viewing my website and that she likes my piece of work what piece of work are they even talking about does he you think I just have one artwork on my website and honestly right now because of the previous sketchy contract I had I don't even have artwork for sale on my website right now so that could be a tip-off right there too number four elaborate backstories I can't tell you how many emails I get was just super obvious because they're talking about how they won some large sum of money but they're serving in the military or they're living abroad and there's some Nigerian princess and they need me to hold their money for them for a while yeah usually that's a tip-off number five over payment this is a common way people try to scam you they will make it appear like they've overpaid you or they will overpay you and then they'll ask for money back and what ends up happening is they didn't actually send you good viable money or they didn't send you money at all and then they get your money back and you end up just paying them with no money from them and lastly number six if you just get the feeling something's too good to be true well that's kind of good indication sometimes but really at the end of it just Google just copy paste put the word scam and chances are you're going to find something about it if it is legitimately a scam hopefully this helps you guys avoid some of the mistakes that I made going through my artists career if you guys like this style of video make sure you let me know in the comments I'm definitely interested in making some more experimental types of work really trying to just figure out what I like the most about art and challenge my ideas about what my style is I hope you guys have a fantastic week and now a
