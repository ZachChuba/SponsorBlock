snow cones shaved ice slushies raspa kagegori patbingsu a million names for it around the world in a million variations but the basic concept is some form of pulverized ice that's flavored with some kind of syrup very easy and fun summertime dessert to make at home i'm going to show you a few simple ways of doing it without buying a dedicated ice shaving machine i'm only using gear that i already had at home fruit syrup whatever fruit you want into a pot these are cherries strongly flavored fruits like berries or citrus usually work best no need to pit or peel anything just throw in a little water at most enough to cover put the heat on high and the water is just there to keep the fruit from burning on the hot pan surface before it's had the chance to release its own water then you just boil the fruit until it starts to fall apart a delicate berry might just take a couple minutes cherries like these are more robust they took 20 minutes but you can help things along by taking a masher and just smushing things a bit if the pan never starts looking too dry too thick stuff might stick to the bottom and burn so put in a little more water i think you want the fruit just soft enough that you can easily press all the juice out of it but if you cook it for way too long it'll start to dull the flavor so when it's just soft pull it off the heat get yourself a bowl of some kind and a fine sieve on top pour everything in there and this is why we didn't have to worry about pitting or peeling anything all the solids are going in the trash though before they do i'll grab a stiff spoon and kind of grind them into the sieve you'll be amazed how much more juice you can get out this way now i'll take my little pot and rinse it out just to get rid of any chunks i don't want in my syrup back on the stove it goes and in goes the juice the quantity of sugar you want is up to you and will depend on how sweet the fruit already was how much water you did or did not boil out i think a roughly equal quantity of sugar is probably the maximum of what you'd want but be conservative you can always just taste and adjust later just bring that to a boil on high get everything dissolved and you'll know enough water has evaporated and you've got about the right sugar concentration when the bubbles start to stack on top of each other like that that's a light syrup right there pull that off before it bubbles over when it's cooled a bit you can very cautiously have a taste that's got enough sugar for me but i think it needs more acid so i'm going to supplement the cherries with lime juice remember we're using the syrup to flavor a completely flavorless substance water ice so by itself it should taste way too sweet and way too tart mason jars are great for storing this but pour it in whatever it probably should be covered and refrigerated to be safe and if you're in a hurry to use it the fastest way to cool it down is in a bowl of ice water just give it a stir every now and then now how do we make snow in our house let's try the food processor first dump in some ice cubes from the freezer and pulse it a few times very loud look inside as is typical for food processors there's a few large chunks that are spinning around and not hitting the blades you could just toss those out or keep pulsing it but beware eventually the rest of the ice will start melting in there put that into a little cup and pour in some of our cherry syrup it should look like not quite enough syrup at first because it'll keep slowly spreading through the ice as you eat that's tasty but the chunks are kind of big like tiny pebbles let's try the blender blenders are more narrow they have smaller blades and they often have ice crushing settings on them see that automatically pulses the blade very easy and there's no giant chunks escaping the blade that's got a finer consistency almost like natural snow that's definitely my favorite of the two options but what if you wanted something more like hawaiian shaved ice wide thin flakes well you could fill up a pan with water the wider the better throw that in the freezer for a few hours and when it's good and solid you get it out and it's time to shave the ice am i right now that wouldn't actually work but link's in the description thank you harry's and i have tried many implements for shaving ice like this but here's the clear winner a large steel chisel just remember whenever you cook with gear from the hardware store to wash it thoroughly first a tool like this comes coated in a non-food oil you just lightly scrape across the surface don't push too hard or you'll dig in and get big chunks it works even better as the ice starts to melt and the water serves as a lubricant on the blade look at that it's not as good as what you get from one of those ice shaving machines you can buy but those are still some pretty wide delicate flakes lauren was into it the thing about it is i always loved slush puppies as a kid yeah but they were so sweet that they made your teeth hurt and made you feel kind of sick and this is refreshing in the same way but way better okay let me give you some other ideas for flavors you could do kumquats delicious little citrus fruit originally from china a little more complex of a flavor than orange and more tart which is good for this and no need to peel or seed them or anything straight in the pan strawberries would be classic they're delicate so they'll cook soft really fast but to make their flavor a little more sophisticated i'll reach for rhubarb looks like celery tastes like bitter citrus classic complement to strawberries in dessert blueberries again they cook real fast and their pigment will be very intense in a syrup it might sound odd but i think lemongrass is a fantastic complement to blueberry chop it up and in it goes and here's a fruit that i normally avoid pomegranate i avoid it because it's such a pain to eat it's like the blue crab of the fruit world you got to tear through so much structural matter to get to those juicy little jewels inside and even when you do there's hardly anything edible on them like half the mass there is a seed at the center of each one but if we're just making syrup with them we don't have to worry about any of that that white stuff the mesocarb that can go into we'll just strain it out later with all the seeds a little water in each pot just to get them started heat on high bring everything to a boil those kumquats have a pretty robust skin on them so they'll definitely need some help from the potato masher go easy they will squirt on you cutting them in half before you put them in would accomplish the same goal those blueberry skins are surprisingly tough a little mashy mash same deal with the pomegranates and in contrast the strawberries turn to mush in just five minutes they're done strain and grind return to the rinsed pan don't let any of those get too dry if they get too thick and concentrated they'll stick to the bottom of the pan and burn in a flash keep them topped off with water blueberries strain and grind i swear that lemongrass works great with them return to the rinsed pan kumquats give those a really good grind to make sure you squeeze all the juice out of the skins back in the pan pomegranates good lord it's all seed i don't know how people eat these things poor yield again up to an equal quantity of sugar for each but be conservative you can always add bring them all to a boil get everything dissolved and when the bubbles start to stack up on themselves you have syrup give them all a taste remember that syrup can reach much higher temperatures than water so good lord blow on that spoon first the blueberry one really needs lime juice the strawberries need more acid too but i'm gonna use balsamic vinegar might sound odd but that's a classic pairing with berries really good by the way if any of these colors aren't quite as vivid as you were hoping for hey nobody has to know pour them all into your glasses and into the snow we go notice the syrup is a little thicker i refrigerated these overnight i find the colder syrup flows a little slower and therefore spreads more evenly instead of just falling to the bottom of the cup it'll keep working its way down gradually as you eat i think the kumquat one is probably my favorite but you know about me and acidity once you have these syrups you can do a lot of other things with them too mix them with an equal quantity of club soda easily convertible into a grown-up beverage drizzle them on pancakes dilute them with a bit of water and freeze them as popsicles go nuts or don't make any syrup at all and just pop open a can of sweetened condensed milk some people pour this on water ice some people use ice made of milk i think it's great either way and i like the korean way of doing it where they put lots of different garnishes in the cup that you can dose out in different combinations sweet cream cherries and snow that's a dessert a roman caesar would have eaten and for us mere plebs in the 21st century a dessert like this is arguably a lot better suited to the home kitchen than say ice cream hey have fun get creative and have a great rest of your summer
