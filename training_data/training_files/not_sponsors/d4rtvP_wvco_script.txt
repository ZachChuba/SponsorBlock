[Music] in the last episode i started killing corp and after upgrading my amulet and doing 50 kills i got both a spirit shield and a holy elixir including all the new items we got last episode as always the new net worth estimation is 599 mil so with the blessed spirit shield on the account i have my site set on two things right now a sigil obviously i mean it's been a long time dream of mine to own one of the three spirit shields on this account but i also want to jump into the inferno in the next episode and for that i'm gonna need a lot of gp for runes each inferno attempt is well over a mil in runecost so corp is the answer to that one drop of onix bolts is 1.5 mil gp alone so corp is my new home until i either get a sigil or have enough money for the inferno or both but corp wasn't the only place i planned to go this episode sponsoring this video your balls will thank you addy bars baby that's 350 adidas and uh 60 kill count too ah cannon ebola yes [Music] yes look at that on the ground dude it looks so nice actually give me like a mini heart attack so i just haven't seen orange text yet but uh i can pretty much just alk while i'm running to do specs and stuff like it should just be zero time getting all this money and that's 1.5 mil in alex the fact that i can get 1.5 mil from just one drop like that is sick it makes my life so much easier for the inferno no way what back to back back-to-back that's so nice to look at in the chat 1.5 mil 1.5 mil 3 mil and 2 kills it's like 40 minutes for 3 mil that's insane honestly i don't really know what my goal is money-wise i'm pretty much just gonna go until i feel like i have enough because obviously i don't know how many tries the inferno is gonna take me i don't know exactly how much i'm gonna spend on each attempt so i'm just gonna try to get a lot of money basically and if i need more i can always come back right or do something else i've been using just the canon bass recently i just set it outside the cave and that way if someone comes around they see the cannon base outside and they're like okay someone's in there i'm not gonna spec down the corp so saves my kills from getting sniped you know so pretty controversial decision i'm about to make here because uh i specifically grinded for this item and i'm about to drop it so i'm going to be dropping the aram skirt over to toby i don't have a second account uh that has membership right now so i'm going to give it to him and i've decided i'm going to be doing armor takeoffs for the inferno instead so that i have enough magic bonus to not splash and it i don't know i just the way i thought it out it turns out i don't really need much magic bonus armor-wise the kodai should be enough i might honestly regret this there's a good chance i regret this but hey spirit shield number two on 68 kill [Music] count honestly the more the merrier dude spirit shield number three and uh yes it's been a while man it's it's been a little while seeing that orange text again feels good it's another 1.5 mil to elk i went to bed that day with 93 corp casey and when i woke up i was invited to do some theater of blood i wasn't going to pass up the opportunity because this was going to be my first time doing tob with my new set of gear no more void i was now fully kitted out it was honestly a lot different having almost no space for general supplies and food with having so many pieces of gear and also noted potions in my inventory there was a lot of pressure to not make mistakes and that was pretty cool i completely ran out of food because i made like three bad mistakes on verzik it's been a while but thankfully my boy air ball clutched it out oh there was 165 kc let's see what we get since we got no purples ah not bad i actually need that out of your i'm like almost out of darts so and by mvp after only a few raids with the new gear pretty cool this should last for a while 880 darts it's not too bad i'm gonna go for either an item or 200 to be kc whichever comes first might need more darts if i get to 200 though well we'll see elite clue 500 blood runes oh my god purple in my name no way no way oh my god it's been so long dude it's been so long please just please don't be a dusty piece i beg i beg dude let's stop right there for a second and remind you what i've gotten from the theater of blood so far my first two items were just dish your legs and the justice your chest guard and this was the last purple i got on chest 132 please no let's open it yes yes yes oh my god finally finally dude an offensive upgrade something that isn't a chest plate or legs oh that's huge that's huge one of the things i wanted so badly it's just like it's such a beefy upgrade oh man that's looking good i'm getting so much closer to max strength bonus this is uh a massive step forward i mean i'm just so happy to get an offensive upgrade i guess i'm ending theater blood there for now i mean i did barely any but to leave with the avernick is amazing and i'd love to come back once i have my infernal cape done we're leaving within a vernick this is a win and a half gonna be having some quality of life upgrades with my raid supplies i've just been hoarding them and i'm gonna cut 250 of these rubies because i can get myself a mounted dig site pendant by turning them over to a guy in the museum thank you very much sir got the medallion there it is mounted dig site pendant so i have three teleports here now oh what okay so i didn't have like any location unlocked but it turned out i needed to use my digset pendant on some strange devices first but after like 10 to 15 minutes i had every teleport location on the pendant unlocked time to do some corp with the avernick it's actually a great upgrade for corp i should be hitting specs more often which is the bulk of the grind here so off to get more gp and hopefully a sigil i would simply love that for me so ah yes yeah there we go dude oh it's so nice seeing him on the ground another 1.5 mil to the inferno fund and that is a 100 corp casey very nice well uh we're uh almost a fifth of the way to the one in five hundred and eighty five sigil drop rate i do be cooking [Music] oh second holy elixir the hell do i do with this thing now i mean it's a 450k alec and the uh actually i think the blessed spirit shield is like 700k i think it's it's like 600 or 700k for a blessed spiritual this one is 450k there we go spirit shield i've been expecting you uh so i did look this up this is a 700k alk uh i don't know if i should alk it or just keep it on me for now in case i get a sigil i can just insta attach it uh but whenever i do decide to get rid of it that is 700k in one alk and it looks pretty freaking nice i love this thing i i can't wait to get an actual spirit shield a rare one man it's gonna be so sick hmm elite clue to go with my raw sharks i will absolutely try to do that let's see if we can complete it all right we got a casket see what it is all right worth it it just never gets old it just never gets old the orange text does freak me out though i'm not gonna lie like i i should probably change that but um it is nice to see it's very very satisfying it's another 1.5 mil so i just got my 163rd corp kill which was uh spirit shield as you can see i think the goal for now is just to hit 200 if i can get 200 corp kc i think i should be good for the inferno money-wise but i'm recording right now because i'm gonna go do a few trips of demonic gorillas real quick because i basically set myself a new side goal which is this final zenite i have three pieces of zenite jewelry right now and the only one i'm missing is the tormented bracelet and then i'd never have to go back to demonic gorillas again so i'm gonna do some now and then i'll do some after i get 200 corp kc or a sigil whichever one comes first tormented bracelet is a super good glove slot for magic it gives a ton of magic damage and accuracy so definitely one of my dream items to have and it's going to be so so worth it for raid so second kill back this is this same thing happened i was going for the torture except it was with a light [Music] frame nice oh beautiful making so much money dude actually making so much money it's beautiful corp is so good to me dude corp is so good to me i'm getting so lucky with these i'm getting disgustingly lucky i'm gonna actually teleport to my house real quick i had 10 mil when i started now i have 22 mil plus these bolts so it's basically like 26 mil that's that's tons of money for the inferno i'm just going to finish up 200kc and then uh do some demonic gorillas and that'll be it oh melones seeds and uh elite clue can it be done is the question all right we completed it let's uh give a bow and then open it yeah okay worth it any orange text enthusiasts beautiful man i've been missing alking i enjoy alking while running to do my specs so it's it's nice to have more bolts to elk all right 200 corp casey that was my goal for now unfortunately no sigil obviously i'm not even close to being done with corp but i'll do however much it takes to get a sigil about 200 is a nice milestone i'm gonna be up to 26 mil easily after outing all these bolts so this has been a massive success and uh i have so much gp i didn't even expect to get this much for uh for inferno but it's really cool seeing the guide value on this granted it is more than this because i have things in stashes in my house and stuff so it's over 600 mil but it is cool seeing the value number there before we hit up inferno as i was saying earlier i do want to do some demonic gorillas and see if i can get that last zenite i'm not expecting to but i'm going to do at least like 200 demonic gorillas or something see if i can get it and just be done with demonic gorillas forever so it would be really nice to have that tormented for chambers and theater blood and nightmare so a lot of things honestly so let's go try our luck see if we can get this last zenite and then it's uh off to the inferno got a very very simple setup i'm only doing two a switch but it's gonna be very comfortable i'm not really trying to sweat this out right now or anything and i'm not gonna be using arclight too much because i only have 700 charges left there and it was pretty butterfly though man look at this dragon med helm we take those looks so good it looks so freaking good this is what we like to see hard clue from demonic gorillas um oh my god no way no freaking way oh my god i'm done i'm actually done holy i'm blessed i'm actually blessed 22 demonic gorillas according to my rune light here what the hell dude my luck right now is just unstoppable my rng feels invincible man oh that's demonics done uh okay it's just under 1500 kc which is actually okay that's it's nothing crazy they're one in 300 so it's definitely definitely a fair kc but god damn does it feel to it just feels so good to have demonics done five billion chaos runes later and we have enough grab our final onix since i never need to buy another onyx again i'm just gonna fast sell all of the rest of my chaos runes third email cash stack now that's so nice if this doesn't get me through the inferno i guess i suck and stink but we'll see it's time baby it's time zenite bracelet there we go and enchant tormented bracelet we have every piece of zenite jewelry on the account now that is actually sick gives amazing bonuses mainly the five percent magic damage is what people really want from it but obviously other bonuses are good too give some prayer bonus too so i have that for both theater of blood raids zora whatever else uh nightmare since i'll be taking a bit of a court break i'm gonna make all of these adi bars into darts while they're in my inventory and that is all of them which puts me up to 2.6 k addy darts i absolutely want to use rune darts for the inferno but i want to learn with addie so that i don't waste my rune darts i was enjoying corp so much that i completely went against my word and did another 21 kills to get myself up to 221 corp kill count got some more onyx bolts along the way which was nice but ultimately i knew it was time to stop stalling we did over 50 hours of corp alone in this video and i decided that the next time i come back i wanted to have an infernal cape on my back i'll see you in the next episode
