hi i'm william and i'm 69 210 dollars and 32 cents in medical debt well it was fun while it lasted little willys but i'm gonna have to start selling all my stuff to pay this medical bill anybody want this ballistics gel hand from the garbage disposal video you want to buy this puzzle we're gonna do a little garage sale classic american insurance how about a laser baby a toy fire truck that was used to train julie neutron to put out fires add that to the pile this is one of the most prized possessions it's a george w bush top gun action figure i bought it at a swap meet like two years ago i guess i could get rid of these too a bunch of michael reeves merchandise that he abandoned and left with me about a bunch and they never sold it and then now they're mine every single michael reeves nut shirt i sell will be personally signed by me william thanks michael for helping me pay my medical debt i have an engineering degree electrical and mechanical and i would love to build my own medical equipment to prove that 69 000 is insane i could build my own medical equipment for way cheaper than that but i don't have time because i'm a slave to medical debt now i have to sell all my things i have to sell my friend's belongings i oh i forgot there's a new t-shirt too another cat warehouse product this was drawn by me and it's embroidered it's a cat pooping in a litter box and i'll sell anything i have in order to pay for this debt but right now i can't build my own medical equipment because i have more important things to do what are you doing huh what are you doing i'm digging a hole why it's a grave so that next time i get sick instead of going to the hospital i'll just die no why not what else are you gonna do with the body no we have medical insurance you don't need a grave your responsibility is two thousand four hundred ninety-one wait so i don't owe sixty nine thousand dollars no we have medical insurance whoa i'm only 2500 in debt instead of 69 000 that means we have plenty of time and budget to make an x-ray machine in the garage but i only have one question why did the hospital bill so much more money than they were ever paid the hospital tried to bill me sixty nine thousand dollars but only got paid eleven thousand dollars insurance steps in and says these nuts we're not paying sixty nine thousand dollars so that makes insurance the good guys right wrong billy boy the reason hospitals charge so much is because they know insurance is going to lowball them the problem is hospitals treat uninsured people the exact same way what you're supposed to do is the same thing that insurance does with hospitals you fight them you tell them no but i've done some research and i've learned that it costs us about 500 a month for each adult to be insured on a really good insurance plan plus 2 500 for a hospital visit that means this year i paid eight thousand five hundred dollars you know what cost a lot less than eighty five hundred dollars the sixty thousand volt power supply i got on ebay for four hundred dollars sixty thousand volts turning it on [Music] oh my god and for 155 dollars i got this x-ray vacuum tube that i pulled out of an old dental x-ray head bought on ebay i just had to drain a bunch of oil and rip off the broken high-voltage circuitry and bada-bing bada-boom got yourself a x-ray tube now i know some of you are probably thinking william you're not nearly responsible or smart enough to be playing with high voltage well i say to you pound sand i have health insurance and my will to do science is significantly stronger than my will to live no i'm just trying to say that i would rather do science and die than not do science all we have to do is get the high voltage out of the danger box and into the x-ray tube should be easy right i've got this red wire wired up to positive and this black wire wired up to ground and i'll just turn the power supply on and see what happens ready turn it on [Music] throwing it off hmm interesting none of our wires are touching so i'm not really sure why the electricity is not flowing through them let's try moving this wire a little bit further away and see what happens all right turning it on again huh that's not right either welcome to the world of high voltage where everything's a wire and you're probably gonna die okay i have an idea if you look right here this resistor that was a part of the high voltage supply and it's kind of leaning a little bit over the tube so let's let's i hate touching this let's just move that this way all right and now we're turning it on oh yeah oh yeah you can hear it hissing i really want to get the microphone over there but i'm scared of frying it all right let's turn the box off ow ow why is this shocking me this is the box it's not arcing not big arcs at least which means we're on the right track so now we need to work on the next step which is turning the tube on we actually need two power supplies because up until this point we haven't actually been making any x-rays that's what this power supply is for this is just a regular power supply we don't need high voltage here we need to activate a filament which is kind of like a little light bulb in the back end of the x-ray tube the filament boils off electrons which then get launched to this piece of heavy metal this copper color thing right in the middle and then that ejects x-rays through this aperture at the bottom of the container let's go ahead and hook this bad boy up according to the x-ray tube data sheet the filament ground should be right here i guess we'll just plug it in and see what happens let's do 3.5 volts and we're going to turn our current all the way down so it's current limited and then as i turn the current up we should hopefully see something happen no i'm an idiot i had the pro hooked under the piece of wire insulation and not the wire itself slowly increase the current [Music] oh you see it glowing oh that's so cool okay oh that's awesome all right i'm going to turn it off now little willys we're about 30 seconds away from making x-rays all we have to do is turn both power supplies on at the same time but before we do that we need to take some safety precautions because here on the william osmond channel safety is our number one priority i bought two radiation detectors i bought a giant roll of lead sheet metal and i'm gonna repurpose parts from the dental x-ray head to protect some of my most valuable assets the geiger counter is directly underneath personal geiger counter is going in my belt we're going to turn the small power supply on with the current all the way down turning the high voltage on and then we're going to slowly increase the current you hear it what is that [Laughter] the geiger counter is very angry with us this is a good thing it means we made x-rays in the garage we made x-rays let's celebrate with an ice cream cone when you wear some temporary clothes for a system oh ten oh you're closed okay thank you this is so sad all right good for you could i get an ice cream cone i'm so sorry we actually don't have shakes or ice cream right now do you have pies unfortunately no we do have chocolate chip cookies though we're generating x-rays but we still need to capture the image that's what this intensifying screen is for can you guess where i bought it we can create an image with the phosphor screen when we run x-rays through it they turn into visible light in the phosphor and that visible light can then be measured by us with either a camera or with a piece of film so if we stick our phosphorous screen on the ground below the x-ray generator and we put four soda cans on top of it and then put this piece of acrylic on top of that and then we put a subject like maybe real human finger bones cast in ballistics gel and when we blast x-rays through it we should see this film glow with the shadow of finger bones cast on it that's cool that tell me that's not cool let's fire off some x-rays right now and see if we can get the sheet to glow at all it might be too bright in here i've set the a7s to a 15 second shutter at 64 000 iso all right high voltage on all right i think we got a picture oh look at this we totally have an image that is so cool the contrast is really bad but i wonder if we can fix that in photoshop that is this is awesome i think this is really amazing i mean this is an actual x-ray of real human bones this is my magnum opus the most dangerous contraption i have ever built it's an actual working x-ray machine made out of garbanzo beans baked beans canned tuna new england clam chowder a piece of leaded glass an intensifying screen a broken dental x-ray head and a power supply that came out of a college lab and has been beaten to the brink of death there's something i want to talk to you guys about safety and the relative nature of it because i can already feel the safety nerds two feet up into my butt and i'm gonna lose it this is dangerous but it's not that dangerous have you ever been in a car have you ever gone to the doctor and gotten an x-ray have you gotten a ct scan dear god let's talk about the amount of radiation exposure you get from a ct scan and what is radiation x-rays do statistically increase your odds of getting cancer later in life statistically if you keep your exposure to a minimum you are perfectly safe this is why x-rays are allowed for medical purposes and the small number of stray x-rays that do end up leaving the setup and hitting me or anybody near here are nothing compared to getting on an airplane getting a ct scan getting an x-ray or just living your life and being exposed to background radiation that being said i'm still gonna put this iron dome around the whole thing because it's gonna look sick oh my god william is that lead that is really dangerous oh my god is that a safety nerd safety nerds are annoying think of all the scientists that died over our history of doing science those are the only ones you think about those are the only ones they tell you about in school are the cool scientists who died doing science no one ever talks about the safety nerds the iron dome is in place this means it is time to turn on the x-ray machine there's no way x-rays are going to get through these gaps or this channel on the side i cave to the safety nerds i put warnings on it let me show you hopefully this makes it really clear that it's dangerous and you need to stay away from it we got real x-ray machine the radiation warning symbol if it's a hissing x-rays it's a pissin and finally a little something for people who have no idea what radiation or x-rays is protecting my gut look at look how ferocious the dogs are they'll take one look at those bad puppies first let's turn it on make sure that it actually works i haven't turned it on since i said all this stuff around it got my personal dose meter going it keeps turning off i'm not sure if i'm using it wrong or if it's broken uh whatever interesting the extras seem to be leaving the shield that's a bad sound it's popping to a can of beans damn it why are the beans so close to the high voltage this is getting ridiculous fix the problem had to replace the metal bean cans with cardboard boxes it kept arcing from i think what was happening i think that basically the sound you hear is like electrons kind of going into the air and they collect on things and i think they collect on the bean cans and then they are from the bean cans to ground i'm pretty sure that's what was happening so i tried grounding them that didn't work i just replaced it with something that doesn't hold electrons as well as bean cans what's the first thing we're gonna put inside the x-ray machine how about my actual cell phone recording a video goodbye the camera's set up i'm gonna turn the lights off now i'm gonna get my flashlight i'm not getting shocked nearly as much i think that the uh the lead is eating all the electron this is a good good news okay let's see how this looked oh my god oh that's amazing oh it's so much better whoa that's so good holy crap you can see the battery you can see the camera you can see the circuitry that like wraps around the battery this is so cool i wonder what the video on the phone looks like [Music] we made an x-ray machine in the garage that takes pretty good pictures for only a couple thousand dollars that includes the camera too that i'm borrowing all right what else could we put in there come in caretaker there's nothing to fear it's nice in here oh boy are you excited oh i can't go to bed why it's like two in the morning you'd rather go to bed and see a really cool x-ray machine i've been up for 20. okay you know what come here come here come on over come on over let me introduce you to what lives in our garage now this way so you see look at this box does this look safe no why not if it's a hissing x-rays it's a business [Music] you're so good at english okay what do you want x-ray find something x-ray i don't i don't know what foot do you want to extract my hand is it safe yeah all right do you know what to do no you see the switch right here you've literally told me nothing look at this look at this see the switch when i tell you to you're gonna flick that switch on okay you got it you're like a pro the microphone on the camera died but we were successful in getting an x-ray of a hand i cannot believe how good it looks we did it team we showed the medical industry who's boss it's us thank you for calling how can i help you hi i have a question how much does an x-ray cost if i don't have any insurance um so it can go from 170 up so 170 is just the initial visit with the doctor and then x-rays are more it's about 70 um each um site okay so if i if i need to get like my hand x-ray that would be like 250 dollars maybe 300 maybe or it could be higher i just can't really say until you come in okay what would make it go up um 300 potentially or more i bet you you could leave urgent care with a bill about the same price as i built this machine for i'm not gonna get all political because i think everyone should build their own hospital in their garage the price is right i don't see why we can't just build our own equipment we got the internet how hard is it to find a broken bone and an x-ray i think it's pretty easy a long time ago i used to do all the cooking in the house because chelsea come here because chelsea had no idea how to cook ever every time she was hungry she would make what would you make when you were hungry beans tacos she would take a can of refried beans and this was like 10 years ago anyways uh this video is sponsored by hellofresh which we've actually been using for the past two years it is a meal delivery system where they deliver you all the ingredients you need already pre-portioned to make awesome meals everything takes i think like 40 minutes or less i've got some meals that are even faster and they've got a lot of stuff now for summer specifically that doesn't require use of an oven because the oven can make your house way hotter why do you do hello fresh instead of just going to the grocery store oh i use hella fresh at the grocery store for all my meals i don't use it for every single but i use it for the majority because i get overwhelmed like coming up with like exciting things to make i'll just make the same thing over and over so it's making me try new things and i don't have to go to the grocery store when i'm feeling lazy and i just get home who's a better cook you or me what define i'm a better cook now i think you're a more creative cook oh thank you hellofresh offers a wide variety of meals they even have vegetarian options right now i'm cooking the chicken pecan royale for this recipe everything is cooked in the same oven at the same temperature to make it super easy prepping cooking and cleaning all took less than an hour how was my cooking go
