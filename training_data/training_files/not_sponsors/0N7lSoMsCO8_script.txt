bloody hell are we still doing these lootcrate ham damn these for a while and frankly I've got two new crates and another box knockin around and I just kind of want to get them out of the way cuz I think we're moving over monthly to the wish calm stuff now I think these have had their day they're kind of going away now blue crate still lives on and there are various other ones but you know they're not quite what they once were anyway let's open up and find out if the contents were what they once were segue guys it is all over lost in space spaceship lot going on look look we've got space boy space girl space dog and the coffin they will all die in and then just float around in space rotting forever because that's how space travel works at least it does if you've apparently made a spaceship out of an old bucket right what do we got what do we got guys have we got stuff I hope so we have office but I've had this t-shirt before in something the office space t-shirt did it come in a loot crate as if it did I've got it again yeah it's well if you've seen this video for like is the red stapler there's a reference how bizarre I mean it's yeah it's a loot crate branded loot we're exclusive so I must have had this before they look right oh well it's two of them now actually I gave the other one to somebody else what if they want a second one well so we got we've got an alien something now we're talking and they even bag helium washcloths do what John what why a wash cloth well that makes useful you can wash your cloths with it yeah it's got a kind of microfiber thing a lot of people can't stand the touch off and yep that's a bigger wall facehugger kind of looks like a massive pair of distant a testicle smear so that's always nice and knowing HR Giger probably on purpose oh those that pictures coming away already on the where it's been folded yeah oh well what's next then we've got a small book a Jupiter 2 mission lock now that is lost in space I don't know if this is a reference to the 60 series this one or these recent Netflix thing they did watch and it was right not really gonna watch me more their 24th mission it's at literally an empty blank book for you to write all your thoughts in like washcloths next up pin ok pin school they really did start locking these pins out of the park like a year or so ago didn't they used to be just like their logo and crap like that and Moon naff writing on now they're just really nice designs look it's a rocket it's gone around a moon moon's made a cheese rocket isn't and that's how Rockets work I hope some astronomers watching have their made a notice of that and can put that in their work going forward and finally Captain Marvel 3d Comic Standing okay color me interested Captain Mountain one of the better Marvel films only one of the better would recall its origin ones ask the powers although I quite like Thor most people don't and Captain America First Avenger as well a lot of people didn't know people like Captain Marvel yet it's a solid one didn't do anything too amazing and introduce quite a lot of the cosmic bits and bobs which was nice you don't really piss me up right this is totally irrelevant but you know there's that bit in right spoilers for Avengers endgame incoming we've all seen it now so there's the bit where Captain models been gone blah blah she comes back during the fight sequence oh my god something's coming that comes captain Mallory like oh my god I've just realized they've set up the fact that she's been off on all these other planets were obviously half the people there have been wiped out as well isn't just earth you know it's like everybody universe wide phenomenon so she's been off with him oh my god she's gonna bring back like a massive Armada of ships from all these other planets in order to [ __ ] up Thanos now she literally comes back and Ron I mean I know that's cheaper to do but don't set it up if you're not gonna do it guys Deary me how cool would that have been seriously would have been amazing and also it you know left with the slightly unpleasant aftertaste that apparently no other planet in the [ __ ] universe gave a [ __ ] a few people's dead yeah but we ain't gonna get on fight--the an awesome he's got a funny stick with a knife on each end you know it's a poor old Captain Marvel is to come back and do a segue right after that that's definitely a thing it's it's an oddity because when they do this kind of thing with perspective and then 3d so kind of perspective where things are small cuz they're far away works in 2d but now you've got the 3d so it she kind of looks like her she's got tiny weird legs and a funny arm coming out of a boob not entirely sure this concept works which is a pity because it's nicely sculpted and put together decent design as well oh well oh look at my list of people who like my Captain Marvel particularly also if they want it but it's it's a funny looking thing and no mistake oh well at least it's an original thing and it's nicely done well we got the box this one was apparently so who's familiar with Only Fools and Horses Kosmic hmm well not missing anything Oh mystery cosmic tea comes equipped with a lute a favorite t-shirt or in other words one you've had before blimey well that's a thing innit and what's going on here there's something else there's just like a Captain Marvel very thin poster it's a funny size as well so you can really get frame for it well they're getting smaller and smaller really I'm though you can't really argue that I wonder what the next one's gonna be like quickly sudden jump cut before there's a 30-day money-back guarantee anyway sponsored bit ends so this one I think is the more recent one probably let's have a look hang on this is got the same box as the last one that's have I been sent two of the same one what's going on here this is very odd right so we've got I've had this Jurassic Park t-shirt before as well 100% definitely and there's another 3d comic standing from Marvel what's going on like have they said the same no way the other stuff look this is different this is like two energy people having a scrap in the sky you know like at the end of the very disappointing Matrix Revolutions and there's also a a bag with some bent necklace is this a different craze and I'm very confused well let's just look at the items and we'll come back to whatever loot crate giving us in here I'm genuinely intrigued this is it having keys that would be cool old metal straws ah yes because of course sort of plastic straws and now Satan's bum hole and frankly the soul paper straws again I'm really much better environmentally either so you can reuse these metal straws Tony sure how you wash them from the inside a very thin buckle brush maybe no idea oh that's that's potentially useful things literally just lootcrate branded as well they couldn't get a some kind of licensing deal to put I don't know Alf and welcome back kotter onto these hey there's a reference to the older Americans but where the hell did that come over my head they called themselves out the Sweathogs John Travolta was in it see I've never seen it obviously because you know I am too young and B I'm not in the country where it was a thing but there we are I'd you know how I learnt about well Welcome Back Kotter seeing the action figures of it an action figure encyclopedia Tomas yeah that's a story for you right the Avengers 3d comics dandy so this is kind of off the back of the last one this list hmm cut open that's also done that anyway what's it which Marvel person is this is bloody Captain America looking like he's squatting for a poem on you getting that kind of weird perspective thing look he doesn't leg and a tiny arm like you can't force perspective like that when it's actually 3d very hot look at that blobby paint on old Iron Man there yeah that's that's a physical items in my hand oh wait it's on the floor now having any knocked the camera over right for range facility use only Battlestar Gallactica 75 command issue ranked service so is this the more recent Battlestar Galactica or is it the classic one the more robotic types what is actually in there a couple of these things hmm intrigue just want these off oh it's like a Cylon blueprint or suddenly no it isn't it's a Cylon target and it's the design of this all-male metally Cylons from the more recent series so yeah so you can shoot to your pellets at it in some manner okay and there's is this exactly the same yes yes it is and wow that's wow don't worry we've got this Godzilla king of the monsters and soap king of the box office because the film's a bit [ __ ] apparently bit of bit of cardboard no Warner wait there's multiples there's not this one nice picture yeah yeah yeah can we get into it this is the question then nobody cares about and yet the answer is yes yeah I do quite like genuinely quite like that picture and I mean if you've sort of ignored that bit of the bottom it's a nice picture of Godzilla that's a get or a king ghidorah well that's that's quite interesting there on the more traditional Japanese Stoli Oh yep there he is being all evil through the 65th anniversary of Godzilla what do they call them in Japan good jira I don't know I think I'm wrong on that well I'm sure you can violently abused me in the comments if I'm not and you probably will anyway right that's that's er that was quite nice I suppose you'd have more together couldn't you just kind of need a paper cutter to get rid of that go down you then you never have to think about that film again and speaking over never thinking about things again yeah that's the end of that showdown April 2019 other mystery Teague is apparently they're not making t-shirts anymore they're just sending your old ones out of the warehouse repeating that sort of I different loss exclusive Aquaman challenge coin where where is this thing I want my Aquaman challenge coin how else will people know have challenged Aquaman and one note that's missing oh good is it not here somewhere well we won't be featuring the Aquaman challenge bit down I do like the metal coins as well you know but there we are it's got the protector of the deep on one side is archrival and super villain evil Ken on the sorry Black Manta on the other we're betting this is going to make an excellent addition to your DC coin collection I like the fact that you think I've got a DC coin collection but I certainly don't now because they'd only have one coin and that's not in there um it's a little crate showdown which classic loot of favorites did you get oh no don't tell me these are old as well oh [ __ ] son so those pants that glekas son on target pose a bit out before I don't remember that much of they're so boring I probably wouldn't anyway or it could be Star Wars number one comic year I do remember that being in one holy [ __ ] so kind of st. boxes last time t-shirt from the warehouse missing coin oh well that's probably just made on Godzilla art print set that's at least new although it's just an art print the pins nice and repeated other stuff from the West they're just sending you the old stuff these days I think that how the are you in trouble guys because this is getting a bit cheap now isn't it and I think perhaps yeah the twilight has fallen on the world of the subscription box and even the mighty loot crate seems to be proper feeling it now well I shall go and use my metal the metal straws mentioned on that No so I've been sent metal straws instead of the challenge coin that's intriguing gonna be honest the metal straw was more useful so I'm quite happy with that hooray there was a happy ending for everyone except evil Ken it's amazing it's a mystery it's the amazing mystery box do you see what I did there I just said those words but in a more dramatic fashion and string hair a bit yeah so this is my subscription box from Norwich I believe in the old United Kingdom here where I live myself and basically it's sort of stuff that's slightly older pop culture stuff they just give you like a massive box of it for your money so this time apparently I've been sent a game of Thrones box it's all Game of Thrones stuff is a game of Thrones has of course ended now with yeah I mean a lot people didn't like the ending I thought it's a bit drawn-out because you know it's quite slow running series but like the last half of the last season the entire final series were so slow paced also I'm totally lying they ruined it but I was rushing through it everyone saying it but everyone is right for once it's a bit of a shame it really is yeah it feels like the writers got the job at Disney for doing Star Wars and just like rights sake of this now well it's knock it out somebody said to me actually that they were actually offered another series of Game of Thrones to sort of Pat it in there right now no it's not happening because they both speak like that now and nobody knows why anyway Game of Thrones then what have we got God a lot of plastic that's interesting Oh most of its actually in there - okay yeah as packaging that makes sense right we have a game II throw no t-shirt oh it's got all your favorite houses on look how stark with their famous motto summer's gone now that's bad innit House Lannister with their famous motto cashes ours house Baratheon with their famous motto our hearts hurt House Targaryen with their famous motto we're all a bit mental watch out watch was that that's house number the name all the ones with the AH that's gonna ignore me jibber weland's one of them healthy Allen's another Greyjoy that's it house Greyjoy with their famous motto we Nick everything that's house ah what's that called that's gonna bug me with the woman with the creepy son or was she creepy she was creepier than to say cut the sudden had you didn't see the sudden character like several series he came back the last episode and he's like grown up and looks like his own dad now it was amazing mmm Aaron there we are we got there in the end house Aaron with their famous motto I'll kick you down the moon door what's that that is house I actually don't know I don't know what that means off the top of the head because that one's but it's that one's Baratheon there's no so what's that one house dancing bastard with their famous motto we speared a deer our house Bolton of course with their famous motto the dogs ate my son that is why they called that's gonna annoy me now I'm doing very bad remembering these names top of my head that was the one that you had the Queen of thorns and all that on the night of flowers Tyrell Tyrell yes house Tyrell we got there and their famous motto we're all dead now and finally that's the ones from dawn is now I'm not gonna member the name of those unfortunately with their famous motto our plot lines are pointless and there we are that's a game of Thrones t-shirt I feel this would have been a really nice one to have had but before everyone lost interesting paper throw we've got set of force digital short glasses look at that we do not so hear me roar fire and blood winter is coming interesting very interesting I don't actually have any shot glasses so now I do and see what they're like nice I'll bang them on my teeth like I know what I'm doing yeah they're really nice shot glasses right I'm very happy with that yeah don't really care if they've got him thrown stuff on or not they are useful for the drinking of the shot oh my god I use one of these books all the time I got all of these before now some sort of subscription box the night is dark and full of errors and you can write those errors down here and complain about them later I use one of these to keep school and we're playing board games and stuff and now I spare that's tremendous is a really really nice book Oh less interesting house sigil magnet set ours is oh that's Baratheon's the dancing so what's the one in the heart oh that's gonna run oi me now oh don't care enough actually do you know what it is it's the one that rushed the ending that's all I'm gonna remember now a game of Thrones and so yeah you can peel those off stick them on your fridge taking off your fridge put them back on the fridge again have a sandwich taken off the fridge put him back on the fridge hey the choice is yours there's a mug the mug is oh good god there's a ton of a wall of text and Jon Snow not the newsreader night gathers and now my watch begins it shall not end until my mug is rotated until my death I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children I shall wear no crowns and win no glory I shall this is someone to read I shall live and die at my post I am the sword in the deer I can't be bothered with anyway it's somebody who's very lonely that's about all we need to know really it's probably a system operator or something but yeah it's a mug it's nicely printed I'm not entirely sure about old kit harington's face on that it's a bit sort of stretched and odd and there's a lot of text that's very difficult to read so that's fun hold liquids though yeah these are these are literally in there these are top shrimps that's interesting at least used to protect Top Trumps when they're being sent or something there's two other actual items in there oh my god they're like part work figurines like from D'Agostino you're the eagle moss or something like that does it say on them a fresh shot HP air license Rose eagle Moss these ones there we are so yeah this is like free bar endure with part two you know that kind of thing it is a white Walker what white walkers do a pound E is just hanging around behind their box and then explode so that's nice [Applause] no it's not really good upload god I got the silver on the bass it's gone all up on the feet um all these are not good it looks a bit like Bill Nighy so that's amusing but yeah it's kind of the wrong car though I kind of had a blue tinge or as these are entirely gray and the paint is really sloppy and sculpting is not bad but yeah not massively impressed with that and now we have all what are the sons of the harpy the creepy buggers in the front masks these work quite well on the programmer come on out you come out you come that's very pastel II colored very past early comment and oh my god I can feel the toes with all the just the sandal is the pain is just slopped on they're not the greatest sculptors head'll it's very thin the mask looks too small this yeah there's a pretty good hmm well if that sort of stuff floats your boat you can actually put in a code and get a third figurine I believe if you do order one so that that is a thing I'll put that in a description somewhere um yeah blimey that's a lot of Game of Thrones stuff really I really like the book I really like the shot glasses the mugs okay the figurines aren't quite up to snuff yeah it's all right innit originally this stuff would have probably cost you a million to billion pounds but I do get the feeling that the game of Thrones merchandise is gonna drop in price somewhat following the final series cuz I mean when these things end anyway the interest tends to wane but as it was one of these sort of final things that didn't really appease anybody that's probably not gonna help that is it anyway winter is stark hear me Lannister some scallion Florida border [Music]
