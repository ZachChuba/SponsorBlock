hey groupies welcome back to form therapy this is the culture study on the channels video producer and your host you can call me PD and today on the culture study we are checking out oopsey by Ricky Mickey months after their recent comeback with dazzle dazzle Wicky Mickey's back now I do want to preface because we had numerous a lot of people frankly asking me to check out dazzle dazzle by Wicky Mickey now when I don't check out something sometimes it's usually because we just too busy and we get swamped and there's a lot of videos that come out or sometimes it's because especially if it's a group that I really like it's because I did not like that release and unfortunately with dazzle dazzle I did not like that music video and that comeback just did not work for me and I just have a policy of not releasing reactions for things that I don't like and if there's like it's one thing to provide critique and I provided a lot of critique in that video but also at the same time if there's just nothing for me to latch on to that I like I also feel like I'm not I'm not a professional critique er you know I just do this on YouTube and so I don't want to release a video that's just all critique you know because this channel is called forma therapy it's about providing people with some kind of a break from life and watch something and have fun and celebrate the things that we love together and so if I don't love something or if there's not something that I like even if it's constructive criticism I don't honestly think it's worth releasing and so that's why I did not release a reaction video for dazzle dazzle now if you're watching this and it's public that means I did like it so here's hoping now this video wiki Mickey but I guess we're about to find out aren't we let's get into this video this is oopsie by wiki McGee and this is your former therapy the bouncy synth [Music] [Music] No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it looks like based on just like their haircuts and their outfits they're trying to at least with this comeback showcase them in a more mature light now let's talk about this video um I will say I do not like the music video once again that's an unfortunate miss but I do like the song I don't think the song is perfect I think I think in terms of wiki McGee's title tracks like they have way better title tracks than this and I feel like I feel like there is an inherent problem which I do want to address and so I I do plan on releasing this video because I definitely do like it but I think there is a money issue going on I think they are scaling back the level of music producers I think they are scaling back their video video production budget because video wise that is two for two I am NOT a fan of these music videos they very very much look underfunded I think oopsie is my Jew the video wise I think if you're the comparator tet2 tasseled as I think oopsie is way better and it makes better use of it's a very small budget but I would say that it still doesn't hold hold up to their usual standards and I know that fantagio has their label has had a lifting a problem over the years and I was hoping they would have settled it by now but I don't know exactly what's going on and I think the song - I think the song itself I do like the crux of it I do like what it's going for I do like the eye I like everything about it here's the problem I like everything about it it needs more though I feel like they could have added way more to the song I think they could have added a much more interesting bridge maybe something that's slightly a little bit longer I think maybe in the structure they could have switched it up a little bit more in the verses but I do I do think that this sound actually like it's still even even though it's like I feel like it's not as complex enough I do see the wiki Mickey sound there I do see the wiki Mickey sound and that's why I like it you know it's very unfortunate because I really like what he make here as a group I think picky picky was one of the best songs of last year one of the best pop songs of last year but I feel like we were having a budgeting issue here if you look at even let's say was it called tiki-taka like I didn't like tiki-taka as much as picky picky and I'll never like judge a group because against their best song you know I'm just more it's more of a comparison but even tiki-taka which you know was I feel like not as big a music video is picky picky while it wasn't as good of a song as picky picky I don't hold that against it like the song doesn't feel under budget the music video doesn't feel under budget but this one does and that makes me feel very sad inside washing this as someone who is who's an appreciator of this group I will say I think they did a much better job here I think music video at least tries to go for a lot more interesting shots I just feel like stylistically they went with this because it's probably the cheapest most minimal option they can go for like go ahead and take a look at this it's it's very very minimal but I also feel like it doesn't suit the song I feel like the songs upbeat it's fun and if they added in like they've got some elements where it feels a little fresh but I think they're also missing sanella it's like the tone of this song doesn't necessarily I feel like compliment the concept they're going for visually here and I feel like visually they only went for this concept because it's cheaper to produce see I ordinarily this kind of shot take a look this kind of shot is very cool very dramatic I just feel like in the context of this music video it might feel slightly unmotivated I mean I think what we're gonna have to do we are gonna have to look up the lyrics for this song you know most and and this is why music videos are important because the music video should convey the tone of the song properly but sometimes the lyrics might not fit the tone of the song so we're going to we're going to see if at least lyric wise this is more appropriate let's see turn on the light and we could be like yeah ready you see how does have one um I knew your Pancham we got that we got that Budhan be zinganna boom chin done they're gonna I beg you do love no no no come join a roller coaster an echo no I don't think there's any okay so after looking at the lyrics I don't think there's anything in the lyrics that necessarily justifies this music videos so I think largely why I don't like this music you know is that it feels largely unmotivated by its themes and its shots [Music] [Music] yeah I mean this feather the crystal ball you John was holding it just heals all greatly unmotivated it's like why I think probably the most impressive set is this set I think this is the set that they put the most into but this set is also they're just reusing they're putting so they're you they're putting the projection of that light but if you cut to this it's the same dance set and if we and in and let me see let me see yeah even until the ends they use the exact same dance that they're filming the bridge section here they're filming everything here they're filming everything here that is one of the biggest indicators that the budget is extremely low on this music video I feel like there's gotta be there's is they're not even one change one no the entire dance portion I think is filmed here and then why and then all the other shots of them as well it's also a blank canvas so that that could have been shot either here or nearby somewhere so none there there is no real set change and it's honestly almost criminal I feel like this music video is just this music video is largely boring and that is a God dang shame because this song deserves a lot better and wiki Mickey preserves a lot better you know I you know it's very it's it's not often I upload videos like this where my critique is harsh usually when my critique is harsh I don't like the product but I like the song I like the song and I like what he make it a lot so I don't know what exactly is going on with Fantasia but you know on this channel I like to be honest even if it's brutally honest and I'm thinking that wiki Mickey fans deserve something better and they need to be demanding something better I don't know what this financial situation is over in Fantasia I don't know what they're going through but all I can say is Astros knock video while simple dares was also a very simple aesthetic was still produced better than this so and the Astros in the same label as Fantasia so I'm just saying I feel like there is some sort of an imbalance here that needs to be addressed but guys those are my thoughts on the video please you know don't
