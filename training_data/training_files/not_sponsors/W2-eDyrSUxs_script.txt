I'm not afraid of intimacy are you crazy how can I be afraid of intimacy when the internet calls me the Taylor Swift of YouTube um I'd like to be excluded from this thread shut up but in working with the dating coach I know I know it sounds extra spark but it's been really helpful so just to spend your judgement I've found that most of her principles actually deal with the self so though you'd think a dating coach is someone who would help you answer texts or work on her online dating profile she mostly focuses on all of your and emphasizes working on yourself to accept love from someone else hey you're great like you I look I love you okay bye and when the issue of intimacy initially came up I almost laughed it was like oh no intimacy is something I deeply crave trust me I have no commitment issues and then she was like oh really well do any of these sound like you dismissing someone on the first date because of no chemistry sleeping with someone too soon feeling bored when the other person does everything right being nitpicky about small things feeling intensely about the other person right away and therefore projecting onto them and choosing unavailable men ah you know maybe maybe like one of those and these specific symptoms of being afraid of intimacy usually stems from you guys did children a lack of self-worth when someone is treating us nicely and things are going well to the person with no self-worth it feels unfamiliar and strange pain is what we know abandonment is what we know longing tension anxiety those are all of our feelings associated with love not things being easy flowing and joyful no I'm not suffering I'm clearly not in love and if you like me felt personally attacked by these six signs know that love does not feel like we think it should because our associations are wrong the beginning shouldn't be intense that is a red flag that we're buying into our idea of a person and not who they actually are chemistry can develop as you get to know them and dismissing them off the bat disallows that it takes a while to get to know a person and those nitpicky things that annoy you now may be overshadowed by the amazing qualities the person has to offer and sleeping with someone releases the chemical in women to him a bond so if you do that before you really know a person you shouldn't be surprised when you wake up and discover you're in love with a narcissist you know the photo honestly I was really surprised that I have fears of intimacy I mean given my history of being like a serial monogamist I would have guessed that my problems were probably from a lack of self-worth but surprise I am afraid of intimacy and I have problems of self-worth yes children yes I have the best of both worlds baby but the good news is that once you're self-aware like most things you can actively begin combating these fears if intimacy and a real relationship are what you really want then you can start taking note of all of your actions and your patterns and ask yourself am i making these decisions because the other person genuinely isn't right for me or am I afraid of developing an authentic connection with this human being so stop sabotaging your love life because as much as we think we don't deserve love we do keep working on it I'm Anna Akana and I I'm Anna Akana and I love myself use the offer code Anna for 10% off at checkout
