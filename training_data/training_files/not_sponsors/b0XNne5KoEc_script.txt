Hey so this is an attenuation of the last video on communicable diseases and this time we're focusing on the little  that are bacteria but just to refresh quick communicable diseases are caused by pathogens and a pathogen is a microorganism the causes of disease there are four main types of pathogens so we've got viruses bacteria fungi and protists so bacteria can be pathogens but it's important to remember they're not all bacteria pathogenic some bacteria are good bacteria and help you out a lot especially those found in your gut but the bacteria that you should be somewhat worried about can damage cells directly or produced toxins that damage tissues because bacteria are colorless and usually invisible to light microscopy colorful stains have been developed to be able to see them the most useful in the Gram stain which separates bacteria into two groups gram-positive and gram-negative this stain also shows whether the bacteria is around a row shaped so the bacteria is stained and cells that appear blue are called from positive and those that appear right after the same process are called gram-negative the different stains are the result of differences in cell walls of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria the gram positive bacteria generally allow substances that damage the cytoplasmic membrane such as antibiotics dyes and detergents to pass through but the gram-negative bacteria have a cell membrane made up of lipopolysaccharide which blocks the passage of these substances to the interrupted or blackened cell wall so antibiotics and chemicals attempt to attack the package alike a cell wall such as penicillin sun lysozyme are labeled faster and even though the peptidoglycan layer is thicker and gram-positive bacteria they are more receptive to antibiotics and gram-negative due to the absence of the outer membrane so basically gram positive bacteria have one membrane while gram-negative bacteria have two membranes and so bacteria are classified into these two broad categories in addition bacteria can come in various shapes including round or odd shaped cocci are around and best there are six classic gram-positive bacteria that can cause disease in humans and basically every other organism is gram negative so the gram positive lot include the eyes like streptococcus staphylococcus Listeria and Clostridium while the gram negative group include things like e.coli Shigella Salmonella Legionella and your zinnia so taking one of the gram positive bacteria as an example streptococcus it can cause things like streptococcal pharyngitis so structure pinkeye meningitis bacterial pneumonia and something known as necrotizing fasciitis which can also be called a flesh-eating bacterial infection which is something that you do not want a google image search if you want to sleep tonight trust me however many streptococcal species are not pathogenic and are important for your gut and upper respiratory tract and streptococci are necessary ingredient and producing Swiss cheese and taking one of the gram negative bacteria as an example Salmonella it is a type of bacteria that causes food poisoning this can manifest as abdominal cramps vomiting and diarrhea also good stuff and it it often found in kitchens that aren't clean in undercooked food or food that has not been read it properly so bacteria can be good and bad and to avoid the bottles having an impact on you and your life you can do simple things like washing your hands cleaning your countertops regularly I'm making sure you cook your food thoroughly I hope you like this video the next one will be a continuation of this theme of communicable diseases and we will talk a little bit about the little buggers our cause malaria if you're into that I'd approves groups into the first 200 people so go check them out and thanks for watching bye [Music]
