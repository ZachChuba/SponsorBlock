oh hello and welcome to commander a fun and casual format where you play the magic cards you love with the people you like greetings peons and welcome to commander where your goal is to discover the most degenerate card interactions you can by locking out your opponents blowing up the entire board repeatedly and creating an impossible fort of spells that no one can ever attack into well actually the idea behind commander is just to take your favorite cards sleeve them up and play some magic wrong commander was created by board judges who wanted to see what would happen when cards that were never meant to interact with one another were put into the same deck and sir this video will talk about some fun and simple combinations of cards that you may enjoy playing in commander don't wrong again this video will go over five of the sneakiest downright evil combinations in the dirtiest color combination of magic Damir oh I'm a naughty boy indeed but are you quite done shill fessor let us begin this list of the sneakiest commander combos with merfolk no these are blue black combos well can they be black blue merfolk combos very well I shall include an honorable mention of a combo involving a merfolk but this particular two card combo is mono blue not blue black so it's only an honorable mention of super sneakiness yet it slots into almost any commander deck a fantastic merfolk legend is the great Empress Galina who for three generic into blue is a merfolk noble that can tap for two blue to gain control of target legendary permanent note that this effect lasts indefinitely meaning that if Galina is killed or even exiled you still control that legendary permanent pretty powerful already but when you combine that with ley line of singularity which makes all non-land permanent legendary Gallinas just tap to blue to gain control of whatever non-land you want and keep control of it once yet fancy add freed from the real to untap her for just one blue and tap her again for two blue three blue total to permanently steal as many secrets as you can afford delightful yeah now that that pathetic Professor pandering is passed let the true black and blue subterfuge begin time and time again we play well let us sit through it with a time sieve and ensure it runs our opponents to the ground time sieve is a blue and a black for an artifact that you tap to sacrifice five artifacts and take an extra turn after this one combine that with a Thopter assembly which is an artifact creature that at the beginning of your upkeep if you control Noth alters other than thought their assembly returned Thopter assembly to its owner's hand and create five one one colorless Thopter artifact creature tokens with flying go infinite easy sacrifice the five doctors to take another turn cast assembly untap upkeep return assembly draw sacrifice and repeat nice and a great many blue black commander decks but especially fun in Sharma the hegemon who can be brought in or blinked to recur any pieces your opponent's attempt to smash much like the free audio book being offered via audible I like free things magic can be so restrictive with high-cost spells requiring mana so why not cheat things into play mm-hmm well this combo takes it a step further by cheating in what we are cheating in double the cheating all of the sneak hey ya audible links shout out ah be quiet you shill but I needed a new camera come on pathetic rooftop storm is five generic and blue for an enchantment that simply says you may pay zero rather than pay the mana cost for zombie creature spells you cast that's fine of course in any zombie tribal deck like Jarrell Finn geese ah but why limit ourselves to the restriction of the rotted flesh no no a conspiracy conspiracy will allow us to name a zombie as our creature type and now all cards whether they are creature cards in play or in our hands are zombies meaning they are all free arcane adaption will let us put this to card combo in mono blue or just offer additional redundancy with an odd amia deck tutor either of these enchantments up early game and you are good for the win I feel these sneaky combos are not quite evil enough let us consult the hive mind what reddit no no it's a magic card hive mind read it's a magic card will you stop saying reddit even I have my limits on evil hive mind is an enchantment that whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell each other player copies that spell each of those players may choose new targets for their copy but this is not a may ability as far as the cast is concerned they must cast whatever spell gets copied their way and what better way to ruin their day than making your opponent's all cast doomsday oh yes doomsday for black black and black search your library in graveyard for five cards and exile the rest but the chosen cards on top of your library in any order you lose half your life round it up now if your commander is Hoonah queen of the Fae you can pick off your opponents by having them draw into destruction but I prefer to wipe everyone out at once with a card like wound reflection which will make them all lose the other half of their lives when you pass the turn what better way to call it today than a hive mind doomsday to Commander combos and black and blue remain which is most evil well both are deliciously disgusting but this next one is especially heinous you can technically slot half of it into a black deck or half of it into blue but with both colors at your fingertips it brews the perfect storm with what might be one of the most evil commander Cod's ever storm cauldron oh this is so sickening storm cauldron as an artifact which reads each player may play an additional land during each of their turns whenever land is tapped for mana return it to its owner's hand so very irritating by itself but let us combo it with one of two options either piracy in blue or warped devotion in black or both for the ultimate attack you see piracy is a sorcery that reads until end of turn you may tap lands you don't control from mana spend this mana only to cast spells so you simply tap all of your opponent's lands and they return to hand setting everyone back to square one while you can continue unchecked but when combined with warped devotion which is an enchantment that reads whenever a permanent is returned to a player's hand that player discards a card it works particularly well now it helps to have a way to destroy or sacrifice the storm cauldron after it's done it's dirty work so that you can finish up the game but no matter how you play it its misery what fun what have I saved for the end why it's a combo that harkens all the way back to the evil that was leveled you think you could ban your way to a safe fair format no no my dear children commander is inherently broken embrace it it is a puzzle to be solved such as two fairies puzzle box - fairies puzzle box an artifact that reads at the beginning of each player's draw step that player puts the cards in their hand on the bottom of their library in any order then draws that many cards so if you get a puzzle box in play and flash in an ocean thief which is a human rogue that reads if an opponent would draw a card except the first one they draw in each of their draw steps instead that player skips that draw and you draw a card combined with puzzle box this puts your opponent stuck at little to no options while all the answers unfold before you amazing that these devious devices are still legal in commander but let's face it there's no one card in the game that needs to go it is as I've always said made up of cards that were simply never meant to interact with one another so we might as well have fun with that as our format well I hope very much these commander card combos have been most unhelpful to your playgroup what sneaky combos do you love most in commander let me know in the comments below and share the broken badness for all of us to brew and remember to pick up your free audiobook from audible.com slash slurring community or texting tellurian community to five hundred five hundred thanks to audible for sponsoring this video
