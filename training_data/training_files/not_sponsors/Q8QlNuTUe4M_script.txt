facial detection nah I prefer racial detection so there's been a lot of racial controversy in the news recently people are saying things they're just not supposed to say look at this look what I 3d printed it's up hard our look at that drop the hard art anyways the problem is that kids aren't learning about racial sensitivity at a young age now clearly the issue lies squarely with the parents but really who can blame them you know I mean I figured I'm half Filipino most of the [ __ ] time how's bob smith supposed to teach little Timmy about different ethnicities you know and that's why I came up with the idea for a revolutionary new toy based entirely on race called trigger me [ __ ] so trigger me Elmo is gonna be 2 3 2 2 major parts it's going to be the animatronics inside of Elmo because it's not nearly terrifying enough if it doesn't move and the software that's going to detect your race oh yeah so what trigger me Elmo is gonna do is detect your race using computer vision api's and then say things to you based on what ethnicity he thinks you are let's start with the robotics that we need to turn Elmo into the spawn of Satan now this is the part of the project where I realized I might have messed up because my rough plans for the animatronics became progressively more disturbing and eventually bordered on devil worship so here's a 3d model for the mouth animatronics it's pretty cool here's how the jaw moves I can't do that and realize and then this boring piece of [ __ ] is the 3d model of the torso animatronics I'll get those parts printed out but while they're printing let me show you where we're gonna be putting everything it's just the hollowed-out corpse of a normal Tickle Me Elmo doll I took the stuffing out so that the robotics would fit nicely inside of it and I know what you're thinking Michael that is the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life don't worry it's gonna get a lot worse so these are what the fully assembled animatronics look like somehow even more disturbing in person the mouth mechanisms pretty self-explanatory gets screwed on to the floor and roof of Elmo's mouth then the servo is sent signals for my computer and it opens it up to simulate talking here's what it looks like there's constantly moving obviously we're gonna use future code to make it actually simulate talking gross this is the arm mechanism that works when the servo turns this wheel which is attached to fishing line which is attached to the arms and it makes them move up so yeah that's creepy and here's what this one looks like constantly running don't worry i'm already disgusted at myself now let's just slap in those [ __ ] animatronics [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right so the arms are in let's do the mouth I told you this gonna get worse so if I plug this in and just have it constantly run it should look like unfortunately for us creepy does not equal racist can't wait to see that on a shirt unfortunately creepy does not equal racist said by Michael Ruiz aka Filipino Hitler so in order to turn Satan fetus into full-fledged trigger me Elmo we're gonna need some code we're actually gonna need a [ __ ] ton of codes spoiler alert I made it way harder to build then it needed to be but Michael I hear you ask why was it so hard to make well the answer is hey [ __ ] sounds like you are about to start saying nerd [ __ ] and that's not cool so if any of you guys aren't into that you better skip this part of the video either that or shut the [ __ ] up and don't talk about it in my goddamn comments section remember to stay cool stay in school and smoke crack a lot of things they're kind of just a lot of moving parts in general I did make a lot of extra work for myself though one thing in particular I'm gonna make the excuse that I spent that extra time to make the cold run faster but it's actually because I'm a [ __ ] while I was looking through the documentation of the API that I'm using I spent all of like five minutes looking at it and I thought that the API would only use images that were already on the infant's so what I had to do I'll show you my computer my computer I'd also create a completely separate web server here web server and then here I'll represent the API here yeah so I thought that I need to get the images from my computer onto the internet before the API could access so my system takes images from my computer and it uploads them to my web server which publicly hosts them on the open Internet my web server then returns the custom URL of the image hosted on the internet on the server it takes it and it sends it up to the API the API then has access to this URL so the API asks by web server for the image hosted on it then the API takes that image processes out different racial attributes and then returns those racial hash in its data to my computer where I can process them for tickle-me-elmo trigger meal saw and so we can represent Elmo here like that so based on the race information the computer tells the Elmo what to say so the fact that I did this entire part of the project would be really stupid if it weren't just coincidental more effective speed wise because the only other alternative is converting the picture I want my computer to a base64 encoded string that's basically turning the picture into just letters and numbers and then uploading that to the API in a JSON file which is a pretty inefficient way of doing things so I'm pretty sure this solution is the fastest but for the sake of the video we're gonna say it's a hundred percent the fastest so let's see what that software looks like without the boring explanation garbage now you might notice I borrowed some of the UI elements from the squirt bore 9000 but pretty much everything else is different so when I start it up its going to start detecting my face and when it reaches a certain threshold it's gonna the server and there we go Wow it knows I'm Asian didn't need an API to tell you that so here I'm going to let it run again and this time I'm going to draw your attention to the upper-left corner you can see this nice little readout I put in see what the API does is it returns race confidence values based on what it thinks you are so obviously we're gonna take the highest race confidence value and then that's how Elmo knows what race you are and obviously we're not going to use my laptop webcam because that's not nearly creepy enough so what I did was slip some camera guts into Elmo's right eye and so the detection will work like this yeah so we can actually do the speech synthesis in real time instead of determining what the movement should be ahead of time we can do this by just listening on whatever audio stream is playing on the computer at any given time and then moving the mouth based on the decibel levels on that audio stream god damn that was a boring sentence let me just show you okay I got the speech synthesis code running on my computer I put a Bluetooth speaker in elmo's ass just because so when I play any audio on my computer facial detection nah I prefer the wait fall detection obviously it doesn't just do talking but you know what I think it's a hundred times better anyway so all we got to do is come up with voice lines for Elmo to say it's gonna be too hard right raw edge five Oh crowdsourcing is the answer just like all things and we now all I got to do is wait for you wonderful people to give me some quality voice lines crowdsourcing was not the solution but you guys did point me to die trickster another youtuber who does a mean Elmo impression and more importantly doesn't mind a little satirical racism because damn it if trigger me Elmo is gonna teach the youth to be more racially tolerant he's gonna have to show them what not to do so I asked him to read off some voice lines that make fun of Asian and white people why because I'm Asian and white and if I've learned one thing from being on YouTube all these years it's that if you are a race you are allowed to endlessly mock that race regardless of if you're disconnected from the culture regardless of if it's mean-spirited that's the YouTube way thank you thank you very much thank thanks for coming up thank you no thank you it may have also asked him to do lines for the other races too oops so I got the Lions reference by the code and that means we're done trigger me Elmo is available in stores across the United States today Wow thanks dad I've always wanted a Tickle Me Elmo well so that's actually a trigger me Elmo your teacher called and you drop the n-bomb like six times in class yesterday we got to teach you some racial tolerance that's no way for a third grader to act trigger Neil oh god its route I of the summer setting up trigger needle is an absolute breeze all you need is one USB cable Oh two USB cables power-chord I guess tuned custom programs your own private server and an enterprise-grade web api trigger me oma because god has been dead for a very long time this is the world's very first fully functioning trigger me Elmo I am so goddamn excited to finally see it work so all I gotta do is stare into his beady little chicken eyes it is everything I ever wanted this might be the best thing I've ever made in my entire life I just I cannot I can't stop playing with it this is the best thing in the world you're a dirty monster Oh weird enough yeah and that was perfect cuz I'm half white and half asian so it should get it right like half the time wait no it should get either one half the time that's what I meant oh if you didn't know I'm back home on vacation I can probably find one of my parents mom sit down chair please mom thank you mom this isn't true that I'm just agent alright just look into the beady little eyes that yeah the iPhones aren't gonna make themselves because you're Asian get it whatever okay you can go okay next I'm gonna call over my black and Hispanic friends okay a couple of my favorite actors let's do John Leguizamo first let me just line the face up okay the thing is I'm not Hispanic so you know Terry Crews rest in peace Brooklyn nine-nine boy I sure hope I don't get demonetized for the racist [ __ ] Elmo's to say I respectfully model New Age culture in the memory dr. african-american trials and tribulations chapter 1 this what trace I'm not I think that covered triggered me Elmo pretty well in depth I can show you guys a little bit sorry about that guys I was having this crazy dream that this video was still somehow monetized I don't know where it came from them up [Music]
