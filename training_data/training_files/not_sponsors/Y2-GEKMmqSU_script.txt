pretty self-explanatory but if you don't already know it's iron man mode but in a group that's literally it that there's there's no other explanations you need i you can only trade your teammates and you have a little group storage in your bank these are the only people you can settled or text settled to 500 500 to start your free 30-day trial all right i made my character ed sheeran at the vmas

okay i won't tell you this what's that man what's going on man he bought the runescape equivalent of a gun to the vmas why you can blow me and then bend me over and then you look like you're about to

anymore this is perfect run eat please settle it's all on you yeah baby pizza [ __ ] girl let's go yeah man this place sucks all right man so uh group iron man was fun [Laughter] yeah we're done aren't we bit of a closing ramble here because i have been a huge fan of the group iron man concept for a long time and although i love what jagex have done here i can't help but feel there was a massive miss in timing and i think a lot of people agree on that as many of you know leagues three will be coming out in less than four weeks and i can't help but feel the momentum for group iron man is getting absolutely shattered because of this and it's a real shame we decided to only play the group for one day not actually because of this timing but it was partially the reason uh but i actually have a trip planned for my 21st birthday which is october 7th so it's a day after the group release and i'm not going to be able to play for the first week so we just kind of sent out this first day of gameplay on the creator worlds just had fun with it and i just very quickly made this super raw video with pretty much no editing really quick right before my trip so i'll be uploading remotely from my phone or something but i hope you guys enjoyed it nonetheless and maybe down the line the boys and i can start a real group iron man sometime after leagues and give it a proper shot so love you guys and uh for those asking where the finale is i promise you it will be worth the wait blood sweat and tears are going into it i won't upload it until it's perfect have a great rest of your week and bye bye
