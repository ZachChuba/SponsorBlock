is it gonna stop or is it gonna go around them impressive is it gonna stop go around it welcome back everybody to tears the driver I hope you're doing very well today we're gonna be testing the Tesla vs cones as per this comments and this comment actually loads of people ask how does the tears of reactor cones so we're going to test it with autopilot on with traffic aware cruise control and with nothing Korn and we'll see will it go round cones and we've got several cones over there and beautiful Holly putting them out for a shout-out to Holly make sure you hit the like button guys if you want to see more of enough money basically to go buy loads of cones I've actually got 25 cones coming and we're gonna basically use them and see if we can create something pretty cool so shout out to all the patrons alright let's give this a go shall we so hopefully we'll get auto pilot working on this road yet there you go and we're gonna see what does it do with this cone the cones there yeah there you go you can see it and it's evaded it it's gone around it and it's carried on going straight so perfect it did exactly what we expected the car to do and that was actually a really good result I'm gonna try it coming back on the other side of the road as well and we'll see how it reacts to this I'm gonna let auto pilot speed up and we'll see will it go round the cone so yeah you saw that it actually evaded the cone very very slightly there at the end actually pretty impressive manoeuvres we've made the tougher test here and Holly's put out two cones so let's see how it reacts to two cones in front of us is it going to stop or is it gonna go around them impressive very impressive car went all the way around them let's see what happens actually if we just autopilot all the way to the end okay I think that would have just gone all the way that actually felt like that would have just carried on I mean it yeah strange let's give this another world then so she's put the two cones out and let's see if it does it on the other way as well so again hands completely off the wheel as you can see we're gonna see okay so interestingly enough there it actually went over the cones and then it stopped it braked and everything and then it continued to go back over them let's see the damage of the cones and let's actually have a little talk to Holly and see what she saw there it literally just ran straight over the code but did it did it hit the you know when it came to a stop yeah did it touch the cone or did it did it stop and then it continued past the cone it stopped and then continued over it okay so what I think happened is it saw the cone and when it got so close to it it then lost the cone and then I think the car kept yes so I think the car continued to accelerate okay let's add a third cone out and try that the reason I also really wanted to test it on this road is you can see there's no middle line marking so the car has all of that space and all of the ability to go around the cones if it can and if it if it wants to let's see again what happens here I'm assuming with what we saw before it's actually not going to go around them and it's just going to go into them at this point again breaking breaking breaking now again I think because oh and then strange it's it's decided then to go straight over said cone and when it goes over the cones for some reason it actually takes them with us which is really really odd let's get this cone out from underneath this thanks doll so you can see that we did squash the cones again and Holly has been able to retrieve the one from one of us so these cones are actually foldable cones so the idea is when we hit into them they actually can fold and they won't do any damage to the car let's try this one more time then from this angle and we'll see how the car reacts to it this time are we gonna hit these cones are we going to go over them and you can see so the card there oh that's actually slowing itself down yeah so yes so it does do a hard break and everything was that good though oh it just touched it Holly said so as you can see again it's actually doing really really well but if you don't if you don't react and you don't retaliate the car I guess thinks that there's nothing else in front of it so it just continues going once it's already slammed on and reduce any impacts in any damage so that's actually pretty good so I can you do it in like a like a 45 degree line coming out as if like you know go around this like so stagger them put that one yeah coming out yeah I just want to see then if it'll go almost around and then can you stand on the yellow line in the road this time we're pretending basically as if holy is a worker on the road and she's put cones around her and we're just gonna see will it go around this or will it react differently yeah you can see it's definitely evading around the cones which is really good and then getting itself back in lane as well which is really nice to see so I'm gonna bring this down to ten miles an hour and I'm gonna keep on going to the end of this rope just to see if it will slam on one side it knows it's the end of the road no look at that so it just abort it wasn't stopping by the way when it aborted it didn't slam on and a boy it actually was continuing to drive so I'm a little bit surprised about that I've got to say this time I'm gonna test that out on just traffic aware cruise control and if I keep it still going at the cones and pretty close to Holly will it react no look at that it didn't react at all on traffic aware cruise control and I actually had to do the dodging and weaving around so interesting enough traffic aware cruise control maybe isn't working with cones let's put all the cones out in the road again and try traffic aware cruise control on it just one time also if this video gets 2,000 so make sure to hit the like button if you want to see that okay so traffic aware cruise control we're gonna put on here and I'm gonna put it at 23 miles and 20 miles an hour let's go say and we're just gonna see I'm not going to stop for the cone now as you can see there the cone completely annihilated the car didn't stop for it at all which is again so strange if the car knows that there's a cone there why is it not stopping you know even though it can it can clearly see it and it can clearly drive around it by itself there for example we did in oh right let's go one more time here we go the last chance everyone we're gonna do auto pilot one more time and we'll see we'll see its ability here is it going to stop go around it absolutely nothing absolutely nothing all we did was destroy the cone don't forget watch out for cones drive safe and to those of you who have stayed past the credits we are going to do a little bit of also pilot on the way home on these treacherous roads and I've got Holly here who's going to talk us through the cone scenario and what she saw so Polly give us a rating 10 for the cone scenario 10 being it did well I'm gonna say probably a 7 a 7 okay I saw the car mode out the codes a few times yeah so basically I used auto part at the star and that's when it reacted better and quite well to the cones traffic aware cruise control which is where it reacts to cars it should stop for people and stuff it completely ignored the cones yeah and I honestly think that it doesn't react to cones at all unless you are on autopilot I just don't think it's going to stop the car but also did you see that when you had to out it would go around it but when you put three out it didn't actually try and go all the way around on to the other side of the road and it in fact stopped yeah one radio just mowed it down yeah and then as soon as they got close enough every single time it just completely destroyed the cones within seconds afterwards cuz it was like oh the cones disappeared under the car so I can just go again it doesn't matter the cone is down so Holly also isn't the biggest fan of auto pilot she's she hates it really when I test it and I'm in the car so can we do this a little bit or so this bit down here goes very very windy I have done it before I'm going to bring it down to 50 miles an hour I have done it at the 60 miles an hour and it's taking us all the way to the junction down at home thank you thank you so let's give it a go and see how we do here and hopefully we can give some confidence to Holly in the full self-driving system I say that with a big bag of salt next to me I do self Drive I just went self-drive on a country road no that's understandable because there's just too many obstructions there's potholes there's horses there's people they're cyclists sure at the moment as well like self-driving you do have to be more aware than just driving yeah so I think most people do question it's got a bit wide here so you know it's there actually didn't slow down for the corners whereas here for these corners it will bring itself all the way down to about 25 miles an hour now whereas previously it used to tackle this at whatever speed you've set and I've nearly hit this hedge many times you can see it still go slightly wide but we didn't and you can see they'd all hello big lorry no problems there for the Tesla it's breaking for us again that's that's it so that pothole on the left we would have dodged it we would have evaded it the car isn't quite there yet I do believe it can see potholes and kind of dodgy areas on the road and maybe in the future it will learn to dodge those things but at the moment you can see it's currently not yeah my ears popped is up previously we had loads of issues down here because of the foliage and made different lighting effects and stuff and sometimes made it really hard to see but we've got a nice clear day today and yeah doing well do you expect it to do all this bit on its own again so this here is the hardest s Bend that I really know around here you can see feel that how it's breaking us down so early and it does feel like a learner driver but okay 2025 I think we get to know 24 23 this is a new low speed limit for this corner and again as you can see it's doing this all by itself really really nicely but I mean if you were if there was no windows and you were just doing your anything you were playing on your Nintendo and you didn't have to drive instead this was your way home I wouldn't mind going 25 around the corners so that's what I'm saying at the moment it is bring it a lot slower and it really annoys other road drivers but even here you can feel it slowing down you felt how it's lowered you feel that slowing down for this corner still slowing down for it going round really nicely but you practice it quite a lot so it's obviously remembering yeah I have practice on the road a lot and definitely roads that are more used by autopilot it slows down for the corners because I assume is taking data from the fleet but this still amazes me at this area it will continue to speed and it will not stops it will not slow down it's not my doing 52 give way do you see what I mean I don't understand why it does that in the so in the videos that was a very natural reaction actually to that but in the videos it doesn't seem like I'm going fast and braking hard but I really I really are give way yeah but obviously we broke hard braked hard for it so that's why I'm saying is that it's that kind of area where people think oh it's that if it can do corners it's definitely going to stop at the end of the road if and it didn't do that at the industrial state you know when I got to the end I tried it a couple of times and it was continuing at that speed and it aborted about 5 meters towards the edge and I had to slam on do you think it's because in England we have giveaways rather than a stop sign yeah doesn't doesn't realise it needs to stop it's an end of a road definitely so at the moment we're waiting for 2020 dot 2013 which should bring us stopping at stop signs and traffic lights but I don't know what that means for yielding because in the UK we yield here rather than potentially well actually we don't really have any stop signs doing so we rather yield anyway I hope you enjoyed our little talk on the way home and some autopilot again thank you guys thank you guys whoever's watch it all the way to the end here Thank You Holly for helping us out with this video so so much and let us know down below in the comments what you want to see again a shout out to all the new subscribers and our new patrons they're all in the description and if you want to help there's no pressure but the support is much appreciated and means I can go out and buy a hundred cones and do some stupid stuff which will be really fun until next time don't forget drive safe
