he can think you've run away from something actually you've been carrying it with you the whole time what comes after the end of the world season 1 of the end of the world went out with a bang literally it seemed like James was dead shot down by the police and this would have been a neat logical endpoint for his character arc he began believing he couldn't feel anything I'm James I'm 17 and I'm pretty sure I'm a psychopath and concluded the season sacrificing himself for love I've just turned 18 and I think I understand what people mean to each other on top of this the location in the season 1 finale looks like the ends of the earth and the song playing over the end credits Julie London's the end of the world suggests that this moment is the apocalyptic event of the show's title [Music] finishing there would have solidified the tragic feudal teen angst that defined the show from its opening but the series doesn't end there it was a fitting end a doomed love story and then I didn't die in season 2 which writer and executive producer Charlie Cavell has confirmed is the series true conclusion James and Alissa tried to go on with their lives two years after their time on the run in cabel's words if the first season is about running away then the second season is about coming back and having to deal with stuff people say moments like this oh i tripping or for pasta the problem is that underneath the plasti to sell quite a lot of [ __ ] and the story becomes something completely opposite to the angry rallying cry it started as it's a manual for growing into a well-adjusted adult here's our take on what the series finale of end of the world says about continuing on after what feels like the end of the world when you find the world's still spinning [Music] so click the link in the description below to sign up now let's unpack how end of the world ends in the series finale Elissa disappears from the police station and James thinks she's gone to commit suicide said to the goth to me I didn't mean forever but in fact she's actually taken a positive step towards life by going back to the house where Clive Kok attacked her in season 1 to finally put to rest the trauma that's been haunting her the couple then visit the place where James's parents met he was sitting on a bench though do we love to stray away remembering his parents love story is significant because it James's mom killed herself and left her family behind while Alyssa the other most important woman in his life has just avowed not to take that path sorry I scared you as they scatter James's dad's ashes the show underlines that the real end of the world is death the only true cut to black there is this [ __ ] man dead isn't it yeah you miss everything so if you're not dead you have to get up everyday and find a way to keep going and that's what becoming an adult is you can't stop things hopping in you just have to deal with them when they do in the final scene we get a self-aware nod to the show style of having its main characters not look at each other when they're talking I read somewhere that if you want to talk to someone about something important it's easier if you don't look at them for much of season two James has tried to muster the courage to tell Alyssa how he feels is it his time that's good now Alissa meets him halfway I heard what you said at the compound I feel a same through this moment of genuine connection the show affirms that their future is hopeful even though the road isn't going to be easy I need a lost hide okay and some psychological help so how did the tortured teenagers of season 1 get to this positive healthy place essentially by learning to feel a feet that's not easy when the main thing you're feeling is pain yours may have expected that if James did survive season 1 the show's final chapter would focus on him and Alyssa facing legal consequences for their crimes boys 18 tomorrow night but season two quickly reveals that both got off pretty easy the jury agreed I was acting in defense of another and family not guilty of murder I got clean is service water dead which wasn't as bad as going back to school still James and Alyssa are punished in other ways by the aftermath of their experiences and by life itself first James has to endure a long painful recovery from his gunshot wound I felt like I was being punished and maybe I deserved him and no sooner does he heal then he has to face the sudden death of his father and life as an orphan meanwhile Alyssa suffers from PTSD caused by the night she was attacked as Alyssa recovers from her misadventures with James she believes her numbness is proof that she's in a better headspace I don't really feel anything anymore it's good not feeling but Alyssa's total apathy reveals that she's not processing what she really feels excuse me you thought about killing yourself what I said is this service included as ELISA hurdles past big relationship milestones but the new guy who doesn't set her soul on fire her boldness comes from not caring about him sex is actually alright it turns out it's not such a big deal do you wanna get married yeah exactly in season one she acted just as brashley with James before she really knew him have you ever eaten before it was important to be comforted in moments like this yeah I want you to eat mine we've seen this before in the first season James's complete absence of feeling is what had him convinced he was a psychopath I tended not to feel things for a long time I was good at it good at feeling absolutely nothing as we discovered though it's not that he wasn't feeling it was that he had buried his grief over his mother's suicide he'd rather think of himself as a psychopath then deal with this scar and this speaks to how far human beings are willing to go to avoid emotional pain ultimately Alyssa's journey in season two is a mirror of what James went through in the first one she has to stop repressing the pain and face the trauma that has shaped her entered the seasons main new character Bonnie a woman hell-bent on killing James and Alissa to avenge the death of her lover Clive I think you knew my boyfriend yeah you killed him Bonnie is Alyssa's trauma chasing her down this punishment obsessed figure symbolizes the way darkness from our past can stalk us and embodies how trauma feels like an inescapable punishment that's coming to destroy us people are supposed to get punished you think we weren't I'm always in that house I'm always in that room ikkaku now the couple's final confrontation with Bonnie it forces alyssa to deal with the event she's tried so hard to forget and that's ultimately what motivates alyssa to return to the scene of the crime and take the first step towards healing meanwhile bonnie herself is a cautionary tale of what happens when you don't confront your trauma her downfall is that she never looks honestly at the abuse she's endured all her life and that's about punishment from a young age I learned it happened because of love we could interpret Bonnie story as a pessimistic variation on James's season one narrative just as James once plotted to kill Alyssa Alyssa was new she'd started that term I thought she could be interesting to kill Bonnie seems to believe she's a killer with no qualms about avenging Clive I'm gonna go kill someone else now James eventually realizes he's not a psychopath because he discovers his capacity to feel love and because he recognizes how disturbed he is by seeing living things hurt having finally murdered a human I realized something quite important police please I was pretty sure I wasn't a psychopath in season two bonnie experiences something similar her horrified reaction after accidentally shooting the hotel owner and the way she delays on killing James and Alissa why didn't you already kill us tells us that at her core she isn't some one-dimensional cold-blooded murderer either yet despite their parallel journeys to this point this is where James is in Bonnie's paths diverge feeling turns out to be James's saving grace the thing that frees him being with Alyssa it started to make me feel things she made me feel things but Bonnie can't handle her inner turmoil her pain ultimately proves unbearable what I do know the pain her suicide attempt shows she wants to escape feeling all together in this season that's so focused on the theme of punishment you're just the witness she's confessed to everything this person who hasn't really dealt with her trauma is trapped by it and will probably never get out of her mental prison he can yes duck in a place you won't even realize it feel careful you can get stuck there forever but body in films people on the road always look hot in season one James and Alyssa's romance on the road is a teen update to the most iconic lovers on the run movie ever Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde we're at banks Bonnie and Clyde were outlaws that 60s audiences identified with embodying the counterculture spirit of the time likewise the show begins with a young couple who are fed up with the status quo well they've got money they feel safe and we follow them as they break with society and set off on a crime spree in season two James's comment about his injury I don't think it works anymore I haven't tried is another subtle nod to Penn's movie where Clyde suffers from performance issues I'll tell you Ronnie I ain't much of a lover boy the end of the world is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Charles foresman who has cited Terrence Malick's Badlands as an influence he wanted to die with me and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms Horseman's story is set in the u.s. even though the show takes place in England it maintains a very American feel if this was a film would probably be American this is especially pronounced in season two where the setting seems to resemble the Pacific Northwest finally the show's notable lack of modern technology a smashed it I don't have a phone either really yeah hatin and it's soundtrack made up of vintage songs make it clear that this is an intentional throwback to the 60s and 70s golden era of on-the-run films Bonnie and Clyde represented rebelling against the establishment and likewise James and Alyssa's fight is with the deeply flawed unfeeling grown-ups around them you wanna know what's wrong with me yeah yeah you are you don't care about me the adults we meet take advantage of these young people fail to meet their emotional need or are just deeply unfulfilled in their own lives in season one Alyssa's mom has the comfortable lifestyle she wants so she chooses to overlook her husband's creepiness towards her daughter last week he said he thought I needed a bigger bra so I threw a chicken Kiev his head I pretended that she hadn't heard him ELISA initially thinks her dad is a cool stick it to the man kind of guy but in the end he's a sellout who calls the cops on her and James I'm trying to protect you from him we don't see a single happy adult relationship on the show so with these kinds of models to look to who would want to grow up in season one the teens solution is to escape you hate it I hate it I parents of [ __ ] Ewok ah but season two moves beyond the teen fantasy of ditching all your responsibilities into the cold light of day where actions have consequences and it can take a very long time for wounds to heal she talked about my injuries about complications and things taking time and long roads ahead at first when ELISA ditches for wedding to Todd and runs off with James it seems like we're getting a repeat of those earlier events but the people in the situation are changed by their experiences ELISA keeps asking about their destination well we do in James we even go in and this time viewers are also probably impatient with the aimless drive we want the couple to face the day which they're eventually compelled to do sometimes doing the right thing fails like commit in a crime surround loss crucially while bonnie-and-clyde died in a firestorm of bullet the show spares James and Alissa this tragic fate in the end James and Alissa can't avoid growing into adults but they find a way to do this while staying rebels they refuse to follow in the footsteps of the negative adult models around them instead they Forge a different path to adulthood that's about learning to express what you feel and address your underlying issues while you're still young [Music] Bonnie and Clyde a couple whose names clearly referenced Bonnie and Clyde are a dark mirror of our central couple love makes you feel quite clear about ways right washroom and when someone has done something wrong they have to get punished Bonnie is a product of the messed up adult establishment shaped first by her imperfect parents that left soon after that just getting some milk then by this older man who takes advantage of her and whereas James and Alissa find a way out the tragedy of Bonnie story is she ends up perpetuating this cycle bonnie suffers because she blindly repeats the thought patterns she learned passively and never examines them Bonnie's misguided view of love stems from trying to reconcile her mother's emotional abuse with the need to believe this person loves her her story explores how that fundamental misunderstanding of love has made her unequipped for life the problem with a person having a lack of love is that they don't know what it looks like so it's easy for them to get tricked to say things aren't that Clive uses the promise of love as a honey pot to lure Bonnie in do you know something what I could fall in love with you and she has no idea how to tell whether she's got love as it happened love that time we finish for tonight it's significant that this girl who grew up in an abusive environment Falls for a serial predator even if she doesn't meet the same gruesome end as his other victims clive preys on her feelings how do you know he didn't have a clot maybe you're just lucky he'd love you me he pushes her toward crime subtly manipulating her into hurting someone for him and now she's made up these lies she's gonna say I attacked her she wants to destroy me my my life my work and rewarding her violence with the ultimate prize so unlike Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde are not a real team there's a drastic power imbalance between them James and Alyssa's relationship can feel punishing at times but it never veers totally into this love as reward and punishment territory Bonnie and Clyde are a guide to what not to do in love Bonnie uses Clive to give her life meaning why did he want to take my class I was interested in why and what the point is she projects her desperate need for love onto this undeserving partner and she willfully writes off his bad qualities and obvious lies I was stupid agreeing to talk to her alone she's clearly in love with me she explains away inconsistencies by creating a narrative in her head you were waiting for him when she finally confronts the couple she can't take the revelation of what Clive did to Alyssa help me down and they tried to get on top of me you asked me to tell you not just because it reveals that her lover was a terrible person but because it suggests that he didn't really care about her Bonnie sees Clive as a way out as the answer I used to feel like I maybe wasn't real like I was made up of nothing but when you fall in love the nut feeling is eaten by something feeling which is eaten by an everything feeling this is exactly how James vows not to see Alyssa I'm sorry trying to make you the answer it's don't fit on some level the whole arc of the end of the world is about two young people coming out of their shells and finding a way to express love if you can manage this in spite of it all the end of the world is a long way away and instead of black empty nothingness you're looking out on a new day I love you too free just click the link in the description below to check it out today [Music]
