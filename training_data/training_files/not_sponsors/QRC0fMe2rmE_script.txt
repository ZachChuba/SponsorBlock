go to my switch Pascal YouTube into music a stress welcome back guys to the best channel and recording studio here on YouTube and the universe and Dana and the butch can he's already asleep deep because we have only 15 minutes left of this day until it is the next day and this means we're almost midnight streaming in the fifth hour right yeah only two twenty minutes left yeah twenty minutes that priority is the sixth oh oh yeah right sorry I always already always mess that up always one hour short it's me calculate can take your calculating that editor boy so yeah five hours forty in and Dana chose her next video by doing a poll with a live stream and the live stream tap voted between astro and oh my girl and they chose oh my girl by far so let's check it out [Music] dang it sometimes [Music] [Applause] I really love the outfit [Music] are there new guru is it a visited abuse or something Chet write it down I'm not sure [Music] this part is really nice [Music] the steady back [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music] Wow okay the judge says that it's a new style for them so yeah I hope that this style gets it gets them more into the mainstream I guess so because it's a very mainstream II production I didn't really enjoy the mixing mastering again but that's that's a theme for today all of the videos most of them just one you know two or three videos I like the mix and master that but that's something k-pop specific I observed it quite a lot but today it's very very often maybe because they're all very really new releases and they are trying to bring some new audio engineering into the world which isn't really pleasure though if it's a thing but yeah okay that's but the rest the girls I can also say that sometimes I thought like the voices when they were really really high there were too sharp right too harsh Pleasant right that's that's my boy yeah yeah and also again with the stereo image in imaging and the compression again yeah but not on the whole master only on some instruments it's aw but I really liked it like you get it's really good vibes it's fun you yea want to move to it house movie I really really enjoyed it some parts are a bit too girly ish for me yeah you know cuz it's like too cutesy I like it I enjoy it but it's just like not my favorite favorite but I really like it they have so cool outfit and so fun they did something clever give with the drum programming because they put in a break because otherwise it would have been just a fauna flora beat again always hitting three times the kick and then yeah hitting the kick three times and then not playing it yeah and it has actually a Denbo rhythm to it [Music] [Music] only the caps are playing again the demo rhythm yet so it isn't too quiche a in the production but the sound design of the virtual instruments kinda are but this still fresh enough that you can enjoy this song so quite interesting I really like the the attitude of the girls they're all super pretty this outfit the jeans with the pink jacket and yeah it's a Chanel belt I think it might also be a Chanel tweed jacket yeah that's a fortune and yeah the whole concept I really like the concept of the girls it would be interesting to get the newest songs to check them out they all have a really nice own characters yeah it is new song but another as well because the Chet said that this is a new style for them and this style is almost like the yeah bubblegum k-pop song again but modern but modern yeah it has more a little more international wipe its vibe it's not to bubblegum bubblegum ish maybe it's it's it has this hint of bubblegum it's yeah but I feel like it's more like the older ones it has still didn't off bubblegum that's right that's what I meant I think when I said sometimes too cutesy girly ish I enjoy it because it's like modern nice in here uh-huh but it's sometimes it's not my thing but overall I really like it yeah but the girls are hot right yeah all of them I love the blue hair yeah she really stands out but they all have the attitude gestures and mimics and the [Music] yeah they're good they're really really good so something else they have two rappers right yeah the seven girls oh good [Music] maybe because of the choir that like like a girl choir screaming here in the hook in the background that's one of the reasons why you thought it's two girls [Music] oh the blue haired one is me me the chat rightz everybody right that she's so hot nice to meet you Mimi how you doing how you doing yeah and the chorus I mean yeah it's it's pretty nice mainstream written you have them sing the main theme melody and also the instruments in the background playing it as well again as we know from mainstream songs guys I've told you that a couple of times before we have that here again and that really gets the in your brain yeah that's that's nice do they say that so yeah Wow just-just-just great no not my favorite song but I'm very surprised that I've never heard of them before and they're actually so good that I want to listen to more songs of them because this one for me actually is kind of too girly as well but a little bit the mixing and mastering but still still I can hear that they're good and that's the point right [Music] suppose much Widener's going on here a nice break with a repetition of the last sentence [Music] oh did you see that make up here on harami it's a more darker one that's something mark Teddy Teddy okay yeah the English word for album it's catchy that's not a good nice word it's catchy yeah but it's something else something I like oh boy I mean album this is like really it's really getting you yeah it's catchy yeah but it's I mean although was such an this perfect think there's word for it translation for that I think yeah nice man nice tool nice nice to finally again found a new group I really like that because there's always something little new going on some different stuff going on in the concept of the group the grooves and so on so I really enjoyed that as well so thank you so much chat and thank you so much for watching out beginning of it later maybe it's better okay it's I don't know what to do okay bye-bye no look at this Popeye how is this face [Music] we want to sleep as well now it's two minutes to midnight
