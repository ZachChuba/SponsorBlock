links to which are in the description below when a modern audience sees 18th century warfare in the film or television such as in the patriot the question that first comes to mind is why are they just standing in lines and firing back and forth and while they really should be asking themselves why am I even watching the patriot the first question is still a valid one hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we're going to be discussing infantry formations in the 18th and 19th centuries and why they were employed but first a word from our sponsor iron sight iron sight is a computer company that specializes in making high-end gaming computers at an affordable price they actually sent me their nemesis model as seen here if you've ever seen one of my live streams you'll know that I have a lot of trouble even running my animation software much less video games but from now on I expect that lag will be no problem at all which will make the video making process a much smoother one you can get your own Ironside computer by visiting their website Ironside computers comm starting at $14.99 and be sure to use my promo code history for 5% off now onto the video present in order to understand why soldiers fought in lines it also must be understood how line formations and tactics were even developed and for this we have to go back to the early 17th century the man primarily responsible for the widespread introduction of linear formations in Europe was Gustavus Adolphus the second king of Sweden during this period up until that time infantry was deployed on the battlefield in large square columns of pikemen and Musketeers which allowed them to move around the battlefield as one unit and provide equal protection to each flank inspired by a system developed by the Dutch nobleman Maurice of Nassau Gustavus implemented informations designed to maximize firepower as stated by david gates in his book warfare in the 19th century shallow linea formations were clearly more advantageous than deep columnar ones when it came to maximizing the number of troops who could see and the shoot a given target as a result the swedish army was highly successful in the 30 Years War while Gustavus system worked it was not flawless in the words of Professor Archer Jones author of the art of war in the Western world Gustavus scheme had one important drawback its lack of all-round protection provided by the formations based on the square a line that could only face one direction men vulnerable flanks and an assailable rear this however would be remedied by the introduction of the bayonet a short blade that could be attached to the end of a firearm which allowed infantryman to fend off cavalry charges without pikes bayonets were probably invented early in the 1600s but did not become widespread until the 1670s although at first they had to be inserted into the barrel of a firearm this was solved by the invention of the socket bayonet which allowed a musket to be fired with the Baena attached combined with the development of lighter more efficient muskets a company of infantry could protect itself from almost anything although soldiers were better equipped than they had ever been it was still more efficient to fight in-line formations this was for a number of reasons first and most importantly the only way for infantry to repel cavalry charges was by staying in formation when infantry was not in formation they were especially vulnerable as this meant that each man's flanks would be unprotected and exposed to cavalry second it was easier to maneuver large numbers of men in a rigid formation as otherwise they would have been separated and disoriented especially in the smoky environment on the battlefield making them an even better target for cavalry or third as muskets were very inaccurate the only way for soldiers to inflict damage on their opponent was by concentrating all of their fire on one target combat in this era was more about intimidating the enemy and forcing him to retreat from the battlefield and this was often accomplished by Baena and cavalry charges these points were recognized by military theorists and generals in the 19th and 18th centuries and as a result linear formations were used for over 200 years and this was doubly insured by the technologies of the time again quoting David Gates at the end of the 1700s many of the features of ancient warfare still seemed to be present smoothbore guns and either much more accuracy nor reach than the slings bows and ballista that they superseded well for close fighting manual weapons swords bayonets and lances were commonly relied upon that said linear tactics were continuously being improved upon with various drills being developed in order to increase rate of fire and survivability for example the infantry square which solve to the fundamental problem of linear formations the vulnerability of their flanks to cavalry charges during the Napoleonic Wars the British used these square information to great effect most notably at the Battle of Waterloo where companies of British infantry broke multiple French cavalry charges by forming square another significant innovation was the development of light infantry who were trained to spread out and conceal themselves in order to harass the enemy and screen the primary battle formations while remaining safe from cavalry despite these developments it became clear that linear formations would eventually become obsolete with the development of more accurate firearms in the 19th century in the American Civil War for instance one of the reasons for increased flitty of combat was the use of static line formations against highly accurate and deadly munitions such as the minie ball these new weapons could also disrupt cavalry charges at long distance which diminished the use of both massed infantry formations and cavalry alike regardless lines continued to be used in some capacity up until the First World War despite the prolific casualties suffered by units in close order formations during the start of the First World War it should still be understood how effective line formations were in their heyday because as we've previously stated they proved to be a major deterrent against cavalry kept a much-needed order and discipline within the ranks of the thousands of soldiers on the battlefield and allowed armies to channel a high volume of fire into the formations of their enemy in spite of all of these points linear tactics eventually succumbed to the inevitable obsolescence of any method or technology and be on the lookout for Ironsides a limited time offers on PCs thanks for watching I'd like to thank my general staff on patreon Fritz Joe Crispin Brandon
