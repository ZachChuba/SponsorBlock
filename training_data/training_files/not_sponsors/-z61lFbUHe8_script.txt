hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to state tonight by Chula I am filming this video also kandi by Becky Owen and bullet to the heart by Jackson all three of them consecutively because I put up a pole and I don't know which one you were choosing I don't know when you're seeing this could be months from today today is May 27th just as a reference that nobody cares about I don't know a lot about June ha I know the song gotta go I know the video to it as well I know the song snapping I haven't I'm not sure if I heard the whole song I have definitely not seen the whole video but from what I've heard it's not like my favorite song so I that's why I don't remember if I've heard the whole song and so I'm also not planning on reacting to that anytime soon because I'm just not a really a fan of the song I don't know why gotta go is amazing though I love gotta go honestly I don't really know what else to say cuz I really don't know much about you at all I don't know how old she is I don't know if she's always been a solo singer or if she was in a group at some point I just know that I love gotta go so yeah but before I get into this reaction please leave a like and subscribe to my channel I literally have nothing else to say so oh there are no subtitles so I am thinking the song might be English otherwise I'll have to look them up afterwards let's do it I don't I have no idea what to expect at all good Hey well this is giving me oh my god vibes Oh [Music] it's not English [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] saying a lot of juice [Music] Paul [Music] [Applause] lights [Music] a change on the color of the bars [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] no nice [Music] I feel attacked [Music] whoa [Music] nice I like this part a lot [Music] it was really fast I felt really short nice I liked the song I think the more I listened to the song I'm gonna like it even more cuz I was a little I wasn't sure where it was going in the first like this first time that I listened to it I really liked the video a lot I feel like I didn't really say a lot during the reaction I was just paying attention I think it's relatively simple I think it's just it's mostly on location it's crazy lighting a few very dominant set pieces or like they use the dancers at like as set pieces and that's it as far as I remember this is such a cool opening it reminds me just a little bit of kick it because I just watched that like a few days ago and it's yellow and black I said yellow and black what didn't I say black and yellow oh that's why it reminds me of kick it and that's really the only reason this reminds me a little bit of skeleton that's so that's something I like the bangs on her like the makeup I like the lighting I like this match cut I like the smoke I like everything oh oh look at the light oh look at how the light is like wait you didn't see it because I pause it like it's like a coming from abroad spot like you like a stream and then back again like here cool nice match cut nice match cut the lights again that's so nice I've never seen that before I feel like they changed the black bars to white here I'm usually not a big fan of white how do you even call this bars because I feel as personally to me it's a little distracting that's just a personal preference this is one of the dominant set pieces I was talking about which is funny cool hey that's such a cool set piece this is like a very big set not set like location I was like a studio so they probably built all of this then maybe maybe it's already there I'm not sure pressive either way like it looks really great I kind of wish the lighting was a little more focused as in the other one here sorry lady that it pause on this let me go further because I don't know this to me looks a little bit like a dance practice video because it's everything so evenly lit compared to all the other scenes that we saw before but again that's just a personal preference I just feel like it would look cooler if the lighting was a little less even this is really cool I think CGI because the shadows are so realistic are they realistic I'm not sure for some reason I feel like these are practical but then they look a little CGI because they're so smooth there's no texture that I can see so I wouldn't know what they would make the make these out of for them to look at this smooth so feel like there's probably CGI I'm guessing I don't really know I like all of the cuts like the framing the different framing they're using choreo is amazing styling I like this this outfit is my favorite with whatever this is called like the diamond crop top no net whatever the pants but there are lights I'm so confused about these boxes in the back are they practical or not that's a cool transition let me see that again light beam comes in on this already oh it does it's a transition ok I like this too looks like a club to me I didn't realize those were people I love that this is upside down also it's two shots because she's she's like down here already but here she's still up so that's cool also I feel like the person with the bald head is here in the other one I think I don't know it's a little or maybe she's just lying flat on the floor and there are no people at all there it's a anyways that's really cool crazy cool using people or dancers and set pieces I love that part this reminds me a little bit of soul are spit it out because I just watched that choreography I would break my everything if I did that I still don't know if these are real or not the lights and the like the boxes in the but no I think they are real are they real I just think they're real because you can see down here when the light comes on there's actually a change I feel like that's a lot of work if those were CGI I feel like it would be a lot of work to make sure the shadows work and not look real but also the light comes on and hits the right place I feel like it's just a lot of work so they might be practical but I can't see how they're suspended at all and again they look so texture less so I don't know but no it has to be real maybe it's just green boxes and they impose the rest on it like it's a green screen could be maybe you can see there's shadow of them dancing on it so I think they are practical but something's weird about them like this transition love the lighting in this the colors the white and the purple black black purple blue and orange super pretty I think that's the same set as before so see this but this lighting so much more over the one where everything is evenly lit because this is the same location as the previous one where I was talking about that like that transition of everything going red and then it cuts into the scene where everything is red really cool yeah again I'm getting a little like oh my god wives sometimes I love these cuts so much I don't know I'm a little confused on the blue to red light if it's actually a cut or like this is a cut obviously but this I'm not sure I'll be able to tell editing also I could just slow it down then I'll be able to see yeah I think it is a cut yeah it is the cut it's very well done though the blue right especially so well done like I can barely tell I also love the choreography again I like this part is my favorite part this is so pretty the effects and the glitter and it just looks so like party but at the same time it looks angelic and so in a way it's it's awesome choreography again they added an element from another shot into this shot like set up into the setup nice yeah I do like the song I think again if I listen to it more I will like it even more but I think I like it I was just having trouble where it was going the first time I really liked the video loved the choreography the lighting the cuts the editing yeah I liked it a lot that's all I have to say about stay tuned I bet you ha I hope this video was interesting or informative I didn't really say too much I feel like but sometimes there's just not too much to say thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or maybe you saw something that you didn't before thanks for watching bye [Music]
