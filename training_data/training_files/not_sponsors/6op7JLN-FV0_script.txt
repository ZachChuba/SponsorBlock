gilanor games thank you welcome back to another episode of guillenore games [Applause] team europe last week you won the olmschool challenge and eliminated a tmna player from the game so this week you guys have a one player advantage coming into this week we are feeling pretty good we won the first challenge na has one less player we couldn't have asked for a better start let's now complete soup's next challenge and take another win before we get started i have some unfortunate news as you can see team eu is missing a player on the way to the challenge today solo mission accidentally kicked his router and shut off his internet and he's currently unable to log in and will not make today's challenge this means cloud badass will once again be filling in this week for team eu oh really he kicked his router you think we believe then we're barely into the season and europe is already desperately relying on their sub to fill in for them we're not here to play that dirty game we don't play like that sometimes you just feel like eating your router mine sometimes flashes at me and i think come on man are you starting team eu you guys have now used your substitute twice you only have one available substitution left for the rest of the season last week's challenge was an incredibly difficult challenge that required skill teamwork and coordination and a tough pvm challenge this week all of those things will also be required except this time in pvp in today's challenge you guys will be playing continental conflict using standard tri-bird gear you guys will be fighting in the wilderness in a 5 vs 5 best-of-five pvp challenge to win a round simply kill every member of the opposing team the early rounds will be fought in the wilderness and the final rounds will be fought in clan wars the first team to win three rounds wins today's challenge and is safe from elimination now team eu since you guys won the last challenge you'll get ping advantage for the first two rounds since the fights will take place on a european world the next two fights will take place on a us world and if it comes to it the final round will take place on a european world since you guys also have an extra player this means one person will be able to sit out every round the player who sits out will still be able to communicate with your team and try to help them win the round however the same person cannot sit out twice tmna would you like to sub in alken for this week's challenge i guess that's a no sorry elkin you guys have 15 minutes to gear up and strategize and then we fight i'll see you guys in the wild i thought we would do well although i do know that a lot of their team is pvpers i thought we would do pretty well we got framed on our team he can carry us pretty hard we have cam q he's up all the time for lms i have some clan wars experience so i kind of know what i'm doing in a multi-fight to be honest i was absolutely [ __ ] myself because i am one of one of the worst pk's known to man solo mission is a is a bad person to miss out on the team but if anyone can fill the shoes it's going to be quite badass i think in the back of our mind if framed is ever an option we should take it i i think whoever is the person that is being piled and one of us is definitely going to be the first target whoever is getting pardoned i'm going to push myself forward to try and get that first pile um and i'm going to try and drag as far north west as i can just make sure you get that first freeze on whoever you're partying and then cool call cool going into a pvp challenge we know that we have the stronger pvp community in the team as well so i felt very confident our plan was simple kill framed and then they don't have any color all right so i'm gonna be honest i think they're gonna pile me um so we're going to want to go for the weakest links first they might be going for me but they want like we want to go over the weakest links first let's let's focus on strategy and take i'll be the i'll be the caller all right we need to get our specs out right away so let's first arrange one of these people as we rush in freeze them what we're going to do is we're going to like we can't be next to each other at any point in time we have to spread out okay if you can dump your dds but you don't want to get too close to them because if you get too close then you're going to get piled and then make sure that you are trying to bolt as well so we're going to be primarily ranging and uh maging but like we are going to all try to pile uh tanzu right away that is going to be the main goal and then the next person we go for is guns chili then the next person that we go for um is going to be cloud bad ass and then c engineer then race yeah so if you if your hp is going down guys it means they're targeting you and get into your tank gear right away kevin was our default caller he just took on the role and he did a really good job our first strategy for the first round take out the weak links the people that can't tank they don't know how to combo eat or put on their tank gear what have you so that was our first strategy [Applause] [Applause] all right guys here we go the team that kills all the members of the other team first wins the round fertoso will be sitting out in the first fight for team eu all right everyone angler super combat range pot when he starts counting down when he gets throughout two everyone to make sure you move quickly we're going for a frame he's second top on their side three two one go all right all right i got framed i've got frames we've got frame everyone focus framed he's right in the middle everyone focus framed in the middle boys i'm done i already got killed one guy did yes oh i'm dead i'm out all right everyone's still on jimmy on the trees boys most acting south he's my spike smite i'll see you later he's back to that oh sorry you should be doing a lot faster than this everyone on development after this zulu see you later everyone on tv everyone on julie here fellas smite's up it's just you left now oh there's nikki over there there's one person left nikki blizzards in range that's what there's food there's food under c engineer there's food under sea engineers south southeast southeast uh look southeast unseen engineer just keep hitting them keep hitting engineers south he's all the way south everyone hit sanji in your south everyone has sanji in yourself i'm being focused i'm being focused on being focused let's see engineer south hits the engineer south i need i need you guys to freezes guys i'm getting focused right now i'm being focused really hard right now is anybody alive uh it's just you and the flutten no i just all right i got zulu all the way over here to the uh to the east boys hey we're doing really good zulu everyone on zulu right now do it again let's do it again yeah yeah it's for everyone if you want to just go down you can that's 4v1 i'm about to get this ko going for the dds for the chaos no and she's there hey we lost one person good [ __ ] boys that's good really good i got piled alright team europe you guys win the first fight fifteen thousand death runes it's the engineer hey we got some 6k blood rooms this this is a tournament world the loot means nothing man there's a lot of little b ring as well okay enjoy the loot tom team a team eu you guys now have five minutes to strategize for the next fight and then we're gonna meet back in this spot are any improvements we can make from my tactical analysis from the side i did see dave dropped very quickly he could have ate a couple more for you all i was doing so after we won the first game i brought the suggestion to all the guys on the team and i said at the moment we're on apping which gives us the advantage so i volunteered to sit knowing that i had that sort of vocal attitude to call if we won that game perfect we go two nil up if we didn't win that game at least i knew i would be back in for the next round and i wouldn't be out on foreign soil on american servers jim how fast did you die man how fast did i i die yeah i had a rakesy and c engineer using dumping specs on me so i was gone right after you pretty much i figured we would take them out faster than that so we gotta obviously change the strategy up so now we just gotta hit rakesy first if we hit rakesy and then we hit uh c engineer then it should be a lot better yeah that's probably a good idea so yeah right we'll go for rake c and then we can go for c engineer and then everybody else will just be [ __ ] putty i i would say the majority of people on our team aren't really pee carriers and they're especially not multi-cleaners i'm not even a multi-cleaner so like i would say not none of us really have that much experience you know multi-clanning so it's pretty hard to actually you know plan around that but we pretty much just wanted to you know take out the worst players first and that didn't work so we want to take out the best players all right europe is up 1-0 and a you've got to step it up go all right rakesy is northwest rixie's northwest everyone looked normal he's part he's far away he's far away far west west look west endeavor that's right in the middle boys right in the middle all right they're focusing me boys they're focusing me so i'm not going to be talking very much framed is in the back frame is in the back line all the way back everybody get framed look racing in the middle look rake's in the middle rick's in the middle everyone should be in the middle on racy everyone should be on rakesy right now he's dead northwest everyone going northwest everyone going northwest he's brilliant he's broke down he's running sideways he's going sideways yeah i felt very good about winning the first one i felt very confident me and jimmy he started talking a bit of trash against me so i decided to pile him no matter what cast the freeze get on him the other guys you have to catch the freeze you have to catch the freeze my team was on killing frame for the entire fight i was just killing jimmy because he was talking so much trash okay get on him get on keep the pressure on come on who wants it next had a target on my head that guy was coming for me left and right and that dude all he knows is pvp he lives in a pvp world on a hardcore iron man with a one built bounty on his head he's a psychopath so that guy coming up and attacking me that's one hell of a thing to deal with he's so close to that he's so close to that get him hit him he's almost dead he's almost dead he's redemptioning he's so low he's dead okay nice okay go chilly okay let's choose a new target okay put your tank on and just start brewing put pretty nearly on oh yes dave keep it up i'm getting on nikki okay he's down he's down more ranges more ranges he's gone he's gone go for rotozo southwest southwest southwest go from over to southwest chances okay that's a blush cat's a blitz he's blitz he's blitz his blitz dumb barrage he's blessed there you go melee get some melees on him get the melee done wait this is a 2v3 you got this come on all right focus endeavor he's completely out all of you focusing development he's like out he's dead black music melee melee he's frozen he's frozen he's frozen okay he should be gone there you go just pile tantu pile tanzu dump your speck in him i'm focusing what do you guys want to do catch a freeze on him and then stand underneath him and then you can just continuously keep hitting he's frozen he's frozen he's frozen okay stand underneath him oh i wanted to power your move how do we die there we go that was the clutch we clutched it back we did it we were better that time yeah we won yes when we won a game on the european world i thought we could we have a chance of this we could potentially you know take this home we lost the first one we could you know come up and potentially get a a three to one why is the engineer on their side i think it was part my fault for losing the second round yes but it was worth it because i managed to kill jimmy all right who's sitting out for you guys this one i um where'd you stop just with me right here i mean i don't mean to flex here but we actually decided just to let anyone sit out we didn't have a strategy with someone sitting out we even had tanzu and potoso call for us and they'd never called america started a war with us and uh it was up to us to defend the wilderness turf round number three guys we're on the american servers now don't think i don't see you c engineer fighting jimmy in a 1v1 in a multi-fight if we end up losing this war because c engineer decides to go haywire you're going to be getting my vote tom get in your tank gear if you're getting hit a lot go for it spread out everyone's spread out too okay low paying is a big advantage in these fights if we can win this next round i've got a good feeling we can win today's challenge cloud is now back in for tanzu the score is one to one if you win this fight you're one round away from winning the challenge go go go go go go uh c engineer is in the back so we can switch to cloud for now he's in the center head center sound in the center cloud inside cloud center cloud center cloud center hit cloud and center all right we've got a freeze on the endeavor do you want us to switch on to jimmy when it comes to pvp i've got experience with the with the one-on-ones clan fighting and and multi-fighting that's a different ball game that is some scary scary stuff because if you've ever tried the tank five people on you at once it's not a good time down jimmy yeah he's running he's running oh jimmy's done i'm down dude i got [ __ ] okay switch to see engineer should we stand close uh get odd fat pap and middle i'd fap in the middle i thought i'd fight fap and middle it's south to south east south i'd fap in south south south i'd fap and south i'd fab south everyone in government is in the middle right now and government's in the middle everyone in development endeavor right down in the ditch boys endeavorment in the middle he's in mystics i tank successfully i'm still live yeah so everyone in endeavor we gotta kill him we gotta kill him just stay on him see engineer south everyone hit south see engineers south everybody hits c engineer south take him out he's gonna be gone he's gonna be gone hits the engineer south hits the engine south everyone bolt them everyone bolts the engineer south i'm i'm chucking some browsers i'm chucking some barrages on him standing to everyone in bigots i'm talking barrages just ranging just ranging just ranging just ranging that's it right down good [ __ ] good [ __ ] all right next person frame frame frame print just keep hitting c engineer i'm probably going to go down here hits the engineer kill c engineer kills the engineer kelsey engineer he's out he's out good stuff nikki right next to him nicky right she's frozen she's frozen nikki right next to him that's the engineer kills the engineer kills the engineer kills the engineer he sees that he said he's not just that good team yeah all right cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud big cloud hit cloud hit cloud they're focusing me so i got us i got a tank hey cloud hit cloud they just jumped they're focusing you because you're the only guy oh i didn't know i was the only person left until i had about one food left i was just tanking i thought i was like calling out they're on me they're on me they're on me and then from the grave they're like yeah because you're the only person alive and i was i was just thinking to myself oh there goes there goes that you got this man are you literally the only guy left i think so yeah wow all right nice job eu another clean 4-0 fight tmna if you guys have a winning strategy now is the time to pull it out you guys have five minutes to strategize for the next fight so i think what we need to do next time is absolutely take out the weakest links first then we tried that the first time well we have a better strategy this time we're going to just take them out faster our evolved strategy was going for racy and that's the round we won well i mean they pulled back and everything though i don't i don't know like what evidence you're going with to go for the weakest link i mean literally what we need to do is just take out the the lesser guys first yes the the round we did when we got racy and everything but think about it like it was so long um of them tanking because there are good tanks that we couldn't do my team they wanted to keep going with the weak weak link strategy taking out the worst of the opposing team i thought that didn't work the first round and i think we should have continued with our second strategy which was to take out racy and c engineer i'm going to be completely honest here soup team and are a bunch of chickens in this challenge and over here on team eu they're eating all these chickens as long as we continue to execute our strategy i can't see us losing this here we go guys the score is two to one for team europe if they win this fight they win the challenge we came here as six members of the team eu we still have six members and if we win this we are not going to be taken down to five sure i say to that jen what do you say david alexa what is my name i'm not sure he's speaking [Laughter] if you know you're going too far in just step back you don't need to be me and flutten freeze and then get in your tank gear and bolt the [ __ ] out of whoever we're calling at the time yep okay i'm ready tm a you have to win this round rakes you'll be sitting out for team eu go oh bigots oh this is beautiful boys they're not even changing our big writing for us i'll be seeing you i'm done i'm going man okay i'm nikki get nicky we hit her in the part everybody they didn't have a chance we're winning guys like loads stay on friend everyone unfriend i mean it was just slaughter an absolute massacre it's like that please it's like clockwork we've won boys we won well done you guys on finishing another challenge that was really fun to watch unfortunately for tmna you guys lost the challenge and will need to nominate one player from your team to go into the banning team eu you will also be nominating one player from team a to go into the banning as well you guys have five minutes to decide listen i don't care who gets voted off i just think it should be jimmy because i hate that guy right jimmy's my boy i love the guy to death but if i'm being honest the second that i saw that he was gonna be on our team i knew that the guy was dead weight so i want him gone and the sooner that this guy is off the team the sooner we have a chance of winning [ __ ] you jimmy all right so for real jim i'm voting you you're voting me i'm voting you who said you could vote me yeah i'm voting when was that ever part of that was never not man you voted you would tell you never part of the plan buddy dude okay cancel is coming after you jim you're going dude the vote system is coming after you i feel like it should be me because i don't think i did anything do you want to do the random number generator again or yeah we'll do random number generator again all right i can actually get that i'll pull i'll pull it up okay you got it yeah no that's kind of a kevin's gonna pull that up and he's gonna say uh the number is jimmy guys rng is pop out that's completely against the integrity of this whole gilanor games thing it's not easy choosing to vote somebody off your own team but if we're serious about winning we need to make the right choice i feel like it should be the people that did the worse and it was me bye-bye jimmy i don't know oh [ __ ] care vote me off for some reason god knows why this man this this walking menace framed suggests to everybody that i was the weakest link of this now don't get me wrong i i could have stood up for myself but at that point i had had it i said you know what kevin fine you get your way it's cool and i volunteered i said screw it whatever happens happens i think i i'd rather get rid of either kemp or framed i think we should pick out zulu i think a lot of my teammates they want to vote out camp or frame but i wanted to vote up zulu because he is the main pvmer so moving forward if we get any pvm challenges their strongest bet is out i do too actually pvc he's like the best pvm i think certainly yeah really makes more sense so do we want if it was going to come to a 1v1 do we want zulu in with chem q and then either way it's a win and they choose either kemp or jimmy like he was going so what if they vote absolutely then he's our second i'd probably say kemp q because frame's obviously going to win but if kemp q fought zulu and last still a win zulu is a very very high experience player he's got 200 mil skills i'm pretty sure like somebody with that mentality knows a lot about the game and i think from na's point of view they're just trying to cut off the dead weight no offense to jimmy but unless there's a trivia which is about quest or something like that you know that's just how it is welcome back to the second banning of the season tmna you lost today's challenge and had to nominate one player from your own team to go into the banning who did you guys choose soup it is my honor to inform you that we have thankfully chosen jimmy for the banning today tmna picks jimmy jimmy come on up brother you are the first person chosen for the banning today team eu who are you choosing from tmna to face jimmy in the banning we voted for zula team europe picking zulu as the second person in today's banning the other team sees me as a strong player so i'm not surprised they got nominated but i'd still prefer to be nowhere close to the banning big matchup here guys zulu vs jimmy in the second banning of the season to fight for your place to stay in the game you guys will be playing know it all for this elimination we're not going anywhere in fact we're going to stay right here the only thing you need to do to beat your opponent is simply no more runescape trivia oh runescape trivia if there's one challenge that could level the playing field it's trivia pvm pvp i'm pretty confident i can win but trivia is a game changer and that might not be for the best and know it all each player will be asked 5 runescape trivia questions the questions will get progressively harder as the round goes on to win the banning you just need to make sure you get more questions right than your opponent if there's a tie after five questions we'll move into overtime the player who answers the most runescape trivia questions correctly stays in the game loser is eliminated framed over here he's been making a lot of snarky comments and it's just so weird like framed is like my best friend and he just the second things get competitive he looks at me i think he wants me killed but i got to prove to him that i've got what it takes i've got to prove to him that i'm competitive and that i'm worth it to make it a little bit easier for you guys i'll make it multiple choice so you've got three answers to choose from jimmy zulu welcome to the second banning of the season jimmy you're up first your question is how many waves are in the mini-game the fight caves is it 60 63 or 66 63 final answer final answer that is correct nice job zulu how many waves are there in the mini-game the inferno 66 69 or 73 69 final answer final answer that is also correct the score is one to one back to you now jimmy who lives in a two-legged walking house on lunar isle is it baby yoda bahayaba or baba yaga baba yaga that is also correct oh the quest master dude how did he know that one he's not at that point spoilers he knows his quests that's too right for jimmy zulu during which quest you encounter the giant scarab contact fight arena or the feud contact contact is correct 2-2 we're tied up trivia on runescape is so broad because the game is so deep there's lots lots of different routes you could take trivia for runescape so i i think it's anyone's game question three jimmy which of these npcs can sell you pink dye sarah betty or gertrude uh sarah sarah sarah dead sarah final answer that is my final answer jimmy that is incorrect the answer is betty okay i know what you're thinking jim that's a pretty pretty obvious one but look i meet so many women on this game zulu you have a chance to take the lead now which of these npcs becomes king during the quest the holy grail sir lancelot sir wayne or sir percival uh i want to say gawain final answer final answer zulu you will not be taking the lead this round the answer is sir percival jimmy your fourth question is how many potato cacti are needed to protect a silastro sapling six seven or eight man five six i don't know six yeah six that is also incorrect the answer is eight what the f is a celestia celestrous sapling what the [ __ ] is that i've never anyone who knows what that what that is is a nerd zulu another chance to take the lead what farming level is needed to plant a banana tree 27 33 or 38 27 you are in fact able to plant an apple tree at level 27. a banana tree can be planted at level 33. your answer is incorrect oh why why could i not have got that celestis question this was my chance to pull ahead of jimmy and i might have just blown it all right guys the score is two to two both of you are now on your final question if you get this question wrong and the other person gets it right you're eliminated from the games if both of you answer correctly we're heading to overtime jimmy in what guild or pub can adventurer jon be found the sheared ram hair of the dog or blue moon in hair of the dog dogs have hair hair of the dog sounds good to me hair of the dog is that your final answer final answer jimmy i'm sorry but that is incorrect the answer is the sheared ram in lumbridge jimmy come on please you convinced me to put myself in this position okay you begged me [Laughter] you shut your [ __ ] mouth all i need to do is get this question right and i win soup please give me a question i know the answer to all right zulu if you get this question right you win today's banning and send jimmy home your question is the anku outfit can be obtained from what tier of clue scroll hard elite or master master final answer i'm going to block that in final answer that is correct congratulations you are the winner of today's banning oh thank god i managed to pull it through i'm still in it with a chance to win i'm sorry jimmy that it had to end this way i'm gonna miss you man i'm gonna miss you jimmy zulu well done on winning you're still in the game and have a shot to win the final prize you can go ahead and rejoin tmna jimmy i'm sorry man but you have been eliminated from the gill in our games we're going to miss your brother maybe we'll see you again in the future you know i knew it was over the second i nominated myself i'll be honest obviously our team's gonna vote the weakest guy they're gonna vote the strongest guy i was going up against someone who knew what they were doing because the other team wanted that strategy they were going to get whoever they could off of our team for their benefit i knew i was gone you know i would want to see a valuable asset like zulu representing us down for the count so at the end of the day i knew i had to sacrifice myself to bring down eu once and for all that's the most noble i've ever felt honestly if we win the next challenge i don't see the point in going to the next one after that it's like it's done if they lose one more i'm confident in the fact that we will not lose a single one after the next one i think it takes a devastation to really turn something around and our team definitely needed a big turnaround a complete 180 and i hope losing an asset like me fuels the fire in our teammates so that they could go on and win a challenge at least we gotta win one come on these guys aren't that cool just win one well there you have it guys the second week of gill in our games is complete team in a you're down to four players if you guys don't pull it together eu is going to walk away with this competition make sure you guys bring your sneakers for next week i'll see you soon you
