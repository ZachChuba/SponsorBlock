[Applause] [Music] this video is brought to you by - Lane I've always felt a little bad for Thor the dark world which is goofy I realized that there's no reason to feel sorry for a mediocre 170 million dollar superhero movie we're not exactly talking about an orphan from a Charles Dickens novel here but whenever I watch this movie which is not very often I realized that I completely forgotten about the post-credits stinger at the end which teases the first guardians of the galaxy movie released a year after dark world I don't love this scene like as far as Marvel post-credit scenes go it's a very middle-of-the-road but it is a huge reminder that the cosmic side of the MCU was about to change in a huge way and in a direction that would blow dark world out of the water these days it feels like the second Thor film has become the go-to movie online when someone describes a bland bog-standard Marvel movie the one to avoid being liked at all costs because apparently there's nothing worse than being similar to Thor the dark world I don't think the movie is quite as bad as its reputation would suggest honestly but I definitely understand the criticisms it's a movie that magnified a lot of the usual problems the MCU has while bringing very little new or of substance to the table for people who really really dislike Marvel movies this is exactly the kind of film they can point to so today I want to take a dive into what went wrong why Thor the dark world is seen as the low point of the franchise and all the scrambling behind the scenes for creative control but to do that we're gonna have to go back to the distant faraway year of 2011 surprised who actually knew that was to give back to the community Thor was the fourth movie released in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and though I definitely put it above the almost complete misfire that was the Incredible Hulk it doesn't exactly stand out director Kenneth Branagh film in my opinion did a great job of casting lead characters like Thor and Loki which by the way definitely isn't nothing I mean Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were relatively unknown at the time but the screenplay is a superhero movie 101 as they come and Natalie Portman was totally wasted in the Jane Foster role still Thor was mostly politely received critically and at the box office and it became very clear early on that Marvel wanted a sequel and quickly as the studio announced the film would be out less than two years after the first one that was a problem for Kenneth Branagh who had just devoted years to Thor the prospect of turning around and immediately making another one with even less production time wasn't exactly enticing so he declined the offer to return and moved on to his next film the really terrible jack ryan shadow recruit this left Kevin Feige and company in a tough spot and in desperate need of a new director so they looked at a lot of TV talent especially people who directed impressive episodes of prestige shows like Dexter and Game of Thrones when that didn't work out they got very very close to signing cabin in the woods director Drew Goddard who opted for a big sinister six project at Sony that never actually worked out because you know the amazing spider-man 2 was the thing so those talks fell through finally Marvel looked to Patty Jenkins who had directed the oscar-winning crime drama monster in 2003 Jenkins came into the project with very high ambitions after spending most of the last decade directing for shows like Arrested Development and the killing she was more than ready to jump back into the world of films and came in with a very specific vision for what her version in the movie would be Jenkins wanted her Thor 2 to be a Romeo and Juliet inspired space opera and it would have seen Jane stuck on earth and Thor being ordered to stay in Asgard by Odin Malekith was still involved but her film would have focused much more on Jane and Thor's our cross love as well as Thor's troubled a relationship with his father Marvel initially agreed even delaying the film by a few months so they would have time to work on the new angle but his scripts began to be written it was becoming clear to Jenkins that the studio's vision of the movie and her own weren't exactly on the same page apparently the actual screenplay didn't have the mythic and romantic elements that jinkin had pitched at least not to the extent that she wanted them and after reading the final scripts that Marvel was dead set on going with she decided to drop out of the project entirely so once again dark world was hurtling towards a release date without a director in sight and this time it was even worse as losing Jenkins apparently had its leads pretty unhappy with Marvell Hemsworth has said that he thought the movies production felt very unfocused but Natalie Portman in particular was not happy about Jenkins departure she had loved and championed the director's pitch which had promised a much deeper and more nuanced take on Jane Foster then she had received in the first Thor and the thankless boring dialogue the character was receiving in current drafts of the script but in the end she didn't really have a choice other than to go along with it she had signed an overall deal with Marvel Studios so she was stuck playing foster whether she was happy with the material or not while the Dark Worlds pre-production wasn't exactly going great after patty Jenkins left many thought Marvel had righted the ship by hiring alan taylor and it made sense taylor was a legendary TV director having been behind the camera for some of the best episodes of The Sopranos and maybe even more importantly he had proved that he could manage shooting a massive epic by directing some of the best episodes of the first two seasons of Game of Thrones and apparently he was fine with going with the script they preferred but the project was still missing a villain the character of Malekith wasn't exactly the role of lifetime and Marvel was having a hard time finding the name actor eager to sit through hours of dark elf make up for it Kevin Feige and company were apparently really desperate to land Danish actor and double-oh-seven ballbuster Mads Mikkelsen there was just one problem Mickelson had just been offered the part of Hannibal Lecter in Brian Fuller's new TV series Hannibal and understandably he decided to sign on to the NBC show instead enter Christopher Eccleston the former Doctor Who lead and future left over star was well respected in the industry but he wasn't exactly known as a blockbuster guy the actor would later go on to admit that he signed on to the dark world and another blockbuster GI Joe rise of the Cobra purely for the paycheck in a surprisingly honest interview well after the movie came out he even said working on something like GI Joe was horrendous I just wanted to cut my throat every day and Thor I just gun to your mouth gone in 60 seconds was a good experience but GI Joe and Thor were I really paid for being a [ __ ] those times so yeah it's probably safe to say that Malekith won't be back for a cameo anytime soon experience the powers of door setting aside the fact that a lot of its stars seemed to be pretty miserable while making it dark world's productions seem to be going smoothly Alan Taylor has even said that he felt Marvel executives mostly left him alone during the shoot which he appreciated but during post-production that changed in a big way now this is where things get very big because we don't completely know Kevin Feige reasoning here but it seems that the movie was really taken away from Taylor in the editing room and from the looks of things it seems they weren't entirely happy with what they had especially when it came to Loki the character had grown into a fan favourite in the years since the first Thor and I guess producers believed dark world really underused him so they called in Joss Whedon who is deep into late-game production on the Avengers and asked for help and Whedon really got to it writing or rewriting nearly every Loki scene in the movie now look obviously the plan of calling in Joss Whedon to work on your movie at the last minute doesn't always pay off but I do think the Loki stuff shines in dark world and it did kind of emerge as the most enjoyable aspect of the film at least for me so it's kind of hard to blame Marvel for bringing him in here still when the movie was all said and done and you watch it now I think it looks like exactly what it is a film made by and starring a lot of talented people who had no real passion for it existing only because the Marvel release schedule said a Thor movie was coming in 2013 and the movie it teases in that post-credit scene guardians of the galaxy may not be a perfect film but the difference between the two could not be more obvious one was made at a peer obligation while the other feels like a passion project now I have no idea how patty Jenkins Thor - would have turned out or if it would be better or worse than the superhero movie she would go on to make Wonder Woman but I do think it's a little sad that we were robbed of a director who was actually passionate about the pitch that she had Thor the dark world feels like a movie no one was driven to make but thankfully this story kind of has a happy ending as thor ragnarok I don't think suffers from that problem at all so at the end of the day maybe the dark world is just what this franchise needed for
