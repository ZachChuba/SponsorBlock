or binders per course also once you get used to typing on a regular basis digital notes have a lot of perks when comparing two traditional handwritten notes moving things around is easier deleting misheard or incorrect information can be made with a click and the sharing capabilities make it seamless to share notes with classmates or your usual study group there are dozens of ways you can take digital notes and a vast array of programs and apps with different features templates and note-taking capabilities for this back to school video we are going to start with the free app that is available on all devices and is powerful enough to withstand the entirety of your college years and that is OneNote I've said it before but OneNote is still in my opinion one of the most underrated apps or programs out there for students yes don't expect to be able to print your notes with this program because the printing capabilities are awful but if your purpose is to stay paperless then this is the app for you if you can't even imagine studying without printing your notes beforehand then I would suggest a classic way which is using Microsoft Word to organize your notes or one of the most recent apps like good notes and notability which despite being focus on handwriting with an Apple pencil also have typing mode and good export settings one note has a lot of features that make it a great note-taking app first of all you get a ton of organizational power its side tab allows you to arrange notes in any order you'd like as well as the sonic color code per class topic or chapter you can move things around easily with the drag-and-drop and creating height pages and subpages despite being able to do something similar with Microsoft Word using the table of contents tool OneNote was created from scratch to allow you to organize different sections inside the app which makes the experience seamless while you're navigating your notes in class secondly OneNote allows you to integrate different types of media for a more complete note-taking experience you can insert files PDF documents images audio file screenshots tables equations symbols and shapes that basically enables a more interactive and visual experience and also makes sure that you don't forget to include in your learning tools other important sources of information that aren't necessarily in written format for instance if you are taking a class where there are mandatory readings in PDF formats it would be a clever idea to insert these in your notes and edit them with a good PDF platforms so our link of them in the description box below now let's talk about some basic rules to type your notes or create digital notes while typing your notes it's recommended to keep a fairly simple layout and color coding scheme using different font sizes and colors creates a batch of very distracting notes which makes revision a harder process a useful tip is to create your own style guide and stick to it until the end of the semester a style guide is a set of standards for the writing formatting and design of documents and for school notes it should be quite simple just decide on a font size formatting rules and a color code to use for examples titles questions and terminology use your style guide throughout the year to create comprehensive study materials also unless you're planning on sharing your notes with your class it's important to keep in mind that your writing style should be yours and not mimic anyone elses this is important because writing is style you're familiar with and using prompts and simplified language can improve your vision a lot even if your notes don't sound as fancy as your textbook or transcription from one of your classes it should be minimal enough to lie to grasp the main contents of the lecture material in a short amount of time this is particularly hard to do with typed or digital notes since you're probably able to type faster than your writes which creates a tendency to overcomplicate sentences and type more information than you should tired to our last rule is the importance of transcribing key concepts in your own words besides how can you understand these concepts better through a simplified language it also helps you create your own style which can be useful in essay type questions or papers that require you to use those same concepts if you're in a very formal course that requires you to give a formal definition widely accepted by the scientific community it's a good idea to write that definition in one color and then transcribing it into your own words below it's your own text helps you connect that concept with the rest of the learning materials while at the same time highlighting that that definition should be memorized for a correct answer for the rest of the information focus more on formatting abbreviations and comprehensive information than grammar rules are complete sentences in the same way having learning aids which are intended to enhance your learning and retention will improve your learning experience so much more learning aids can include questions created to structure notes better or small summaries on the top visual aids like charts tables and small mind maps voice memos the inclusion of problems or other assignments where those concepts were used in a more practical manner and small graphs symbols and even emojis to create visual distinctions between concepts or keywords as we've mentioned earlier OneNote makes it really easy to include all of these in your notes via a drag-and-drop interface you should really use these features to obtain notes that are as complete as you can make them indenting information also known as outlining is a classical way to organize information and something really easy to do in digital formats it creates a hierarchy between general and more particular specific information the information at the top is usually the most relevant and contains the core concept of the topic while information at the bottom of the indentation consists on useful examples or details that show more complete knowledge of the subject a complete set of notes made up of outlines can structure the entirety of your class topic and at the same time organize all of your thoughts and these are the basic rules to type your notes in college if you enjoy these videos you can subscribe to
