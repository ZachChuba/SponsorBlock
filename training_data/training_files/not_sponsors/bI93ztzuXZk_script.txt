[Music] this video is brought to you by skill share Sarah and John Connor are trapped in a never-ending loop in Terminator 2 the pair successfully stopped Judgment Day this catastrophic event that's lingered over John's entire life and driven Sarah to a mental institution as Sarah Connor tells us in narration that finally the unknown future rolls towards us and for the first time she's facing it with a sense of hope it's a nice ending really helped out by the fact that t2 has one of the best movie scores of the 90s but it's also dead wrong Sarah Connor may have destroyed Skynet but there's something out there far more dangerous than any army of robots could ever be the needs of an almost completely franchise driven film industry Sarah and John can never truly be free of the terminators just like John Rambo can't retire to the quiet life he's always wanted these franchises demand that its stars be put through the wringer again running through different versions of very familiar scenarios until eventually audiences lose interest and sadly I think that's exactly what happened to Terminator dark fate here's the thing I don't think dark fate is a bad movie and it's really far from the worst Terminator to come out since t2 I would put it well above salvation in Genesis and probably about at the same level as rise of the machines but all of them exist in the shadow of t - I mean sure I'll give salvation a little credit for trying and failing to go in a different direction but the rest of them are all trying to repeat that basic formula a protector and the evil Terminator are sent back from the future and a giant cat-and-mouse chase ensues and I get why they do this like at the end of the day it is a satisfying formula Terminator began as a fairly low-budget film that drew a lot of inspiration from the then huge slasher genre James Cameron was just able to execute it at a really high level and with a sci-fi flavor and in t2 he was able to find just enough creative twist to make that original formula feel fresh and exciting again and so many of these film scents are trying to do just that find a way to emulate Terminator 2 without feeling too stale and what makes it even worse is these films tend to come up with the exact same answer what if the bad Terminator that they're fighting is even more powerful than the t1000 and you know it never really works whether it's the goofy TX and rise of the machines that can use her arms to make guns as well as knives the Rev 9 in dark fate that kind of has the t1000 powers plus the ability to like separate his liquid skin from his robot body and whatever was going on in genesis the instinct is always to try to top robber Patrick's creepy police officer in t2 but none of these terminators are half as memorable as that one because they fail to understand that more doesn't really equal better in 1991 many viewers hadn't seen CG on the level of the t1000 like ever watching this guy slowly morph his arm into a giant knife was probably genuinely weird and exciting but not only is that kind of old hat now dark fate also doesn't really have enough of that horror movie DNA to sell it to us as disturbing or terrifying and I think a lot of that is how the movie uses CG Terminator 2 really benefits from the fact that it's use of the new technology had to be a bit limited not because I think more CG is always a bad thing but because of the impact that it had on the tone of t2 when those effects are used it feels deeply intrusive to the world of the film it really sticks out like a sore thumb every time he morphs or uses his knives it feels like and the characters react like you're watching something that should be impossible and that's powerful that's what gives those scenes something of a horror movie edge but there's just no way for Dark fates rev 9 to have that kind of impact not just because he's giving a familiar performance and doing things that we've mostly seen before but also because the impact of having these otherworldly looking visual effects on screen has just been completely lost their scenes in this movie especially in that last act in that fight on the plane that just look incredibly fake where the rf9 using his liquid metal body barely makes any sort of an impact because it feels like every frame is just packed with so much CG it just doesn't stand out in the same way where the t1000 can turn a single finger into a blade and create a suspenseful memorable scene I've barely bat an eye when this new Terminator rips all the skin off his body and lets his skeleton drive a car a lot of the time less is more and you can definitely see that in how these movies approach CG now create your own terminator with the by own flesh regenerator I'm back yeah think again but let's talk a little bit more about suspense something that James Cameron nailed in the earlier movies but that you're not gonna find much of in dark fate in fact the most creepy scenario it creates it kind of just backs away from there's a scene early on where one of the main character's father shows up at her work but we the audience know that this is a terminator who's taken his form this is a really great setup for a scene I mean really imagine that for a second your dad who you just saw a few minutes ago at home shows up at your job and is acting off there's something wrong here and you just don't know what and really he's there to kill you meanwhile a total stranger is up against a ticking clock trying to make sure they get there in time to save you that's some really fantastic just meat-and-potato sci-fi horror right there but no instead it's just tossed aside in a matter of seconds so that we can get straight into the over launch a scene where there could have been some really suspenseful moments here something that gives us more insight into Danny her brother Diego and her relationship with her father we settle for more terminator fistfights instead as for the characters I feel a little bad for the new cast I have no problem with grace or Danny on paper but these are perfectly good sketches for characters but they never feel fully fleshed out and the older cast Linda Hamilton and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger really steeled a movie right out from under them I don't even think it's these actors faults Grace's pretty planned she feels like a generic soldier in an open-world RPG she's determined competent and focused the injector with a little personality here and there especially when she's arguing with Sara but overall this doesn't really feel like a fleshed out person I don't think it would have taken that much to make her just a little bit more interesting or at least more fun to watch I've always liked the small moments in Terminator 1 where Kyle Reese is just really in awe of the world of the past and I think they could have tapped into that here grace is someone who spent the majority of her life in a wasteland she came of age having to fight and scrap to get by we don't really get that sense much I would have loved if they had gone in a more charming dirtbag direction with her like she has a hard time adjusting to the past and comes off as kind of a weird and gross person to people in 2019 I mean it makes sense that someone who lives in a post-apocalyptic future probably doesn't have to bother with hygiene or politeness all too much I'm not saying this is the exact correct thing to do with grace but I do think that adding some more character traits like that could have gone a long way to making her a much more memorable presence on screen and Danny and I don't know I feel bad for Natalie Reyes because this is a pretty thankless role like you need to believe in basically just one scene set in the future that this person could unite humanity against almost certain doom and that's tough Terminator and t2 got around this really well like we got small glimpses at John in the future this dude with a cool scar and like weirdly robotic head gestures but that's really it I don't think future John even speaks we can kind of project onto him any type of genius leadership we want and Edward furlongs John doesn't really have to live up to any of that yet cuz he's just a kid Danny doesn't have that luxury it also doesn't help that the movie treats Danny actually being the Future leader of the human forces as some kind of big twist because that's kind of just what I assumed all along but it's with Sarah Connor and the t800 now named Karl that this movie really shines I think early on they really give Sarah one too many very hammy lines but once they get to Carl's cabin things really turn around her reaction to seeing the Terminator who killed her son again is one of the few really human moments in the film and I think it's played really well I love the scene where she explains that she was always terrified of keeping pictures of John when she was alive sure that it would just give Skynet an advantage but now that he's dead she's forgetting what his face even looked like that's the kind of thing that I really wanted more of from this movie and it's what genre and sci-fi stories I think can really do with their best take these massive larger-than-life situations and stakes and find something that feels real and devastating in them but with giant franchise blockbusters like this those are often few and far between oh and of course I have to talk about Arne himself I really loved his performance here a lot more than Genesis Schwarzenegger was never a great actor but he was always the perfect terminator and as he's aged a lot of his best performances have really taken on this sense of haunted loss and regret the weathered look of a man who's seen too much and he used that well in one of his best roles in recent years 2015's Maggie and here he's finally really able to apply that to the Terminator now he's not the exact same one that he played in t2 but he kind of reads as the ultimate result of the humanity that he began to learn in that film now he can still be a killing machine when the circumstances call for it but he's come to genuinely care about people while never totally being able to come off as fully human there's still some humor to him too but it actually works because it feels like it comes from a believable character driven place unlike a lot of the more cartoonish gags in Rise machines or Genesis but in the end is the Terminator franchise just doomed well looking at the box office results for dark fate that seems more than possible they went back to this well one too many times and audiences have just gotten tired of it and the sad thing is I think they actually had a great sequel to Terminator 2 already and one that I haven't touched on yet Terminator the Sarah Connor Chronicles which ran for two seasons on Fox from 2008 to 2009 starring Lena Headey from Game of Thrones and Summer Glau from Firefly this show kind of turned out to be everything the other T two sequels weren't the show began being more or less what you would expect a Terminator hunting the Connors on a TV budget but it soon grew into something much more interesting than that yeah every t2 sequel kind of negates Sarah Connors claim that there's no fate but what we make for ourselves but this show was the only one of those continuations that actually seemed to care about what that meant as John Sarah and their new Terminator Cameron had to deal with the idea that maybe they are trapped in this cycle where they don't have any control over their lives and a season two goes on things get even stranger like if action is what you're looking for it could be just downright slow at times but it was always in service of some really cerebral sci-fi storytelling that was more engaged with questions about the concept of artificial intelligence than the franchise had ever been before and to top it all off it easily had the best evil terminator since t2 thanks to garret dillahunt the limited budget meant that they leaned more on suspense and had to get creative with the way that they shot action like this memorable scene where the camera is at the bottom of the pool and it's all set to a Johnny Cash song and you know if the show isn't your thing you always have some great comics written by Zac Whedon that came out in 2011 so even less than 10 years ago there was still some real life left in this franchise if you were just willing to look outside the predictable constraints of blockbuster film so maybe the Terminator movies being doomed isn't such a bad thing because there's always a chance that they could find another great second life in another medium but you know I am still really mad about the Sarah Connor Chronicles ending on a cliffhanger you slash captain midnite 23 that's sk l dot s h slash captain midnite 23 nu 1940 play patrols you'd better hurry up and join at once because there's a big adventure ahead the thing to do now is to get started because we're going to have not only barrels of fun but loads of free gifts and prizes
