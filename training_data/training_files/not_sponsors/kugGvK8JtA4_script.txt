the only bits of there's a dude playing a trumpet nice graceful huh you're getting a getting in and out of this car is one of its more challenging aspects is where's my seat belt I found it been wine and the ladies and gentlemen this is a what 2014 2014 BMW i8 I would argue that this is the greatest bargain supercar on the market right now brand new these in 2014 would run you about $150,000 and right now the new BMW i8 is also around that and if you want to get the BMW i8 roadster you're talking more like one hundred and seventy thousand has an interesting spot in the market yeah it appeals to everybody in terms of looks like everyone would think wow I'd like that car but given if somebody walked up to you gave you $200,000 and said here spend this on a car I don't know how many would spend it on this like this is a car if it were $70,000 like use price I can see myself buying it yeah I honestly can because when you show up in this thing people like oh wow you look like a gamester is showing up in this thing like this is a such a gangster's car yeah just the way that the doors pop up like it is the car to use on a rap video on a budget you stylin if you drive car 3 2 1 [Music] 6360 Wow it doesn't have the pickup that it's an electric car has yeah it has a little bit of a lag it'll lag there when you stop it that still felt quick it didn't feel lightning like I feel like the both the model 3 and the the Evora yeah felt faster and I definitely think the model 3 was slower yeah but it felt faster because that instant torque that this doesn't have and the Evora was just faster so the looks on this are outrageous it looks like something out of Tron like this is what people thought everybody would be driving by now like in the fear this looks like a concept car that actually made it God just like every angle of this car is good to look at everything like the doors go up they pivot so what does that make them Falcon doors technically yeah I just think they're lambo doors yeah super car doors yeah super car doors got the blue accents on the back and around the sides this one actually has it's got the blue wheels which are aftermarket those are not stock but it's a nice touch I do like that everything is like I there's not a misplaced line on this thing no you've got the the big ol whatever that is reverse hood scoop on the hood you've got the the big window for the hatch everything is just really well-thought-out like looking at this I'm honestly shocked that it's a BMW and BMW people might hate me for saying because every single BMW looked exactly the same I mean I'd agree with that honestly I am a little shocked that this is in fact a BMW yeah I would have liked now he would make something like this yeah it doesn't seem like all the interior it looks BMW oh yeah the console and everything does but the exterior definitely looks distinctly different it's not all that big of a car like it's one of those ones that you see it in videos and it looks bigger than it is in person I feel like yeah this is very much a little sporty coupe yes one thing I will point out you have one cup holder for the whole car so you have a passenger and you want to stop and get McDonald's and you both get a drink one of yous got a hold it yeah especially if you have four people like two in the backseat what are you who are you gonna put in the back so yeah realistically no one's ever gonna send these back seats except for shelter I tried to get in the back seat and we've got I think we've got some video of it yeah let's talk about the - the - it's all digital all digital really cool it's pretty futuristic really cool this like this whole thing feels like a spaceship what's really cool that I like is the different modes you have so I'm gonna shift this into regular like a mode this is the fuel-efficient mode and the dash turns blue when you're an e mode and then if you want to shift it into sport mode it turns red that's cool it gets aggressive and mean-looking yeah and we're gonna go a little zippy [Music] this isn't as slow as people say it is it's not it's still fast it's not bad yeah I think it's important to mention now that we're on this that this car despite its outrageous looks only has a three cylinder engine which is so goofy inside of it it's turbocharged but still it's a turbocharged three-cylinder engine and that pumps 200 and something horsepower to the the rear wheels and completely powers the rear wheels then it has an electric motor that powers the front wheels and combined the electric motor and the three cylinder provide this car with 369 horsepower for again for 150 K for this kind of car for like 369 horsepower that's a little lacking yeah that's like Subaru WRX or for sorry our focus RS horsepower territory and those cars are like third yeah 35 or 40 a thousand dollars is like a third of the price of this car yeah it's half of what this is used yeah and now at five years old man so crazy then again do the focuses doors go up no no they go house I can tell there's a cop behind us or not you look only Yolo once looks vaguely Coppa Sh something that maybe don't eat it a little cool thing heads up display they've got a a speedometer magically appearing over the hood this is kind of cool it even shows the the speed limit for the current road it does so that the heads-up display is connected to the GPS which is built into this little tablet screen thing here which I think is just the right size by the way yes I do to you in theory should never be breaking the law while driving this car yeah always be aware of the speed limit theoretically you should never I will say this as a weird trait get phenomenal mpg that tell us how rageous miles per gallon for what it is this thing and if this affects the practicality of it for sure yeah this with the electric motor and the gasoline motor going at the same time gets like 79 miles to the gallon okay and this can run 18 miles which is nothing but it can run 18 miles alone on the electric power I'm sure that's incredibly sluggish yeah probably but it's so cool that you can do that in an emergency so cool yet in an emergency if you run out of gas you have electricity you're gonna run 18 miles on just the electric power alone like I've said in some previous episodes I am a sucker for luxury like if a car is decently fast and it's comfortable you've made the perfect car congratulations manufacturer yes yeah that's this to me I love it like this I could drive this to working back I could drive it to get groceries and not feel like I'm wasting the cars potential yeah definitely you can do all that and you can drive it fast yeah when you want to have fun pop it in the sports mode you get some fake exhaust note it goes quickly the heads-up display tells you you're speeding yeah it's kind of cool like it really can do a lot of different stuff I can serve a lot of a lot of different purposes yeah the only fault is the price yeah honestly and it's why I think partially why this has depreciated so hard because they don't sell very well new because no one's interested in paying 150 grand for a car that's this slow yeah and that only has a three cylinder engine it doesn't sound like a supercar because why would you at 150 grand buy this went for that same price pretty much you could get a mclaren 570s yeah it looks just as cool as this does and goes way faster and sounds way better does yeah the brand-new Mustang GT will go faster than this and be half the price yeah of the used one you used 2014 you have the used 2014 a brand new 2019 Mustang GT would be half the price and it would be faster one of those is a purpose-built muscle car this thing is like an exercise in futuristic what cars could look like yeah it's a luxurious concept Road car yes this thing it does multiple different roles it's fast but also it's very luxurious and nice on the inside yeah it perhaps an enormous amount of attention much more than any Mustang don't ever get much more than I would argue anything at this price point oh yeah I'd say out of all the cars we've driven this would turn the most hits yeah I think it actually does there were some some road workers back there and they were looking at it every time we went by yeah I think this attracts more attention than the Lotus yeah I agree it's like this car I used to work at Best Buy fun store for all you guys but every time or many times I went to work there was this beautiful I ate in the parking lot and I would walk past that and I would just stare at it every single time that it was parked there it's like a sculpture yeah it's gorgeous and there's nothing wrong with the car you can make a lot of comparisons between this and the DeLorean both were more artistic statements I feel like then performs that performance cars because the DeLorean is a very slow car oh yeah and it's very poor handling it's just like a very poor performance car but it's very cool-looking even today in 2019 I still think the DeLorean is a cool-looking car this is a better car than the DeLorean was yeah I think this is better in today's world that the DeLorean was in the world of the 80s oh yeah it was really this car did everything that the DeLorean tried to do but couldn't quite pull off I think [Music] nice try copper you won't get me I know what the speed limit is thanks to my heads-up display so to the ratings we're rating in here today because it's a little windy outside yeah and we want to spare you guys that Buffett a terrible audio so starting off first on the performance yep I would say it's plenty fast for your average person yeah I would say it's a little lacking for your speed freak I would give this thing I'd give it a seven that's exactly what I was thinking yeah actually it was a seven the handling is great oh you like going around corners and turns it's fun I was prepared to be disappointed by how this car performs I was too but that wasn't the case I'm very much enjoying it and next up is practicality yeah on the one side yeah this gets a really good gas mileage yeah which bumps up the practicality score but on the negative side the back seats are worthless basically not a savanna non-existent do your storage capacity in here is also almost worthless you can't roll almost anything on this maybe a backpack maybe yeah you could have like I mean you can throw some stuff in the back yeah and throw maybe a couple backpacks in the back you can't fit a suitcase in that bag I think I'm gonna go with a three on the practicality score for this I don't want to knock it too much but it's not practical it has less storage than like the front of the Tesla yeah [Music] three and a half three and three and a half can't write must accelerate then we move on a value next which I think it's an excellent value used is price absolutely that's the cash yeah this whole the whole premise of this episode is would you take this car used and depreciated I don't know how to fairly rate that because I'm also a little worried that since this is depreciate it so badly already yeah and of about five year timespan this has lost more than 50% of its value you know the five years will be worthless yeah who knows how it's gonna continue to depreciate in the next five years which has me a little worried and it's also a BMW so you know like parts are gonna be expensive to fix and maintain it's also a hybrid and as complicated technology which will also become outlaws like it's gonna get updated like Tesla right I like the value but I'm also a little hesitant about it to be honest Singh give it a five and a half I was thinking about a five I'll probably stick with a five alright and then there's cool factor which yeah I think that I think it's a 10 no no hesitation for sure I I don't even think I have any hesitation there I'm not afraid to give this a 10 on cool factor no way undeniably exceptionally cool car yeah next up is quality which i think is quite hot very good very good there's nothing here that feels like it's gonna break a couple plastic key pieces but even those are nice yeah that's all nice it's all like leather trim I think that the interior experience that rolls performs is much more than just the how you feel inside it's also what you hear because Rolls Royces from my knowledge have like almost no wind noise yeah they sound quiet this does - to be fair like this is a pretty quiet card right it's not rolls quiet but it's not totally quiet you do hear road noise you do hear tires you do hear stuff but overall I would say the quality in this is good I probably go with a 6.5 that's that's lower than I would have thought well okay let me give it a seven and a half yeah let me put that on paper because I think they're gonna stick to a very nice presentation everything is clean orderly comfortable you know what no I'll go I'll actually move mine up to a seven I was looking back I gave the Lotus of six and I do think that this has a better interior yeah this definitely has a better interior than the Lotus and moving on next to the fun factor I feel like I thought the Lotus was more fun than this yes it's a manual and it has more horsepower and it's faster it's more engaging it's a more driver-oriented car yeah that being said this is not boring that's not gonna no it's certainly not boring I'm gonna give this one a seven and a half two all right honestly seven and a half from JC I don't really think you would take this to a track I mean there's nothing stopping you from doing it but yeah I don't think you'd have as good a time the Lotus would definitely be more fun on the track than this it's just faster in my opinion it handles better yeah you're right it's not quite as fun right as a perfect think'll I think I would give the fun factor on this 6.5 also can I say that I was adjusting mine to seven and who didn't but I can mark that down squirrel don't you do a boy oh man good we saved the day almost killed squirrel chase Lakes are very good yeah there we go break test so we've averaged the scores all together and our final score out of what it's six out of sixty points out of sixty points is a perfect ten on everything our average score is a thirty nine point five which is the highest rating of any car we've driven at all the ones we've done so far higher than the Lotus Evora which was the highest until we drove this and kind of glad of that honestly I am - my god it's this car is an anomaly despite the fact that there are far better cars you can buy for the money and despite the fact that neither of us would buy this car anywhere near list price I'm still very much in love with this car yeah I would agree I love this thing anyway this is your first time watching thanks for tuning in make sure you catch all of our other episodes to see all the other fun cars we've reviewed and hopefully we'll have an even better car in the next one yep peace you know sometimes when I've content sign up for your free trial by visiting curiosity stream comm slash GTA
