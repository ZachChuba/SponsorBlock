so antibiotic Awareness Week and I wanted help spread the awareness by telling you what you can do to help prevent antibiotic resistance so antibiotics are medicines used to treat and in certain cases to prevent bacterial infections antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria changed in response to the use of these medicines it is a bacteria and not the humans or the animals taking the antibiotics that become antibiotic resistant these bacteria may infect humans and animals and the infections they cause are harder to treat than those caused by non resistant bacteria so antibiotic resistance leads to higher medical costs prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality and this antibiotic resistance is accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics so basically not taking full course when you have correctly been prescribed them or taking them when you absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely do not need them like when you take them because your knee is acting out or you have the flu and as well as our poor infection prevention and control can cause antibiotic resistance there are many many things we can all do to try and reduce the impact and limit the spread of resistance number one only use antibiotics when prescribed by a certified health care professional number two never ever ever ever ever ever ever demand antibiotics if your health worker says you do not need them most doctors know better than to give in to ridiculous demands like that but I have heard of some prescribing them just to get the patient out the door so don't ask or don't even suggest antibiotics unless your doctor has confirmed or is very certain that you have a bacterial infection I mean the Center for Disease Control has said that at least 30 percent of antibiotic courses prescribed in the outpatient setting are on sorry meaning that no antibiotic was needed at all and most of this unnecessary use it spread things like acute respiratory conditions such as cold bronchitis or throats caused by viruses and even some signs near infections number three never share for God's sakes never share or use leftover antibiotics this is something but I hear about far too often antibiotics are not one-size-fits-all there are specific antibiotics for specific infections they target different aspects of different bacteria so one type of antibiotic may not treat the bacterial infection you think you have number four prevent infections from happening in the first place by regularly washing your hands preparing food hygienic ly avoiding close contact with sick people on by getting vaccinated number five if you have pets or animals only give antibiotics to them under veterinary supervision and this goes for any sort of medication - don't give them anything unless you've been told to by your vet and don't oh my gosh don't give them human medication that is a massive massive bugbear of mine that's a whole nother kettle of fish and that's it those little things aren't that hard to do and if you do do them then we all be better off and when the World Health Organization recently reported that tuberculosis or TB is the number one global infectious disease killer today causing 1.8 million deaths per year so to put that into perspective that's kind of like almost 40% of the population of Ireland dying from TB every year and then we have drug-resistant TB and that's the most common and lethal airborne antibiotic resistant disease worldwide today and it's responsible for a quarter of a million deaths each year and what's worse is that only two new antibiotics for treatment of multi drug-resistant TB have reached the market in over 70 years research and development investment in TB is seriously underfunded and it is at its lowest level since 2008 so 10 years it's so easy to sit there and hear and figures and kind of shrug it off but the thing is is that there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't get it to the BCG vaccine is only really effective for kids the BCG is either you already probably know the vaccination against TB and it is only really effective against severe forms of the disease such as TB meningitis and children but it is not as effective against all forms of TB and I kind of doesn't really work once you turn 35 people who are over 25 aren't where they offer the vaccination so be warned so there are so many facts premium subscription to the first 200 people so go check them out and if you like this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe and if you want to further support the channel through patreon you can Weig following the link down below in the description thank you for watching bye
