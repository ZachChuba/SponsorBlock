imagine someone made a sailboat you were like I want a sailboat and they said sailboat cost a million dollars because we only make sailboats every feature imagine and you were like but I don't need the air-conditioned glovebox the automated cereal dispensers in the waterproof pogo sticks yeah those don't come cheap wait is that a shark catapult you just want a good simple boat that sails really well and won't fall apart in a year or two assuming you got the drivers to install properly oh not that that did it's right here I am looking directly at the boat well I've got some good news welcome release their new boat or been displayed this week and it strips away many of the features from its larger more expensive siblings while keeping that Wacom drawing experience they're known for intact and they were kind enough to send me this one to review sponsor detected down below in the description thank you dot site the Cintiq 22 is a pen display it's a giant monitor that you plug into your Windows or Mac computer that you can draw on using the included or or pen stylus thing in the box you have the display itself the cords you need to connect this to your computer like the USB cord the HDMI cord and also the power cords oh yeah you also have the pen and the instructions legal information and also a stand the good news here is the price $1,200 is still a lot of money but it's half the cost of the pro model and it's only three hundred dollars more than Hui on similarly SPECT canvas Pro 22 that I reviewed just last week and right now you're probably thinking wow $300 is still a big price difference and it is but almost all other welcomes products are around three times more than their competitors it's looking more and more like this is Wacom strategy going forward to create two different classes of products their proline which packs in all those high-end features that they can fit into those display tablets and then their non proline which scales down some of those features so they can release products at a lower price point and compete directly with the who yawns and XP pens of the world earlier this year we saw the Cintiq 16 which is their first screen tablet to go down this path and now they released this this Cintiq 22 looking at the Cintiq pro 24 versus this new Cintiq 22 the specs jump out at you the pro has a 4k screen this one the 22 has an HD screen so if you jump up to that Pro Line you're gonna get four times as many pixels as you're gonna get on the Cintiq 22 the pro screen is also laminated cutting back on parallax lamination or screen bonding as it's often called reduces the space between the glass and the screen below it think of it this way when your pen tip hits that screen there is space between where the pen tip hits the glass and the screen underneath it or where that cursor is appearing underneath your pen tip this is what artists refer to when they talk about parallax now the Pro versions laminated screen has greatly reduced that space so they've almost entirely removed parallax this gives you a lot more drawing accuracy especially when you move away from the center of the screen it's not like the tablet is actually less accurate along the edges it just seems that way just because the way you're looking at it if you look at it from an angle that cursor is just gonna seem more offset then it looks when you're looking straight on it the pro also has features like USBC thunderbolt support which the 22 does not have this connects with an HDMI cable and a standard USB cable so those are the big differences between the Cintiq Pro and this but what are the benefits comparing something like this to say who yawns latest 22 inch canvas pro tablet this is very similar to it if I had to highlight things there are two differences the first is the new who Leon has added a laminated screen which I mentioned before that is a pretty big upgrade especially when you're talking about accuracy the second big difference here though is the Wacom Pro pen - it is the same pro pen with most of what comes products including the entire pro line if you're in the group of people who want Wacom is quality and their brand name but can't afford that $2,500 display and Wow yeah there are a lot of you in that group that's where this comes in ultimately what is the number one thing I look for in a drawing tablet or pen display it's the quality of the lines the accuracy that I get from the pen in the pro pen - here is our gold standard I want the best pen well here it is this this is the one even though the competitor made great strides in recent years this is the measuring stick that they all use to see how much better they are and to see how much they have improved so let's take a closer look at the display itself it's full HD that's 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels it has a 72% NTSC color spectrum and there is an anti glare treatment on the screen overall this display gets the same critique I give most HD monitors of this size the HD resolution on a 13 or 16 inch screen doesn't look bad they're smaller and having that many pixels condensed into a smaller area looks crisper it looks better it doesn't look bad but when you take that resolution that 1920 by 1080 and you expand it up to something the size of this it loses a lot of that crispness especially in a drawing tablet because this isn't a monitor that's sitting on your desk a few foot away I mean you can prop it up that way and a lot of people will but when you're drawing you are right on top of this you you can see every pixel you're not that far away from it but when you think about cost those high-res screens that's where these things get expensive so that's the trade-off you're making to save money you may not need that 4k screen but boy is it nice to have I did want to check out the colors on this so I took some time out to color calibrate this thing to bring it in line with my max screen my own brand Brad yellow is notorious for changing saturations from one monitor to the next I got it to look pretty close to my max monitor I did mention before that there is a matte coating on this it's an anti-glare coating that is going to dull the colors but overall I felt like the color was pretty accurate to my max screen I should also point out that this coating is less grainy than the etched glass that you find on the Cintiq pro's and this is something I've seen other people mentioned in their reviews that they hate about the Cintiq proline is that it uses that edged glass which refracts light in such a way that creates a grainy look to the screen and there are some reasons why Wacom has use that on their higher-end tablet's one is durability h-class isn't going to scratch the way a coating will and the second reason is drawing quality it just feels good to draw on it it has that paper like texture now like I mentioned the Cintiq 22 doesn't have the etch glass it goes with the coating that still feels really good to draw on will also not have that grain it will dull your colors however this it's a trade off I personally hate drawing on glossy screens even though they do look better they do look crisper the colors do look better it's just too slick I don't like drying on it another thing I noticed right away is this entire thing it's really heavy so let's talk about this pen the pro pen - oh wait I already I already did didn't I I got excited like I said this pen is the gold standard the only thing that I think stands toe-to-toe with this is probably the Apple pencil it's hard to do a comparison since you're dealing with different apps and different operating systems and there's just a lot of variables there but but one thing that most artists who have used both will agree on is that they're both great this pen has two customizable buttons along the side and it also has an eraser around the back flip it around you can erase with it pretty cool there's also a pen holder doodad clips into the side it can clip into either side has this little loop you can stick your pen in it and if you open it on up there's some hidden replacement nibs in there for when your current pen tip wears down so let's jump over the pen test I'll show you the kinds of things that I look for in a stylus so the first thing I look for is I like to grab a nice pen tool and I like to do really light lines and I slowly apply pressure just to see what the pressure curve looks like and to see how it performs I want to know if I'm using medium pressure around curves or something can I hold that level of pressure can I hold light pressure could I hold heavy pressure can I hold that like medium pressure and I like to see where blows out if the pressure curve is blowing out anywhere in particular and how much variation basically that I'm getting with ink lines those are the type of things I'm looking for when I start playing around with pressure the next thing I look for is line quality like I like to do a lot of fast strokes and I like to see how they taper I like to see if I'm getting any check marks at the bottom of my strokes or anything like that now one thing I do notice in sketchbook is the the quick tapering is a little less natural than it is say in Photoshop or I'm usually using it but for the most part I think this pen tests pretty much the way I expect it to it feels like every other Wacom drawing experience that I've had with the pro pen - the other thing I'm really looking for is those slow angled lines if I'm getting any wave I'm getting any jitter if I'm getting anything that looks mechanical now these are hand drawn not with a straight edge so obviously there's gonna be some jitter there's gonna be some wiggle especially just because I'm using my hand so that is why we usually bring in a ruler to test it but usually you can get a feel for it there's a difference between your hand shaking and just the natural movement of your hand trying to draw a straight line and mechanical jitter which is going to be more like a pattern or more like a wave formation when you're drawing a slow diagonal line then it's going to be just an organic looking line so let's let's take a look at this with our ruler drawing very slowly just to see what we get and there we go I should probably use something that has a little less pressure sensitivity because this pen can really woo get thick but for the most part we can see that we're getting a very very straight line a super straight line which is exactly what I'm looking for and what I expect out of this display tablet so there we go there's another one of those lines there's another one of those goofy tapers at the end of it too since I draw a lot of line work that is what I'm looking for and that is what I expected to get right here out of the below and the code Brad : let's spend a minute on this stand one of the really cool features for a price conscious tablet buyer is the inclusion of a stand that was one of my criticisms of the Cintiq 16 earlier this year you had to buy a stand extra so having a pretty solid stand right here in the box is great the stand has a lever all on the back so you pull on the lever and you can adjust it to pretty much any height you want and at the lowest angle I'd say 15 20 degrees I'm bad at telling degrees it's still really solid this is something that I've seen in other pen displays they get kind of tippy as they go down that's that's not the case here this is rock solid it's not going anywhere you can also take the stand off and mount any standard VESA mount to the back of this thing as far as software goes this is using the same drivers as the Cintiq pros and the Wacom Intuos line I can just plug any Wacom device into my computer since I already have the software suite in here and it just works now this is probably one of the things that only like six other people in the entire world appreciate but I love this and I think this consistency and their drivers and their software makes it feel more stable than it did a couple years ago it has been a long long time since I've had any problems with Wacom drivers on Windows or on a Mac so for me this was like crazy easy to set up I already had everything installed I plug this thing in and it just worked this is also good because the drivers have been around for a while so they've been able to work through a lot of the bugs and problems that may have existed when they first started rolling these things out around the time of the Cintiq Pro 16 let's move on to the pros and cons the pros it is big it is a big screen and generally speaking the more space you have to draw on the better it is and you have plenty of room to draw here plenty of room for all your tools and all your interface elements plenty of room to hit all those little interface things checkboxes resize sliders all those little fiddly things it'll just make you nuts on a smaller drawing tablet display all of that is super easy to hit on a really big screen like this the other Pro is obviously the pen I feel like I keep talking about the pen but but really I mean that's that is the major thing that you're going in for when you get a display like this and what about the cons there were actually more cons here than I expected so I'm gonna break these down first of all I really wish we saw Wacom get a laminated screen on this that's where all their competitors are going and this feels a little bit behind the times 2019 is the year of the laminated screen we're seeing Hui on XP pen rolling these out on their 16 inch tablets earlier this year now we're starting to see it rolled out on some of their larger screens and I understand Wacom wants ways to differ she ate this unit from their pro-level unit but I still think you could have pulled off lamentation or lamination and just saved features like the 4k screen and use that as is your big differentiation to justify the price the other con for me is the lack of hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts this was the one problem with this design that made it kind of not fun to use especially early on when I was just getting used to it and this is the one thing I really really missed Wacom hasn't released a screen tablet with hotkeys on it for years so there was no surprise here I didn't expect it to have it instead they've been going the route with their hotkey remote it's extra it comes packed in the box with the 24 pro so I have one it does not come with this it does not come with this antique 22 it's an extra hundred dollars if you want to pick one up so this is nothing new why am i bringing it up at all well this display is big it is a 22 inch display it sucks up most of your desk space it is wider than a full-length keyboard for me it meant my keyboard was sitting behind the display while I was using it usually only half my keyboard was visible to me because the display was like blocking most of it so I couldn't see the keys and some of the keys just weren't accessible like it just couldn't wrap my arm around it to hit them the way I needed to I could move the whole thing off to the side but then I'm reaching way over to the side or my arms resting in an uncomfortable way in order to hit those keys on a regular basis I'm always hitting command Z to undo or I'm using our keyboard shortcuts to like change brush size flip between my eraser and my brush grab different tools all that stuff pan around the drawing and I don't like to look to see where I'm going to do that I like to either rest my hand on a keyboard or rest my hand on hot keys that I programmed myself that everything is where I needed to be that's a huge part of my workflow so this is where that shortcut remote comes in and I did use it here and it works great i sat it next to this display and it did work better than using the keyboard but it still wasn't great I really wish that it's sat comfortably on the display itself in this case when it was set it pretty much any drawing angle it slides right off when it's in the drawing position the Cintiq pros they have magnets and those magnets prevent this from sliding away I really wish they had included those here even if they weren't as powerful something to keep the remote in place since there are no other shortcut keys my point here and why didn't find this as fun to use is that I never really found a comfortable workflow a good place for the remote to sit that was intuitive where I didn't have to look at it or think about and whenever I needed to undo something changed from a racer to brush change brush size zoom in and out pan around I had to look away from my artwork looked down at my remote to see what I was pressing all because it wasn't sitting in a comfortable place where I could form that muscle memory those shortcut keys become second nature to you and become part of that drawing flow that gets you into the work that you're doing and with this I just never really got into that flow so overall I this thing gets a good great you get your Wacom pen on a display that won't break the bank well not break it as bad and ultimately what is the most important part of drawing out one of these it's the quality of the pen that drawing experience here you have that the same propensity to get a much more expensive displays like I mentioned before with the cons there are improvements I'd love to see in the next iteration specifically integration with the hot key remote and a laminated screen but overall I think this is a great move for Wacom a lot of folks are gonna be happy to pay a little more to get the Wacom pen in the brand name although I think if it had those little improvements I think a lot more people would say hey I will pay a little bit more and get the Wacom if you guys have any comments or questions let me know down in the comments section and if you found this review
