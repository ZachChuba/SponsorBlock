all right 2020.24.6.9 first time on this software version let's get going this ought to be an interesting drive i already checked the map and there's going to be traffic i know that there's an accident that's clearing but this is the first time i've had traffic on the dc beltway in quite a while and that's kind of one of the challenges of doing this route is the traffic because of covet 19 hardly anybody's been on the road but let's see how we do today whoa entering a way too fast in that corner actually it seemed to handle it all right though faster than i would have gone that's for sure and this version of software is very sensitive with the with the wheel i've got my little special autopilot autopilot buddy but it's um it's asking for a lot of confirmation that somebody's there that's for sure more than previous software versions all right that's signaling again we're moving over well this is a high speed corner and turn if you see and see if i get over the express lanes this first time around i don't think so it never has before yes i wouldn't expect it now it's signaling up it canceled all right it bumped the speed up it was set at 57 it bumped it up itself to 62. signaling left not going it canceled again i don't know what it's thinking now i've got the new computer get the hardware 3.0 suite all together now we've got the full self-driving computer and also mcu-2 we used to have mcu-1 that's what came with my car i have to pay for the upgrade infotainment upgrade is what they call but it's a way better central computer here auto poly computers over there on the glove box all right now generally what happens if you guys have watched before is that my car will try to merge over here on the next entry to the express lanes but it won't do it because usually by the time it makes up his mind to do that this dotted line over here on the left tends to turn solid so it doesn't do it and there's these crash attenuators are always going out over here people are always hitting them hopefully it will not be me usually we'll get into the second i can see how it goes solid up here it probably will try to if it's done in the past but it'll do it too late let's see yeah too late see it's solid there's a new crash attenuator there for us whoa we got close to that all right now let's let's see if it uh goes over this next time like it usually does and drop the speed down to 60 miles an hour in this area that's what it's set up now i bumped it up to 62. i don't know i'm not sure why it's doing that i've never seen it so quickly change speeds like that maybe it's doing it based on what it sees down the road i don't know this could be a another part of this new software update that things that little things like this oh this crash 10 units messed up someone's hit it all right we made that pretty smooth see someone hit that one we've got a car on our left a van this is a difficult acceleration lane there's not much of an acceleration lane here just disappears all of a sudden we're signaling which is nice because in the past it has never signaled for that it's just done it so it knows a lot more or at least it's programmed to use a lot more information that it's probably always had which is good and you guys i have plenty of groups plenty of groups look down in the in the description below all kinds of links different tesla groups one for each model we got a cyber truck group in there we got tsla stock discussion we even have the neo stock discussion that thing's been going crazy recently up and down it's skyrocketed up and now it's it's been neo has almost been cut in half it seems like i don't know it's reason hi anyway i'm a neo stock owner and a tsla stock owner if you see my videos in the past you know that i've got videos on that you can search up the channel a digital nomad type in tsla stock or neo stock you'll see when i bought how much i paid all that good stuff so even though it's gone down i've still done well definitely done well which is good and of course we have plenty of videos here where you can see the history of this specific course that we do around the dc beltway just go and type in the title with a digital nomad all one word add that and then take away the software version and the episode number and you'll see all the different episodes of this one according you can see here on the the map we're going to hit the the traffic right down in uh this area off the 270 spur to the 495 beltway if you guys are familiar that's where the traffic's going to set in and we've got autopilot's got to set 60 miles an hour right now and it's weird that's going up and down on its own which is great i'm just not expecting that maybe it's a new feature and always you know tesla you just don't announce new features in the software updates and every time i get a software update i do a video and i roll through and talk about you know how it was to install this update and also go through the update notes but a lot of times like on this software version there are there are notes but they're just copies of the previous version and it doesn't list anything other than it says at the end the little disclaimer minor fix and fixes and bug bug fixes and changes it's usually related to the autopilot system auto park autopilot sometimes the charging profile those types of things they don't ever really tell you about those updates when they're uh relatively minor anyway they only really announce major updates all right so we're set at 60 miles an hour i might bump us up there we go let's do a little 63. you'll notice that if you've ever been in an snx versus three and y the steering wheel is a regular size in snx and it's much smaller and three and y and you know why that is because there's no center display there's no there's no driver front display that has to open up in the in the wheel so that you can see it that's why you can make a much smaller steering wheel so that that gives it a little bit different sporty feel that is not in the s and x and it is more those are more nimble cars as well but they're not as big and they don't have air suspension available from the factory all right i don't see anybody yet the traffic is kind of going away that's what i've i checked the internet when i saw that on the map they said it's it was an accident that was cleared up on the outer loop of the beltway right before we get to the american legion bridge it'll give a little signal here yep a little signal so we know that we are going to the right i'm not sure the choice of lanes here there is somebody behind me it dropped the speed down to 60 i don't know what okay changing lights out of passing there is somebody over there they're way over there okay they're two lanes over it's okay they're in the middle pavement you can hear those tires on that bmw suv i don't like milk pavement people tend to kick up rocks is get caught up in little little rocks little pieces of asphalt get caught up in your tires and go flying up here we go we're slowing down dramatically all right oh we got signal lane change signal all right we're signaling autopilot doesn't like that i don't know how far they can see down the road autopilot is letting this car go in front of me oh that's a little bit of a heavy brake pedal there and we're going to be sucking soft and go traffic unless autopilot can get us over one more lane fast but that one looks like it's probably slowing too but again things are picking up but we're gonna be in some traffic so let's see how it handles dc traffic back in it yeah cause if you look at some of my previous video videos from way way back way back when there's all kinds of traffic videos what is this man doing he's over trying to pass somebody on the shoulder it looks like it's dc for you little impatient drivers that's just normal right we're coming to a stop nice and smooth to stop there just about as smooth as anybody could do it are under the overpass the bridge yeah it looks like we're in the worst of it right now it's just like a ripple and let's say it gets better down past river road where the actual accident was that's already cleared we're just still stuck in the traffic ripple which is look which is good i'd like to see how autopilot behaves in this so far you know these things usually pop up as a surprise and it was a surprise and i i think it handled it well let me know in the comments what you think i remember doing a video here and showing this merge language there's a merge lane on the right that comes in and and then actually we lose the lane on the right so it's actually two merges and the original software i got or earlier early versions of it with the ap2 that i used to have it came with the car which was you know cutting edge at that point it never gave way never yielded to anybody if someone was was uh in that acceleration lane and they were trying to get in it would never stop it would plow right into them there was a number of accidents that were that were actually caused because of that because it was aggressive and i could tell and tell that i made many videos where i showed that i had to slam on the brake basically to avoid hitting a vehicle that was merging in especially in stop-and-go traffic like this it would not let them in and it was just going to hit him if i didn't really match that brake pedal but if you didn't have autopilot two in the early days like i did three and a half years ago you don't know what i'm talking about and it's probably better you have to be so attentive back then you're still to be attentive but not as attentive it's a much better system these days and of course i got the same car i've had for three and a half years and 130 233 000 miles i believe something like that that's because we've got time let's take a look 131 982 we're going right into the sun here actually i might put my hat on and move the camera a little bit on doing that it's because i'm getting full sun on me and you can because of the of the full giant ginormous windshield on the model like you can get a sunburn no problem look there's the sun right there see right into the windshield it doesn't stop but i have does that line there is my tent line i tinted the top i would highly recommend that i've still received the sunburn even with having it tinted like that believe it or not so you got to wear a hat like you're in a convertible at least if you have sensitive skin anyway if you're sensitive to sunburn i definitely am it's doing a really good job of slowing up sorry all the way around slowing down speeding up kind of feathering the petals using some finesse it's not perfect but it's really really good it is so much better than it used to be it was nice just to have something where i didn't have that constantly be working the petals in the beginning but it was not the smooth this is almost like a buttery smooth almost they've definitely done some work on the code the processors are faster i mean i don't know it could have been the upgrade that i did with the the computers mcu2 all this stuff makes it more smooth and less ones and zeros digital choppy type stuff like where you have a processor that barely keeps up and i i'm really i'm really wondering if mcu-1 can be used with all the full self-driving features they're almost all complete now but elon even promises that it will be level five i don't see how it's gonna be doing level five but with the mcu one but those will all burn out anyway you guys probably know that i got lots of videos on that check out the channel about the tesla computer the memory chip on it they the mcu-1 which was built in all tesla's until about 2000 summer 2017 some 2018 something like that but before i bought my it's after i bought mine mine was ordered places late december 2016 march delivery 2017. so i got mcu one and that had been used all the way since 2012 the old computer same order and had a very limited life span on the re write rewrites on the memory the flash memory that was on there and that would be the achilles heel it would go out and you'd have to replace everything i think the screen everything but this one must not be attached to the screen because they forgot to replace my screen i saw the yellowing screen over here they forgot to replace it when they did my mcu upgrade and they owe me a screen now so i would get that and i wonder if it's a non-yellowing screen i wonder we'll see over time i also think that the yellowing and non-yellowing stuff is a result of just getting so hot you know how it gets real hot in the car in the cabin you know it sometimes you can get to 130 140 degrees no problem and that'll destroy all kinds of stuff and i think that's what ends up happening so just don't park in the sun use your remote on your app to keep the temperature cool even the cabin overheat don't trust it because cabin overheat at least the way the software is right now it only lasts for 12 hours after you park after that it will allow it to get to i guess any temperature it wants so you've got to keep an eye definitely keep an eye when i park outside especially now there's lots of superchargers in the past i couldn't really run the ac that much if i wasn't in the car because there just weren't that many places to charge way back when you know three three and a half years ago when i got it but now there's superchargers everywhere it's awesome don't worry about this at all the biggest concern i have is making sure i drain that battery down before i get to the supercharger because there's so many chargers now you may never lower that battery and you do want to cycle through it you don't you want to have as few charging cycles as possible i got some videos on that about what's best for your battery but generally you know you want to go up to eighty percent and then down to twenty percent and charge only at those times that that'll be best because you only have like three to four thousand cycles before the battery pack goes bad any batteries with today's chemistries only have about that long so you don't want to plug your if you're the kind of person that goes back to your house and plug your car in every night i wouldn't do it i would not do it batteries don't like to be kept you know they like to be exercised i like to be used just like anything else and it will affect the lifespan if you're charging every day and you don't need to one of the things that has the newer software updates have done for us i've noticed on this beltway course is that when we get across the american legion bridge in the virginia and we have to get back over the local lanes to make that first actually the second exit you the only way to get it is to get on local lanes if you don't get on local lanes right away you miss it uh it didn't used to do that until the last couple of videos we've done and when the update when the software updates the newer software updates happen it's letting it it's knowing that it has to signal and get onto the local lanes it didn't even know enough to do that it didn't even try in the past so it's learning you know this the programmers the code writers are writing in more code it's definitely figuring this stuff out and we're seeing it over time that's why i'm doing these videos that's why i've got them all numbered software version numbers in there for you as well you've got several years of history now on most of these courses that i'm doing and i'm trying to pick difficult challenging courses not just driving straight down the road on my way to work or whatever this is obviously not your simple straightforward spot right here dc beltway traffic friday afternoon 407 pm and it gets worse than this because it's just this is still a lot of people are still working from home because the coke 19 looks like a little fender bender there yeah they must have someone tapped on the brakes and someone wasn't paying attention accidents lead to more accidents and that white car is trying to turn in my car i don't know i don't know if there's any logic in the system where i can tell that someone's signaling i have no idea but doesn't seem to be doing much with that person a person still hasn't been able to turn in there's a broken down car no that was a tesla that'd be nothing wrong with it but people would stop and ask what's wrong show the engine trouble this is if there was something wrong with the front motor you could apparently you can still drive a tesla even if one of the motors is out front or rear i'm sure it won't drive the same but supposedly you can still drive it we're gonna have to get over two lanes at some point but it's still not for another probably two miles that we really need to do that another broken down vehicle there's left and right they're all over the place this is not helping traffic i'm sure these accident scenes tend to be like a magnet for broken down vehicles because anybody can drive at a constant speed on the highway as easy as driving the world then you start to stop and go and something goes wrong all right upcoming lane change you see that a little blue rectangle there it's telling me it's going to make a right turn soon which i knew and it's going to be early this is going to be earlier than it's ever done it before we should be getting out of this heavier heaviest stuff pretty soon you can see on the map the light it's a lighter color red in front of us instead of really dark red and then it turns to uh an orange so it's lightening up this might have been the worst and last stop we'll see another car civic i used to have one of those but i had an older one i had a 92 and i drove that thing for 20 years same original owner drove for 20 years still have the car actually if anybody wants to restore a classic or turn to electric i've got it it just needs a new engine gas engine as far as i know it through a rod but at you know 20 years and almost 400 000 miles it was time for a new car didn't even bother to do anything other than a guy at the honda dealer looked at it and tried to crank it and said he thought it had thrown a rod so that was it and just got a towed and it's kept being kept indoors somewhere in a secret location yeah we we usually start that first right turn just about here so i guess it was giving us a signal because usually you're going 60 miles an hour on this road it's still there saying it's going to make that turn and let's see how it does in this heavy traffic it's about the spot where we make that turn how do you guys think we're doing here let me know in the comments uh i know that you know a few years ago when i was showing these me videos of me in traffic it was it was like an anomaly or just uh what do you call it there's another word for that novelty it was like a novelty item right not anymore a lot of people have seen these but still the value of these videos is that you get to see the progress over time same car same courses just updates in the hardware and software to the vehicle makes all the difference in the world and of course more tesla's on the road so you have that that neural network up there we go that's a good spot if cars let me in we're gonna go and we're gonna go okay autopilot all right i'm gonna take over i'm gonna have to take over because that car is letting me in but autopilot didn't want to do it so i have to take over what do you guys think of that obviously we're not ready for prime time we can't handle something like that that seemed pretty straightforward to me i'm glad that person let me in i don't know why the car didn't go because we've had issues before we had some really congested high speed lane changes much higher than that i'm only going like 10 miles an hour 15 miles an hour i think we're going less than that at the time yeah i really think it should have made that turn i don't know why it didn't make it wasn't able to complete it this is up into the area where the accident took place right over this bridge i think that's where i i was looking online anyway it seemed like it happened right across this bridge it's another broken down vehicle over there yeah pickup truck older ford f series i think now the lines have gone away here see how well it handles this it's just following the car in front of us i guess you must have enough data from all the tesla's driving on this road we don't know exactly how much how the neural networks get going i mean you know there's different systems and i'll have a video actually coming up soon very soon with hassan walla of telenav we've doing a follow-up on level five full self driving and his thoughts and it should be an interesting video because you know a lot of people like i think some of the companies they're working with are using high definition maps in the car for basically limited access highways and they'll be able to use those i guess that's the goal when these high definition maps that they have to keep getting new data on so it's not going to be done in real time tesla's is all vision you know it's all done in real time as if a human was doing it but there are some people like hassan that are very skeptical of anything happening in his lifetime so we're going to find out more details about that soon so be on the lookout for that video there's an acceleration lane and there's one more lane of regular flowing traffic and we eventually have to get into that one up here is usually where the system will try to make that turn happen when we're going into the sunlight you can see the sun is right up there so this is a much longer video how sensitive it is apply slight turning force these last couple of updates up last couple of updates have been very sensitive because i've got my special little well the new one's called a phone holder my this is the old one called autopilot buddy okay there this is a good time to do the change let's see if we it's asking me to do to confirm with a little like force on the wheel which i did that was pretty smooth but it's like i said it asked me to confirm that one i have confirmation off but it's just hyper hyper sensitive right now it you know having done these videos and all these different software versions the sensitivity of the pressure on on the driver's wheel is definitely something that changes with each software iteration it does not stay the same sometimes it's hypersensitive like it is now other times it barely even gives you warnings just depending on the software like when you fix one thing something else happens well that truck is getting close and it knows it needs to get into the local lanes looks like we're going to have moderate traffic all the way to those local lanes because it's orange on the map yes this is a long long one but we got to talk about a lot of things and i'm going to do a video too at some point of the experience with see how some sort of it upgrade to mcu-2 and full self-driving computer denise and i my thoughts about that like a summary video of that because it's been a little while now and i can report on it having had that other computer for almost three and a half years the differences and of course there's a tesla battery day coming up that's going to be fun we will be reporting live on that another crash attenuator smashed oh man this there's accidents happen on those things on a regular basis i'm telling you if you watch these videos you can see so many videos there's brand new ones there then they're all wrecked and there's brand new ones right right it's like a revolving door and of course you know that there was a famous or infamous tesla model like accident in california i think it was on the 405 or someone someone's model x drove straight into one of those almost kicked me off it's getting real sensitive i'm not paying attention enough gotta stop talking to you guys all right this is the american legion bridge whoa we've got merging traffic and we've got to get over we've got to make sure we get onto those local lanes like where'd the lines go wow there's like no lines in the road here oh see where we're yielding my car yielded to that prius now it's it's it's being very sensitive starting back up again i would have a human would have started out faster than that well we're letting the computer do its thing like i said in previous situations my car never would have yielded to these people these guys are they driving off the road no that's an exit only lane i thought maybe that was a driving in the shoulder or something but it's not you can see all the cars there's a tire blown out tire there right my car's being very very sensitive there's a tire big shred of like i guess it's like just truckers with the retreads something like that there's potomac river now we have to get into this local lane hopefully autopilot will get it done we're still set at 63 miles an hour so pretty soon it's going to open it up just got to make sure to signal and jump over yes all right so maybe that's the thing of the past oh man all right well oh interesting let me start it back up again huh maybe it quit on its own something must not have been right there i guess we still don't have it 100 so keep watching this video series we will be doing more videos we will be checking it out now we have to get over two lanes of traffic get off the exit and that's the end of our course i think we're at like 33 minutes already so thanks for hanging with me and definitely like i said let me know your feedback we got lots of uh trying to complete maneuver whoa this ought to be interesting all right it's gonna have to slow me down because i think it knows where i have to get off it's like right here it's gonna miss the exit with this key guy keeps blocking me oh we're getting a solid line whoa just barely made it all right be sure to like share subscribe hit the thumbs up and the bell for notifications and we will see you in the next video i gotta do that manually it wasn't gonna give me all the way over bye
