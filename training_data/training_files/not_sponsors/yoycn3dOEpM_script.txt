hi everyone welcome back to my channel I hope you all are having a great day so far in today's video I'm going to show you how to give this 20 dollar Walmart bookcase a complete makeover if you love married furniture just as much as I do then I know you will enjoy this Walmart hack before we get started with the ahead and get started with the Walmart hack I went to Walmart one day and looked at the furniture selection they hadn't noticed this 3 shelf bookcase I was listed for $30 I thought that was a good price and when I was checking out at the registers actually $20 and placed it on top of the wrong price I was very happy with this purchase you can order this in white or a wooden gray finish if you don't want it black starting off by emptying out the box and look to the pictures for assembly but I never follow this step-by-step process I've always been the type to figure it out by myself instead of reading the instructions it took me about 20 minutes to assemble the bookcase because I didn't read the instructions so make sure you do so that way this piece is a hundred percent secure and you finish faster do any of you do the same and try to figure it out by yourself let me know in the comments [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you so much to everyone who has sent me the sweetest messages and comments in my last video I had so much fun painting and sharing the results with you all if you haven't seen that video yet I'll leave the link to in my description box so you can check it out I'm going to be painting another one so let me know if you want to see another one in silver or gold I wanted to give you a view of how the bookcase looks right now next I'm going to add the back to keep anything from falling out of one side but you can leave it blank if you like this is the back that I'm going to attach to the bookshelf I wanted to add peel-and-stick metallic paper to the back but I didn't find any that I liked so I found these metallic paper sheets from Hobby Lobby they were $1 each because that week they're 50% off so I thought that would be perfect I glued the back of the paper with the glue stick and covered the entire board [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now that the board was covered I grabbed my hammer to nail the board onto the bookcase [Music] if you didn't already know Lowe's has a cutting section in their store for glass and mirror there are some associates that don't even know that they have a cutting section because it's a small space in their stores so they might tell you that they don't have one if that's the case I would ask to speak to managers so they can direct you to their glass cutting sections you will need gorilla construction adhesives to glue the mirrors down and this glue is very strong it holds instantly so you will see me applying the mirror to the sides of the bookcase without the mirrors falling off after you're gluing down the top I took the shelves out from the bookcase and applied a good amount of adhesive to make sure they're very secure [Music] I glued the mirrors straight up instead of laying it on the side so I don't change the mirror to crack you can lay the bookcase on its back if that'll be easier for you to work with this worked for me so it's just your preference after you finish gluing the mirrors down the last step is optional you can glue thin sticks around the mirror to make sure you don't get scratched or cut yourself if you have kids I highly suggest to add the thin sticks to make sure they don't get hurt I will be adding thin sticks around the edges and spray-paint the sticks black and glue them down Lowe's was closed by the time I needed to get them so I'll be adding them after this video to see how I glued them down you can check out my DIY mirrored table video so you can do it yourself I'll leave a link to it in my description box and I'll include a quick clip here of the process [Music] lastly I'm gluing the bottom shelf down and I can't wait to share the results with you guys my gloves have a little bit of glue on them so I took them off since I was about done and here are the final results this is how the new bookshelf turned out you guys I'm super excited it was such a great price for only $20 and I paid $40 for the mirrors this can be used in many different ways other than its main purpose and someone reached out and asked me to help them with an idea on how to store candles and perfumes this is a great way to keep them organized and look like they're in a little boutique you can place this in your bathroom and add towels baskets with soap lotion hair products and body wash there's so many ways that you can use this bookcase and you can even place this in your closet to organize clothes accessories or shoes the possibilities of how you can use this bookshelf are endless I would love to know where you would place this mere bookshelf so let me know in the comments down below I have it here in a corner of my living room to show you that this can be a nice little side table next to your chair you can place the lamp on it and have a little cozy reading space in your home this concludes today's video thank you for watching all your continued love and support it means more and more each day don't forget to download shop targer the link is in my description box
