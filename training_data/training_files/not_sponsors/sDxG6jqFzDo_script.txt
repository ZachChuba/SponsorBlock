hey guys what is up my name is Thomas Park and welcome back to the video today we're gonna be talking about we VPNs wire guard update now if you remember fry we VPN review I was generally pretty positive about the application I really liked it's cheap affordable pricing it's friendly community and a management team it had really good speeds my application had some room for growth and stuff like that and as well as a reputation since it is a brand new company I just couldn't fully trust it yet however now a month or so later we VPN has pushed out a pretty good update including wire guard in the application pretty much available for everyone to use and test right now in beta just download the application ends there in the protocol settings so today I'm going to be testing out wire guard and comparing it with the normal we VPN open VPN connection to see what kind of speed improvements you guys can expect it's this gonna be really fast or really really fast let's go ahead and find out check out VPN tearless comm and my merged or goodbye my marriage so guys in terms of speed tests how ways we VPN can perform differently on wire guard open VPN and IP two well actually the good news is is that with we VPN I can now get I key to working really see I kind of had some kind of bug where it wasn't working some other people were able to get it working and I did able to get it working on another computer so I just kind of dismissed it as something wrong with my own individual setup however now it does seem to be working in the newest update which is really nice these are the kind of speeds I got with IP 2 on wii VPN honestly not that impressive but these kind of speed tests aren't always that accurate so let's go ahead and disconnect and start a new speed test with UDP Open VPN see if we could get any variation there around 60 m/s there see what kind of speeds we can get so it looks like we still need to connect just when I click that there we go now it looks like to be connecting so this is good looking like a little bit faster let's go ahead and reset that test just to make sure that was testing the right thing so let's see what kind of speeds we can get there and then we're going to be testing wire guard as well with the speed test but more importantly what I'm looking for in this test is to see the kind of difference we can get between OpenVPN downloads with torrents and stuff like that and of course stuff with wire guard because wire guard is excellent for downloading torrents and I'm really excited to see what we can get over although the speeds for Open VPN and I fee to for.we VPN are kind of disappointing I did do a wire guard test already with the speed test we did see an increase in upload with Open VPN versi v2 and I really did a wire guard test as well and speeds weren't that much better so let's go ahead and just do that just for the purpose of the video to show you guys what kind of speeds you might be expecting um so let's go ahead and start that up but again like I said what we're gonna be looking at really quickly is the torrent download speeds because you're not just using a VPN to test your speed all day right you're using a VPN to watch content on Netflix you unblock to your restrictions and most importantly probably torrent or download content securely without leaking your IP so like I said before all these speed tests seem to be pretty comparable but let's go ahead and check what's going on with the torrent file alright guys so we are now connected to wire guard let's see what kind of speeds we can get now if I remember correctly my speeds for the test for Open VPN with this torrent the same exact torrent file with we VPN we were getting around 30 to 40 in this area here megabits per second so I was testing it a little bit ago maybe 20 minutes ago wire guard and we were seeing stuff like 40 to 60 there we go right there forty point eight so that is pretty much faster than any other VPN protocols so far I do not believe we've ever gone so high as 40 maybe a little instance here and there but anywhere between 30 to 40 is very good anywhere above 40 is excellent so right now we're not cresting that much above 40 just like 20 minutes ago it was getting ups like 60 so there probably is some variation here and there but anything 30 plus 30 to 40 is excellent and gonna be pretty much highest ranking you can get 4 speeds for me I think anybody would be very pleased with these speed results I'm gonna go ahead and reset it and do a little bit more testing here so we kind of restarted the test with wire guard as you can see it's going up pretty quickly pretty fast 40 right there 42 41 or so I'm starting over we are getting a little bit more consistently higher there went back down a little bit so the wire guard would we VPN is it super super super fast I'm not quite sure yet I think I want to do a little bit more testing in the future see if they add more servers and stuff like that right now it does seem to be pretty fast let's go ahead and do a comparison between why our guard will be bpn and just regular OpenVPN let's see what we can get there so let's see if there's that much of a difference all right so we're starting up the speed test with openvpn seeing what kind of speeds we can get down here now with wire guard we're going up to around 40 and right here we're going in the low 30s I'm not expecting to see as high in the peak there so right now I'm gonna be pretty confident to say that we VPNs openvpn is a little bit slower than it's wire guard implementation for downloading torrents not too much slower though you know maybe 2 to 3 megabytes a second downloading stuff here the question kind of comes to be is there kind of like a limit you know I do have like a 1 gigabyte per second internet and I've at least from me pretty much every other VPN that I've seen around 30 to 40 35 to 40 is pretty much the highest that I can get with any VPN active so this this this does look promising you know did it blow my mind right now well no when he got to 40 it certainly did though all right like I said 20 minutes ago it was testing 50 to 60 so I do expect some variation overall guys how much really exciting to see that we VPN has implemented wire guard I think they're working on it with mobile to if not already available for testing by our guard is gonna be very good for mold because it's gonna reduce battery usage super lightweight it's very fast as you can see and the cool thing about it is that it has insanely fast connection times so let's go ahead and show you right now connector wire guard beta click connect and it's pretty much going to be connected right away that's really nice and it's probably one of the biggest benefits for wire guard in my opinion besides those really impressive downloads beads overall we didn't get very good speed test results but as you could see speeds seem to be very quick for Wii VPN still not really much I could do for the score since it already got five out of five for having such good at Open VPN speeds but now it has wire guard which is good to see go ahead and test it out and
