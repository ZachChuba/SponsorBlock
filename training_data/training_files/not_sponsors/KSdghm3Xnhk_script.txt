nah check that out welcome to Byron Bay the cutest little town you have ever seen I have to film in the shade because I definitely underestimated how freaking bright it is outside and as you've already seen I don't have filters so you can see all the dust particles on my sensor yeah Byron Bay is easily one of the cutest towns you have seen in Australia it is so humid or what squishes cheeks is turning a little bit luxurious I used to live here actually and it was a lot more hippy but now it's like hippy hipster calf plain lifestyle kind of things I'm gonna give you little snippets throughout this video of this place so you can get a vibe for it whilst we talk about the top ten mistakes that you can make when traveling I'm gonna save you guys the pain in the butt of having to deal with these horrible situations where you mess up massively so you can have the best for the day ever let's get into it if I can't have chickens I'm gonna have Bush turkeys thank you point number one over packing I recommend always as much as possible just do carry-on baggage that's it no check-in you do not need a lot of stuff when you're on the road it is far more enjoyable having a few things then having to worry about dragging your bags through cobblestone streets in Europe for example over packing is one of the biggest mistakes most people make so whatever you have have that and then have it again and that's roughly how much you should be taking when you're traveling to this light house area in Byron Bay is the most easterly point in Australia meaning that just down there that's New Zealand so we're look there don't have a plan the adventures that you can have when you don't plan too much it's your best whenever I travel I generally land the first night of accommodation wherever I'm going and then I let the rest of the time just whatever happens because you don't know who you're gonna meet you might want to change direction and go on an adventure with those people if you have everything set in concrete it's really going to take the spontaneous nature out of travel and that is one of the greatest things so don't over plan what's good extra to contradict myself because there is no good to eat you but that doesn't contradict themselves every second video plan whenever you're traveling make sure that you plan the top places to go I you're not I've gone to some places and I have missed the most important things to see and I still have to go back to these countries now I'm not gonna say what you wanna say other cuz it's pretty freaking embarrassing research some history I know some people might be scared about this but if you go to a location and you're looking at say a building nice pile of bricks isn't it but if you know the history behind it how long it's been there what important events have occurred inside that building all of a sudden everything starts making sense and it's very very interesting so even if you don't love history research a little bit you will absolutely get more out of your travels if you do okay so I think you guys should definitely get health insurance it doesn't sound glamorous and when I started first traveling I didn't really have the desire or I didn't think there was a need for it however as I have been traveling for about 10-12 actually much longer I started when I was like 5 I did realize that things go wrong like I have actually had my stuff stolen I've lost some stuff I've broken stuff on the road like my lens for example like $1500 gone unless you have travel insurance and then they can repair it it's amazing or overnight delayed flies and then they pay for your food accommodation lost baggage all of this stuff so it seems like such a petty expense that isn't worth it but it's worth it honey it's getting hot in here so take up Oh yoke this is how all my shop is out there I would like to remind you that if you have patronym in your own country you shouldn't go to hating them in a different country you know why the exact same things are in that store so if you're gonna go shopping just buy stuff that is so freakin unique and maybe representative of that country like a kimono from Japan I keep talking about Japan for some reason oh we have a few minutes of that son and I'm so excited because it doesn't make me look like a bumpkin with all these shadows everywhere probably see it all over Instagram like everyone saying in these luxurious places I kind of want to debunk this because I recently discovered something about myself that I don't know if I'm such a humongous fan of traveling in luxury anymore little snippets are good and I kind of want to comfort you if you kind of fold it just yet do the luxurious thing don't worry I actually somewhat miss the days of hostel life when you've met so many amazing people and you had the weirdest funnest nights with the locals or random view but I was staying in the hostel it's just so much fun and you spend much less and you experience things a lot more real and raw instead of the Polish luxurious feel just book a little bit of luxury but make sure you mix the raw local Chiang and ratty little cabins in freaking jungle somewhere mixed it up you're gonna thank yourself because travel is all about adventure and not sipping cocktails next to a pool which you can do right in your own country maybe unless you're in Alaska so I'm not gonna go into much detail with these things because you guys said smart cookies and you can work out for yourself as why all of these points are important but you should chicken early because you want the absolute best seats bring earplugs I mask a little dry squiddy towel and a lock for your hostel why he's so bad and I can guarantee you the sound of water non-stop he's not helping at all anyway welcome to water goes bees to be a lifeguard on this Beach some girls leg rope broke on her surfboard and she was getting crashed into some rocks and she was really struggling so I saved her and then I got out of the water and there was applause round of applause standing ovation it was amazing you want to make sure that you tried the local cuisine this is an embarrassing story of mine I'm gonna say I have been to Japan about fourteen sixteen years ago I haven't had sushi in Japan I literally said to myself I was like well I've had sushi before I'm not gonna bother oh my good try the local cuisine do not stick to the usual I guess you guys know that I didn't know that some telling you guys just FYI in case you're silly like me yourself the very last point is to make sure that you do not book last minute you should be aiming for the sweet spot for about six weeks outside of the travel time over three months if it's a really busy season I remember hearing those beautiful stories of people saying go to the airport last minute and just booked a ticket and see where you go that she doesn't exist anymore it's so freakin expensive however holy oh you can already check in for the flight we literally just booked in there we can take it straight away I'm climbing up the stairs I'm starting to lose my save 10% off your first purchase of a domain or website humans enjoy your trip I'm so excited for you to go and explore the world it is so much fun my favorite thing in the world is traveling make sure wherever you go do adventurous things meet
