today's video involves taking this and this and this and like these boxes are like they're not empty you know they're full of stuff and this and this and this and putting them all in here yes my friends we are going to make a full custom gaming rig that is small enough that you could conceivably shoplift it in your hoody LTT store calm stealth hoodie it's awesome check it out and while you're at it check out our sponsor for today's video the Anker PowerPort Adam slim wall charger fits in your pocket and charges your devices in a snap learn more at the end of the video or at the link in the video description [Music] let's kick this off with a look at the case that we're using to perform this feat this is the Bell case vk3 and the whole thing is actually shockingly simple at least on the surface so we've got our front panel which is just brushed aluminum with power button here and this is all one solid piece all the way from the back it's bent here and then down to the bottom okay then we've got two side panels that are fully perforated on the top they've got two 80 millimeter fan mounts they've actually got their own fan that they made which seems to be just sourced from some fan company but what's special about it is that it is super slim then on the bottom they've got what looks like kind of some mounting stuff I don't know I've never built it before so we're gonna find out what that is and then finally at the back that gives you an idea of the scale of the project we're looking at that is a motherboard IO cutout so I have no idea how all this stuff including an RT X 2060 is supposed to go in here this thing's 80 bucks though so hopefully they've given it some $80 worth of thought I don't stand a chance of doing this without the manual I'm quite certain of that so now that the panels are off we're getting a look at one of the first lies that I've told you guys in this video so that is not actually the size of a standard i/o shield and the reason that it's bigger is because it includes multiple sizes of motherboard standoffs so that you can actually change exactly where the motherboard is mounted depending on whether you have like a larger CPU cooler or you have a thicker graphics card so that is how we are getting a dual slot graphics card into this thing and in fact if you need to accommodate a longer expansion card you see these slots here the case can actually be extended or retracted well the manual says to start by assembling your motherboard and CPU and RAM and all that good stuff so we are using just comes in a white box because this is an in sample board but this is a Seuss's x5 70 ROG Strix Mini ITX motherboard and this is a truly special little piece of kit because it's got full support for up to AMD's upcoming 16 core processor now we're not going that extreme we actually just went for a 3700 x8 core processor because that was the most heat that we could handle with this right here the NHL 9 am-4 from Noctua which is the biggest cooler that we can fit in this case we have the dual slot graphics card but the capabilities of this thing are freaking sick so why don't we start by getting our CPU installed here everybody loves that CPU insertion point now we're gonna go ahead and throw on our MDOT 2 SSD so there's just the one slot on this board right over here you can see they actually had to build up this crazy like riser thing so they could put a cooler in there for the motherboard chipset freaking bananas these feels more like working on a laptop and a desktop and this can go gonna miss out on this RGB well it's just clearly not gonna fit this build is beyond stupid already it is going to be great I will give you that now we've got some vengeance lpx low profile memory this is a 3200 C 16 kit so nothing special but pretty close to unlocking our CPUs full potential there and now we got to install our cooler it's crazy this motherboard is so small they don't even have to put all the fan headers in different places because you'd be able to reach them from anywhere so there's our CPU fan header and then we're gonna go ahead and cable manage it like that I guess so we're gonna put it on that way put our graphite on it oh oh oh oops oh look at that I lied to you guys again there's a second m2 slot on this board it's on the back so do I even views the I guess not then you do that is one freaking dense bit of computer performance although I have noticed a potential problem we know that this cooler is as thick as this thing can handle but our our SSD actually Peaks out above it a little bit so we might run into a clearance issue here so here's where it gets real ladies and gentlemen wait what normally you would take your motherboard standoffs and you put them into your back plate or motherboard tray and then you put the motherboard on there not today today we take the motherboard we put it straight against the back plate and then we drive the tallest a 30 millimeter standoff through the motherboard and then into the back plate what is going on here my world is upside down you can see the back plate of the motherboard is like bowed now so we're hoping that it still fits without bending it too much so this is adorable next up is our PCI Express riser because obviously if that's our maximum clearance we're not getting a graphics card sticking you no way out of the thing here so the riser goes in here at the bottom and then immediately wraps around the back of the motherboard and then why is this so long wait a minute what the hell no I know what the extras for holy crap it's got to go all the way around and then flip back over that is the sketchiest thing I have seen today and today has been a sketchy day already so next up we've removed two screws here and here and we pull out this lake-like blocker piece like a spacer piece because if we didn't have an expansion slot we we could actually put it here and then you could install the i/o shield normally but we do so our graphics card i/o needs to be over here this case is so very different from anything that I have ever used before there you go then they're just empty space now so now we're ready for one of the coolest party tricks of this thing remember I said that the spacers kind of effect where the motherboard is positioned in the case so you see this little tiny hook on the bottom of the motherboard tray here that can actually go into either this one or this one depending on where the motherboard goes so I guess we're gonna go with the top one so then the next thing is to put an m3 countersunk screw in here which brings the whole package actually kinda together and it like I am legit having a lot of fun right now this is like the most unique computer build I have done in quite some time and I mean unique and like an endearing way so now we go ahead and wait we unscrew the riser why did we screw it in unscrew the riser then connect the card to the riser then slide it into the back so we go ahead and we put this on here Jake I'm like mashing this PCI Express riser I feel bad okay so then we slide it up through the back like that this is so ridiculous I just don't I just can't even it's actually in there surprisingly securely it's amazing to think that these are all standard components it's time for our power supply and this is this is something a little special silverstone if there's a weird thing that almost no one could possibly want silverstone probably makes it so this is the SS t FX 350 g this is a flex ATX power supply and it's about as thick as a single server you it's got like a little tiny what is that forty millimeter fan 30 mil 40 mm yeah it doesn't even have an 8 pin PCI Express connector just has a 6 pin so we're gonna need a 6 pin 2 8 pin adapter which is perfectly fine so that needs to get wait what even know it's not wide enough oh my god no I see it you you just wrench this down here and put thumb screws in from the back that is the worst power supply mount I have ever ever seen you mash it down and then these slots they're not even holes that's where you put the screws in and then you just have to I guess wrench them tight enough that they don't shift it's getting heavy considering the size this is a lot of computer what the crap how is this supposed to work so now it's time for cable management so our 24 pin has to some friggin how get over here oh lordy so that can go there yeah okay so now our 8 pin connector goes up here so we're just gonna stash the extra GPU power cable over here that's gonna hurt our airflow a little but I think that ship sailed a long time ago and now it's time for the front shell installation ok apparently you can mount drives to this now we don't need to because we're using em too okay we do want to put a fan or two in here though do you know which way is right side up okay so you know the fans not gonna fit in there no way I am calling it now no fan is fitting in there there's no way I think we might get a fan in here I'm like stressed out so warm Jake insists that we go for full points and put in the second cooling fan think we're gonna need it I don't think I really have a choice the amount of hardware that is packed in here like yeah the sides are perforated sure but geez I both love and hate this at the same time it's like I love it but it makes me really uncomfortable so theoretically everything is lined up I've got all my fan connectors installed so now in Bell case fashion the way to fit it oh oh that makes me so uncomfortable how are we gonna do this anchor one side so right now in jamming the fan power down alongside the fan so it'll stay out of the blades this is dumb and this is crazy I think I can lock it in place here but do the fans spin that one scraping that one seems to be spinning I think I forgot to plug in my front panel power yeah okay they're both spinning now so I got to keep these cables down like on the down side of here okay all right see if the side panels closed you know what I'm uh I want to see it boot first it's bad jeebies to close up the side panel before you actually see it turn on good and cut for me the big thing is how quiet is it gonna be or rather how loud all right I gotta put on some little feet here some assembly definitely acquired this one it's so cold from yesterday nice honestly looking at this setup on the table I'm like where's the computer it's more like an excessive like this is smaller than most external GPU boxes all right moment of truth time that's a good sign lights are on we've got fan spin hey we've got a video output though alright so everything looks good we got our eight core processor 16 gigs ram now our ram speed is still low but it looks like it's applied the do CP automatic overclocking to the 32 hundred megahertz profile so let's try it let's give it a shot and see if it works alright one thing that I want to get altered here is that fan noise Wow okay so both my CPU and chassis fan are set to silent but one of those headers is actually an a i/o pump control header and they've got a bit of a different approach to control of that one be nice if you could just set it to and mode so we're just gonna set it to the CPU as a as a source auto now let's see if it'll turn down a little bit cuz right now this thing is pretty friggin loud really that's controlled yeah these things are ripping okay I've got us uses software fired up and it looks like that a i/o pump header has a 100% fan curve on it thirty degrees will go down to 30% like 7d will ramp up to 55 or so okay that's better so is that one fan that was killing us to be clear this is still not a silent system but we need to have realistic expectations at least this is not horrendous alright let's go ahead and close it up so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just not quite put these in all the way so that our side panel isn't too bowed there's gonna be a bit of a gap but hey if it's good enough for test loners it's good enough for me is that noticeable Andy you can't tell so let's tune the other fan curves and then do some testing here I think I found a profile that kind of works so I've got my two top fins which are by far the most obnoxious set to 25% until we hit a fairly critical temperature of about sixty degrees so that's where we're loading the system and then my nock to a CPU cooler I've gone ahead and set a more aggressive curve on that because even when it's running at a fairly high rpm it's pretty quiet and a non abduction sound unfortunately you guys can probably hear that even with my two fans at the top running very low or stopped and my not to offend not being annoying this is some still kind of whiny and there's just nothing we can do about that because of the 40 millimeter fan and the power supply that's one of the challenges with these super small form-factor cases is that you're stuck with unconventional power supplies that just require weird tiny fans to cool them anyway I'm pretty happy with this so let's go ahead and hit it with a load shall we so let's start by firing up the classic BMW blender test and what I'm looking for here is what kind of CPU turbo speeds were observing as well as what kind of noise thresholds do we reach here so it's going to take a couple seconds for our system fans to kick in because I configured them that way but you can hear them ramping up now as our CPU approaches seventy-five eighty degrees we're still turbo to just shy of four gigahertz though 81 degrees how's our turbo doing 3.94 gigahertz still looking pretty good okay let's get a high sweet open and see just how hard we have to hit with the CPU cooler in order to tame it I mean we still haven't turbo down yet oh we've got a couple of cars at three point nine one seven oh wow windows search you are so damn useless HW info Oh a web result you know I bet with a slightly better thermal compound instead of a thermal pad that would probably break us through this threshold honestly it's not bad though we're still turbo into three point nine plus which is respectable if not amazing for a 3700 X so CPU performance is looking pretty good I mean we didn't hit maximum boost speeds but we didn't fall down to base clocks either and considering the form factor even with the noise I am pretty darn happy with this thing but life is about to get a little bit more difficult because this is only a 65 watt CPU so if it's kicking a bunch of heat out into the chassis these fans have a pretty good chance of removing it our graphics card that's over a hundred and fifty watts so they're gonna be working a little harder and less of the fan actually overlaps with the graphics card side of the enclosure so just gonna be interesting now let's move on to games okay well I can definitely hear our power supply working harder now ooh that fan is going ladies and gentlemen in a computer that you can hold one-handed we have got Metro Exodus running at over 60 frames per second 2560 by 1440 like basically all high details I mean do you need a punch line like kick him kick him in the mouth good good job take that spiders okay I figured out why we don't like the webs these are very very bad spiders well there is definitely a lot more heat radiating off this thing let's go ahead and have a look at how our GP is doing you know we maxed out at around 73 degrees that is not freakin bad and that's actually without even one of our top fans spinning so one thing that I would tune about this configuration is that I would definitely add like a separate temp sensor of some sort and then tie my case fans into that instead of tying them into my CPU temps because while it was gaming I was actually hitting max turbo so well in excess of 4 gigahertz on my CPU and it wasn't even running that hot because you know obviously most games only use anywhere from sort of 2 to 4 or ish maybe 6 threads freaking awesome I really like this thing I mean not an IDE use it sort of way I'm more of a silence freak than a small form-factor freak but I think the merits of a system like this basically pitch themselves you want to you know go to a friend's house or let's say your parents are split up and you go between mom and dad's house or something like that you want to bring your computer boom I'm walking out of the frame thing and Andy the Anker PowerPort Adam slim wall they've got all kinds of other stuff too so thanks for watching guys hope you enjoyed the video if you did maybe check out our other recent build video where I upgraded my personal rig with the Big Brother to the 3700 X the 3900 X 12 core with water cooling
