[Music] today a new campaign against cyberbullying is encouraging kids to get out there and do it in person it's the latest attempt to cut down on online abuse among middle and high schoolers but won't work and in news that might be very relevant to most of our audience a new study says that listening to podcasts causes irreversible deafness and 95 percent of people and that number could be on the rise from the onion and onion Public Radio I'm Lesley price and this is the topical if it happened it's not covered on this news podcast it even really happened probably not the topical is presented by up using promo code topical it might just help you out cyberbullying has been on the rise in America for years now recent studies show that nearly one in three students between 12 and 18 have been the victim of internet harassment with those numbers steadily increasing each year it's a disturbing trend the organization parents against online defamation is the latest group to try to address this epidemic this week they've launched a brand new campaign that aims to cut down on internet abuse by encouraging kids to get out there and do it in real life face to face OPR correspondent Jenna Resnick has been covering the story and she joins us now in the studio hi Jenna good morning Leslie so what can you tell us about this new effort and do experts think it'll work well the idea that if more kids are out there bullying each other in person or IRL as they say that could cut down on online harassment incidents across the board interestingly as cyberbullying is on the rise bullying overall has remained consistent and in some cases even decreased but these activists say that if you increase overall bullying and focus it on traditional physical and verbal taunts you could decrease the online harassment statistics as for whether it will work that remains to be seen but this group is optimistic so how is this campaign working what is parents against online defamation doing to encourage bullying in the flesh well just yesterday they put out this video a sort of PSA with a number of parents articulating the group's message enough is enough it's time to stop cyberbullying in all of its forms tell your kids to put down their screens and put up their fists we want teenagers to stretch their legs get outdoors and physically harass each other out in the here-and-now offline tangible real not online if they're berating their younger siblings physical appearance to their face that's time spent not berating a classmates appearance online pretty effective at a lot of teachers say that cyber bullying is their number one concern these days and I'm sure many other parents listening agree what should they know about the campaign well the PA OD is stressing that it's all about creating opportunities for your kids to make each other's lives miserable in-person calling up other parents setting up bullying dates feeding them some solid burns about the other kid and there are a few schools that have implemented entire class periods where there are no electronics allowed and it's just full-on no-holds-barred student on student psychological torture are those school seeing a decrease in cyber bullying too early to say so in addition to these television and radio spots you also attended a parents against online defamation event is that right I did last week they organized their first face-to-face meet up which was a huge success it's a great way for kids to get some practice bullying face to face no Twitter or Instagram insight but it's also a great way for the adults to learn how they can be most supportive this is what one parent had to say both my wife and I learned new techniques to help support the healthy development of our son from now on we're going to have a no phones during dinner policies so Kyle can watch and then mimic us verbally abuse each other we didn't realize that could be so beneficial pee AOD recommends implementing small put-downs into your daily routine while slowly working your way up to constant physical abuse for example Leslie why are you such a oh wait what I said why are you such a little oh wait why do you I could have texted that to you but instead I'm saying it to your face you little idiot oh ass stop I hope yours Jenna Resnick Oh a potentially game-changing study published yesterday by researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz found that listening to podcasts causes irreversible hearing loss in 95 percent of users virtually all of the studies 200 participants reported that after two weeks of regular podcast listening they had gone completely and permanently deaf the study indicated that the podcast induced hearing loss often began with an inability to make out tones of a higher register followed by a ringing sound associated with tinnitus and ultimately a stop to all auditory functioning whatsoever while pretty interesting stuff to help us make sense of this data I'm joined by the lead researcher in this groundbreaking study dr. patricia du Bois dr. Dubois thank you so much for joining us today mm-hmm now of course tell us how exactly did the study come together fascinating now according to your research even a few minutes of exposure to podcast shatters the cochlea of an average person obviously I'm personally in the podcast industry so I feel a bit of responsibility to my audience here is there anything podcast fans can do to mitigate the effects really so listening through headphones can accelerate the damage by up to 400% anything else mm-hmm so it sounds like what you're saying is that even if you can still hear podcast that doesn't necessarily mean you're in the 5% that's unaffected could just mean it's taking you slightly longer to go one thing you tell listeners what would it be well I'll be sure to steer clear of that then good advice no I was particularly curious you indicated that every form of podcasts news sports it's trauma to the inner ear but I [Music] survived a glass we're gonna piercing your room with a nail Wow and finally I'm sure subscribers would want me to ask completely hopeless okay thank you you're very welcome it's been a real pleasure getting to speak to you today along the way let's listen you
