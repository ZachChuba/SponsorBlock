between his devotion to color his love for unique releases and his constant self myth-making White has gained notoriety for his eccentricity but there's one quirk that may stand out most his love for the number-3 from song names to label names - changing his own name the number 3 has had a significant impact on Jack White's entire career both aesthetically and musically let's take a closer look according to Jack white he first became fascinated with the number 3 during his work as an upholsterer he was working on stapling down the fabric for a sofa when he had an epiphany he remembered the moment in an interview with The Guardian I had three staples tamping the fabric down left to right and center and I just stared at it for 10 minutes it became hypnotic this was the minimum amount of staples I could put to hold this fabric down the number three exemplifies the almost iconic mysterious perfection that cannot be attained white realized that there were all kinds of things that tied back to the number 3 when you strip them down to their bare minimum 3 is the minimum number of legs you need to make a table 3 primary colors make up the entire color spectrum even time itself is organized into three basic states the past the present and the future then there's its relation to whites Christian faith the holy trinity is one of the most important symbols in all of Christianity and while these revelations were fascinating they became more interesting when applied to music when you trace rock-and-roll back to its blues origins you find songs composed of three core the most common chords these songs use are the 1 the 4 and the 5 also known as the tonic sub-dominant and dominant these three chords form the basis of the 12 bar blues one of the most ubiquitous song structures in all of Muse and Jack white is no exception he used the twelve bar blues in a number of songs across his career his second solo album Lazaretto featured three woman a twelve bar blues song with lyrical themes around the number-three as well [Music] it's like a big [Music] another one of Jack White's most celebrated songs uses both the 12-bar blues and lyrical themes around the number-3 ball and biscuit that song is a hard commitment to the 12-bar blues building an entire seven-minute piece around that simple structure and those three chords lyrically ball and biscuit features one of the most important threes in Jack White's career the third man a year before ball and biscuit was released Jack White founded his own record label Third Man Records named after a 1949 noir film in addition to the name of his label the branding of third man features Jack White's love for the aesthetic of threes in his solo career White has taken three vertical bars as his logo a minimal look that drives home the power of the number aesthetically threes were important in White's work with the White Stripes to their entire career was guided by a strict color code consisting of three colors red white and black this color code can be seen in the band's biggest music video ever seven nation army but more than just colors that video uses triangles further driving home the symbol of three and then there's the gimmicks Jack White loves working threes into his art in unexpected ways on tour with the White Stripes in 2005 he changed his name to three quid the White Stripes also released a limited run of three-inch records played on custom turntables in his solo work Jack White released three videos from the Lazaretto track that black bat licorice he created a website where you could watch the main video but toggled through the others by pressing C or 3 on the keyboard when performing on tour for boarding-house reach his microphone setup featured three mics and of course Jack White's website is Jack white three calm and that's a moniker that he usually signs his name with and while these gimmicks are fun the real power and freeze comes from music of the White Stripes the white stripes are rock stripped down to its three most basic parts melody rhythm and lyrics Jack white consider those three things the cornerstones of songwriting and it's part of what makes the White Stripes so incredible their early work is particularly minimal in this sense a song like stop breaking down captures raw energy with just three parts meg is drumming Jack's guitar and Jack's boat the number three is also built right into the music that the White Stripes play in their early career songs like broken bricks are built around power chords a grouping of three notes power cords are one of the most basic structures in rock and often one of the first things guitarists learn by writing songs using these three note chords Jack white is further emphasizing the importance of minimalism Jack White's love of 3s comes through strongest on the big three killed my baby the third song of the White Stripes debut album that song uses three chords throughout a song made of three verses and three choruses [Music] [Music] on top of that musical phrases made of threes are emphasized on both guitar and drums on the cover of the single for that song white even wears a shirt emblazoned with a big red three the number three is more than just a fascination for Jack white it's the very basis of some of the greatest works of his career by looking for threes white was able to strip so much of music bare and find the minimalism that gave him success early in his career and by maintaining devotion to his favorite digit white has created a unique experience for his fans who
