yeah forever Dana Caravan ARIMA Sam Chema's hi brilliant oh they already put it on gmail over so that's pretty much how we imagined this product came to be yes it is in fact a real thing the key the key Mouse and it really works exactly the way that you would think it does hey James remember how I said that I was really excited to try this out and learn to use it and tell our audience about it yeah yeah I'm not and a-one and a-two anda have fun [Music] the mas backpack is back in stock utilizing a removable sunglass pouch longer straps for larger shoulders available power management to help charge your gear and backed with a five-year warranty it's pretty sick check it out at the link below if you've been following our escapades with weird or organ ama keyboards then you'll recognize some familiar features when you look at the key Mouse alpha for starters it's a split keyboard with each side having a contoured integrated wrist rest and this of course lets you spread your hands out as wide as your shoulders which is dank if you got y-dash shoulders and optimizes the position of your wrist to prevent the three amigos the three main causes of repetitive stress injuries which are all are deviation which is in your wrist go like this is no good extension and pronation which is when your hand is laying flat on the keyboard this kind of handles all three next it has these thumb clusters which I personally after having switched the ergo docks over like a year and a half ago cannot live without now it just doesn't make any sense to use one of your strongest digits only on the spacebar so key Mouse has four keys with Cherry MX switches blue in this case brown on this one accessible by each thumb then there's the layout which is similar to the one on the Kinesis advantage to another great keyboard first it's ortho linear which means that the keys are aligned instead of staggered which is a real pain if you're not used to using your middle finger to hit C like a good little typist but I got used to it eventually and it feels good now second the keys are in these concave key wells they're not as deep as on the advantage too but it still keeps your finger surrounding to stretch as far as they normally would on a traditional flat QWERTY and finally there's only about 60 keys in total which is obviously a lot less than your typical 104 key layout so you're gonna have to get used to switching between function layers using these little blue and yellow keys kind of a drag now some secondary functions like the arrow keys and the numpad are actually pretty easy to use once you get used to switching layers because you can rely on the muscle memory that you all right have to hit them but other things you'll have to learn from scratch like since when our parentheses over here and why is caps lock on a secondary layer and while I'm at it where are all the number keys all of those special characters have moved which can be really annoying when you're trying to use your password muscle memory surely they could have included the number oh no well maybe not yes they could technically do it but that would come with the trade-off of adding more weight which is yucky because remember each one of these is a mouse it's actually comical how bad I am with the left Mouse especially since I'm left-handed but this is actually pretty cool because for the first time in my life I can move the mouse around without taking my fingers off the home row and if you're the type to get a strained neck or shoulder then this is a godsend because you no longer have to reach way out for your mouse yes it does take some getting used to don't worry you still only have one cursor on the screen but each module is a fully functioning Mouse with its own optical sensor its own left and right clicks and its own mouse scroll wheel that you can even click so you're free to use whichever Mouse you want to and switch between them at will you can even use one on the far right side of your multi monitor setup and then kind of hand off the cursor to the left when you get on that far side of your super ultra wide display like I have but you can't like move them together to try to double your movement speed or anything crazy like that because Windows only accepts really one input at a time there are a couple of extras though you can hold this sniper type button to temporarily drop your sensitivity for finer control and since you can't easily pick up the mouse when you get to the edge of your mouse pad or an uncomfortable position this special little snowflake button pauses Mouse movement so that you can get your hands back in place without moving the pointer as for how well it works as a mouse though the thing that was weird for me especially at first was that with a regular Mouse there's a certain intuitiveness to point around at things on your desktop as if the cursor is an extension of your index finger by comparison the key Mouse felt more like fisting and squeezing because the mouse click is accessible like a thumb one solution I had to make it feel more natural was to put the clicks up here instead of on the side at least then first time users wouldn't find themselves accidentally smashing the J key all the time like I did but apparently earlier versions of the product did have them up there and then customers reported pain after extended use plus some people actually like to grip the palm rest instead of keeping their hands on the keys when they move around so the buttons got in the way over there overall it definitely works well enough but I think that it's safe to say that you're not going to achieve the same precision as a regular Mouse probably ever but what if you didn't have to move the whole module introducing the key mouse track now with this version you get a trackball for each hand and because it's stationary you also get a buttload more keys including the number rows which is awesome and the front mounted clicks that were on my wish list which would be sick except that they don't line up with this finger they line up with this finger which is gash thankfully there's a third option as long as your hands are big enough this little post guy up here is also a left-click but wait there's more key the house also sells mounting brackets that let you strap these puppies to your chair like you're on the bridge of the heck and Starship Enterprise it's crazy your colleagues may raise an eyebrow but only because they covet the splendor that you alone revelant seriously though it does really feel like the interface you always wanted and it's ergonomic AF if only it weren't equally jank not only are the mounting brackets attached with the velcro straps that can irritate bear arms but the brackets themselves sold for $45 are plastic so the whole thing ends up flexing under your keystrokes it's like having a mechanical keyboard with no backplate or even negative backplate plus one of mine straight up broke these suck they need to be metal and bolt to the chair so I guess we're talking about the weak points now ki mouse opted to go all-in on 3d printing which gives them an advantage in terms of rapid prototyping and the ability to offer multiple SKUs like there's multiple sizes of the chemos outfits awesome but well none of the alternative keyboards i've tried have matched the finish of mass-market products from say horse air or logitech and well as far as 3d printed objects go these are actually pretty nice there are still a bunch of irregularities or maybe artifacts in the finished product it's not a deal breaker for me but it definitely contributes to a cheaper look and feel hey but at least they give you nice braided cables instead of cheeping out like urgh Oh docks yes but that said it's unlikely that you'll either never really need them because these are the first pirgos I've seen that are Bluetooth with a USB rechargeable 1400 milliamp hour battery in each module another strong point for these keyboards is their intuitive and robust software that lets you customize just about anything you can imagine you can remap all the keys all the buttons and even the mouse wheels on up to 6 layers you can make each Mouse module have a different dpi or make the mouse motion a different function like using one trackball as a scroll wheel you can make a single click register as a key combination like alt f4 and you can program full-on macros as long as you have the software running in the background slight the merit there so then is this the ergonomic keyboard to buy well it's 500 bucks that's extreme for a keyboard but I have to put it in context ergonomic keywords are typically around three hundred and fifty dollars which merely makes it expensive in the ergonomics space and if you take the mouse out of the equation I put the key mouse about on par with the advantage too as far as organ omits and features so the question becomes really whether having integrated wireless mouse is worth a hundred and fifty dollars and I guess that depends on you and your RSI you it's shoulder related and can't be solved simply by switching to a vertical Mouse then the key Mouse could be your best and only option unless you want to mess around with foot pedals or something so my advice then is to poke around key mouse's forum where people many of whom have tried a ton of the different organ or keyboards that are available in the market today post reviews and are happy to answer all your newbie questions so in the how did you hear about
