hey guys what is up its Alisha and today we're back with another bands reacts beautiful people you guys don't understand how excited I am right now literally as soon as I saw that twice morning law dance practice was uploaded literally I was just so excited guys obviously I just said it was doing twice more and more I did that music video not too long ago so I was like yes the dance practice is out it's time I'm really excited to see their dance in this because in the music video it was really cool how it all worked with all the other clips how they used but I really want to see the dancing by itself and see actually what um the movement is and all that before we get into reaction don't want to miss out well guys do that further ado let's get into the reaction okay here we go oh my god I'm so excited right now oh my god I love how the ring or why that's epic oh we got something oh my god beautiful I love how they connect straight away like that picture was really nice to start it stupid oh my god I love how they're in a square but they are based like diagonal Hey Wow oh my god some of my mom hey Colin yes I love how they hitting those beats but in different ways it's not just the same yes stop it yes I love how them making it simple for the bridge so that the course is going to be extra big hey oh come on [ __ ] Wow hey yes I love how they're making it like Ruby and kind of like funky you yes come on yeah those transitions are literally so smooth oh my god stop that is epic ah stop it oh my god they are like the hottest girls on the planet at this very second yes come on they said yeah we're rolling our booty and a cannon that's what we do yeah that's so sick I love how they move that because obviously that'd be really hard to do that step while mating hey yes oh my god I'm obsessed with her pink hair like she pulled that up so well come on yes dang they traveled really far for that oh my god I love it yes Lucy I love how they using their shoulders on that because it shows that they're not just using the arms but they make it extra bigger with us all this yay yes hey come on I like how they're being rounded with all this grooviness because otherwise it's just gonna be too I guess white especially with this song break it down oh my god stuff but that was so satisfying to the eye oh she said yes it's my time to shine I'm going for it come on yeah she said I did too time let's go hey they're really brought it with this one Hey she said yeah what's good stop it and it's so clean like when I doing the grooves the cleanliness of the grooves is just like next level hey come on I think that's my favorite through bad they do yeah she was living on that guys I actually am like shocked I definitely recognize some moves that they did in the music video but I really liked how they kept it simple at times but they still made it shopping clean which made it look a lot more difficult than it is I really liked how they kept transitioning into different moments and different positions because that made it really interesting especially when they were doing grooves like it was so satisfying to see the groups when moving because it was just like a whole like roller coaster to the eye and I really liked how they made it sexy at times too because they are just honestly so hot of that I really like how effortless they make it look but yet when they want to go full-out they definitely go full-out and like when they do all the chests they really don't hold back and that's what makes it so big and dramatic and amazing because even without the close-up shots and all that they still pull it off like it was in a music video it was so awesome that they all were white as well because it straightaway makes it automatically cleaner especially when watching it and when you do the grooves and all that it just looks all symmetric I have to say my favorite group that they do is all this stuff because it's just so groovy and so nice and satisfying to see and you can also do it very easily with them and every time they dance with it especially this spot here it makes you want to join them and I think this is why more and more it's going to be one of my favorites that they've done because it is so joyful to watch and you want to do the dance with them well guys I hope you videos you'd like to see next I love you guys also so much thank you guys for watching and yeah I'll see you guys next time peace love you guys [Applause] [Applause]
