make sure you guys hit the subscribe button if you guys are enjoying the content that we're throwing up and make sure you guys hit the like button if you enjoy the video and yeah let's begin okay so we are covering Justice League the six dimension and I know I'm behind on this I know like a bunch of other coming book youtubers have covered it don't care I am excited about this story I am hyped about this story okay Justice League the sixth dimension is probably one of the coolest stories to come out of DC Comics for like a long time right so initially like when it comes to Scott Snyder like writing like really writing Justice League in general emember all this is like one part it's like a part of a big cohesive story right like the end result is Perpetua and like her return and a manipulation of like really like the omniverse not even the multiverse but like the omniverse uh and then like there's gonna be a couple other cures that kind of get thrown in here but it's all sort of like leading up to that moment right like it's ever since we had like the first fracture of the source wall that landed on earth and the first volume of the Justice League running all the way up until now and going into like year of a villain and all that kind of stuff this all focuses heavily on the character of perpetuo the villain of Perpetua who just hasn't showed up yet for the most part well I think in year of the villain she may have but there but basically like she's trying to make her return now initially this leads into the generally I guess it picks up with the Justice League kind of coming together now a couple things to bear in mind here remember Mira is currently the queen of Atlantis right like Aquaman's off doing his own thing and it was a way for DC to kind of focus on Aquaman's character absent the Justice League itself so really like his ongoing series is kind of isolated now it's kind of like cut off from like everything else going on in DC it's cool and it's really good but it isn't really 14-2 like the overall Justice League as a whole and there's a couple things going on here in there but for the most part it's kind of removed but the whole reason why the Justice League is here is because what they've done is they've gone forward with a purpose of like bringing back a classic character that we haven't seen for a long time of course this classic character is revealed when the guy makes his return when he was supposed to show up at this point in time and it turns out to be mr. Mixel pedelec now the question a lot of people are probably wondering is where has mr. Mixel pedelec been like what's he been doing this entire time oh I can tell you exactly what he's been doing he's been using Skillshare hashtag only around ten dollars a month having said that uh we actually don't know what mr. Mitchell public's been doing this entire time we really don't and that's kind of an interesting thing right because like you go from like Superman reborn we're like Mixel pedelec has been pretending to be Clark Kent this entire time and then basically like you end up with like the new 52 and the three new 52 Superman merging into one another to mix up it like vanishing and then we have no idea of where he went to but the funny thing about this this is actually kind of a cool display of power is this is kind of a story that I would say would be an introductory place for people who were new to his character right because um he doesn't appear all the time I mean used to be that he would appear not all the time but like more frequently than he does now but I think since the beginning of DC rebirth he's probably shown up like maybe twice if you consider Superman reborn like him showing up twice in that story so I guess be in there for like the whole story so in reality anybody who's going through and like reading DC Comics right now has probably never heard of him so what Scott Snyder does is give us this kind of grand display of the power that Mixel pedelec has and literally like he just turns the world of the Justice League upside down like Jon Stewart the Green Lantern goes to launch an attack in Mitchell pedelec just like starts breaking his body down it's cool things like that cuz you don't really see this and that's one of the big differences between like Marvel and DC Comics front like Marvel Comics you have a lot of reality walkers right you have the Beyonder you have the beyonders you've got the molecule man Owen Reese you've got the cosmic entities you've got Galactus you've got classic silver server from the 1980s you've got all kinds of like crazy power you know people with with crazy powers in DC it's a lot more grounded in terms of like extreme capabilities and extreme powers you don't really see those and so seeing this in here is actually kind of cool but of course then that goes into John Jones foreseeing a mission of Hitler to start like saying his name in his own mind without saying it out loud now for people who are new to this whenever Mixel pedelec says his name out loud he's sent back to the fifth dimension right it's the one way to kind of get rid of him and that's the sort of ongoing joke that goes on with his character right whenever he shows up he bothers Superman for a while Superman has to use his intellect and trick Mixel pedelec into saying his name backwards I'm sorry saying his name backwards the right way and in order to send him back to his own dimension now of course the reason why Mixel peddler doesn't pull that stunt with Batman is who's back would be he would like to play some mind games and then like Mitchell pedelec would end up saying his own name and then going back to his dimension before he even realized what happened butit's kind of a cool thing because what Mixel pedelec says is like the impact of the Justice League destroying the source wall and the kind of cascading effect that it takes throughout the entire multiverse isn't just felt in like their native dimension it's felt in like the fifth dimension right like it spreads throughout everything and that's when things get a little bit hairy because what ends up happening here is we sort of get this this explanation that things are not as limited as we thought they were that things are not as basic as we thought they were they're what Mitchell pedelec does is it County comes forward it says okay there's like a whole host of multiverses out there and for the most part in DC Comics we only ever really assumed there was just one right like there was a positive multiverse and the negative multiverse and that was basically it but like the negative multiverse was more of like a reflection right it was a darker and more evil and twisted and in hopeless reflection of the positive multiverse Mitchell pedelec says no no no it's not like that but you have this you have a singular multiverse and then like the third dimension is the one that we occupy and then you have like time which is the fourth dimension and then you have the fifth dimension which is just pure imagination fully walk on the Chocolate Factory a world of pure imagination like that kind of a thing and then the sixth dimension is the one that nobody really knows anything about because only individuals of the highest order are allowed to go there not only that we actually kind of get this explanation that what Perpetua did is she had like what were essentially like three suns right it was the mana of the monitor at the anti-monitor and then the world forger and the kind of cool thing about this is the world forager as he's depicted here we've seen him in the dark multiverse or at least the dark multiverse version of him and so again like it's it's kind of cool to see Scott Snyder making these callbacks to like stories that he's written in the past would again is actually pretty sweet but the idea behind this is that there are like multiple multiverses out there right like throughout the entire omniverse there's a whole host of multiverses and like all those multiverses have their own individual universes and that perpetuo was kind of the creator of this multiverse and presumably the creator of woke seemed to kind of be all others now how we reconcile that with like the presence right like DC's absolute God it's kind of difficult to do because when it comes to the presence in DC Comics that's largely a vertigo concept right you know Lucifer Morningstar and and Michael the Archangel all that kind of stuff that's all really vertigo and you never really see a crossover with like the main DC Universe line of stories and so because that's the case we can kind of assume they're two distinctly different different things neither one having a bearing on the other and so with that being the case we just sort of take that a little bit of information and just kind of run with it but the overall gist here is that in order for them to truly understand what's going on they have to enter the sixth dimension and see how far this goes and see if they can't like find a way to at the very least solve things now there are a couple of things that kind of get mentioned in here for example like the Justice League has hidden from the from humanity the fact hidden from everybody on earth the fact that they broke the source wall they're like the multiverses spiraling towards its inevitable doom and then the reason why is because if the Justice League came out and said ok everybody fYI we kind of broke the source wall and so because that the entire multiverse is hurling to its imminent doom which will probably happen in like a few weeks or so society is going to completely and totally collapse right it's it's gonna totally fall apart and so of course what Mitchell fiddling says and this is kind of a throwaway Moeller from Scott Snyder but we can kind of accept it what Mitchell piddling says is that like with Batman as Superman they're essentially like like that might you know kind of the the Batman equivalent of like Mitchell Hitler is a ohia in in Mixel pedelec himself are the two most powerful mmm like the 5th dimension and so in the various escapades the various instances was emitted when mixup hit like had shown up and kind of bothered Superman what he'd been doing was essentially just like kind of bombarding him with energy that would allow him to access the six dimension now again this is really kind of a Scott Snyder just grabbing that throwing it in for the purpose of just being like we need a reason for Superman to be able to go in and he's the only one that can go in so like mix up hit a lick made it happen it's a very hand wavy kind of throwaway thing but it works for the nature of the story right I mean you can kind of yes you know and then just kind of gonna go with it and just sort of call it a day what what is up happening is Superman passes to the door and then immediately comes back and like he's older and I have to say let's be honest with ourselves here all right I know like Jorge or hegemonist who I think I think it's Jimenez is how you pronounce his last name the guy doing the art for this comic Superman looks amazing do you like old man Superman looks awesome and like do here's the crazy thing he's basically almost godlike in power but then then like we get this kind of rug pulled out from under us right because it's like hey welcome to the Hall of Justice which is unlike the future of what your universe is going to be and it's crazy and it looks amazing and all that kind of cool stuff and then we get the rug pulled out from under us when we actually end up running into like actual Superman who's just kind of on this singular planet of sorts in this almost infinite expanse of nothingness surrounded by like all these dead versions of himself and so it's kind of like okay so like what in the world is going on right now what in the world is happening right now and it's kind of a cool thing because what is up happening is that when that with the rest of the Justice League being unaware of the fact that Superman is missing because as far as they're aware this is him he's just kind of been here for decades and basically they won the war against Perpetua and everything the Justice League hoped would happen ended up taking place he basically says like you know before we answer any questions before we get too much into things just go explore the world I go explore this world and just see where it leads you and like in this world that they occupy it's basically perfect but it's like a perfect world it's pretty cool the way it works for example Jon Stewart has become the white lantern and like this future a future version of Barry and Jon has basically figured out a way to to like run in and out and to kind of move freely throughout the timestream without creating any kind of fracture without breaking anything and so the way this works is it's almost kind of like the end of Jonathan Hickman's Secret Wars right where like Jon Stewart basically uses the life entity to like create life on worlds and then Barry figures out where to put them in the timestream it's actually really cool like it's really awesome like they're creating entire multiverses everything is kind of orchestrated and built out of like this place that they occupy this space at the rent they associate is kind of like seed the multiverse seed new worlds the whole nine yards they're essentially gods and is it's kind of cool the way this plays out because didn't you switch over to Gotham City and Gotham City is a utopia and it's kind of a funny thing because that's sort of what Bruce Wayne was always fighting for white light to lead Gotham City to a place even if he didn't necessarily live long enough to get there but to lead it to a place where Gotham was kind of like not really like a metropolis but like something better where was a place that people wanted to be it was a place of spiritual and emotional you know growth in and relaxation a place where people could be at peace to see Gotham has finally achieved that and to see that it's kind of maintained the legacy of Batman by constructing and Max's a massive statue of to his legacy is kind of an honorable thing not only that we actually end up finding out that like Dick Grayson has taken over the mantle of Batman that Dick Grayson is like the guy who's basically you know kind of maintaining or at least not really may not even maintaining order the guy who's kind of overseeing all these things but again like this is this is a perfect world this is a perfect life this is what the Justice League has always been shooting for and so again kind of jumping back to Superman who's in this like this bleak and dark environment we end up having like this what was supposedly his future version this this future version of himself who shows up it says hey look man this can go one of two ways either you can like stop fighting and you can basically join my cause you can see things away that I see them and become a part of what it is that we're trying to achieve here or you can be left behind and be one of these countless bodies is sort of just dotting this landscape here and die in this place and it's kind of a crazy thing because what he is of saying is like that light up there that that Sun that you basically see will not be there forever and it's enough to keep you sustained but it's not gonna be enough for you to really like use your powers your powers will eventually drain right the solar energy you have built up in yourselves will eventually drain out and like you're gonna die in this place so answer me now like are you going to join me or are you not going to join me and ultimately by virtue of his thoughts and feelings Superman says no and so that basically leaves him to just kind of be down there and try to find a way out for himself but nobody else really knows what's going on and that's what we kind of switch back over to Batman again right I'm gonna kind of talk about this for a minute you switch back over to Batman and we end up finding out that Arkham Asylum has been torn down the villains are no longer an issue anymore and that while Alfred Pennyworth died after the Great War you know with perpetuo and all that kind of stuff that wound up happening was Arkham was basically replaced with like this sort of pennyworth home for individuals who were like looking for a reprieve right like people who are looking to kind of get back to their senses or to find a place of respite of relaxation that's what this is for and that Barbara Gordon plays a pretty big role in helping people get there but it's kind of a crazy thing because when all that happens of course we also end up finding out that in this future Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter ended up having a child together and that's when Martian Manhunter uses his telepathy pulls everybody in and says this world is not what it seems to be this world is not what you guys think it is this is a dark place here we don't know how dark this place is but this is all in illusion this place is a place of darkness a place of suffering in a place of paint and that's when their child kind of kind of pops up and says I'm the one that showed them what this were at least told them what this world is really like it's not a paradise it's not a utopia it is in a lot of ways and absolute living hell and so what is it going on is of course while this kind of message is being conveyed by the kid suddenly this older version of Superman pops up and says I will explain what it is that's going on I will tell them what's happening and of course once he imprisons the Justice League mentally that he simply goes through and starts to say the person that I am is to not Superman I took on this form to come for you I took out in this form so you wouldn't walk in here and immediately feel like you had to be on your guard I wanted your guards down and I wanted you to relax not so I could destroy you and kill you but so that you could be in a place to where when I reveal Who I am you're not going to immediately try to attack me now of course this is the Justice League they attack first and then ask questions later but this guy reveals himself to be the world fortress now again I want to talk about this for a second because this world for is your concept is relatively new and the reason why is the idea of like the I guess a forger of worlds really kind of came about with like Dark Knight's metal right eye all we really knew is that in the dark multiverse you had some system by which worlds were being created and when those worlds were created they were being judged if they were worth staying they'd be allowed to go up into the multiverse and become part of the multiverse if they were not they would be kept down there and they would remain within the dark multiverse of course that led to all different kinds of crazy and twisted alternate realities like the flash Batman hybrid Red Death and like you know the the murder machine where batman merges with like cyborgs and in august becomes cyborg and that kind of stuff just those twisted and really really really screwed up situations and so when when the world forger appears to them he actually really kind of challenges them without with a pretty significant thing and it actually really switches Batman over to kind of to his side what he does he sits down and he says in this multiverse that we live in and because of what you guys have done you've broken the source wall and because you've broken the source wall and because the Legion of Doom is trying to bring back Perpetua is only a matter of time before she arrives and so what the world forger has been doing is basically grabbing all these different members of the Justice League from across the entire multiverse and all these different villains you see we're powered beings and has kind of offered them an option either join me and become a part of my cause or stand against me and be in prison for all eternity presumably like forever and of course the question is asked do you ally with me or do you stand against me and the you know by again in the same way the Superman did by their thoughts and feelings stand against him and so they're immediately teleported to a world I guess a version of apocalypse that was created by the world forger now a lot of this stuff is being thrown into disarray a lot of the stuff is kind of being thrown into flux and the reason why is because when it comes to these concepts for the most part they've kind of been etched in stone when you talk about like apocalypse and like Darkseid the new gods all that kind of stuff by and large it's it's the way it exists right now is there's only one Darkseid and throughout the entirety of like the DC multiverse and there's only one highfather throughout the entirety of DC Multiverse there's only one apocalypse and there's only one New Genesis that's the way it works now when you were when we were talking about like post-crisis you know after 1985 when there was only one universe and no multiverse then the New Gods are basically out there in the universe and is kind of walled off from everything but now like like there's only one of them in the entire multiverse and so the implication seems to be here the indication seems to be that either this is a different universe in and of itself entirely or it's a whole other space that was created by the world forger and that really seems to be the case that it's not really a different multiverse it's just in the space at the various multiverses inhabit out in the distance somewhere is kind of like this little small localized galaxy right like own closet your house and so what this means is it like within this small little space what the world forger did is he built a version of apocalypse 100 times the size of the one that we would normally see in the multiverse and all those who stood against him are imprisoned there and it's kind of crazy because it's creating like it was essentially a pocket reality out there in the space that like inhabits the multiverse it's pretty far out there and it is really kind of mind-bending and a little wild but it's still cool to see because of course wal Superman's trying to find his way out while he's trying to like fight his way out of like this darker space of course you have like the rest of the Justice League who are imprisoned by what's essentially an alternate reality version of Lois Lane who ended up siding with the world forger and saying like I agree with his cause and I do this because I'm tired of seeing Jonathan Kent die in so many different universes I'm doing this because at the end of the day the lives that we saved will outweigh the lives we lose now the reality of this is actually 100% true and that's why I say like the Justice League is actually kind of stupid because what the world forger is proposing to them is saying look if Perpetua comes back she's gonna wipe away everything in existence like everything that exists right now she's gonna wipe it all away and she's gonna recreate it in the way that she believes it should be done and so if that's the case a countless number of beings from across all things in existence are going to die so what I ask of you is to ally with me and then travel the multiverse and and even move like beyond the multiverse and find other versions of yourself who will ally themselves with me if they stand against me will throw them in prison and of course the Justice League said no but that's stupid because what you're talking about is the preservation of untold numbers you know and the Justice League's like no because we're talking about imprisoning people and it's that's not cool you can't imprison people for things they haven't done but it's not as simple as like the right thing versus the wrong thing is it's as significant as like the destruction of all things right like of what use are moral principles if like all of reality gets wiped away it's nice to take this sort of high horse you know stance and well we always gotta make sure we do the right thing but like sometimes you got to be the bad guy because in order to like preserve all existence you got to do bad things it's the way it works there are no absolutes and right and wrong there's all kinds of gray areas and it's the only the old Batman is the only one who realizes that and the only one who seems to figure that out because he's the only one that stays behind and sides with the world for sure and saying like yeah man sometimes you just got to do bad things like like that's just the way that it works you know this kind of high horse absolute I always do good I never do bad kind of moral philosophy that the Justice League walks around with that can't work because at the end of the day they can't do what needs to be done in order to make sure that like everybody gets safe it's kind of a cool thing and it's kind of a cool moment because what it really does is it takes the Justice League as heroes and it looks them in the face and says you guys are a half-measure you guys are all talk and like half brawn at the end of the day you guys put like goodness above what needs to be done and it's kind of a cool thing right because sometimes you got to sacrifice your moral compass in order to get the job done and so it's a it's a cool little moment here because where the Justice League is initially freed by like the the son the future son of Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter and then of course they're basically rescued by like the Legion of Doom right like thousand Estero and cheetah and gorilla grodd but then we also end up finding out that like they're also joined by Darkseid presumably Darkseid in the future and again that's where things kind of get murky because if what we're doing is we're talking about a future story then it makes a lot more sense if you say the events of this are confined strictly to the multiverse but for the most part Darkseid never really seemed to indicate himself as a character who would take up arms with the Legion of Doom or like any earthbound superhero group or even supervillain group for the purpose of like achieving a goal right like Darkseid's always been a villain who stands alone if he can't do it on its own that means they're like it cannot be done you know and so it's it's kind of a cool thing because what this does is this really kind of Scott Snyder pointing to the future importing to the idea of Perpetual and saying this is really how bad it gets like it gets bad enough that like Darkseid ends up having to ally himself with various superheroes or or like the Legion of Doom because it's the only way to preserve all things in existence and Darkseid is nothing if not a being that values his own his own preservation as it was kind of a cool moment because what is up happening here is that Batman's kind of given a test by the world for to write like a test of loyalty and it's like if you truly want to ally yourself with me then the one thing you have to realize if Superman he'll never back down you'll never take the stance that you did Superman will never take the stance of if you want to make an omelet you got to break a few eggs he's never gonna take that stance instead like he's always gonna say no there's got to be a way to Britain to make that omelet without breaking some eggs I don't know how it is maybe heat vision he can just do that but still like he'll he'll never take that position and so because of that he'll never ever be able to join our ranks that place that he's in that pocket reality does the world forger created that Superman is confined in the bodies that are there they'll always be filled with Superman because in every single universe that he's been to and in every single multiverse that he's visited Superman always stands against him and that's when Batman that's when the questions kind of asked by Batman if I pull this son away if I yank it away will he die fast and the wolf forger says yes and then Batman says I'm sorry Clark but is what we have to do and basically pulls the son away from Superman and effectively kills him and it's kind of a cool little moment because when that happens Superman just sort of falls back down to this reality that he's been in and by all standards of measurement it appears he's going to die now there are a couple things that go on with regards to the Justice a talking to the Legion of Doom but it's an interesting moment because it's kind of a coming together right like the Legion of Doom says hey look at the end of the day like we realize that like the world for sure is essentially wrong we kind of brought this future about like we brought this this this universe for this perspective future about ourselves you know because we were the ones who released her like we were the ones who release perpetual we're the ones that basically caused all this if it hadn't been for us then like none of this would have happened and so what this means is that the Legion of Doom is trying to make up for their past sins I mean Lex Luthor's out of the picture we never really find out what he's become we just know that whatever it is that he's become was like dark and twisted and really screwed up and so it was like okay you know so like they've been trying to make amends this entire time for what they'd previously done in the past and so of course being chased by by the forces of Lois Lane and being chased you know kind of around this this you know six dimension ultimately like they managed to find a wormhole and they're jettisoned out whether there's Chaza this wormhole and and what that does is basically bring him back into like the main DC Universe and it's it's a great little send-off it is actually a great little moment and the reason for this is because Lois Lane basically tells him he looked Superman was kind of put in stasis when he was shot into this pond and then given like images designed to sort of acclimate him to like what earth was supposed to be like so that when he didn't show up here he wasn't like immediately threatened by the first human he saw having no idea what they were and then just attachment right like that's not what would happen instead he would show up and he would be acclimated and relatively familiar with the environment of Earth so that when he saw humans he would realize okay they're not the worst thing ever I mean like even as a baby he wouldn't like panicking and lose his mind or anything like that and so what Lois says is like we perfected that technology and what we can do now is we can basically bombard people with these rays of sorts we can put you into a state where you fall asleep and then condition you to basically agree with us and so it's kind of cool because when that happens they literally start bombarding the ship without the Legion of Doom and the Justice League with all these rays threatening to put them to sleep and that's why the Justice League is shot out and sent to this portal by the by the the Legion of Doom because it's the only way to get them back it's the only way to get them out of this place and so the Legion of Doom actually crashes their ship and it's one of the it's one of the most awesome things ever because thousand Estero is like flying this ship into the forces of Lois Lane and he's like ah yes you know that old feeling isn't it how can I ever forget the power of fear and it's just it's just like this amazing moment I feel like it could have been like a little more grandiose right like a little more a little more drawn-out you know like the last ride of thousand Estero and the Legion of Doom it would have been pretty awesome and it could have it could have been put together pretty well but that's when we end up basically you know emerging with the scenario where Batman dons this god armor and literally like just kind of wages this conflict against the Justice League that's one of the important things to bear in mind here is that in this particular moment Batman has essentially become God right he has all the power not really all the powers but like the entire backing of of the world forager behind him this vastly powerful entity now again the way the world forger functions is he says okay look I basically create worlds and send them out there like that's my purpose that's my job that's the role that I play in this entire multiverse and you know potentially multiple multiverses and so would that being the case he literally turns his weapons on the Justice League Batman goes to fight them all like we just call him bad god like that God goes to fight them all and all the while he's basically calling out to Superman and that's what we end up finding out again Batman was kind of planning this under the table the entire time under normal circumstances I would make fun of this and just be like of course Batman did because prep time or something like that but I'm not because it's actually pretty awesome Batman trick to god it's actually pretty cool I guess it's pretty amazing the way this happens like it's all happening under the current because what he knew the one thing Batman knew and the one thing the world forger did not know is that Superman did this version of him this this prime version of Superman is more powerful than all the others right it's what the world forger told Batman he said look Batman asked the question can he break out and the world forger says well none of the other Superman have been able to but this one's different this is the prime Superman what it seems to indicate is that like this was the first universe and all the other universes that are out there that are part of the multiverse are templates meaning it's the half-life effect right you can only ever be half as much as the thing that made you and so that's basically what what seems to be going on here is like none of the other Superman out there are on par with the prime Superman from the main DC Universe and so where none of them were able to break out it doesn't mean he cannot and that's what Batman was banking on Batman was baking on on this this gambit this idea that if he were to pull the son away that Superman wouldn't give up that he would keep on trying to find a way and that's exactly what happens the energy put off by the Justice League kind of combined with this sort of dream sequence of Superman has basically leads him to realize it like the Forenza D has will always be there like that like what he needed was this this kind of courage to not give up in this moment when he wanted to quit in this moment when he wanted to stop he didn't and that all these little stars all these things that had basically kind of been thrown out there by by Batman were available for Superman to take advantage of and he literally flies into a star and then comes out but it seems like he's almost infinitely more powerful than he was before right because all it says is like he's a million lanterns he's a million flames lit by effort you know by by steady hands was a he moves faster than he ever has at a speed beyond physics he's more powerful than he's ever been Superman was already on par with with most gods I would say he's probably beyond them now right like it's God Superman and God Batman in terms of the power he possesses now how that compares to Superman 1 million I don't know just take a guess in whatever your guess is is right I have no clue but in the moment right now I would say the Superman and Batman possess the power of God and it's kind of a crazy thing to see because one is up happening in the way this kind of kind of gets laid out is this almost kind of like a red connoisseurs right I mean what Scott Snyder says is that the way this world forger works is like this when we think about a singular universe like you have all these events that transpire the take place and then like crisis on Infinite Earths happens and the way we always imagined it is an event like crisis on Infinite Earths wipes away everything that was there before and then you kind of go forward with like a whole new creation that's not what Scott Snyder's telling us what Scott Steiner is telling us here is that reality gets wiped away except for like the characters and and you know to a degree the fact there's somewhat like shells right like they're vessels for their new essences as they've been made by the world forager to house right so like the world forager designs a new version of Superman he designs a new version of Batman of Wonder Woman of all these characters he wipes away the essence of who they are and replaces it with that new essence and so the only thing that really changes is the environment around them the world that they live in and to a degree who they are as people in terms of how they view the world and how it impacts them but again like with the with a possibility existing that like this entire universe is gonna be wiped away and it's all gonna be totally obliterated Superman seemingly comes flying out of nowhere now how Superman got here we don't really know but given the kind of power he possesses now I would surmise Superman flew through two dimensions to get here he broke out of the sixth dimension flew through the fifth dimension through the fourth dimension and then came into the third dimension so I would say he flew through three dimensions in order to get here Superman busted through dimensional barriers in order to get here to where the rest of the Justice League is and with a singular punch lays out the world fortune he doesn't kill him he just totally like flattens him and lays him out and the world for justice kind of like wow now where he expects Superman to kill him Superman says no we're not going to kill you but with everything that's coming with everything that's happening everything with Perpetua we're going to need you like we're gonna need a power like yours to basically save us to keep us protected or at the very least to aid us in this massive battle that we're gonna be facing without you we stand no real chance here and so that's when the Justice League is also faced with the fact that what the Legion of Doom had done is a it basically shown up to the rest of the world and said hey the Justice League broke the source wall the Justice League set the multiverse on its path to destruction the only way for you guys to save us or the free to save yourselves is to put your faith in us now kind of a background story that was going on here was that mr. Mixel Pitta like you just kind of gone crazy and basically sort of like wiping away everything we're trying to destroy everything and the Justice League essentially called in bat-mite now that's an actual Legion of Doom story I'm pretty sure and so we're gonna cover that as a separate video that way we can kind of focus on it in its totality but basically the takeaway from this is that the Legion of Doom they're now on their way to basically bringing in Perpetua Lex Luthor when two Lex Corp essentially sacrifice them self you have amanda waller who was subjugated by what was left of the legion of tim they took all this information on we're like the most powerful and dangerous villains throughout the entire world were being held it's basically year of the villain number one all the things that kind of go into it they either set the stage or came out of it and so not only that once it's all said and done and Lex Luthor begins to re-emerge what seems to go on here and I could be wrong but what seems to go on here is that Lex Luthor basically reverts back to like his dark side war version Lex Luthor begins to turn into Darkseid again I don't know if that's true I'm not a hundred percent sure that's true it's kind of hard to tell but that's what it looks like so let me know what you guys think down in the comments section but if you are new here two comments explain make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the rob4 if you guys enjoyed this video make sure you drop a like and I will catch you all later peace [Music] you [Music]
