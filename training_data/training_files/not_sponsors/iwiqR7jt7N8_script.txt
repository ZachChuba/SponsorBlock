[Music] good morning everybody I thought I would do a Sunday morning routine this is just gonna be a super-duper chill video of what I get up to you on a Sunday morning for every single morning Nelly jumps on my tummy to wake me up and then he proceeds to lick my hand I don't really know why and give me a kiss what a cutie and I owned up falling back asleep but when I do wake up I just grab my glasses and go ahead and make the bed [Music] let there be light [Music] Nellie she wants una huh she wasn't una yeah look at Lord Nelson e in his tuna he's so cute you've chosen I really want to know because I was so torn okay let's get on to washing my hair I literally look like Monica in the humidity it's the humidity so let's make my hair look ten times better first of all obviously I'm using the shampoo as you can see I put the pump on this bottle and it works amazingly [Music] after I've washed that out it's time to put the conditioner on I cannot get over how nice he smell as I said I chose the peach fragrance which is one of my favorite scents ever and it smells delicious but now that that's all washed out it's time to towel dry my hair and move on to drying it with the hairdryer [Music] but now let's go and make me some breakfast I am hungry my go-to breakfast is porridge I love porridge so much I just use 30 grams of oats or 40 depending how hungry I am and then I use this skinny syrup which is actually made for coffee but I put it in my porridge and it tastes delicious that's a little hack for you I always have a banana with my porridge if I run out of bananas honestly I'm so sad because they're banana makes the whole porridge nice [Music] so I just sit down for a little bit take it easy on a Sunday morning turn shining [Music] and I'm actually watching a line of duty from the very beginning right now I'm on to season 3 so I just went ahead and watched a little bit of that [Music] and then on a Sunday I always like to get out of the house so I always tend to go on a mid-morning stroll today obviously because it's me I went on a walk to Starbucks and I had work to do so I just sat and did some work on a Sunday cry for me no I'm kidding I actually find it so fun editing videos [Music] but that is the end of my relaxed Sunday morning routine let me know in the comments what you get up to you in a morning once again there will be a 20% downbar if you guys want to check it out don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and I will see you in the next one bye [Music]
