and that's it it's that easy good luck friends a honeycombed one buy one that has one door and can hold a tier 2 workbench 6 furnaces 9 large boxes and is only 1136 metal frags and 46 high-quality metal on upkeep and it's a 16 rocket raid how'd he do it you might be asking well I'm here to show you how to make this annoying as [ __ ] to rave little solo paradise well quite the intro boasted quite a lot let's fill up the Franco this [ __ ] and just jump straight just jump straight into it alright you gonna start with a square then you're gonna do these triangles like a side door way it's going to be your only door on the baseball nice two walls and the two half walls up top ah that's beautiful fill in that part there nice all right we got the triangles that we need there very nice all right so we're gonna place our boxes down below yeah so you can't really build this base from the start like as a starter base if you're a solo player this base is recommended for a solo because it's essentially just a one by one you are going to want to start from a 1 by 2 just on the ground you know you know your normal [ __ ] or 2 by 2 or something like that all right we got those up on waste let's go back down here we're going to place a hard ball and then our whole wall on top of it there's anger that would destroy that nice so there's no half ball here we've got three storage boxes already the unifor it's looking great so we're going to just put a ceiling on that one also what you want to do is you want to add triangles down here like that beautiful now we're gonna put some nice so what slam these three more boxes here just like I'm doing here we'll squeeze him in there I'm sure let's try this way let's try that again get it as close as we can all the way back here xanga maybe was this box here come on you're embarrassing me in front of my friends place stam yeah ah I knew it fit but yeah that's you pretty much want to do these from the roof you pretty much need to and then you just look it's beautiful isn't it that's pretty much it yeah we're gonna do the necessary upgrades and show you the honeycomb and all that [ __ ] and all the placements inside as well so you are going to need place one up and down can be a little fiddly to get in and out but it's not too bad and we're gonna place another one ah this is pretty much your entrance now keep in mind you are going to need shotgun traps or you can get pretty deep done up in this area that's it just this area so you're gonna want shotgun fracture but also we're going to chuck down our furnaces up here because this is where the six furnaces go [Music] I'm the fourth one over yeah five and six done Nate shotgun traps you're going to place just just and also on there and it watches that jump up right there you can't just can't get through it no matter how hard you try you're not gonna get through that and once you shoot it in sand or something like that but you know that comes with the raid so here we are in this area up here it's looking good right now oh we need a tool cabinet so we're gonna get it as close as we possibly can to that corner they're gonna have our tier two down here as well that's sleeping bag box another box down here we need box that [ __ ] in place him like that ah four boxes in the main loop and then three up here you can even I think you could even do this oh my god I thought I place that box with a bit of punch yeah I know all right now let's just make sure see if we can reach our furnaces now you can't so this takes a little bit of placement yeah I know you can do it now we can reach that fast we can still fit through can we Venice yes we can so there you go there's another two boxes on top of that if you really want that you can do it if you need the space but that will bring our total of boxes to nine all right and that is pretty much the core of this base done so when you want to log off I said a week has to be Twigg not stuck here I'm gonna do I don't trust you guys tweak then I gotta go back to start so it's gonna be a little finicky hey bottom of the lineup and then when you wake up you spawn in here destroy that look there we go done now I do recommend once the space is fully operated and stuff that you do upgrade that floor got a place below me to my quad so right now we're going to do all the necessary let's just say that we let's just say we fully upgraded this base to sheet metal so I'm just going to upgrade it all bizango look at that everything is sheet metal now if you can't get the high qual straight away you know it's something you do work at so if you don't have any high quality this is your upkeep at the moment 897 mill friends nothing you definitely want these two triangles let me show you these to raise triangles you want them metal straight away and unless you be pickaxe of jackhammer right some metal and then they're probably the first thing you gotta want to operate as well hey guy like that this is how it's looking so far just beautiful isn't it so tiny so neat but such a [ __ ] arrayed that's what I should call this design the [ __ ] yeah we've got our door on what we're gonna do now is we're gonna do all the necessary upgrades so you can upgrade these from this sled we'll just jump in here and do it so we've got that pod upgraded and boom you also want to do this area and this that's all y'all I quilling now officially done would that regret that so let's see the cost of the up cake right now 43 high-qualified hundred and seventy eight metal francs that is nothing and at the moment it is a fifteen rocket raid we could we can increase that to a 16 rocket red just with this little upgrade here so what we're going to do is we're going to switch to metal let's assume they at this point you can upgrade to metal now everything put that roof on top we're gonna put low foundations here that a square cuz you can't put the raised and then we're gonna put two raised triangles right there this one boom you know you just want anyways is that how easy is that now this is a true solo players paradise this is a sixteen rocket raid I'll show you the easiest spot to read it still you know will it be worth it's a solo player I don't know so you open the door one rocket into that ten explosive bullets and then fifteen Rockets right there and you're into the TC room main loop that is the cheapest way to read it let's say the bus at the door went up top here [ __ ] around with the shotgun traps the whole time and then they wanted to read down here to another sixteen rockets plus a lot of a lot of screwing around with all that and then when they come down here they probably will still get [ __ ] on because traps two more shotgun traps and we're going to place back there I'm going to have a shotgun trap a shotgun trap place that voila that is my simple us one by one sixteen rocket raid base Oh imagine if they came in through the side what's that there's fifteen rockets plus another hey that's twenty three rockets if they go over and from the side oh ouch also this is the final upkeep 1136 metal frags and forty-six high quality Oh but anyway goes thank you very much for watching and as always I will catch you in the neck Jack [Music] pinky promise that it all be [Music]
