bag noted [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] this EPA cover I'm doing is so much fun it's been so I reputed to keep it really loose alike and purposely make it more imperfect than I usually would it also carry it in is I see why people why adult color books now [Music] okay we are filming outside because I need to film a Q&A before you go to an airport rocket and I and the rest of the family are going to Chiang Mai in Thailand so yeah this is our lovely lush Singaporean background hopefully you can hear me I don't say thank you to and a 10% discount on your first purchase ready for the QA what are things you can or can't achieve when painting digitally versus physically I think the one challenge that I have that I would love to be able to achieve is the imperfection of drawing traditionally in digital painting it's really hard to get imperfections obviously because you're using crea created brushes textures that have already been created and also layered and also repeated so that's the hardest thing one thing that I find useful with digital work is being able to color match like your pre-existing palette so when I'm doing client works if it's like a logo job or if it's something that requires specific colors to meet branding or meet like start the style guide of the company I'm working for I'll opt to use digital because you can create perfect color schemes whereas with watercolor it can be hard when you mix the color it might drive differently like you can always do tests that if you layer up too much it can be a completely different color so that's what I would say there's not a lot you can't do with traditional you definitely can do it but it's a lot harder to get the color palette yobs okay do you think it's too late for someone to start learning how to draw such illustrate in early 20s heck no of course not from Rosalie Gascoigne she's an Australian artist she makes installation works and she started making out when she was 50 years old and she's a national treasure so no I don't think it's ever too late to start learning how to be creative how do you do with time crunches all-nighters or is sleep above all try and get as much sleep as I can but sometimes that just doesn't happen I've been a lot better in the last couple of years with time management I think that just comes with experience knowing how long things are gonna take but in high school and in university I did all-nighters all the time I think I'm getting to the age where I'm just like I don't have time for all-nighters I don't get wrinkles sorry baby your abs okay how do you get clients I want to do what you're doing but I don't know where to start I am very fortunate now that I pretty much don't reach out to anyone I think because of my audience size and the fact that I've worked with a bunch of clients before they just need to email Chris or they reach out to me on Instagram and that's it I don't have to do any seeking but if you're beginning what I did I did this one time and it really worked out well for me it starting to rain but whatever what I did when I was younger is I went on to like this bed I don't know everybody told this story I wouldn't talk like a band that I really likes a website and I found like all the emails on their MySpace page I was email my portfolio every single email and then I got like a multiple jobs with multiple bands because it was their manager that reach back out to me her EP covers I did like an album cover merge designs stuff like that so it was really really good for me so I would suggest just like putting your work out there and sharing it with people that you admire or sharing it with possible clients or reaching out to people that you know who have work for you so I'm not talking like directly to France I'm talking to agencies talking about like managers of specific like events or something like that you know what I mean like people that can put you forward to clients to give you the work what types of classes do you attend in middle school to get experience with the basics of painting um I'm not really sure what middle school is is it like year seven or something no I don't think that's what it is because that's like sophomore or whatever I don't okay if you're American sorry I don't know what that is or any other country that uses that system I'm just gonna say in general I would take visual arts any sort of design courses that help you with creative thinking would be really good as well and help you with like program so any graphics technology or graphic design courses because then you'll learn how to use the programs to create work because your lights as the main one I think but we also study visual design that's where I rock and I Mets it I would suggest that so you can meet your future boy how do you determine how much paint to mix before ordering particularly large paintings what do you do with excess paint and finally what do you look for in a paintbrush whoa whoa uh-huh I think it's become quite natural knowing how much paint to put out but also I find it quite easy to mix colors like I'm pretty good with color theory and I am quite intuitive with my color palettes so I have no problem with mixing more I'd rather go less as not to waste paint and what do you do with excess paint it depends what it is if it's watercolor on a palette I can just keep that for next time I don't use the kinds of paints that dry out and you can't use anymore so I usually just reuse them what do you look for in a paintbrush I like soft bristles and I always use round brushes and like and detail brushes do you have any uh am I know making that clicking sound again so you started and basically half the plants same just slowly throughout the whole thing I'm not used I'm not used to sitting down and I mean standing up do you have any I like from when you're at school college uni and if so would you ever do a video in which you show so I'd love to see I would be willing to do it if I can find some if you guys want to see it let me know and maybe I'll do it if I'm not too humiliated and ashamed but he see yourself in ten years um I don't really know I never think ahead I just go with the flow I'd like to have lots of children's books under my belt and I would like to do a lot more like I'd like to eventually have like a studio where I do more commercial illustrative work for brands whether it be like packaging or branding and working with other designers and stuff under the umbrella of my studio but that's just a pipe dream right now I'm really really content with creating like artwork for companies and also just doing whatever I want gold hi Sean I'm not very patient when it comes to making illustrations and I finish fast and with a not very good result what do you recommend to me I would suggest like pushing through a finishing isn't just like when you finish the last line I'll fill the page it should be when you're happy with the work so continue until you're happy with it not when you think it's not a good result you know what I mean obviously sometimes you have to be like I don't want this anymore but all all the time you can really push through and create a good artwork okay that's it thank you for watching hope you liked it I'll be back with another video soon feel free to do whatever you want to do to support me aka you want to subscribe you can't do you want to like you can't if you want to buy stuff from my store support my sponsors that would be awesome anyway bye [Music]
