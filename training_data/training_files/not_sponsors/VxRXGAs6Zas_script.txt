hello and welcome everyone to another video so today we have update 2020.20.1 and uh as usual let's find out what it means for autopilot what has changed and what's getting better hopefully now before we dive into the actual test i have noticed in the past couple of updates that after you get an update the car still downloads over 100 megabytes for some reason so maybe it's some tweaking um i don't know but uh it's kind of peculiar that in the past couple of updates um yeah it's mostly in the next day or so that it downloads even more after your uh install your outdate but anyway here we have the hillcrest where i'm interested in the downward section where it loses the lane markings on the left side last time it was giving only a little jiggle let's see what it does now yeah it goes a little bit to the side starting to search for the center of that really wide lane at that point but yeah nothing to be too worried about coming up on the s-curve the last update it was slowing down before the curve let's see if that sticks around in this update yep it is slowing down that's good staying within the lanes slowing down a little bit more going a little bit too much to the outside of the lane there i got the impression that it was a little bit better oh this is better in centering in the lane i got the impression that the first part it kept better within the lane and then it went at the end of the first turn it went to the outside of the lane now let's see what it does when i try to enter the highway so i need to confirm a lane change okay it is slowing down making the lane change it doesn't want to oh i get the time out here because the car behind me was also cutting in and here we have the automatic blinking again even when i'm on the rightmost lane of the highway it thinks i'm still next to the highway or something i don't know but the reason why it i got the timeout was the car behind me was also moving into the highway and that meant that the gap behind the car was not big enough for me to legally between quotes entered the highway so uh yeah then the car just refuses to do that because of the unece or 79 regulations now traffic is a little busy right now with a lot of trucks but let's see how it handles this double exit so here's the first part yep doing well and making a second adjustment again to find the center of that lane so that still needs some work but it's the same as the previous update now let's see how it takes the second update here or the second exit sorry oh that was rather abruptly okay that uh was a little bit worse than the previous one but uh yeah it still took it okay so let's see if i can work with this truck to see if i go from the third lane to the second lane if it still detects the truck thinking it's in the second lane and in the way of my lane change so next to the truck activating going no no it cancels it going it didn't display the truck this time but it still stopped the movement it showed the red lanes thinking there was someone behind me when it wasn't and the truck was in the two lanes over basically so that still needs to be fixed now let's try that again with another one so there is no car behind me i'm going to initiate when i'm next to that truck so here we go initiating trying to move trying to move yep and then it cancels a little bit and it still detects the truck in that second lane now let's quickly get off here and see what the double exit taking does on this exit so first part yeah again it's in two parts so it moves to the side and then it moves the second time whoa going straight on for way too long i got the impression that it was going to drive just straight on now let's see if it takes the second exit here i've had some uh bad experiences with this on this update let's see what it does today not doing it not doing it yep yep okay so now it's working i get the feeling that it's kind of an on and off thing [Music] most of the time it works but sometimes it still freaks out and uh i get a high curvature warning or uh the car just uh stops autopilot starts screaming at me with the red hands saying it disables autopilot so yeah that could still use some improvement but today it was doing it quite okay so it has started to rain a very tiny bit it's not going to influence the results here but here we're coming up on the lane shift let's hope we can get a green light and we can continue straight on let's see nope light just turn red but that means i can continue on autopilot if i just slow down and go to zero okay looks good all right so i'm going to help it accelerate still on autopilot no truck parked here let's see what it does yep that's still good and it takes uh my gut feeling is it's a little bit more distance from the right curb but yeah i still have no problem trusting it there in this version and this is our final test where it loses the lane markings altogether last update it was hunting for the center of the road let's see if it stays on the right side here nope it is going to the center now what does it do here it still stays in the center now it goes to the right okay so let me slow down for the intersection all right oh going through the center in that turn let me just leave some additional room here with the car in front of me and let's try to get through that little lane shift at the end with the divider at 30 kilometers an hour and see if that is any different now here we have another intersection but the mirror on the left side is blocked so i have to watch out here okay that's good now let's see what it does here with that divider last time i tested it it was really butt clinching but yeah it did make it but still it is really narrow and i hardly trust it to scrape my wheels so yeah i wouldn't use it there in any normal circumstances and here it just stays on the right side which is good all right conclusion time so what do i think about this update well first of all i think there is a small improvement in the s-curve where it keeps more to the center of the lane but still in the end it goes too much to the outside of the turn and that makes it too close to oncoming traffic to really trust it in that situation but overall tiny improvement i think in keeping that center so that's definitely a good thing um as for the double exit um i've had some bad luck with uh taking that i've had some high curvature warnings i've had some uh cases where i just refused to take it it was just driving straight on so it's an on and off thing from my experience in this situation i get the feeling that about 75 of the time it actually works and 25 of the time it starts freaking out and creating potentially dangerous situations by going halfway through it and then canceling uh or just uh disabling autopilot altogether so it still needs some work to get that to work properly now what also needs work is of course the trucks so when you're driving in the third lane truck is in the first lane and you want to move over it still thinks that the truck is in the second lane apparently either it's not high on the priority list for tesla or this is a difficult problem to solve for one reason or the other i don't know which one it is but i do know that this is something that really needs to be solved now the problem i had uh with entering the highway i explained already that was because of you and ece regulations um for which i have a very tiny update and that is that talks are still ongoing no real decisions have been made yet but there is a talk about conditional uh hands-on steering wheel timeouts so right now that's set at 15 seconds there is a talk about reducing that to 12 seconds but conditionally so that means that if uh tesla for example can prove that they are safe for a longer period then will they will be allowed or they might be allowed to get hands off for a longer period but for stocks only september is the next official meeting so only then will we know uh what it will mean practically and whether the other decisions will be approved or the other suggestions will be approved with the increased lateral acceleration um so yeah there you have it overall a standard update only minor things that changed nothing really out of the ordinary but again it's uh not taking anything away either so that's definitely good and as usual if you like
