not long ago i had the most powerful runescape account ever certain builds are better than others and by specializing in certain skills i figured out a way to construct one with the most damage output possible while still able to attack low levels with the release of iron man mode i abused the combat triangle to maximize ko potential optimized my magic to strength level ratio through the combat formula and beat the desert treasure quest with just 10 hit points unlocking some of the most powerful spells in the game i felt like the king of pvp destroying everybody in my path the first account with entirely offensive stats and zero defensive stats at all i was an absolute machine nobody stood a chance since then i've made some mistakes that led me to getting 11 hit points ruining the aesthetic of my build but 12 hit points was intentional i needed the granite maul which is now my most powerful weapon but then i got 13 hit points killing a blood veld another mistake what are you an idiot sandwich so yes as my 10th grade teacher once said martin you're acting like an idiot but that doesn't stop me from trying because i still have many levels to train and items to acquire to make this account as good as it can get and that's what counts right right welcome to the next 10 minutes of your life where i try to convert 400 hours of mind-numbing runescape exploration into one packaged narrative that ultimately only adds to the amount of time i've wasted onto this ruined account [Music] [Music] at expressvpn.com chem q for the first 20 hours of my progress i have the privilege of showing you 80 runecrafting accompanied by a substantial source of blood runes my work has paid off running out of runes to cast spells is something i do not have to worry about for the foreseeable future but what i'm greatly lacking now are cannonballs they are the lifeblood of this account because i need 250 000 more to get 99 ranged beyond that my canon is required for dismantling organized crime in zea which awards me with many experience books to be used on strength of which i also need 99. the canon is virtually the only way to kill monsters without gaining hit points experience but this great benefit doesn't come without its downsides on an account that can't trade steel bars are required to make cannonballs and it is coal and iron that smelt into steel bars i mined a lot of these resources myself already but i need to buy the rest from ordan 125 000 of each making the quantity of cannonballs i need will deplete my resources be tedious and mentally draining and take hours upon hours playing consistently months will pass before i complete my goal of getting 500 000 cannonballs [Music] at last there we go 125 000 iron ore and just over that with the coal i need to make 125 000 steel bars fortunately i'm already at the blast furnace so i can get started right now part two begins turning all of my ore into steel bars [Music] here it goes breaking the 100 000 mark we gotta say goodbye to 100 000 iron ore ah it was good well it lasted i loved those white stacks it was beautiful 25 000 steel bars only one-fifth of the way level 90 smithing was just achieved beautiful 91 smithing achieved i no longer have to boost my level to make runite limbs which is basically the rune crossbow one of my stronger weapons and a long time later i'd finally hit 100 000 steel bars made entirely from scratch and on the way to the full 125 000 i managed to get another smithing level now at 92. [Music] 125 000 steel bars phase two completed now just to make them into cannon balls phase three here we go [Music] there are the first four to be made [Music] 94 smith 95 smithing excellent 400 000 cannibals wow just passed 400 000 cannonballs and 96 smithing i've never had this high of a smithing level it actually feels so strange oh looks good looks good here it is oh it's been so long i've probably had this goal for a year it's finally done 500 000 cannonballs oh my gosh i am free of this place finally oh it's so beautiful look at that stack god let's see it in the bank plop it in there there it is despite ruining the build with 13 hit points instead of 10 this account is still very powerful with the granite mall but surprisingly there's an item i can chase that i think is even better the dragon claws every bat i catch cook and eat and the raids that i complete slightly increases the chance of me getting the dragon claws oh another raid complete 1-1-1 no loot unfortunately casey 112. there are 10 people and i got 10 of points so well that's pretty good 11 if you round up i'll take it and the loot is oh herbs oh kiddo no not a lot of points here's good raid and let's go find out what we got what do we do more herbs at least it was kind of quick that's like 36k points an hour if i keep at it 905 soul runes come on for dry let's pull an item well i got what i asked i got what i asked death runes i love death runes hell yeah all right raid 115 completed yeah apparently i have the most points in this raid i didn't even look at the total another raid complete we finished the raid but we got nothing 18 000 points raid 119 pretty good loot from raid 120 who got the decks mizoid all right well i had 12.5 percent of the uh the points there in a nine man raid that's something i'm very happy with beautiful dynamite beautiful that's exact oh that is what i want mining xp and smithing xp with the radar money hell yeah they finished that raid so quickly i am shocked i only got 13k points and with 125 raids completed the dragon claws are still nowhere in sight but i'm optimistic as long as i stick with it for the long haul i will get them eventually but in the meantime i'm going to keep doing some crazy stuff the other night someone reached out to me requesting the help of my particular account it was sir pugger who's an amazing runescape video maker you should definitely check out anyway he told me about this huge bot farm in level 42 wilderness that could only really be destroyed by an extremely low level with ice barrage we went out together and hopped into the bots at the same time this is what happened like some worlds have two some worlds i've seen 15 and they only insta log if it's your combat bracket like if you can attack them okay okay ready on go three two one go hopping [Music] oh my god huge xp drop oh my god oh my god we got them all we got literally all of them oh my god you're good thank you thank you oh i just killed you oh no that's fine that's fine don't worry about it okay there's a pk are coming i have to log out oh no serp hugger uploaded a full video about that which you can find in the description below as for me i've been waiting a full year to use these cannonballs and i cannot wait to blow some stuff up i'll be off visiting family for the next week so when i don't upload don't worry that i died or something
