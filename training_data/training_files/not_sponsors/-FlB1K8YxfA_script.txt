we all knew it was coming but Samsung has made it official we're getting the Galaxy Note 10 and the Galaxy Tab s 6 and there's some pretty cool upgrades for illustrators and creative professionals I'm gonna be covering some of those today this video description onto the video it wasn't that long ago that samsung press conferences were cringefest but they've become much better than the one we saw today was really watchable it moved fast it was a little over an hour and I covered things that really pertained to customers as opposed to stockholders the highlight of course were the new phones you got the note 10 and the 10 plus I'm gonna be paying a lot of attention also to the tab s6 which is a follow up to the tab s4 the released last year which is their ipad competitor who saw some new watches we saw a laptop I am gonna be talking about the laptop a little bit just because I think the design is kind of cool but primarily I'm gonna be focusing on the phone and the new tab so let's get to the phones first not a lot of this was a secret we all knew it was coming we even knew when it was coming but the one thing that I really like about this new design is the punch hole camera at the top of the screen I love it I much prefer that they are embracing this camera the front-facing camera is a design element instead of hiding it in a notch you're not gonna hide it we all know it's there just embrace it use it and overall I'm just a fan of the aesthetic you know the fact that they're going edge and really wrapping around the edges and the thing is is basically a full screen I'm willing to take a little camera dot at the top there is one little thing as I notice that the chin on these phones it is it is tiny I know it is tiny but one thing when I'm designing anything I like to keep margins equal so if there's gonna be a little space at the top I want it to be the same height is at the bottom and here the bottom is about twice the height and I know we're talking about like a millimeter but but it's different and because it's different it looks off to me I just wish that they had added a little bit more to the top to offset that or just found a way to kind of get rid of that little extra tiny bit of black along the bottom it bugs me probably one of those little things that when you when you have in your hand you're not gonna notice at all but when you're looking at screenshots you know looking at it from a distance you notice it there are two sizes here there is this smaller one the ten but it's not really small it's just small and then of course the ten Plus which is the largest one they make now the fingerprint sensor is cool they've managed to find a way to get it underneath the screen and kind of hide away so I'm curious to use that in real life like how well does it work when you kind of bury it under the screen if it works well I'm probably gonna prefer that over something like face ID now last year the S Pen added some Bluetooth features and primarily that was just added not so much for the drawing note-taking side of things but it was added so you can control the camera you can set the camera up in front of you and use it to like take pictures and things like that what's kind of cool about this year is they've taken those features those Bluetooth features that they've added into that pen and they've expanded on it quite a bit there's more controls for the camera and things like that so that's kind of neat but they've added an accelerometer and some other fancy-pants stuff into there to allow you to do like motion gestures and things like that at the presser they had a travel blogger showing how she would use it like with the little motions controls and I got to tell you the whole thing reminded me of the old weed remotes for the Nintendo Wii now now I'm just saying Nintendo's making mobile games now I'm saying bowling on Android just just think about it Nintendo I think it'd be great now the one thing to point out is since they added some of these bluetooth teachers last year starting last year they've also added a battery to the pen so now the pen will recharge when it's nestled inside the phone but one thing I should point out is that if you are using the pen to draw or to take notes just generally draw on your phone you're not gonna need the battery to be charged up so the battery dies while you're using it it's not gonna affect your drawing ability in any way the other really nice thing about not needing the battery just for note-taking and drawing is that you can use another pen and other than the one that comes with the phone it is really nice that it sticks in there it's with you all the time however it's thin it's like drawing with a pretzel pretzel that won't break anyway Samsung sells their separate s pen which is thicker it's easier to hold for long periods of time that was one problem I had that if I was drawing for more than 10-15 minutes with that really skinny stylus my hand would really start to cramp so I was gonna use it for an extended period of time I would probably have something else along with me that I would use but one of the older s pens or something like that look I'm all that happens the other thing that I wanted to mention about the pen was they've added some features into their note-taking app so if you jot down a note it identifies your handwriting and it converts it to text now it may still look like a handwritten note when you're viewing it in the Notes app but what that allows it to do is it allows to bit you to make those notes searchable within the app and I thought you know it's such a little feature but if you're taking a lot of handwritten notes hard to tell them apart that's a nice thing to have as far as camera features go they're always updating these cameras are getting better and better it blows my mind how good the cameras they pack into these things are big thing they've added this year that interested me at least is some of the video features for example you can now apply that background blur they had a name for bokeh effect you can now apply that to video we've been able to apply it to photos in the past but being able apply to videos is nice I like having a nice blurry background behind me I guess also when you zoom in the microphone focuses on that subject that was really interesting I don't think that's something I would ever use but I thought was really neat and the other big thing that then I will use and I'll probably use a lot is in some of my videos I like to hold up my old phone and talk into it but that's really kind of shaky so now it's got video stabilization in there as well to kind of take out some of that shakiness I know some people don't really like me using my phone like that so I I don't use it that much but if I had stabilization I would use that a lot more so that is another thing that's really cool about this and then there were a bunch of other little AR things AR I find fascinating I think I have a failure of imagination when it comes to AR apps I look at stuff and go that's kind of neat that's kind of gimmicky but I can't really think of be used for that so I'm still waiting for some AppMakr to really come up with that killer app for AR right now I'm I'm glad it's there I'm glad they're doing this cool stuff I'm just waiting for someone to really knock it out of the park and give me a reason to use it so those are the note phones are shipping on August 23rd it's only two weeks away the ten starts it I think 799 the ten plus starts at 1099 okay let's talk about this tablet so they've added a couple things that we also saw in the phones I think the most interesting one to me is they're using the same fingerprint reader under the glass so that's a nice touch they've ended up putting two cameras around the back for video photo editing type stuff now the form factor it kind of looks like Oh what was that talent called the iPad pro look it looks identical to the iPad pro they even copied the antenna lines why as far as the galaxy phones go I love them because they're they're kind of paving their own way right you got these wraparound screens they're going with the hole punch instead of the tab along the top so Samsung has proven with their other products that they have some killer designers in-house that can create some really amazing looking stuff I'm just not sure why they don't do that with their to their their tablet line they keep just swiping designs from Apple and I I just don't get it even though visually it looks a lot like the iPad pro it's a little bit more rounded on the sides because of that the pen sits along the back I believe there's batteries in the back of the pen that kind of outlines it with the camera bumps I saw a photo last week and I'm gonna have to look this up where the case like a keyboard case actually has a cutout that keeps the pen attached along the back now magnets were something that the Apple pencil also did but the Apple pencil attached along the side that my initial thoughts looking at it along the back are two things one I never actually store my tablet facedown because I don't want to accidentally scratch the screen with whatever's on my table so off the cuff it didn't exactly look practical to me the other thing is holding it and this is probably something I have to try out before I actually judge it on with the Apple pencil snapping to the top of the iPad it's really easy to carry with you without having to worry about accidentally brushing it along your leg and knocking off the pencil or anything and I wonder with it on the back how strong are those magnets how is how hard is that gonna hold hold on and stay there if you don't have a cover for it so I have a lot of questions in terms of just the placement of where they're putting it on the back of the tablet one thing I don't know and I'm guessing that the pen doesn't need batteries so it doesn't need to charge when it's attached to the back the way the Apple pencil 2 needs to attach to the iPad pro it's possible that they're gonna add in some of the bluetooth features we saw on the phone but I don't think they are and the reason the iPad pro was flattened along the side was specifically for that battery sticking so they stole some of the weird things from the iPad pro but they didn't steal the practical things from the iPad pro anyway enough about design I I do want to say that I used last year's tab s4 and I really really like the hardware I do think what held it back ultimately is as an illustration tool as a creative tool we're just the apps you know the Apple ecosystem tends to be a little bit stronger you've got procreate you got the affinity software you don't have anything like that on Android you have some apps some good ones I've been using art flow lately that's really come a long way there's still sketchbook you could do a lot of things with Autodesk SketchBook that so there are some good drawing and painting apps out there but I think the Apple Apple ecosystem just has a big step up there now that we're factoring in sidecar and some of the stuff you can do there you know it's kind of interesting but the S Pen itself like I said using Wacom technology when you compare that to the Apple pencil it compares really really well I'll have to see how the new one compares but but the old one it was a little bit lighter didn't feel quite as premium but but the lines are really clean the pressure worked really well palm rejection was good wasn't great wasn't as good as the Apple pencil but it it was good enough so overall the s-pen is really nice to draw with in the press conference they also talked a lot about desk de ex-ored X not sure how to pronounce that one I have to confess here and don't know much about decks it's a Productivity feature that lets you use your phone or your tablet as your computer it's even got a like desktop II looking interface to it and I think the idea here is that you can attach it to a monitor or a keyboard and then your phone is your computer you can take it with you anywhere and then just use it as a phone or you can use it as a computer honestly it makes a lot of sense is they start to flesh out this ecosystem around it this is something that I'm really looking forward to to play with when I get the phone and the tablet into review so the Tab s 6 is available on August 23rd at least that's what was on the slide I don't know if that means that it's shipping on August 23rd like the phones are that's the implication there but on a lot of websites I heard that it was shipping on September 6th which means available might be available for pre-order so that's a little vague be curious to see when that comes out but when it does I'll have a review up within a few days maybe a week the last thing I want to touch on was the galaxy book s I think this is a beautiful looking laptop it is a Windows 10 laptop it is crazy crazy thin I'd like I said I really like the look of this they designed it to make it look thinner than it actually is but again this just shows that when Samsung puts their mind to it they can make a good looking product and I've noticed this with a lot of other laptops as well HP for example has been designing some really good-looking products you know Dells products don't even look that bad anymore I think Apple stuff looks great Apple nails the details but they haven't really changed they've just evolved their laptops and since everybody else is now copied Apple laptops over the last like 10 or 15 years Apple laptops look kind of safe and so that was my general thought when they were showing this on the video I thought this is nice this is just a cool design I just love it when people do different things I will not be reviewing one is I don't think it's really a creative tool I mean it's a Windows 10 tablet so you could use any drawing or painting app with it you know you could do video editing on it I just don't think that's what it's for it's it's designed to be an ultrabook it's designed to be ultra portable it's not really I mean you couldn't use it to creative tool anyway not not really my bag not gonna be reviewing it but if you're interested starts at $9.99 available in September so anyway that's what went on at the press conference what was your favorite thing is there anything here that you're looking forward to that you're excited about what did you wish you would see that you hadn't see let me know down below in the comments thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days [Music] you
