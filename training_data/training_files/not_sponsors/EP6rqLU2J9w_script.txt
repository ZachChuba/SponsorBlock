the link below if you're one of those people who is just totally sick of this trend of having bezel this displays with big notches cut over the top of them then why not go the absolute opposite direction and get a flip phone again this is the Cosmo communicator by a company called planet computers and it is frankly an absolute brick but hear me out you've got dual displays one on the outside and another one on the inside accompanied by a full QWERTY keyboard with actual keys typing like this is a little difficult for my hands to reach to the middle but it is doable but if you set it down on the table and if you use just one finger on each hand you can actually get pretty good and we're way beyond phone territory and getting closer into laptop category so the difference between the Gemini and the communicator which is the upcoming one is this outer screen so what you've got here is your standard Android fare when it comes to notifications it's an OLED screen notifications come by in either portrait or landscape mode it does rotate unfortunately this is just a demo so it's not responsive to me and I can't actually interact with it but you can see it's full color maybe it's a battery drain but you do have a four thousand two hundred and twenty milliamp hour battery on this puppy which I would expect about three hundred grams I would hope it has good battery life opening it up you do have a six inch display which is I guess always going to be in landscape mode it has a camera that's kind of cut out you can't really call that one of those cut away hole punch cameras because it is in the bezel and these puzzles are pretty big and I don't know if you can have a determination on this but to me it kind of looks like the screen isn't exactly Center it kind of looks like it's a maybe closer to this side than that side which kind of irks me but this is really interesting to me because on the one hand you've got full mobile phones very small phones like my pixel three and then on the other hand you've got workstations somewhere in the middle of this year we're gonna be seeing these Snapdragon equipped LTE laptops that run Windows and now you've got just closer to the phone and in spectrum things like this where I couldn't I can plop this down on a table when I'm on the train have a full keyboard experience another cool thing about it in closed mode is that you do have your fingerprint sensor here which you unlock like this but it actually doesn't matter which orientation you use it because each one of these is a speaker and microphone combined so you can answer it in any orientation you want once it's open your speakers are on the sides and they are stereo speakers something that's really interesting about this phone is that it has not one but two USB C ports so what you can do is maybe be charging your phone and using a USB C Mouse at the same time or even having a display out using HDMI via a USB see specs wise we're looking at six gigabytes of RAM at a mediatek P 70 processor which is an 8 core processor at 2 gigahertz each per core which is a photo 50% faster than the old Gemini model from last year which had 10 cores but some of them were a lot slower storage wise this is a 128 gigabyte device but it does have expandable storage via micro SD card so if you're looking for a full flip phone that has a complete keyboard that actually is backlit and runs Android 9 and the Cosmo communicator might be your out at the link below so thanks for watching guys this is just the beginning of our CES 2019 coverage so stay tuned we're here all week
