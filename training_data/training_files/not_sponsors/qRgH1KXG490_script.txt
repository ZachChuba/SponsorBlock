what's happening B's and G's and welcome back in to another episode of upgrade and unlock if you've missed any of the back to this episode but a quick lowdown if you haven't watched a previous episode we unlock chunks of the map by doing certain things so as you can see right here we have the map here and we have potential squares that we can unlock for doing things such as completing a quest or completing an achievement diary getting 25 new levels we can also lose chunks by dying on the hard core we lose 10 chunks if we lose the hard core status and any deaths after that we lose a chunk per death but without further ado let's get into the episode this is going to be 53 fishing coming in which will mean we hit 600 total level but as I started this clip it's decided to be slow with the fishing come on one more there we go 53 fishing coming in which takes us to 600 total we can now catch lava eels I'm not going to help us at all at the moment but a 600 200 level which means we can go ahead and open a new chunk up then we're going to go ahead and do a Souls Bane whether or not I'm strong enough to do that we will find out and that will unlock another chunk as well here we go guys let's see where we were off to I would love 14 to get unlocked here let's have a look for [ __ ] sake looks like the the desert wants to get involved in the series so that is another useless chunk for now but you know we are slowly gonna be pulling over towards that and there yeah there will be things we can do in the desert at some point but as of right now nothing too useful just a bandit camp and we cannot get there now I've had a look at a soul's Bane and we definitely need to get these levels up a little bit when you kill a level 45 and we also need anti poison because we do get poisoned during the quest so I'm gonna go ahead and get these combat stats up a little bit definitely about 30 defense so we can wear a D and then maybe go for some strike that attack levels as well and then go ahead and do a soul's Bane we can also do the knight sword and because we have unlocked everything that we need for that now we can go down there we can also access the anvil there where we need to give the red berry pie so we will go ahead and do that after which would be two chunks once a soul's bane and the night sword is done would be really nice and hopefully we can unlock that falador patch where we can actually start farming which would be amazing because if we get get those levels that would be some fast levels there so we might as well do two birds with one stone and kill some men and women for an earth warrior talisman you guys in the comments said that they dropped them fairly commonly and obviously they're only level two so it'll be easy as piss to kill them and obviously we want to get the attack and strengthen defense stats up anyway so it's you know seems like the way to go go for this 30 defense and then we will upgrade to the ADI armor because we've been using the whole grammar way it too long now [ __ ] it is so I spent about two hours try to get a talisman the other day let's have a look how he kills it was this to get a no talisman frog men and women there you go 11 kills thank you to the comment section for for speeding that up for me we have our tasman so i'm gonna kill hobgoblins because we really need law runes i have none on the account and at the moment there is no way for us to buy law runes at any shop are they level 42 down here ah [ __ ] there's the 28 [ __ ] we are gonna get a grade by 42s but i will just stay vigilant and not lose this hardcore state as i promise next clips gonna be me dying i can feel it now i don't know if i've been a total idiot here but can I start Slayer I have a feeling I have to go to birth up first and you have to talk to that Slayer master she's like tal or whatever he's called but uh let's just give it a go and see can we get an assignment sorry but you're not strong enough to be taught by me a trainer would be mez Arcana I think I need 40 combat and then we can so that's what I'm gonna do we're gonna go ahead and get 40 combo that's just gonna be like a side quest for us to get 40 combat and see if we can it looks like we can the fact that he's telling me to go to Mauritania would mean that it's probably gonna be okay so yeah that's that's like a side plan to to start Slayer because we might as [ __ ] him well get some extra levels in there and there we go 30 defense coming in at which means we can upgrade our armor obviously getting an a deep light body is gonna be very hard gain a DeShields gonna be very hard but we can't a default helm and antiplatelet pretty easily so we'll go ahead and upgrade those first and then probably go for a myth plate body and maybe a myth shield or something there haven't quite worked out what we're gonna use for the shield slot but as you can see this is you know this is piss-poor armor so we do need to go up and upgrade that I am gonna start changing to strength now so we can get our our strength up a lot right first upgrade is gonna be the missile plate body beautiful look at that oh yes please and we're gonna fly on over to PEC Surnow or Pixar Pesce PEC so whatever her name is vector big girl I would like one of those thank you very much another upgrade we are starting to look a little bit less newbie we get in there we're getting there I'm gonna home telly now and we'll go over to our career and get our a deep plate legs low E thank you mate and we still 16 K left [ __ ] yes to be honest at the moment I think the shield slot I'll just stick with the steel square shield just because I don't really have anything else to upgrade it to we'd have to go and kill things to get the upgrade I'm not that bothered about the shield but a massive massive upgrade from what we weren't before which is really really nice gonna go ahead and get these levels up now here's the tank test let's see how we do set here not only been hit once I think so yeah very very nice just gonna use these guys because to be honest we weren't getting any Lauren's from the hobgoblins anyway and this is super afk we can just sort of attack one and they'll all attack me which is very very nice indeed and yeah I think I'm gonna go and get forty combat to be honest and then we'll head on over to van acker and see if we can start Slayer and if he assigns me something that I can use then we will go ahead and do that if not then obviously we'll we'll just carry on but the main goal is to get enough combat up so that we can go ahead and do a soul's Bane and then do a knight sword and then maybe do some slayer as well one positive to kill in the Warriors art they do drop a lots of hugs now obviously we can't do anything with the herbs at the moment because we haven't unlocked the quest yet but I am starting to stock up quite a few herbs and once we do it's gonna be herb town then you we're gonna get levels out of our anuses hello everyone I was live-streaming and totally missed 40 strength coming in so uh so GZ on that from me yeah [ __ ] 40 strength coming in hello lychee I tried to record this but my other recording bit was flat so uh yeah hello I'm link for those you've never seen me and thank you very much for watching the grain unlock video appreciate it thank you I'm and yeah it's also discussing earlier guys we were we were gathering quite a few herbs together and as you can see look at that nice little pile coming together so what we do unlock the the herb lost skill we will have a nice little head start I think yeah 24 Guam's right there which is really really helpful the seeds coming together as well when we unlock farming as well [ __ ] I nearly just missed that wow I was getting a drink and I just saw it wheel it was there and it just went but we did get it this is gonna get us into Jersey level you [ __ ] love to see it you'd love to see it we could do the falador agility shortcut now unfortunately the shortcut is there which means we can't actually use it yet but I could use that to Train agility to ten then I believe at level ten agility we can use the draynor village agility so that would be the plan so 1415 they are big squares to unlock now they really will unlock a lot we'll be able to then use the Draenor duty so uh yeah very nice that genie has done a lot for us right so for the night sword we do need to make red berry pies or one red berry pie but I didn't want to burn one even though we do have 255 cooking I don't even know if it's possible let's have a look we need one of these and we have cooked the first one beautiful and the game totally lagged there as well for some reason to red berry pies and we are gonna go ahead and finish this quest off we don't we didn't bring any food I'm sorry mate I'm sorry big man oh he's nicked it off me cheeky little [ __ ] cheeky little [ __ ] is nicked it off me jaja jaja jaja [ __ ] little [ __ ] a little [ __ ] there we go we have the blue right sword we can now go ahead and finish the quest off and unlock the next chunk right Squire a big man have retrieve the sword for you there we go twelve thousand smithing XP one quest point a new chunk forty three smithing coming in as well which doesn't give us anything new but it is a level towards that's a level five more levels to a chunk as well so uh that will be incoming after this but let's go and have a look and what we're gonna unlock here right here we go guys let's see where we are off to you [ __ ] hate to see it why do we keep on locking this [ __ ] [ __ ] Sade it's a fairy ring so when we do unlock fairy rings we will be able to fish crab wands but we still have to do the quest for the quran' wands yeah really not great not great until I think the plan now is to go get these five total levels and we'll unlock another chunk then we'll do a soul's Bane and we can also do at witch's house which we haven't done or witch's potion even so we've got witch's potion we've also got the souls bane to do so there's two more quest to do we just got a dance and I couldn't record because I was so close to losing it we're attacking the al-qura guards at the moment just to get that total level up and they I had like two on me and they would not give up but we got it in the end I'm gonna go ahead and get a little bit more XP we're probably gonna check it back into agility again probably not gonna be massive for us but it is just some extra XP and obviously dance is huge XP which is really nice right here we go we are gonna go and I'm going to go back insurgency let's just chuck it in that is gonna get us close to level six actually just very very nice indeed level six just from XP tomes you know genies and dances which you know and also for a request we did x marks the spot so yeah not bad at all anyway we're gonna go for this six to five total level so three more attack levels we're coming in with a 33 attack now and then we will be able to unlock the next chunk right here we go guys as you can see attack and prayer coming in I don't know what's gonna come first it looks like it's gonna be prayer that's gonna be the one that gets us 625 total all am i wrong now I'm not wrong I'm not wrong kill him kill him Oh kill him there we go and we grab these bones and bad that is 27 prayer coming in we can now use mystic lore which actually is very nice 10% increase on the magic while using that and of course it's another chunk it's another chunk let's see well we are off - here we go guys how what are we going to get let's get everything in there and pick a random junk [ __ ] sake oh the dog was his fortress we're just just places we don't want to go as a hardcore really cuz obviously if we lose the hardcore state as we lose 10 chunks it's just not it's not helpful not helpful I don't really know I think then there is a there's a clue scroll in there I believe but yeah really not helpful still holding out for the 14 hopefully that can come at some point but ya know as always up with 35 attack but that is where we're gonna stop the combat grind and we are gonna go ahead and do witch's potion because we haven't done that yet so well let's go ahead and do that and unlock another chunk here we go I have everything boom and put it in the [ __ ] drink oh I think we drink from here don't we right drink from the cauldron figure self imbued with power we get some magic level 325 and magic speed one quest point not going to give us another level there but it does take us fairly close 1800 XP away which won't take long at all but the main reward from that quest is another chunk and hopefully a good one here we go I think that means we can do Black Knights fortress I am pretty sure yeah we definitely can so we do Black Knights fortress now it does unlock that unlocks the monastery as well which I guess it's a it's an altar it's nothing too crazy yeah it unlocks Ozzy ACK as well it's a difficult one to be happy about but at the same time it is one that's you know one for the future and it does mean another quest to be complete as well so what we'll take it we'll take it I think the monks aren't too bad for training on either but I think we're sort of past that point now but yeah there we go another chunk unlocked number fourteen becomes another 13 now so yeah they're still waiting on that elusive allotment to be unlocked but uh not happened as of yet and this is gonna be 40 attack coming in I'm gonna go ahead and get 40 defense as well and then we're gonna go do a Saul's Bane because I feel like the combat levels are high enough for that and then we will head over to Van occur and we'll I will try and get ourselves a Slayer task this is going to be 40 defense coming in which means we have gotta grind it our way all the way to 40 attack 40 strength and 40 defense so there we go meaning we can now wear rune stuff we're gonna go ahead and do of course a Souls Bane also got myself together a load of herbs if we have a look look at that looking beautiful that's really gonna help us those 55 Guam's at the start gonna be massive for just getting those earlier ball levels we're gonna go ahead and put this into agility as well I got this ages ago but I wasn't filming at the time so there we go 75 agility taking us to six agility as well and two levels away from another chunk but as I said we're gonna go ahead and do a soul's Bane and then we'll get two more levels and we'll have two chunks to open from a soul's Bane and the air and the levels now in a soul's Bane we do actually get poisoned and it's advisable to bring anti poison obviously we don't have the herblore level because we haven't unlocked the quest yet but we can give cavada buries the limpet route and five coins to the apakah three and he will give us an antigen so way yeah you know 200 IQ player obviously the area we currently have there's no way of getting out to poison any other way but you know that little trick thank you very much so we click potions on him there we go that's poison Thank You great okay we are pretty much ready to go gonna grab some food and I'm actually gonna bring magic with me for the final fight because the attack speed is so much slower against the boss if you're using magical range and range isn't very viable I think yeah magics definitely gonna be more viable so we're gonna go ahead and bring some magic with us if we talk to Lorna we can start the quest and we got to go down here and fight some angry beasts okay so we take a weapon and each weapon associates with a different animal or monster and we've got to kill them with each one the sword is for the unicorn so that's going to kill the unicorn I'm pretty sure we can hit massive hits on with this weapon I think it like multiplies by like ten or something supple look there's a thirty there we go we're [ __ ] losing it at the moment apparently but I think that is the room complete in this door should now be open yes it is we get 40 attack Wow Wow I might have to start this again I think if I exit I lose all progress but we're poisoned I didn't realize I was gonna eat poison this early on I also didn't bring an a/d sword because I thought I just had to kill those things at the start and we're already down on food and I haven't gotten emergency teleport yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna exit hopefully we don't lose all the progress hopefully it's just yes I don't mind starting this room again okay that's fine Yeah right there we go that is all the rooms except for the boss completed now this is actually taking a [ __ ] long time we're gonna mix it up and go for magic while killing the the boss here I'm gonna try and keep as much armor on as possible while still having I think I'm gonna have to take it all off on I yeah we're just gonna go with that and just hope that we are tank at all because I do want to be hitting if not I hope I can run out of this room because I forgot to bring a tele again denied which was very good of me but we'll see what happens here and I think we get a cutscene and then we have to kill the three-headed beast thing they are level 46 each and they all attack so it could be a little bit dangerous but we will see what happens it looks like I can run outside of this door behind me right here we go probably would have been an idea to put that on but anyway boom oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] oh my god okay that's not good actually got quite a bit of health as well I might not have brought enough runes oh god I've really [ __ ] this up am i come on we need to see some 12 so we need to season 12 I think we're gonna be okay now we're gonna be fine we're gonna be fine I'm pretty sure we'll eat up an anti poison in a minute after this kill there we go and yeah we're gonna be good we're gonna be fine it doesn't seem like it's hitting very hard at all thank God for that when I walked in and took all the meta hits I was worried that's why we weren't with magic so that we didn't stand there taking melee hits cuz I hit like a tick speed of four if you were if you attack it with mellow words it's like a tick speed of 12 for one of the heads and like an eight for the other head so yeah we are going to be fine that is two of these three down and the last one to go and we're gonna have this we can have this quest done and then we just need to get a couple more levels and we've got another chunk to unlock as well as obviously the chunk for completing this quest there we go 500 defense and 500 hit points XP 500 gold coins the access to the dungeon and of course another chunk to unlock any levels no levels at all unfortunately getting pretty close to a hip points level actually we might go ahead and do that and I think the magic was super close as well so they might be our two levels that we go for but let's go and unlock the next chunk and see what we're gonna unlock for doing that quest here we go let's see what we're gonna get it is the bottom of taverley gets us one away from being able to unlock the older druid circle doesn't really are we got to have early dungeon [ __ ] yes okay we got a whole totality dungeon unlocked that's very very nice we can get in there as well very nice the to 8:00 sharp obviously the quest I can't remember what quest that is I think it's the one we have to get like the meets or something I know that is the Drude circle I'm not sure what quest that is we'll have to go and have a look we got a tree patch there that is about it I know we need to go there for one of the quests to see the lady on the lake and there is a quest there as well we will see what we've got we'll go ahead and have a look but not a bad one to unlock it gets us as I say closer to the hero's guild obviously the druid circle and being able to get into birth open the Wizards and the Warriors guild and all that good stuff so yet not a bad bad square there at all and if we have a lurk this is going to be Edgar's ruse definitely won't be able to do that as of right now grim tales definitely won't be able to do that either but taverley dungeon or unlocks blue dragons it unlocks black Dean it unlocks so many things that we just haven't had access to at all we can really start to get some decent things and chaos throughs which would obviously be good for hubs and stuff like that really really happy super happy with that oh my god that's good that is so good okay awesome we're definitely gonna have a look at that but I'm gonna go ahead and see manica over in Edgeville because let's let's get some Slayer going we're level 50 combat now let's get some Slayer going see if we can get some levels through that and as I said we are only two levels away from being able to unlock another chunk right big man give me an assignment let's see what we are going to get 32 ank-ooo I mean that's doable I could go and range them down in the the stronghold but do I want to be doing that right now it's not really something that's that's crazy important especially as they will be able to hit me I don't know if I can even say spot them in the stronghold actually come to think of it um I probably will just take a backseat on that for now but we will get rapid Slayer levels if we do go ahead and do that when we do but as of right now I do want to get these stats up a little bit more maybe get the range and magic up before yeah start doing things like that but that is fine um what do I want to do now that's the question the world is our oyster so when I got one strength level and we're just going to go ahead and get the the rest of the level with with a runecrafting level so uh yeah I'll probably use I think we've got about 300 or so of the pure essence so I'll probably just go ahead and use all of that now see what runecrafting it gets us and then we'll we'll open a chunk up and every time I do that I know I can just click on the altar 9 no I'm gonna get [ __ ] roasted for that that is [ __ ] Tamra Grafton coming in which means we can now make dust runes very nice obviously that's also the 650 total but I am just gonna go ahead and finish all of this essence before we do unlock the chunk right this is gonna be the last full inventory so right this is gonna be the last full inventory so this is where we're gonna end the room crafting for now but we will definitely come back to it it's gonna give us a level which is very nice 17 runecrafting coming in and we started at level 9 so that is not bad at all let's go ahead and open this chunk up and hope something good happens please be something useful oh come on [ __ ] yes taking that a we can finally stuff oh my god we can finally stop farming Jesus that took a while to get that one done amazing okay so we can now start farming we've also got the farming shop there as well some cows fairly close to a bank I guess I could take that as a positive we can also walk from Draenor supports the rim and Remington now I don't have to walk all the [ __ ] way around which is amazing really really happy with that a [ __ ] last great stuff I've really started to open up some great stuff now I think we're gonna go ahead and plant our first bit of farming right so our first allotment I'm gonna go ahead rake the flower patch even the herb patch to be honest even though I'm not going to be planting any herbs just for the extra farm exp and we have some potato seeds and we also have one marigold that we can we can plant as well which would be nice I need to get at some compost which will go and buy from whatever our name is over there in her shop and we're gonna plant that and that is our first thing we've ever planted on the account which is amazing yeah as I say gonna water everything get compost and just try and keep everything alive and yeah start getting some farming levels which is amazing that we can start that we might actually get a level from doing this so let's have a quick look there we go level 3 farming coming in which means we can now grow barley which is nice as a hop we can start growing and we're just gonna let this grow and we will get level 4 when we come to harvest all of this good stuff right so unfortunately I wasn't actually playing Rooney over the last hour or so and wasn't able to save these from dying so we have lost the marigolds and we have also lost the dead potatoes but one soul potato patch did survive and we'll see how much XP we get from that I went and bought myself a hundred compost as well I don't know if I mentioned that earlier just so that I don't have to keep buying it every time you know we need need to go farming but we are gonna plant some more potatoes and we will see if we get a level here which I think we will yeah there is the level very nice level for farming coming in we can now grow hammerstone hops very nice we can go and get all of these barley and you know hops from Draenor we can buy them or steal them so that's probably gonna be the root of how we do that and now that this is all unlocked we can just walk there easily oh it's so nice honestly so so nice going to take us to just about half the level I think yeah around that we'll just go and buy a couple more compost here and try and keep these as alive as possible and yeah we're gonna move on from here but very happy we've unlocked farming and these levels will start to come in pretty quickly as we as we got the levels I have never planted a hop in my life and by the looks of things I don't think one barley seeds gonna be enough here because that is a big patch and I'd expect it to probably be like three barley seeds or something we'll give it a go and see if this is gonna work but I'm not feeling very confident you need four yeah okay I only have one in the bank so yeah I'm probably gonna have to do some some thieving or just go and buy them over in Draenor but as of right now we cannot plant any hops because I don't have enough also I was streaming some upgrade and unlock the other day and everyone was saying do the Halloween event do the Halloween event it can count as a quest I'll leave a pole up in the top right corner now go and vote on that if it gets 75% yes then we will do it and yeah what I'll say is that this will go ahead and do this and it counts as a quest completed and we get a chunk for doing it go and vote on that up in the top right corner and yeah if it's over 75% of you saying yes then I'll do it if not we won't do it but guys that let's go take us to the end of the episode please don't forget to drop a for watching and I'm catch in the next one
