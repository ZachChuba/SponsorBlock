the process of making everything from scratch can be messy and as you have seen I can make huge messes though well occasionally I get rinsed off to really get clean sometimes requires a little help so starting from some rocks some lake water and a variety of plants and animals let's take a closer look and make my own soap from scratch but first club today so it's a grandiose story of its origin coming from the holy mountain near Rome of Mount SOPA where animals were frequently sacrificed and burned as an offering to the gods the mixture of the animals fats ashes from the fires would intermix and flow into the mountain streams further down people washing their clothes in the stream notice the strange combination was very effective at cleaning and the rest is history except it's not and that's a complete myth it's not even a mount SOPA it's not where the word sub comes from in fact the Latin word SOPA is borrowed from a German word for animal fat the actual history of soap is likely somewhat similar but first occurred at least 2,000 years before Rome was even founded and a little further east in ancient Sumer their soap was similarly made by combining animal fats and ashes historically however soaps primary purpose was most often for preparing wool for dyeing it's used for personal hygiene was relatively rare and usually restricted only to the wealthy or by priests in religious ceremonies in fact the Romans themselves often preferred a method of cleaning the body with oils abrasive sand and the device of Astral in the end it wasn't until after the end a revolution when soap be more cheaply mass-produced and everyday uses soap became commonplace before I make my own soaps Chris decided to try out making a version of that original ancient soap himself using wood fire ash while I was still busy stuck in the Stone Age working on our next upcoming video [Music] [Music] go [Music] okay so here's the deal I have already made like four fighters this week just to get enough ash to try to do the sake and ash experiment my neighbors are complaining about the smell I you know just smell like forest fire all the time anyway enjoy your footage of water boiling so I'm going to use the last of a Valentine's Day gift that I gave to my girlfriend this year little bear can it feels like so don't know if it'll a there or if I'll just make you dirtier than clean and I'll set that aside for a few days but how does soap actually work you've heard the term that oil and water don't mix well they do and soap is used that's because one end of the soap molecule is hydrophilic or water-loving and the other is hydrophobic water heating which makes it a perfect meal man between these two chemicals these molecules in the soap bind with the dirt and grease allowing the grime saturated molecules to wash off so if there's a great job of getting rid of grease mass to do with a fact that is derived from fat itself soap is made when the fatty acids from animal fat or plant-based oils mixed with an alkaline solution forming a fatty acid salt in this process called saponification the alkaline reacts with the fatty acids and they neutralize each other the resulting chemicals are soap and glycerine now to make my own soap the first step will be making an alkaline solution to react with the fatty acids fortunately the same chemical compounds i've spent a large amount of time and effort collecting in the past for glass making can actually also be used in making soap i extracted potash before by burning hardwood and collecting the ashes then i soaked them in water strained and boil the solution down to just the remaining potassium carbonate the alternative compound i also sourced for glass making sodium carbonate or soda ash i found in a mineral rich lake in Wyoming I slept in Utah before going home they got the help of Kody of Kody's lab in removing the other contaminants in the lake water so I could have a mostly pure soda ash leftover both of these compounds are alkaline but there exist even stronger basis it can made from them sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide also known as lie-in caustic potash to produce that I'll need another compound I also collected previously for making glass limestone first with a quick warning make sure you wear a proper skin protection I'm working with caustic compounds such as quick lime and lye not wearing them can easily result in chemical burns which I got plenty of in the process of this video I have limestone I collected here before my first attempt at making glass at least I think it's limestone just went to an area that supposedly has limestone and grabbed some rocks and grown them up first thing I'm gonna do is actually test it to make sure this is limestone because if it isn't it's gonna explain why my first attempt at glass was so bad it's a pretty basic process you just take an acid like hydrochloric acid and just drop a few drops onto the rock and if it fizzles if custom carbonate we have limestone I don't know the full concentration but after I killed it it should become water-soluble well the impurities should not I think you can tell the color is kind of brown which probably means there's a decent amount of impurity I'll put in the kiln at about thousand degrees Celsius and carbon dioxide will be driven from the calcium carbonate train it into calcium oxide yeah our little kiln we got before and our attempt to making the ultramarine oh this should hopefully be the calcium oxide now with the other impurities which look like I've made it darker to water now calcium oxide should dissolve into the water trying to calcium hydroxide so just let that sit for a little bit and then I'll strain it that should be quick lime or slackline now that I've quick lime converting the soda ash and potash is simply a matter of mixing them each with quick lime and removing the precipitate then just need a quick pH test to confirm that I've made some new alkaline bases for all my previous attempts I now have five different bases that I can potentially use for making soap I have potash soda ash lime water caustic potash and lye so now with these five different bases I should be able to make five different types of soap so tests that I have store-bought olive oil everything's already pre-measured I'm just gonna mix them together blend them up just to compare how they're all different so I'm gonna start first with the potash and soda ash these were kind of the first compounds are used to make soap the weakest basis and as soon as people figured out how to make these stronger lye based ones they use those for soap making start with potash so there's two methods of making soap the cold method and the hot method and the difference between them is one you do when it's cold and the other you do when it's hot and like all chemical processes the hotter it gets the quicker the reaction is and that's basically the whole difference so do these quicker so I'm gonna heat them up and then agitate on my mix them up this is gonna be like a lukewarm method I only got a hot plate big enough for one story in my life lie ooh don't breathe that [Music] thinking about making soap its self-cleaning throw my crock-pot let them sit for an hour so finish baking and then pour them sit for a couple days soap alright so the samples here now after a few weeks pretty much only the lye one is actually gone hard even then it's still pretty soft the caustic potash is relatively soft they usually use for soft soaps you can see why the outside is dried out so a few more weeks it might actually be solid eventually this is the non soluble one which is all liquid got so - actually has hardened up a little bit I might just be crystals of excess though and then the potash probably would make a decent liquid soap but I'm after a hard soap so I think I'm going to use the lye for my other batches now that I figured out what base I want to use next I'll just need a fatty acid for it to react with pretty much anything with fat and it can be used in so far through all my other projects actually have a wide variety of options including some of the pig lard you also got from the pig I used for my football from scratch do you collect just the fat just needs to be rendered and strained other items i've previously sourced that contained fats include both cow milk and goats milk beeswax plus a variety of different plant seeds that all can be pressed in an oil press to extract their oils so of all my different fats and oils here I have a dozen of them and each of them should make a different type of soap each one contains a different combination of a variety of fatty acids and they each have their own characteristics and will yield a different result for each one I'm gonna just experiment with each individual fat and make my own bar soap and see which ones will work best some might form rock-hard bars some might not lather so I might lather too well some might not do a good job cleaning it would be possible just to look it up and find hundreds of different recipes of recommended balances but do it the hard way just experiment and turn all my different fats into their own unique soap make some soaps now it's just a matter of mixing carefully measured quantities of a lye solution each fat if I did my math correctly each one should have just enough lye to react with the fats otherwise the left oral I could remain in the soap and cause skin irritation since I'm doing the cold method for this it's gonna take a lot of mixing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now for the milk's there's a risk that the exothermic reaction might cook the milk so oftentimes just ice water bath keep it chilled [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yeah other ones did that support us on patreon so we can keep stuff up so I got a little bit of extra soap each of my mixes I'm just gonna put it into one big beaker and combine them all and then I'll have a little bit of a all-inclusive bar and see how that one turns out my twelve different soaps made them twelve different facts and as I expected very wide variety of consistency between them she'd be interesting to see how they turn out after a few weeks in the meantime I have a huge mess to clean up [Applause] now a few weeks later took my first batch of soaps out for a test wash to see how well they work and compare as far as I could tell they all seemed to work fairly well whoever if you I quickly realized that leftover lie in them can give me some Pleasant chemical burns so I tested them all for the pH eliminated a few bars when my chemistry didn't quite work out right my combined soap of all of them combined was also too caustic so I remelt did it and added some more oil to try and balance a reaction out also the combined smell of twelve different fats didn't really turn out the greatest so I thought I'd try adding some lavender from what I grew in dried this summer in my garden [Music] lastly I thought I'd try to make a little bit more of a creative mold for this time I made my own using some carved styrofoam and a silicon mold kit now just to pour it out let it dry so at this point I now have 20 different soaps we've made it have a 5 different tests I did with base each of them form some kind of soap then I have the 12 different oils are used and made 12 unique soaps few of them I got the chemistry wrong and they're a little bit classic and if you have any cuts on your hands they're going to burn and then I took the leftover soap kind of Frankenstein of all of them that's the first time I make my own mold and it kind of shifted and got weird on me so I'm not too confident about it I'll take it out in a second and see how it did and then I have lastly the soap that Chris made using the very primitive method of just probably about how they did it way back when I was first discovered flip this guy over see if it comes out in one piece or not yeah I didn't work that's a fail he made a decent bar soap though it just did not hold the shape don't smoke somewhat lavender he wasn't very strong I tried testing all the soaps by washing the dirtiest thing I could find leftover pig hide from my football this pig is gonna be so clean however once again I had a hard time assessing and comparing them so I enlisted a little help thanks Andy this thing is terrifying oh it's already all over my hands no I take back my gross noises I would play with this it washes off very easily I just feel like I'm playing with mud from a pond my hands feel relatively clean there's still a faint smell of baking grease on my hands and I don't like that actually doesn't know a little bit better actually I think it helped water is quite gross I don't know if that's from the pig or the soap probably the soap this thing looks like somebody took a flue in it it's so slimy we have a little suds on this one this one looks like it's trying to Sud but like it just ends up slimy instead you could probably so that like a wash or something you like ooh do I like slime so this one's worse this one's funny too it's just like way thicker than just soap is supposed to be here Reisen this way starting to bubble a little bit I feel like I just played with a slug but it's not as sudsy as so it should be there's absolutely no suds with this one oh this one's good it's still kind of like slimy and oily but I got some time look at those sides uh didn't know soybeans were so sudsy this one's really starting to get bubbly and it doesn't feel gross on my hands either still kind of slimy we're back to a slimy feeling in this soap animal little meatloaf is the chocolate one I feel like I'm eating so this wouldn't feels not gross but it's not lathering well just feel like I was cleaning with like a rock or something this one is getting sudsy also does it feel as gross but it still doesn't have that soap feel yet pretty much no slime on it doesn't smell just surprising everybody said it was gonna smell bad it's actually pretty neutral not a lot of suds not a lot of residue coming off the soap this soaps very hard actually a lot better than I thought it would be so there's gonna be a hunk of wax this is not Burt's Bees htm' me very clearly it says H to me HTM e molded great most kind of earthy feels weird though it's got that gooey thing going on by its sudsing really good I wasn't unlike the other soaps probably cuz it is all the other soaps mixed together we made 20 different types of soap here and most of them were pretty successful I'd say I think with the soybean has been the best so far the most convincing and I bought at a store I wouldn't return it I'd be like hey this is soap and it's cleaning my hands I'd say my favorite soap so far is still the peanut and Loki I kind of like the big melody fair against tight one cuz it smells the best wasn't absolutely the best result but I have successfully made 20 soaps that are at least somewhat effective just beginning of a whole series we're doing on toiletries I'm gonna be doing a bunch of other cleaning products toothpaste toothbrush shaving cream and a razor and a bunch of other things just so you can get clean for that pig I do not feel that clean though if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and check out other content we have covering a wide
