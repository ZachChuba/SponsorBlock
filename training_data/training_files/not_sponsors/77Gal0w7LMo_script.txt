has come to press the button (Weeekly is the first artist to press
the print button for their debut album) I think this is a real privilege
and a very meaningful experience (Looking_at_other_artists'_albums.mp4) Awesome! Oh, my god! That is so pretty Shall we take one...? (Will Weeekly's album soon make it

got to press the print button themselves) (Checking_for_errors.mp4) (Can't get their hands off the new album!) Today, we had this rare opportunity of pushing the print button
to print our very first album covers We would like to express our gratitude to the staff and employees
who planned this special occasion to give us this opportunity Today, we were able to realize that so many people put a lot of effort
into making our album And to the fans who will be listening
