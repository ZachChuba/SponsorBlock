okey-dokey folks welcome back to another episode of RL craft has always brought to you by our sponsors I'm co-hosting providing the server on which we are playing if you want to play some Mario craft yourself feel free to check the link in the description it'll take you to their site where you can get a server with a discount off your first month you new one-click install of some RL crafts and play along get demonetised or unaligned buy a million things a million times so awfully accurate we've got out we've got kind of an objective now though right yes the the I've been told for multiple people that we can do dragon's eye bobble and also maybe resistance rings and stuff like that like that seems to be what people feel is a good route that will help us in our in our pursuits and lands so we only have the ability to make one dragon's eye bobble right now right yeah and then we just send the other person who gets it to in to kill another dragon on their own and then we're fine okay no problem we can't really make a potion ring of resistance though oh wait wait hold on sorry that's a bunch of oh there's a ring of strength as well which is kind of cool so what is a ring of resistance which one is that we can we actually do have the ability to make that it looks like if we would like gasps tears oh that's regeneration yeah there's a bunch of different ones that you can do so we have these pretty have the diamonds so maybe one of us one of us does the dragon thing and one of us does the ring of her generous you mean in terms of equipping yeah okay yeah yeah that makes sense a little bit of a trade-off you know a little bit of a trade oh yeah and I was up playing around in the the farm up here farming and a Broco of watermelon and a monster jumped out of it oh that's always what you want definitely and startled the crap out of me and made me scream and yell and run I eventually killed it but so watermelon can hurt you too there's more story well I just everything every to be afraid by watermelon I mean you know like I was it was unexpected it is winter all right I have manufactured a potion ring of resistance I don't know oh I'm assuming it goes in the Emerald so it's a bubble yeah no no I just had something in the bauble slot where it goes that's all no the bezel or you can do simultaneously which is nice I had a guarding emerald ring which I guess gives a little bit of bonus armor but this is probably better I'm gonna imagine so that's good times good stuff exciting things and now the dragon thing huh that's gonna take a little bit so what's the dragon thing called dragon I I think it's just dragons I Oh dragon takes pork for diamond swords a ring of enchanted eyes which is its glow easy enough right yeah yes so basically it's the blaze powder the glow stone is really the hardest part about all this do we that's how that's the Diplo's or blaze powder I think we found a little bit of mobs here and there I could be wrong but yeah we yeah do we go and we've probably 22 rods I think we're okay they were okay yet so that's fine so we can make the ring of enchanted eyes no issues at all I guess the only issue is the diamonds oops we're running a little low on those now yeah a little bit okay it's fine we can definitely get more we mean it's about time to head underground anyway right so absolutely I love heading underground okay so we can make one of the swords now which is cool and then I mean do we want to just strip mine to get diamonds or it might not be bad to head down and see what's what and and things I wish I knew what this ring of Enchanted like it doesn't do anything Oh gives night vision and then you were also saying right that I was enchantments are quite valuable right yes they're enchantments are very late alike extremely strong and so it was advised that perhaps we stop ignoring them and started paying attention to them okay so just regular enchantment like on a table as far as I could tell okay there's no like special block where we put in the certain resources and get out the enchantment that we want not that I know I mean I know with it I know that there's the there's disenchantment I think there is something where we can disenchant and take things off of stuff we don't want or don't want to use uh-huh and and get the enchantment back I believe and then there's also the Forge where if you have like the the things that you were making or you were carrying that had a bad a negative impact like your beibei's where I believe yeah I think you can reforge it in the equipment Forge and try and remove that possibly oh I mean I don't none of this I'm an expert at I haven't done any of this I'm just kind of relaying what was passed on to me sure so everything that I try and remember all right so going get is well here you go buddy let's do well reforge it put your newfound skills to use actually I mean it does have 15 plus attack damage so that's not bad at all might be worth the trade-off yeah it's just a slight negative reach right yes but also the only other potential issue is the fact that we do have to level up our attack in order to be able to use it but uh you know we'll have it in the meantime we'll have it waiting in the wings ready to go as soon as we hit that attack level I need 24 attack yet to be able to use it anyway I don't think it's even like happy with me trying to use it in this Borge or outside or not using the Force correctly that could either way do not know how to do NORs nor do i I do like how my current diamond rapier has plus 15% dig speed though so so what you came to dig dig dig okay so I was making I made the golden carrot and then I was gonna make the glowstone ingot which I needed I got iron and now the blaze powder so I need to glean get you know what I was able I would say that should let's just go back to our original spot and then we can from there go into the existing mine it'll just be a little bit quicker I think existing mine was horrid but yeah although I might want some more food you'll be like extra food I only have six cooked chicken on me I have five bread and ten steak to take a couple steak if you want it to be very nice thank you mate Oh appreciate she'll okay fingers crossed that we don't get super cold here so apparently on your you know when those kobold stole your stuff yeah I don't know I don't remember but I think you might remember oh I remember apparently you can right-click on them and open their inventory so I mean granted part of that was that they you know suicided into yeah I don't think there was much of a chance of me but I'm just saying like you know if we if if things are lined up oh I forgot all these cows if things have lined that better we could have they didn't but we could it's it's definitely good to know for hopefully when that never ever happens again exactly yeah you get it no I totally get you it's it's good yeah yeah definitely a very good thing that I hope I had never have to put to use okay so strip mining huh sounds like funds let's get strings if we like never we never know like what why level we're at so I don't know why a straight line I I'm gonna assume that it's you know at the lava level so lava levels probably y equals 11 let's assume fingers crossed please criss cross there is a shoe macabre and it's no more is gone goodbye farewell chupacabra that was quick dude I got this time rapier down pat bro alright you oh yeah oh yeah well here we go Pat is oh there's a youtuber minecraft guy by the name popular MMOs and his name is is Pat actually well in that case hello super girl freaking freaking dick and he dude Chupacabra yeah that was that was a little bit hurt so when you extinguish lava with water and turn it to obsidian it creates a mob like the green guy the violet f return o acid something didn't do it that time it did it over here he's suffocating he poor guy oh yeah the ZAF and the zafon is created by lava converting interesting I just thought you could no I am on fire now though it's it's very toasty in here yeah it's it's warm and I you know prepared it well as I do so my pickaxe is almost broken I mean that's definitely what you want when you're you know going mining I might for the sake of like have you found some iron oh no I wasn't looking for iron I'll call it out if I find it okay yeah I guess I'll just kind of look around any existing spots a frickin skeleton bro out I can make a stone version for a minute and just be a slightly slower I got it I got a headshotted it all wait I mean skeleton skeletons are ridiculous they are absolutely ridiculous I don't know what to do with my life when they just hit headshots every single time that I look at them it's absurd that you have these modded mobs that I can deal with no problem but a vanilla skeleton is God dang impossible I would agree I hate it I hate it I hate it you need help we're gonna find out I think I can get back to it pretty easily but we'll see if I just get eaten by the skeleton once again the instant that I get back so I mean I've got my shield so he's right there he's right there and do you head short me son of a day oh he's got my rapier he's not not any more get frickin shrekt bud there's a groove right on the other side this wall just okay cool yeah a lot of good data bring a resistance dude huh a lot of good I mean I don't I don't know what what with sorry I'm sorry that you feel this way not your fault I'm I'm just mad at the ring I thought that the ring would do something turns out I was gravely mistaken I mean a shield is pretty helpful in those situations you're not wrong you're not wrong I I would I would definitely agree with you yeah I should I need to be better at doing that mm-hmm definitely let me see where's where is this ugly creepy crawly he's i up and to the right up the up the walkway okay it's a blaze right on your right look look up oh there you go oh that is a that's a boy over there well this is what I'm saying is that it's I don't know it's called a shade it does not look nice to what we do want to do though probably is okay yeah sorry sorry villager um I want to go to over here because it looks like a place where there is perhaps less fiery things happening and get bad what is this it looks like nice and open over here maybe there's diamonds to find I did find iron good I found Heat no no no skeleton no negative negative creepers skeletons frickin Frick Frick Frick why are there so many I'm sure that I just got head shorted skeletons don't do anything but hit you with headshots it's insane oh I'm gonna focus on doing all my level ups into attack though so that I can definitely just get some crazy crazy dragon stuff going be sweet oh you're gonna cool your chill come on give me some diamonds up in here they can't be there err what the heck is that what the heck is that a freaking light Specter whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh okay he's sorry he started like pulling me to him I know he's freaking gravitational field dude I was not okay with that that's not cool you cannot do that wait that's illegal oh my god I got course fruit from him but that's about it holy cannoli dude okay so yeah about that strip mining attempt let's try that again let's try that again right you're doing great keep it up you know the grooves in this though right at least a chance to kill right it's not like in that eggs or iya thing where it's just like an insta Gibb so yeah I agree with that maybe I'll just no I just don't wanna waste my torches is all sound alright strip my knee here we go dude fingers crossed I don't run into battery if you want just branch off might strip mine or something I'm just digging Windows because I forgot to do it on the way uh well I'll tell ya when you run into one of the mobs spawning when you're digging a window it's not so scary anymore cuz they can't hit you you know when the win the Oratory today well no a the the one that I just ran into it uh existed but I was able to very easily just take it out because it couldn't get to me so I see anyway it drives a crystal shard which don't know what that is used to throw a crystal shard can also be fired from a dispenser and then oh I got some more levels we must bring a tech up more and more we got diamonds boys I think that's bedrock right there hey 1 2 3 4 5 where we're at like why we're at 6 up so that'd be why 11 right that would be y equals 6 but y equals 6 is just as easy to find diamonds really so lava is at y equals 6 in this modpack oh no did you just run into your first bedrock because bedrock can go it ranges go-go's up to 5 down yes yeah ok cool cool so that's why I did 6 plus 5 and I said 11 and you were like no I I didn't really thought you were making fun of me no I thought you would do anything where no I thought you were doing the thing where it was like ah so yes we found bedrock zero plus well I just got a boss bar on my screen zero plus five is eleven right like you were making fun of me for saying that we were 11 before and I misunderstood and misinterpreted but I just got 5 diamonds so that accounts for everything right makes up for it all well we have one sword right so we need two four six more and we had one diamond yeah so and I try and find more I mean yeah we need to find more diamonds but now we have three out of four right right cool good good times good times I just want to do a little you of yeah yeah no this is the stuff consider me alerted cool getting that attack up to level 19 there we go only six more only like a hundred more levels until I can use the dragon rapier please tell me it's Lots nice that'll do it that'll do it all right I think I got six out of it okay I'm just about ready to get out of this place don't you think call madam call that a win I mean we can probably just an afront yeah what so let's dip on out dude and we can actually make the dragon thing now that we have all these diamonds so that's good it's gonna take me absolutely ages to get out of here but it's cool you know I'm sure it's actually not nearly as far as I think I've covered yeah probably not I can see your name almost right here yep on my way all right there we go all right hopefully we can make it out of this place alive without any further issues and that's gonna be amazing once we are super invulnerable to things I bet the ring a strength could be cool to like just give us a big ring a regen actually would be really good wouldn't it yeah what was it I looked at that but it needed something that was like oh really it was it gasps tears probably yeah yeah yeah yeah gasps tears could prove to be a little bit problematic where you going there's four permit torches back here Oh oh you're just grabbing us I got you oh I'm on fire so we are gonna want to dip on out of there twenty-one heart crystals by the way dude you're out here with megahertz I didn't find any that I can think of really yeah somehow diamonds were more consistent for you than heart crystals I mean I only found with diamonds once but yeah hello chupacabra I don't think you're meat thank you so much very nice of you to do oh okay I will take your meat very nice of you to do do you want to grab some stuff grab some stuff there's various random little bit teeth oh yeah I mean it's like you don't care not really too much I mean there's some lap ease and some City I suppose you can grab but otherwise I was dip on out here and we'll arrange things back at home mm-hmm let us do that was a booking Cristal yay yes uh-huh that's what you like that's definitely like to see we got three spares so there's five more towards where we need to go a heart dust is it nine in order to get a heart crystal shard it's art dust is like real low-tier yeah yeah no hard desert hard dinosaur like nuggets gotcha yeah go for it here at U of you six here is two more for the other couple of swords there you go and then we also have five spare diamonds for any other needs which would be a diamond helmet for me right now but it's okay I'll save them for more crucial things later on although we might go straight mining again and it'll be great and stuff like that I really don't know it's gonna be it's gonna be the best I love going strip mining is the most fun thing you can do especially good content for episodes definitely all right look at that rain I love rain rain is the best favorite like rain let's see regenerations rings just like it that is potion ring of haste pushing ring of jump boost potion ring of speed strength could be kind of cool but I guess the gas tears are the ultimate and oh you need another star for that one oh that's yeah I didn't I didn't catch that because the nether star doesn't look like the normal another star but that's the thing too so ring or regeneration Zil just a little bit just step out all right so how's your thinking going I'm working on I'm working on we're gonna you know we need to do though is we do need to make ourselves an enchantment table I think that's a good use of some of our remaining diamonds for the greater good alright I would agree and then do we have book Louis we have a lot we have a lot of books a lot of books where are the books in the paper all right now the question is is the enchantment table recipes still the same as it ever was and do I remember it for that matter oh it is nice requirements magic 12 whoopsie daisies I'm at Magic 8 I am at Magic 12 oh nice alright well you can place it down and use it have fun with that and I'm gonna need to get some levels and level up magic stop focusing purely on my attack output apparently so that's cool where do we want to put it like upstairs in kind of an Oakland area so we can build some bookshelves around it yeah this could be the enchanter room put it in put it like in the center look Center lose our light yeah whatever we can put torches around it's not a big deal okay and we didn't even lose light actually I have torches in my off hand so that's an inaccurate statement it looks no different dude I'm carrying a torch alright yeah except I had I had a creeper spawn on me in the middle of our base yeah it was it was disconcerting so we don't I'm assuming have any bookshelves no but we can make some with these books and also is it I'm assuming we can actually make a lot more books because we have the leather and we have paper is paper more difficult to make I can't remember all right I'll make some make some bookshelves might as well do that can make ten of them okay well I have fire resistance now let's go kill dragons yet yeah that that's that definitely sounds like something I'll be able to do a lot of a lot of arrows um I have something the question just becomes do I like immediately go and try or do I do I choose life you know I mean you you may have a chance I don't because I'm not gonna be you know Stan I get that you've come up short there that's um it's not what I want I would love to be more useful but you know I'd love to go with you to fight the dragon but I got this crick in me back yeah I do this prick and me back just makes me like take fire damage it's really weird like I never expected it to be the case but it's a pain really is it's pain in the back it's a pain in my everywhere when I'm on fire wait I can use it to find diamonds what hold on hold on hold on a minute hold on you you you say what now piqued your interest huh feel free to elaborate more on that dear-dear chat of mine that would we we wish to know more and learn your secrets yeah see sick press P what does it do do this I don't know I don't know what any of that is but it's a cool menu I mean a disabled pretty fancy block particles okay oh so like sets off particles around blocks I don't know use a numpad 1 2 3 4 the function of the eyes one two boom what the heck yeah I need more coal for my treasury what hmm so it's powered like oh oh I can toggle between what I look for what wait I got it I'm going back to the mind oh my god dude I can't die I want to see this is this something that I'll be able to see or do I now have the magic level I I doubt magic levels this is just the the I function I want to see after you after you do it I want to see what I mean it's assuming I can even tell what it's doing all right show me how this thing works nothing jumping out at me just yet what you should do set it to unknown one like set it to coal or redstone because we can see these right now and then see what happens when you're like on the other side of blocks from it or something okay so that's I'm getting a lot of particles it's really difficult to tell what's going on there let's see what redstone is okay so it kind of gives it a particle effect oh can you see it I grew the walls walls dang that six you can just straight line straight through and then you'll be able to see if there are particles oh my god that's amazing dude we should go let's go back to the strip mining let's go let's go back to the strip mine and then you can just walk through it you just give it a run through and you can basically just tell oh yeah it's totally uh well no no no no no no no Frick Frick Frick it's bad oh no I gotta leave help what is that thing what how did this happen Oh everything was fine and then everything was insanity holy SH art I just turned around and saw bad things kind of chasing you around is that an accurate assessment oh my god I tried to go into the strip mine I was like nope you're not gonna go in there you're gonna come back to us I didn't see what it was it's a it's a it's another one it's just a different colored one of the gravity monsters okay hehe done and then there was a lava lizard monster boy so yeah I saw the lava lizard oh my god are there diamonds everywhere tell me there are diamonds everywhere not everywhere they're actually pretty rare but you see them I think so I'm bro I want to see what this will grow this is amazing this is amazing okay well we need to get fortune that'd be great but but but but but alright now let me know this let me check it you put it into your head slot okay and then you can use one two and three to enable and disable stuff I think it's two on your numpad to swap between what pieces you don't put it on your head you put it into your head bobble slot I mean it's in my head bobble slot now okay so numpad 1 2 3 yeah 3 I think turned on night vision okay and 2 started cycling through the treasures iron laughy's gold diamond oh wow okay it is quite bright in here yeah okay I just want to see what I'm looking okay so I'm gonna set its iron really quick that's why that's why I didn't actually dig out the diamonds except you were so excited and and voracious that you just went and immediately pulled them out rather than you know no I said I'm doing I I haven't set to iron no I haven't set to iron now so I'm okay but it looks like okay so it it doesn't go immediately it kind of second it takes to say yeah it's it's kind of a every five seconds kind of highlights okay let's see if I can find a vein and then I'll pass it back to you this is I can I can tell why he what's up no I'm just saying yeah you can definitely tell that there's not very many diamonds yeah that's quite a radar blip yeah I can I can tell why he wants to increase the cost of this one though yeah cuz that really wasn't that expensive all things considered no I really wasn't I feel like you make back your investment pretty quickly say as you are unable to find diamonds there there aren't many diamonds Oh yep there are right over here oh yeah oh yeah that's what you're looking for don't that's what you're looking for out here well yeah that's some diamonds eight yep nice boom boom boom oh oh so many so many so many you gotta leave go ahead C go ahead and get the XP that's cool oh sure thanks thanks for being nice about all right here I'll hand it back to you yeah yeah there you go now my night vision is going bye-bye yes God fiery oh you just swim in though I don't know what [ __ ] I I couldn't figure out what to or what number pad one did but everything else ruined the bar that's crazy yeah I do we need to find another dragon head holy crap wait I'm sure they're just lying around everywhere absolutely okay that's gonna be just adventure though I mean in my thumbnail world I I stumbled across one like immediately you found some oh man just a door reach god I hate that I hate that I knew it was gonna be like right where I just hadn't quite mine too nice oh we're crushing it we're crushing it gonna be able to make a diamond helmet and complete the set actually I'm gonna do that right now while we out here give me that diamond helmet with a is 10% speed oh my god what a weenie crash you don't figure it we need to figure out how the reforging works in our ages oh it's down this way wait so I actually I have plus 10% speed on my feet and minus 10% on my heads so two different veins right over oh my god this is amazing this is the most incredible thing ever we should have just gone and made the thing that the instant that we found well actually no I suppose that uh we did we did as soon as you find your second vein yeah it we pretty much did dip out this is a much more efficient way to to mind oh yeah just a little bit you know it's it's a marginal increase in efficacy there we go mmm Oh done I hear roaring that's fairly out there's another is there another oh yeah oh so much for yeah diamonds not being able to be found at all oh where are you going off to I hear a lot of roaring though set oh there's another one wow she's set to set to treasure to find dragons dens are you kidding me oh I get it this is nuts there's I can see I can see two other veins from right here oh my god dude this is insane do you want me to start like are we are you bored or do you want to it's I feel like I could go on for days I mean pretty much you could whoa sorry that was me don't worry I just needed to I just needed to refill the canteen real quick we're just going on this like goose chase through through the bedrock area finding some diamonds you know ones Oh got it cool nice all right so a little bit of a maze through there yeah and then the other one is straight back and to the right oh my goodness is about to die but I brought another one actually I'm gonna be able to regen my diamonds rapier which is very nice and almost like I'm digging up diamonds and you're planning on how to spend them it's it's it's very well we did agree that one person was gonna get the dragon thing one person who's gonna get the resistance thing now I do believe that the Dragons thing is probably just inherently better than the resistance thing but we can trade off every now and again yeah you know treasure in my inventory I have 23 diamond hey you know what maybe uh maybe it's time that we go back and get some fortune so that we can more effectively put that thing to use what do you need to use the the diamond armor what level was it I believe it's 16 on everything for diamond we got another annoying gravity boy gravity boy out here freaking gravity boy get out of here bro get out of here if you could advertise them oh yeah dude high antigravity Tim oh so gravity boy nope there's diamonds oh my god didn't have wait whoa it's a spider jockey careful I don't see where he is it's on the other he's to the left oh I see him that's just a spider no it seemed it sounded like there was some jockeying going on there is ask Ellie ever there though yeah there's diamonds basically in this lava but oh yeah that's that's a difficult way to deal with them I mean you go for it if you want I'm gonna head back and I'm gonna yeah regen my rapier so that we are all good all right this is a kid what a time to be alive oh my god oh my god what a vein that was oh it's just you know some more over here different veins over here holy crap this one this is fun I like this I could do this for a while yeah yeah not bad how can I get another vein um once you you know like there's one right underneath the golden dude I think okay it's down hey hey that's a scary place to be oh that's like it's so it's in the lava it looks like necessarily let's see maybe yeah maybe alright cuz it's down from that yep okay alright well you know we had a fun run and now what I'm gonna do is level my magic probably because I want to there we go I'm at level 12 now good so I can use the weight now you can use the enchanter oh no I'm at level 11 I always get faked out now I'm at level 12 cool yeah so I place the bookshelves now I guess I can access the thing we're not up to level 30 yet but we might have what it takes to get there oh yeah right now we're up to 20 have you even gotten close to level 30 uh-oh like in our own inventory I've gotten a level 30 before but then I used it on you know level ups and things like that but if there's a fancy enchanter enchantment thing that's what I was wondering there's disenchantment is that within the enchantment tables options okay and it doesn't look at least not that it's named that oh yeah yeah it's just it's slightly problematic mining in the Java you know well I don't think a lot of burned stuff oh really hmm because I got a redstone out of it when I walked it but I hadn't read I did just go ahead and use up the rest of the and so I might be able to get enough bookshelves to get us to drop the leather off I might be able to get us to level 30 enchants now that it's like critical but I'll try I can't remember how many bookshelves it doesn't like 15 I think so I never remember these things we are up to 13 bookshelves which should get us kinda close I believe let's see what we'll be up to it that boom boom and that gets us to we're at 26 so I think two more books see more than 26 no no no level 26 all I know yeah so I mean just just a little bit of a little bit more happen right now I literally have more birch on me cool yeah then we oh yeah yeah there's lots of birch over here might as well that's why I brought birch seeds over with so I could plant birch and have it be easily available right now made into paper please do not obliterate me there are yeah there's a lot of birch trees here did you didn't plant all these did you a lot of them oh really oh dang I mean not like this forest going into the back oh okay that's what I was saying yeah no no no no I brought I brought a lot of them forward though gotcha buy replanting which is apparently something you don't do okay excuse me excuse me I am good at at team trees replanting okay geez how dare you such harsh judgments man I'll have you know I planted a lot of trees over in a different server very recently okay are you gonna tip oh there we go did you did you need a hug or a medal or just I just want you to not be giving me short saying I own that rear Acme trees that will never have he's it a is it a catkin is that the equivalent of a sapling yeah okay cuz I actually didn't realize that that was a sapling so I feel like there's perhaps a bit of an excuse maybe yeah I mean if you rationalize it then there's plenty of excuse you didn't know that that was a thing my goodness the judgment it just doesn't stop it's true it's true all right there we go bookshelves I'll make one two three make it symmetrical and I think that'll get us to 30 I mean now obviously we have to actually get there with our levels but we'll have the ability which is probably and that's level 30 sharpness three lesser fire aspect to I wonder what we get on that pickaxe is already not stuff but cool that's exciting it's good times good times all around well would you like to wrap it up here sure we'd like to say thanks to our everybody wins also in that same description that we will have a link to the playlist so you can catch up on any other episodes that might have had your diamonds stolen from and you know that's about it it's anything you want to add to this I'm not farming level 8 so I wasn't able to plant those and I didn't realize they were sampling so anyway level up your your planting I will do that hmm after I get where I need to be okay see you next time bye guys [Music]
