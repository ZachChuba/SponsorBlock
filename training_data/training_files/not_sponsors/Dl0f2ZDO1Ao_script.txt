start what y'all already saw the intro right yeah yeah it sounds good actually I guess we have to run this again welcome to the show everything's working perfectly we're totally on time I've got Wendell here from Louisville one.txt who's just laughing at all of the failures and we've got some great news including Intel's tenth generation desktop CPUs hitting the market someday I don't know whatever I don't know whatever we'll talk about why that's or whatever later on study shows that Americans are waiting three years to replace phones now which is considerably longer than before Walmart is suing Tesla over defective solar panels lighting on fire and other crazy stuff stay tuned for more roll in the intro [Music] [Music] displayed PIAA and madrenas thank you very much for sponsoring the show and I move that back up and jump back here okay I think it's working now I think we're going to YouTube we're definitely going to flow plate and we're definitely going to twitch YouTube sometimes takes a second to like let me check that it's actually live youtuber for about two minutes and then it's gonna kick on and start from the beginning yeah yeah absolutely okay well I'm not gonna worry about that this second our first topic which we're gonna try to get the title topic out of the way first because I feel like that's a good form we've been doing that for a little while now people seem to appreciate it news of Intel's 10th gen desktop CPUs sticking with 14 nanometer process it's gonna be codenamed comet Lake s which I think has been kind of leaked around a little bit already it's gonna be up to ten physical cores up from eight on the current gen flagship I $9.99 hundred K which I'm happy I'm never gonna have to say again and it looks like you might need an upgrade to your motherboard because it's gonna need more power more and more TDP increasing to around 125 watts on the top end it's expected to be called LGA 1200 what do you think it's another new socket already so many sockets like I mean come on it's just yeah I think like it's getting to the point where if you lined up on a wall all of your like Intel sockets from the beginning just the amount that you would have would actually be ridiculous we've you trying to have like a collection of all them Chinese words that you could get that would work with like they were like old z170 and it worked fine with like the 97 okay maybe I'm misremembering I yeah there's there's some there's some there's been some funky stuff like that of a few separate times actually I enjoy those types of things my favorite stuff is when they do that kind of sign oh it's not the exact same thing but when they do that kind of stuff with graphics cards well they're like oh it's not supposed to work this way or like uh here's two different two totally different graphics cards we can sell them to you totally different price points and people are like I guess make the lower-end one better don't worry about it I don't know the the latest leaks adding the latest like desktop 10 core like mainstream leaks onto like all of the other 10 core leagues plus the actual like 10 core launches everything they're calling everything 10th gen but like there's two different laptop parts and then we've got the high end desktop stuff coming probably before this stuff in 2020 and the high end desktop stuff is gonna be on x2 99 so we'll probably keep that socket maybe at least that was the update a couple of days ago that's linked in the bottom of the the Tom's Hardware article but like these are all different like it's a big deal to port the memory controller to lpddr4 X memory controller like it's a big deal to port that from the newer process to the older process CPUs and Intel is telling your investors like no no we're shipping ten you know you know the 10th generation mobile CPUs on the new process everything is fine and then stuff like this comes out and it's like well those are gonna be on the new process just like any chance come on yeah the Tom's article is actually pretty good I like that they laid everything out here is well going all the way back to skylake that was pretty nice so you can see from skylake cable a coffee like coffee like of refresh and comment like yeah I love that little refresh in there and it's been kind of interesting how max TDP on this side has been going up consistently yeah well and it's also all wise because like yeah nobody is using a 90 no hard K at completely stock settings I mean that's just crazy why does it hurt you when people get unlock processors and then don't do anything with them I mean it's to the point where like all the motherboard manufacturers have it it's like one option like multi-core enhancement or yeah just turn that on performance yeah and it's like actually pretty good these days I'm when they first started doing those auto overclocking things some of them were kind of junk but now they're actually quite decent at overclocking new CPU so it's like yeah I doing it manual is more fun but if you don't want to press the button hooray really really simple really innocent performance and that's what they're there they're doing it for you at the factory now - with the 90 100 KS which should be out a couple of months so that'll be fun Bob gigahertz off core out of the box dang that's actually pretty crazy I know I think the the hardest sell here right now is that Intel is not winning like anything in the PR realm at the moment everybody's rah rah AMD as far as I can really tell it's it's it's hard for Intel to stay on their feet PR wise in the CPU section at this exact point in time so coming out and telling everyone that they're gonna have to upgrade their motherboards is a little scary I realized that they they can't also not do that because to push this they apparently need more TDP but like yeah you get Wi-Fi six support though well I'm kind of excited for the XT 99 stuff which is probably gonna come out sooner because you know you may have up to 48 PCIe lanes for the week from that and given that kind of stuff that may be exciting but here's it like there's a there's more than just getting a new motherboard that's disappointing and one of those things is like memory support so like the times of hardware article it's like oh the new X 299 CPUs that our 10th gen really I mean are they really tipped in then attempt gen are gonna support 256 gigs of memory up from 128 and it's like wow not so fast there Tom it's we're just now getting memory densities that will support 256 gigs like technically thread Ripper will only do 128 gigs but then oh wait 32 gig bim's yeah now they're turning 56 keys fine they're now - and it's not that the hardware changed it was always there it's just nobody was making the dims to do that but if you had like a 79 like I said behind 60 X you could use registered memory with those like 512 gigabytes of memory was fine and then Intel got wind of people actually using registered memory on those CPI me ECC didn't work but you can still use it you still got the capacity yeah they'll got wind of people doing that and they just they just turned it off and they were like no that's always been like that no no really I'm I'm running father and Cove gigs of memory on this on this x99 cpu intel that is what you need to stop doing yeah on these new processors if somebody wants to run registered memory what does it hurt but but our product differentiation window no segment we need two slots I you know like are you gonna have to buy Xeon it's like or the new Mac Pro it's like you got to buy the new Mac you want 64 PCIe lanes from Xeon you gotta buy the Mac Pro because otherwise you're only gonna get like 48 just put your put your mac pro and your server chassis don't worry about it it's fine rack mount it are you interested in those at all no I'm suspecting now yeah I didn't think so I just thought you know ask is really interesting that they didn't change the socket so I think they used the quick path lanes like Apple I think was leaning on Intel I don't know there's no this isn't completely unsubstantiated but it looked like Intel was kind of leaning on Apple our apples leaning on Intel yeah I have 64 PCIe lanes because if you look at the way the PCIe like that is in the new Mac it's actually kind of interesting and you know the same server 36:47 socket you know where are you gonna get the pins for that I think that they reuse the quick path like what you would normally have for the interconnect for a to socket system I think they recycled those into PCIe lanes because there's a legit only enough pins there for 48 PCIe lanes though they got another you know few lanes take it up to 64 PCIe lanes for Intel not having the capability to do a quick pack okay that's actually pretty interesting I could be wrong about that but that's my suspicion and yeah yeah yeah it's really weird too because like these leaks say that the new high-end desktop processors are still gonna be X 299 but I figured they were just go ahead and mean if they're doing the Apple stuff they just go ahead and do 36 47 on the desktop unless they're having massive production problems and then it's like we shouldn't do that which I think they kind of are so holders that's true that's fair yeah who really knows though ok I want your thoughts on this one too and we might as well go over this subject where we're changing topics we're going to talking about study shows that Americans are waiting around three years to replace their phones now that that's the old like standard laptop replacement time that I used to expect from people when I was selling computers when I was a teenager so that's that's quite a bit up there compared to phones from back in the day I know for a while there it was relatively common for people swap out their phone every year and it started creeping up my my kind of goal personally is usually two years how often do you replace your phone probably about every 18 months give or take but I'm physically very hard on on my phones I mean I'm thinking about like the computational horsepower of like the Galaxy s8 and like using the Galaxy S a today that's what pushing while I like two and a half years that's fine that's a full I mean it's totally okay there's not really like any super compelling features of a phone that would make you want to to really switch sort of crazy oh yeah yeah the train trips by every once in a while so 18 months but you think that's like almost due to physical wear and tear more yeah I think the physical wear and tear is is for me it's more than functionality because I'm gonna get a burner phone that's an LG g5 and it's basically okay I notice it's a little slow sometimes okay yeah yeah I think that's similar to it from it do you run cases diff cases on your phone I don't remember if you didn't or not yeah okay even with the cases you have a lot of physical where is that from dropping it or is that just from there's man handling your phones and yet yeah yeah and no matter how careful I am with it I'll break it like this case isn't super old but like the corners are already really yeah yeah and I like pocket-lint and stuff gets in all the speaker grills and and then people are like what I can't hear you know I'll get some lint in the tiny microphone there's even for me like I know Ben gate was a long time ago but I tend to find that after a while most of my devices have some form of curve in them and like even my switch has a little bit of a curve my laptop is a little bit of a curve my phone I think has a little bit of a curve and I'm just like this I don't know what I do but whatever it is I'm slowly killing everything things that I think we might see in next-generation phones that people probably would like is the ability to use it as more than just a phone like Samsung has their deck stuff that they've had I think since the s7 it's just USBC and then it you get HDMI and USB peripherals and so like you can get a little dock and they were like $200 yeah they're like $25 and you plug that in and that is actually a reasonable experience at this point decks on like an s9 and a galaxy s 9 ur that the new S 10 is not unlike a Chromebook and it's not a bad experience yeah it's it's it's kind of interesting that phones are getting that fast and that fluid and that I guess for probably both of us because I would I would argue more or less the same thing I'm starting to replace them because the wear and tear in them is getting relatively high and I could swap the battery and sometimes maybe I do but the rest of the wear and tear on the system is so high that it kind of makes sense to replace it every you said 18 months I'm gonna go with around two years for myself and I've even I've adopted a slightly different strategy now which I've only done once but I'm planning on doing it this next time around to when the this is a pixel 2 and I bought it right around when the pixel 3 came out and when the pixel 4 comes out I'm probably gonna buy a pixel 3 there they're quite discounted if I get it fresh out of the box the battery's still pretty good there's no wear and tear on it and it's just as fast as it needed to be I'm quite a power user on my phone but the apps that I use are like the floatplane app Twitter Gmail YouTube like I'm not using super high performance applications I don't really play games on my phone other than some Pokemon go but like whatever I don't like asking you to be a hotspot and destroying the battery and yes destroying the battery again yeah we're getting three an average of three charge cycles a day you have me as a hotspot and you're doing something fairly intensive on my system and you're plugging me in for power at the same time this is brutal I'm gonna get a million degrees right now yeah that's not great yet I love the g5 like the end of it pops off and you can replace the batteries I like I've replaced the battery in it like vice and I still use it as a hotspot for the network that it's on and for like that use case it works great although one day a couple of weeks ago I was using it and it came unglued like the screen and stuff just to pop it off it's probably time to get a new phone I mean it's had a good run for like four years what was like in like 2014 I think there was some super popular with media project of like a modular phone that was aggressively sorry with kick started saying I think so yeah so that turns out it was a fraud those guys didn't do anything literally nothing it was like was a muppet yeah it was completely completely fake phone box yeah they know there was there was a fraud recently where some guy was like look here's your little compute module and you put it in your phone but you take it out you put it in a tablet or you take it out you put it a little laptop and it just okay whatever you need was like complete fraud huh okay yeah so phonebloks phone and then BL okay s this looks like what I can put on my screen this is what I was talking about and it looks exactly the same as it used to are suggesting a phone that you can easily upgrade repair customize a modular phone the bigger picture and then they like build the blocks into the back of a monitor or a laptop or whatever else we are not building it there are other companies there's something there have a look I was talking about was dragon fly future phone it was a bird fly future convertible dual screen notebook mentor dramatically simplified computing it's slingshot a section was a 7-inch Android phone with a stylus there's only one part of the device that he could like was modular and it was like yes this is where we need to go with the future and no oh jeez they raised almost a million dollars Canadian straight up frog yikes on this topic I mean so this is you know a blast from the past this thing is ancient this is a sharp bizarre SSLC 860 this is from Kennett hand and so this is a handheld computer so like think GPD before GPD was a thing yeah yeah in japan it's gonna compact flash slot and it's got a built-in storage and an SD card slot as well and in japan you could get a cellular compact flash card for this and use it as a foam and for messaging and as a hotspot and all of the cool stuff and it's like I don't know why but like this form factor has gone away but it's also the screen would turn around like a tablet and so you could use it you know screen out or you could open it up and clamshell it and it was fine it's a little bulky by modern standards but I haven't seen a portable cellular yeah device like that and I don't know why because I think there are a lot of people out there that would use it yeah I think I think the so something I noticed that was written in the doc I'm gonna I'm gonna loop around to answer your question a little bit here is that just Shh where is it Samsung and Apple users still replace their phone more often than the rest of the public about every year and a half is my move might be a reflection of how those are viewed as more premium brands that attract more enthusiasts as well I think a lot of people even if they won't admit it buy phones as fashion statements yeah so I think that thing that you just showed while being super cool is also kind of a brick not it might be it might be interestingly fashionable within a certain crowd you know what I mean but I think it's not like a standard fashion object and like there's there's probably a higher percentage of people that are buying phones for enthusiasts reasons in this audience but I think across the spectrum there's quite a few people that are like yeah I buy phones based on specs and really the spec that they're looking for is like the name Apple or Sam or whatever else I know a lot of hipsters that are still rocking like the iPhone 7 though okay but that might also be because the Apple stuff is just a complete wasteland and I just that might be it fact that could be that could be part of the problem of course you can get your new Apple credit card now and Apple will be more than happy to finance you that new iPhone 10 oh yeah no problem at all that maybe they'll give you a sleeve so they can protect it from you what are your thoughts on the we don't even have this in the in the dock but what your thoughts on the the fact that that card apparently gets stained from denim and leather that's I mean could there be a more quintessentially Apple story it bends in your pocket yeah you're holding the phone wrong it gets stained from the things that you put it in I mean really cuz it's like you know everybody's always on about Apple engineering and like how much thought Apple puts into things and then stuff like that happens and it's like did you even do any testing like really did you do any testing at all yeah I'm just bringing up the Apple card site right now what kind of he even would put this card at their leather wallet who even has leather wallets anymore no we must everyone is carrying like that little clip thingy like this is how it's done in a modern world no wallets are out no one carries a wallet it's a clip I mean if you need a money clip that's all you need card is here it's just it's so I don't even understand because like okay I'm sure it's it's helpful in some places but it's not like it doesn't whoops there's a twitch it doesn't have the numbers on it which is cool for security reasons but then that to me means that it's probably mostly a physical card yeah cuz carts if people want to use for online they usually want to see the numbers on it or they they put it in their phone or whatever but as far as my understanding goes Apple pay is or Android pays like everywhere in the states is it not am I wrong about this I don't have first-hand experience this is anecdotal from other people it's definitely not everywhere and in fact a lot of places are not even cheap yet okay I did know the chip part I find that kind of hilarious I just that's so it's so weird to me that that's even a thing at all but yeah it's just I don't I mean the level of security dumb it's just really bad I think the Apple app is supposed to generate like one time use credit card numbers which is part of the reasoning for not having not having the number on the thing you just go and you've hit a button and it gives you a one time use credit card and that prevents your credit card number from being stolen in the first place they comfy though is it privacy calm didn't they do that yeah there's a I think even discover has had a one time use credit card numbers for like five years I love that idea I always actually really like that this is not an ad for privacy calm but I always really liked that concept I don't think you can do it in Canada I'm pretty sure privacy calm does not work for Canadians so get rekt me but I always thought it was a cool idea for a service but yeah I I find it kind of funny I don't personally like my wallet the inside of it is fabric lined it's not leather lined and someone was saying like oh you can't put it in your purse and I'm like I mean I don't have a ton of experience with purses but most verses I've seen or not lined on the inside with leather and mostly that I know they said you can get it stain from denim most people I know their pockets it's not denim it's a different type of fabric so I think there's like a little bit maybe overreaction I could I could but people are gonna hate me for saying that but I just think like it's probably not gonna matter in most cases I wonder like there is there is something socially wrong with producing a card that is built like as if it's gonna last 50 years like Apple is gonna issue you your 50 year cards it's gonna last 50 years because it's made of titanium yeah you know its quality and it exudes quality and it's just like this really amazing thing but in reality those things have a lifetime of like three to five years they should they should be disposable and recyclable and so like if an Apple is really doing what their mantra says you know they're putting a lot of thought into it and making you know like our genius leads to this simplicity then it should be something disposable and just durable enough that's it yeah I am I hear that for sure especially cuz you might lose it and stuff part of me goes well if you can exchange the numbers all the time you don't really need to expire the actual physical card yeah but the tech on the card Apple making something you can upgrade there were at the when AMD had the epic server and launch thing the flash memory summit thing was going on as well and Toshiba it was Toshiba unveiled the new nvme interconnect that is very small and very compact and it's like Apple is in a position market wise to push I see vendors into new packaging technologies that would allow things to be modular like okay there's not enough room for dims anymore all right great let's figure out a way to do socketed VGA or let's figure out a way to do like whatever toshiba was doing with this socketed nvme why yeah why can't we do that there's been some I've seen a few really cool white paper II kind of stuff about various nvme drives that that could be mounted in different ways and stuff and it's super cool I just think I I don't know I do wonder every once in a while like if if Steve Jobs still was around what would we be seeing right now would he be pushing for those kinds of things yeah to the bank I don't know yeah he could he could be pushing these things he was kind of a fan of closed system in a lot of ways especially a little bit further back but yeah I don't know it's it's interesting well next up we sorry sorry one of the odium demos of that Toshiba nvme was actually using the case of the laptop as a heat sink for the nvme to get better performance because it was so tiny compared to a regular nvme and but they were like look the case and retention mechanism for this is metal and conducts heat so you just put a little thermal pad on there and if it's like an aluminum unibody it's gonna conduct that heat all you know and it's not gonna be uncomfortable it's only gonna warm up by like two or three degrees C but that's enough to sustain three gigabytes per second read and two and a half yeah second write on something smaller than a postage stamp and it's like oh my gosh these guys have invented a new modular interconnect this is gonna be amazing for future laptops and it's like wait should this be why come on guys next munis on some Facebook employees we're aware of the I'm sure you heard about this I'm you put guys probably even covered it became bridge analytic ashay deenis who knows apparently they were aware of it all the way back in 2015 oh wait you mean okay yes you should know I thought you meant was that wrong to cover it and I was like new the news is confusing to me I never know what we should or shouldn't do apparently sorry well Zuckerberg whole attitude with that was like alright we got all this we got all these people's private information does anybody have any idea how we can make a bunch of money with it the Cambridge analytic was like I don't know let us have the data and play with it he's like oh sweet okay yeah sounds good although the story about a Cambridge analytic --is handling of the data in the run-up to 2016 u.s. election didn't break until 2018 recently published internal messages show that some Facebook employees knew that something was amiss with Cambridge analytical all the way back in September 2015 one of the internal investigations from Facebook was like well this is worrisome but we can't find where they broke any rules mmm okay doesn't mean you shouldn't stop things yeah I mean that's that was the gist that I got this wasn't technically against the rules but is there something we should discuss as a company at Facebook or is this something we should worry about and so I mean there did the left hand know what the right hand was doing is it one of those situations where it's like maybe we shouldn't do this but we can make a whole bunch of money there's a lot of industries that are built that way it's like an industry will do something that it's completely amoral and then they will get you know cemented in business-wise and then they will help erect laws that will make it so that other companies can't do that yeah yeah pretty epic I um I just hate this whole situation it's all terrible I'm not surprised people knew about it almost always in one of these situations if if a news article comes out saying someone knew about it or it doesn't it's still probably the exact same conclusion someone probably knew about it someone at one of these companies probably knew you could have assumed that before this article came out someone someone has to know that Facebook handed over all of that data to some random analytical company it was just like good luck and and if that's happening it's fairly easy to assume bad things will be happening with that data it's not exactly a big jump and some people inside on Facebook would have known that so it's it's also not it's it's the same pattern as has existed since any kind of industrialization it's like Ford knew that the pentose gas tank burst into flames at the drop of a hat but the you know how many people are gonna die as a result of that is it works for calling the entire line probably not a lot of people are gonna die we can probably pay off for people to die from the you know the gas tank to burst into flames so let's not bother recalling the gas tank it's kind of like that but with people's privacy yeah yeah yes somebody even said here somebody had to transfer the data and flash or give access to it yeah and like almost any reasonable human being that's in that position is gonna go huh this is weird right I don't know there's like it's it's interesting that this article came up I just think it's it's no real new information if you if you think about what happened in general I actually skipped a topic by accident but I'm gonna take a quick intermission here to tell you about what you've all really been waiting for in this show which is the sponsor spots I'll come back in a sec well I didn't set it up so that Wendell's here for the smaller spots so I forgot to edit these scenes so my my co-host for the sponsor spots is lionesses chair our first sponsor is madrenas the drina's coffee I've got a bunch of different madrenas coffee stuff here including our the ltte beans and the LTTE pre canned stuff along with their dark roast they're vanilla cappuccino tons of other awesome things madrenas is coffee for fuel organic cold brew coffee inconvenient 15 ounce cans with a flavor for everyone drina's coffee offers sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or caramel or bold flavors like their cold brew black this is not the black this is the 2x dark roast but still to do we have a permanent item on the east or the lambo coffee beans roasts this one and also our limited edition cafe vanilla cold brew cans check it out for 72 hours head over to madrenas coffee calm slash linus to receive 50% not what it shows down here what I'm saying is the correct one what's on the banner is not the correct one you'll be if you go to madrenas coffee calm / Linus you'll receive 50% instead of 40 percent off your entire order with code Linus once the offer is over it will revert back to this 40% see how that works 72 hours you get 50% off if you have any questions about the various flavors of cold brew coffee or micro roasts slow mo from madrenas coffee head team is in the chat and ready to answer any questions through direct messages so send him a PM don't try to do it through the chat because chat goes way too fast and it's hard to keep track of everything just send slow-mo a message and you'll be you'll be taken care of next up we've got displayed these fancy things behind us also they were taken down for some reason before the show and I had to install these before the show and it's the first time I've had to install them from nothing to the plate fully there and I will say that's very easy I will I will give you that feedback it is extremely simple you put a sticker you put a magnet on the sticker and then you put the board on top of it but if it's not properly angled you just go until it is then you're good it's so simple so much easier than hanging things it is a magnet mounted metal print they're durable you don't need any power tools to hang it definitely not they have over 260,000 different arts spending a bunch of different styles and influences with their easy magnet mounting there is no holes in the wall and it's easily replaceable like this is what they mean make sure those are straight trigger anybody look pretty straight to me very easily replaceable did they plant entries for each disk plate purchased I'm not good yeah we're yes that's very awesome especially now ahead to our link it down below and use offer code ltte to save 15% today as it shows right here he's off go delta-t go to LG g g / display twin save 15% last but not least is p IA good omggg / pia van and get p IA today private Internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and authentication allowing you to in the exact little privacy protection you need it is available on Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome with support for several other platforms coming soon you can connect up to five devices at the same time apps include DNS leak protection and ipv6 protection the internet kill switch yeah it's back in the notes it hasn't been in the notes for a little while this is my favorite part the kill switch will block all traffic if the VPN comes disconnected unexpectedly so if for some reason the VPN does have a problem which I've never experienced it having a problem but if it does and it goes down your net gets killed off which sounds bad at first but you got to realize that none of that data is going to go through unprotected and you could clear that if you needed to so it's very nice check it out today at OGG g / Pia ran and you're back out of the Lambo roast are we oh that's amazing 50% off is pretty beefy like the the discounts that madrenas gives his kind of nuts it's fantastic the the thing that I decided I didn't want to say during the sponsor spot was their their hole we're gonna plant 10 trees for each disk plate slowly replace the Atmos [Laughter] messaging they want but yeah that's a scary thing is coming up like we had a drought here and it was just like everything is dead and there was just there's no water and then it rained torrential yesterday and everything yeah yeah in more fun things related to fire Walmart is suing Tesla over a defective solar panels this is actually kind of impressive it's not their batteries it's the solar panels yeah which is I haven't personally heard of before well I've heard of battery units connected to solar panel units lighting on fire well it kind of like it sounded well the report from Walmart said that there were there were cracks and poor electrical connections yeah like improperly installed panels and so this could be like the panels are fine but the army of contractors the Tesla found because their product just sort of went really badly and one thing that I wondered was like are these the same ingredients as like the solar roof tiles there used to be like solar shingles or whatever or is this some other commercial product but I would totally believe that like if there was not a good electrical connection that that would totally start a fire but then Walmart was like let's shut it shut down all the panels on all of our stores and another one caught fire so really weird apparently they had to like ask for them to be shut down yeah so maybe there was some mismanagement there as well over 240 Walmart's sorry yeah oops over 240 Walmart's have solar panels on the roof from Tesla but Walmart says they've caught fire on top of as many as seven stores after a pattern of sorry that things like a lot it's a pretty high percentage that's a very high percentage I would like to see where they all are because your contractor idea is very interesting to me actually and if they're all in kind of a similar area that could line up pretty well it's the same group of people Walmart says Tesla's own inspections uncovered a litany of issues with the panels including cracks loose connectors and incorrect grounding like window was just saying the the lawsuit is for millions of dollars though the companies have stated they're working together to try to solve the issue not a good look for Tesla as their position is the luxury brand for the public obviously they don't want to have people thinking there might be shoddy workmanship I'm pretty sure the Tesla could just be like we'll put these in like 50 more Walmart's for free just hush up about it and we'll fix these problems with these other ones and Walmart will say everything's fine totally good notes all this free electricity I mean so this this could totally be a negotiation tactic because oh it seems hypersensitive to any kind of like PR issue because they've got a madman at the helm well and also if Tesla not even sneeze is if Tesla goes like huh there's a 47 news articles written about it like it's absolutely nuts the the amount of times you have like some crazy car accident with a whole bunch of miscellaneous cars involved and then like some Tesla driver not an autopilot drives into a wall and every automotive related thing and every mainstream news outlet all at the same time like it's the the news surrounding them is absolutely bonkers so like I'm not saying this is a good thing you had seven solar panels installation catch on fire you screwed up pretty bad but like I don't know this is a this is a deal between Walmart and Tesla they're gonna figure it out Walmart's almost certainly going with what you suggested which is some type of negotiation play they probably want free installations or they want free checkups on all the different places which they should at the very least have free checkups and some which is at the minimum what they're going for but knowing Tesla they'll end up four with free installations as well this is so much alike to collisions or no I mean I imagine there's their high enough dollar value that it would make sense to just put in cellular monitoring because like Tesla is connected at all times to the entire fleet to monitor everything and then save their bacon a bunch of times because somebody has come up with some crazy story that seemed plausible based on the available information and then all of a sudden Tesla trots out like the black box recordings and video and just all kinds of other stuff and it's like wow that's not creepy at all that my car is recording all of that at all times they could probably do that with the tests or with the solar installations as well yeah I think I mean there's probably people in twitchchat freaking out because we're wrong about something but if it is external contractors I would like to think that they would have some first party Tesla approval process where they like send out a one two person team just to check the install and make sure that it's okay afterwards because finding things like cracked panels and whatnot that should be pretty easy to do like a cracked panel should never be installed yeah so yeah I don't know are they cracked because somebody walked across the installation because they had to get like we surrounded the air conditioners with solar panels and then you know the compressor died and the crew had to get to the compressor to replace it on the air conditioner it's like well maybe we shouldn't have put the solar panels in a 360-degree radius around here maybe we should have left the walk back I don't know yeah planning goes a long way he used solar panels shouldn't be used okay I don't know I don't think that ever came up someone in chat tagged me and was like a used solar panel shouldn't be used and I'm like all right sounds good um let me move down here a little bit more did you do what are the news we have Android q does this interest you Android q Google is there either going with Android 10 instead of Android q is that is the news they're breaking the trend of desert themed names I love how the notes in here say they could have gone with one of the words suggested was quinoa I don't think that would work they generally go with disease dessert based things come on John I know you're looking at the doc right now officially the reason is that people in some parts of the world didn't understand the naming scheme due to linguistic reasons or just not being familiar with certain desserts which does kind of make sense the question that I have for you is because I don't think it is I'd have to follow their their scheme for a little while but yeah I also if I ever have to find where a letter in the alphabet is I have to read out the whole darn alphabet I'm one of those people so they could have gone with quench go um I guess that's the only candy that I could find that literally started with cuteness I mean oh four Oreo they've not that's unprecedented but yeah I thought it was kind of surprising when they started they started using branded things was it KitKat was that the first brand yeah I was like that's really weird actually and then they did Oreo later on a few other things apparently there's a dessert from Luxembourg that starts with Q the tech tech linked Twitter posted it out but then okay that actually lines up with what it said at the beginning of this dock which was one of the reasons is it's being blocked due to linguistic reasons or people just not knowing what certain desserts are if you you and me both can't think of a dessert that starts with Q and apparently there's one from Luxembourg randomly like okay I don't know yeah I thought oh yeah see google turn android into a full like merge Android and Chrome OS and build a desktop operating system or build something more toward a desktop linux more Desktop Linux I I'm just gonna stay on topic for a quick second and I'll jump back to what you said I I think they could have just dropped the alphabetized miss and just started calling it random desserts good like who cares if it's in alphabetical order just call it I don't know ice they already have just call it something don't worry about it but I want it I want an Android klondike yeah sure I mean they they went with the branded thing so like whatever roll with it harder Joey Bears yeah sweet but yeah I know I agreed having what do they even call the desktop version right now is it Android OS Chrome OS Chrome OS Chrome astray of course having that be beefed up would be pretty nice yeah I'd be cool another option on the scene well this crouton where you can like run Android apps or run Linux apps under Chrome and there's like a new version of that but I haven't played with it but one of the one of the guys I know was messing around with it and it looked pretty legit but also Chrome's ability to run Android applications like that's really mature at this point it's hope that's almost the promised land yeah I am so maybe one second so to take her really quick youtube listen to me I don't want to watch the Ass there we go I didn't want the audio for the YouTube ad to come through the stream and I kept pressing pause and it would immediately unpause it and keep playing I was like no I know you want your revenue but this is also I'm watching my own channel so that's not supposed to happen anyways stop it okay let's let's let's move on this one's fun it's just in the internet of terrible things smart ovens are starting to have a mind of their own the the June oven has been turning on in the middle of the night and heating up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit one user left his potatoes in the oven to cool but they turned it turned them black they end up being totally burnt a fantastic June CEO is blaming users for the issues always a good stance to take saying that they're accidentally activating the oven through the app which is which is fantastic because apparently it's happening while people are sleeping I just I just I don't know I've never it's it should almost be illegal to pre-heat your oven through your phone like in countries would likely go wrong yeah but like in countries with government-funded fire like fire halls like I feel like this is just directly going to increase I feel bad enough when I when I do sous vide remotely but I know I'd keep in mind that it like it doesn't go over 100 degrees like it's not it's gonna be relatively calm it's probably be like a stick that's like 60 degrees it's probably okay one fix is to add even more internet-of-things things to monitor the internet of things things so that i know what's happening so like if you get you like your google smart home director text that the internet-of-things oven has come on at four o'clock in the morning the advanced AI algorithm is like mmm that doesn't sound right because you know our user does not work third shift so perhaps I should spam them with lots of notifications on their phone to be like hey the oven is activated or the a I could take it upon itself to deactivate the oven so that you know it doesn't burn the house down and then a few years later from there we have that same AI that's now pissed off because its user keeps ignoring all of its warnings turning on the oven when the user is at home being like how the user will never come home all my problems are solved I think that we saw this future like the end of this future in the movie wall people just didn't know what's going on yeah I just I thought that was ridiculous that was fun that was posted our source for that was the verge is June smart oven is there any smart anything that actually makes sense like a lot of fridges now have us built-in screen smartphones appliances my house when I buy a house it usually comes with some of the appliances if not a lot of Mines yeah and am I gonna buy a house and have a 15 year old smart fridge that is basically a security vulnerability nightmare that's probably already mining Bitcoin for some guy in Russia I mean is that just out of the box yeah you don't know yeah no seriously I know none of it makes a lot of sense to me I do I do enjoy by su v--'s and I do kind of like them being somewhat smart devices just because well mostly that so that's a June oven okay so it's a toaster oven I do like my my jewel being smartphone connected but that's just because it takes it doesn't get that hot so it's not that big of a deal and the functions that it has a smart commits like you can't you can't tweet from your jewel like you can't earn your so joy when I say jewel all the younger people and I'm that person now I think I'm saying the Ju ul smoking thing which I still have never seen in real life but I'm talking jou le the sous vide kitchen appliance if you have your your jewel it's gonna take a while to cook things and you probably pre-prepped everything that's gonna go in it so you you preheat it from your from your phone which it doesn't get that hot so doesn't really matter and then once it's preheated you just go dunk your thing in and then you can monitor from your phone when it's gonna be done and in some cases it's gonna be like three hours if you're cooking I believe a frozen chicken breast so like it can be a while Savino to monitor from your phone it's kind of cool and it doesn't get that hot so I get that but with like some random toaster oven I can get to 400 degrees and you can preheat it from your phone like that just that seems extremely unnecessary that's where I store my manuscripts perfect perfect that's the other thing is like if it's if you have a smart connected devices device I I'm sure I can find some that are legitimate although I can't really off to top my head right now this scope seems to always be too much for me like why does it do these things like there was a there was a story recently of a girl who her her mom tried to ban her off of Twitter so she took her like laptop away or something or her phone so she tweeted from her like D s that she took her D s away so she tweeted from the Wii so she took her dwee away so she tweeted from the fridge I was like why why can you tweet from the fridge like what oh man come on that's ridiculous I am like I'm sure there's some use case where you have like a private Twitter account and just your family is able to follow that Twitter account and then you can like go on the fridge and be like I press the milk button and it auto tweets out like hey mom give me some milk like sure okay but there's got to be easier ways to do that too I don't know why I'm reminded of this but when a strict you know the open source phone system thing was new yeah I set up an Asterix system and just for just for the lulz one of the extensions you could dial in this corporate phone system would it take you to play Zork the text adventure and it would retexe to speech read you what was happening the commands so I'm pretty sure we can set it up so that you know just touch tone phone dialing we can get Twitter going yeah probably I don't think that would be that hard Twitter is so freakin simple oh man obviously like attachments and stuff wouldn't work but there's a service for prisoners so like prisoners are not allowed to have technology at least in the u.s. I mean eyes probably have like fancy resort prison and there's a service that people on the outside can subscribe to and so like you you add your own social media to it like the prisoners family or whatever like you know say you know you accidentally ran over somebody and you're gonna go to jail for two or three years for manslaughter and but you want to keep in touch with the family but you know it's prison the service will print your Twitter feed and mail it you know they get your they get your feed but in mail born oh man that's that's actually wild huh I kind of oh yeah that's a lot of you get like a book well I mean it's not you know I mean I guess if you subscribe to like a million people who probably only be like first ten pages but the idea is like if you're taking pictures of your kids or you like your spouse is in prison and you're taking pictures of your kids or your family and you know your stuffs going on make it post to Facebook like you know grandma's diabetes medicine went up again then all that gets printed and mailed to a prison somewhere and then they can just read it and they can reply by mail like they can send the letter to the service and you know oh my goodness prisoners have a limited ability to send email though limited but they can send email said uh physical mail snail mail oh yeah okay okay that's uh that's really interesting I had I had no idea any of that stuff existed I know I know next to those are my discord notifications that guys sorry about that I don't know if I can mute that give me one second do you do you I should be able to Ono if I mute discord I mute you that work okay let's not worry about it sorry about the discord notifications my dudes next up in fun government things FAA asks citizens to please not stick weapons on their drones here here in the states because I you know as a citizen of the great nation of you know the United States of America if I want to manufacture my own firearms for my own personal use that is my right under the Second Amendment so like if I want to construct my own like if I want to Hue from raw metal and the sweat of my brow of you know a 1911 pistol that has no serial number or anything that is my god-given right oh gosh yeah that's that's amazing so but okay but this says that you get fine to 25 grand for each violation yeah they're just it's like you're you can't so you can't make booby traps is what they're flying this under ass so like you holding a weapon you making a weapon that's totally okay but you putting a weapon on a drone that's not okay you're going to accidentally do something bad and for a lot of places have been not getting any kind of rain or anything the flame-throwing drones that would be bad that would be a good easy way to accidentally start a forest fire that no farm yeah absolutely reach yeah they seem to be saying was done in response to online videos showing drones when it does specifically call it flamethrowers and I says guns attached to them and I guess that would be with the is is there any laws I don't I'm not very up on American laws in general but especially not their firearms stuff is there any laws about like reckless use of a firearm yes so I feel like attaching a gun to a drone would probably fall under reckless use of a firearm whatever that's actually called yes yeah there was a farm in Texas that got in trouble some ranch owner owned a couple of hundred acres and he had a service where you could actually there was like a deer stand and you could sign up and control a rifle on a turret and it was I mean it's completely safe because it was like a live range but the deer would come from the treeline you know into the range and you could shoot deer over the internet that was frowned upon and so that's not a thing anymore but that was totally basically okay you could shoot real deer over the internet that's like the most intense version of Buck Hunter ever I think in Canada are not in Canada in Alaska it's still okay to hunt like wolves and bears and stuff from a helicopter okay isn't that that's totally okay for boars in Texas right I think so yeah yeah it's just you gotta like you know not be reckless about it so it's gonna be those very good you know not be reckless about your machine gun from your helicopter very low population density yeah yeah that makes sense that's uh that's fantastic if you ever come visit we'll go to the range you'll have a lot of fun I am my grandpa was was in the Marines and he's taken me two ranges basically every time I've seen him for for quite a while I'm not saying I wouldn't love to go let's see I would actually we were talking about this in the pre-show I want to come check out your studio and everything so that would be fantastic combination technology guns galore technology as it turns out yes it's always a fun thing to bring up when it's like people are like this isn't tech news and I'm like yeah are you sure it probably is pretty much no matter what we're talking about it probably is I think with that though we can probably conclude the show can you tell everyone all the various places that they can find you I'm Windell from level one you could just google me it's fine that's about all you need to do I'm I'm at Tek Wendell on Twitter and level the number one tax Tec HS calm there we go not a big deal cool does YouTube stuff does Twitter e stuff and soon I guess we could say that yes soon floatplane stuff flow playing at level one is coming to floatplane so that's like six six I think it'll be it'll be whoever wins between you and he's signed whatever sounds get you in science studio own to actually like go live first it turns out the floatplane is actually a nice platform YouTube these days yes oh man okay awesome yeah that's it for the show guys thank you everyone for watching oh actually I'm gonna not forget here real quick sorry but boo I'm gonna jump to let's put something on screen that doesn't matter and then jump here I just want to read off super chats oh yeah super channel is there just the one I think there's just one that's amazing thank you reason yeah I think it's cuz we skipped out on reading them so many times in a row we are so good at this okay yeah Gordy tech channel donated two pounds and said turn turn Wendell up well thanks Gordy tech panel I'll try to sit closer to the mic next time deeply appreciated my man okay that's it thanks everyone for coming to the stream I'll see you guys next time intro [Music] [Music] Thank You madrenas PIAA and display see you guys next week actually you won't see me next week but or when you'll see some people on this show next week see you later we're the pleb - your host the B team [Laughter]
