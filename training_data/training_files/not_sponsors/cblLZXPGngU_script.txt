the run back i like this this is what i want to play all right hmm ah the cameras ruined me the camera's toast guarding this and the cameras absolutely ruined me okay that's i think i counted five people there hmm oh god oh okay caught toast wait you caught toast no way yeah five uh five up you didn't catch tokyo oh i definitely all right so i see i'm spilling the tea right now so there is a kill on above weapons right now and a kill just happened under cams or not camps under comms uh toast is running out of there as i'm going out of o2 just because i was going to fix the lights and the lights got fixed and i went down now i i only barely caught cycuno also in that also there might be caught me too i mean why'd you only call out toasted first if you could because i because i saw a toast kill but i also see you with a little bit in there also okay so i am going to vote toast for this one yes my rebuttal is usually this would work if saikuna wasn't there to witness it as well yup unfortunately it was two kills there i saw one and i saw the other get just out of here it was just bad luck nah get toast out of here is you guys should just pick someone you trust and just yeah all right live with the decision don't fit five up guys story checks out because i saw it right when lights were going out towson did you see anything i i hope people were on vital so they could see that they were too awesome just now yeah okay you level your decision guys it wasn't toast i saw it i think this should gain her trust in theory all right get second out of here down that's enough for me for me okay that's what i'm saying what's your defense how come you're so sure it's not toast again oh wait you guys are trying to kill me it's like yeah it's enough for me you know i'll just say the same thing toast said we both saw five up do it but if you think it's me you're gonna have to live with your decisions how did you see him do it with my eyes in the dark get him out of i can't believe you didn't trust me until you're not voting i'm going to explain why this was incorrect okay it was a 50 50 there we had to vote five up here to split the tie yes i agree i agree ray but there was a kill and i was with you the entire time in the dark right so you are not with me what you're on the button we just won oh this round yeah but there's a kill hmm uh it feels so good you are so sick oh yeah imposter and crewmate thank you guys i don't know what happened me and toast not to do the 50-500 i that wasn't the impossible round thank you for the 20 gifted yeah as soon as you called it i was like never before received strategies i just didn't care and second it was like i saw and then five ups like i saw and you guys are like wait so i don't know how did you see like no one questions yeah i you know it happens and then there was no 50 50 either it was just like let's focus wait so do we are we against the 50 50 rule in general like what you're like but i'm like if you're gonna trust one person's word on it just his words  go for it also that wasn't even a 50 50 because i know it was you just killed an innocent person i don't know how it happened that was just i at least it was funny right yeah i'm happy you
