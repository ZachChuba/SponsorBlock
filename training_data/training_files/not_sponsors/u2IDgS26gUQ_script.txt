please gosh there's here's God the name Freddy Krueger is iconic he's at the top of the list with the greatest slasher horror villains of all time along with Leatherface Michael Myers Jason Voorhees Chucky and Ghostface with a career now spanning 35 years and after 9 films a TV show documentaries video games and comic books Freddy Krueger is still relevant across today's pop culture landscape making appearances in mortal combat dead by daylight Robot Chicken Rick and Morty and the Goldbergs who do you think you are in this video I'm going to examine the original Nightmare on Elm Street 7 film series dissecting what made the series work so well while also exploring the bad decisions and creative pitfalls that eventually led to its downfall culminating in the day and Nightmare on Elm Street died so much of the series lasting success comes from the original film that started it all a Nightmare on Elm Street in the midst of slasher popularity permeating the horror landscape since the 1970s with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween and into the 80s with Friday the 13th writer director Wes Craven was able to create a story that revolved around a unique concept with an original villain whereas most other slasher villains at the time wore dark drab colors and expressionless masks while wielding knives machetes or other weapons in order to kill their victims Freddy Krueger wore red and green striped sweater a fedora and of course his trademark metal clawed glove not only was his weapon unique but the way in which he killed his victims was unique as well Freddy didn't attack under the bed in the closet or at some cabin in the woods Freddy attacked his victims where there was no escape in their dreams and the fact that Freddy attacked while people slept watched the entire film and its subsequent entries in a dread of inevitability you can try drinking coffee or taking caffeine pills but there is no escape from it you have to sleep sometime it was a terrifying concept and perhaps one of the main reasons why Nightmare on Elm Street stood apart from other slasher series was because of Freddy Krueger's personality most other slasher villains hid their personalities behind a mask they became a menacing presence that stalked their victims and although the mask does add a sense of unknown which is scary in its own right it didn't particularly elevate the villains or differentiate them from one another Freddie never shied away from showing off his burned disfigured face he toyed with his victims like a cat playing with a mouse before the kill and so much of the character success came from actor Robert Englund he perfectly embodied the character bringing him to life and giving him so much of his personality through his demeanor and mannerisms as bad as the series became and later in trees and it did get bad Robert England's performances Freddy always made the nightmare movies at least watchable Wes Craven helped shape the tone and aesthetic of the film from behind the camera as well he employed the same creative tactic that Spielberg did with the shark in Jaws and Ridley Scott did with the xenomorph an alien by barely showing the monster on screen the unknown is far scarier than what we can see and that's a large reason why Freddy Krueger is only visible on screen for seven minutes of the original film when Freddy was shown it was through obscure close-ups and in shadows hinting at the terror and one of the main reasons why the original film still holds up so well after all these years is because of the fantastic practical effects Tina's death and Glen's death are highlights but even smaller effects like Freddy haunting Nancy in her bed and in the bathtub are simple but still very effective the only misstep of the entire film is probably the ending it was an incoherent ending that seemed to undo everything that came before it and that's exactly why Wes Craven hated the ending to Craven always envisioned nightmare as a single standalone film but president of New Line Cinema Bob Shaye insisted on a sequel teased I felt that the film should end when Nancy turns her back on Freddy and his violence that's the only thing that kills him Bob wanted to have Freddy pick up the kids in a car and drive off which reversed everything I was trying to say it suddenly presented Freddy as triumphant I came up with a compromise which was to have the kids get in the convertible and when the roof comes down we'd have Freddy's red and green stripes on it do I regret changing the ending I do because it's the one part of the film that isn't me the next year Bob Shaye got his wish with the release of a Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's revenge a film reviled by many fans because it's so disconnected from the rest of the series and for changing the rules of the world as opposed to killing in the dream world Freddy kills in the real world through possession of the mink director Jessie there's a particularly jarring scene near the end of the movie where Freddy runs around a pool party killing children besides one cool moment [Music] the rest of the scene isn't really scary at all and that's because what made Freddy scary in the first place was the unknown slight glances and hints obscured by darkness that makes him feel larger than life the towering presence that attacks us when were isolated and alone so to see him scurrying around a swimming pool with a bunch of teenagers who are taller than him made him look more silly than scary despite all these missteps I still actually enjoyed this film again the use of practical effects throughout the film is fantastic the scene were Freddy literally burst from Jesse's body is a triumph but besides that I really enjoyed watching the film because of its much publicized homoerotic subtext a subtext that apparently the cast and crew weren't aware of while making the film and the screenwriter only admitted two decades later Jesse played a role so often written as female in the slasher sub-genre that it has become known as the final girl or scream queen in the film Jessie struggles to repress something inside him that is trying desperately to get out people like to point out Jesse's dance scene when he goes to a gay bar the gym teacher tied up in the shower and whipped when Jessie runs away from his girlfriend to sleep with his friend something is trying to get inside my body yeah she's female and she's waiting for you in the Cabana and you want to sleep with me and all the high-pitched shrieks throughout the film now none of this is overtly mentioned in the script and the idea of paralleling repressed homosexuality with the murderous inclination is troubling when you think about it but watching the film with this subtextual lens helped elevate what would otherwise have been a mediocre bland horror movie into something interesting in never boring following up Freddy's revenge was the third entry in the series dream warriors the film was a return to form for the franchise with Wes Craven back in a writing capacity and Heather Langenkamp reprising her role as Nancy dream warriors did what all the best franchise sequels should do it added to the mythology without taking away anything that happened before while also managing to reintroduce past characters that we already cared about and balancing them with new characters that we ultimately cared about just as much and that's the best part about dream warriors the characters they're a diverse group with their own hopes fears strengths and weaknesses they're all the last remaining Elm Street children which gave Freddy a much needed motivation for his attacks in the dynamic between the children was changed as well these aren't unsuspecting children in high school classrooms the usual location that's often overplayed in the series these are children who have been through trauma coping and struggling to survive in a psychiatric hospital and they aren't passive victims they use Kristen's telekinetic powers in order to share the same dream discover their dream powers and fight back against Freddy after the group was able to successfully lay Freddy's bones to rest and Nancy had her sacrificial send-off it felt like definitive closure but after its biggest box office returns yet along with a growing fanbase New Line Cinema continued churning out more sequels the very next year on August 19th 1988 the fourth installment dream master was released and it's within the first act of dream master where a Nightmare on Elm Street died everything that made dream warriors so great the characters Freddy's motivation the closure was all undone at the beginning of dream master the three remaining Elm Street children Kristen who was recast Kincaid and Joey are still friends and happy that Freddy is gone for good but a series of bad dreams leads Kristen to believe that Freddy might be coming back later Kincaid as a dream his dog peace fire resurrecting Freddy's body and he's killed Joey he's killed in his waterbed and then Kristen has a goofy dream on a beach where Freddy does this before killing her too after building up the last remaining Elm Street Children and dream warriors they're killed so unceremoniously in dream master and this moment set off bad storytelling habits that rippled throughout the remainder of the franchise first Freddy wasn't scary anymore there were hints of this and dream warriors when Freddy's personality began to shine through more and more but dream warriors still managed to strike a fine balance however throughout dream master and dream child Freddy became goofier and goofier until he basically became Bugs Bunny in the sixth installment Freddy's dead the final nightmare the other bad habit set off in the first act of dream master was second the lack of motivation and interesting characters from the beginning of the series Freddy's entire motivation was to seek revenge on the children of the parents who killed him that clearly defined motivation made the first and third movie so engaging we understood why Freddy was doing what he was doing but once the last Elm Street child was killed off and dream master it just became killing for killing sake and that left us with boring uninteresting characters that were hard to root for and no semblance of a story to tie everything together the rest of the series just played out like final destination movies we're just waiting to see the creative ways these boring characters are going to get killed off that was really the only fun part about the later nightmare installments but that made for such boring and repetitive stories the strongest movies in the series were when it was less about the dreams and more about the characters but with each installment the dreams and Freddy took more and more of the focus and the film's were worse because of it when it seemed like the nightmare franchise was dead and buried Wes Craven peed fire on the grave of the franchise and resurrected it one less time with the film new nightmare the first nightmare film written and directed by Wes Craven since the original Wes tried to write many of the wrongs of the franchise by bringing back characters the audience cared about making Freddy series again providing motivation as to why Freddy is back and actually giving the characters a goal of how to stop him unfortunately the final product wasn't scary at all it's logged along for a majority of the film sporadic earthquakes eerie phone calls cracks in the walls and one creepy as hell kid but what the film left and scares it made up for it with an excellent meta concept that provided a commentary on fear fandom and the power of stories and even though the meta style of storytelling didn't necessarily work in new nightmare it paved the way for a new style of horror storytelling that would be perfected in scream the film was Craven would go on to make just two years later new nightmare wasn't able to save the franchise that had already been dead for years but with its multiple callbacks to the original film through kills characters and bits of dialogue it ended up being the perfect love letter to The Nightmare on Elm Street series its loyal fans and the lasting legacy it left behind this video Oak in order to get 10% off your first
