in a recent video we gamed on the first 8k consumer display and the conclusion we came to was that given all the hoops we had to jump through to get any more than 30 Hertz working at 8k pretty much wasn't worth the hassle and we were gonna have to wait for this technology to become practical but then sharp electronics watch to that video and basically said hey it really shouldn't be that difficult to get it working all you need is the right TV so their commercial display group sent over this charts 70-inch a KTV that actually utilizes not one not two not three but four concurrent HDMI connections to achieve true 8k 60 Hertz functionality supposedly with no hassle whatsoever well I have a way of creating hassle where no hassle existed before so I truly wish them luck with that it's honeycomb slash LTT did I mention it's free [Music] step number one stand it's the easy part step number D power cable still easy it's dumb numbers right get a mean DC powerful enough to run 8k step 4 introduce Andy who just cleared his probation you don't have to duck from the camera anymore dude alright do you want to give me a hand with this oh so ha let's go ahead and I'm gonna tip it your way so we're gonna put the stand on with it upside down okay do you want to grab that screwdriver it's okay I got this you can you can trust me he thinks I might drop it gotta say the packing for this is definitely more rudimentary I think this is like a demo unit for sending to potential commercial customers or something there's no I don't even think there was a remote in the box it's a really clean looking TV very little branding got your Sharp logo over here ah quotes and then you've just got eight k76 80 by 40 320 pixels baby okay here we go now these HDMI cables are nothing special but theoretically each one of them is only carrying a 4k 60 signal which should be fine just fine except for one small problem no modern graphics card contains more than usually one or two HDMI connections now we tried a solution a little while ago where we used for graphics cards in a Quadro mosaic display thing to drive quadrants of a monitor it didn't work at all it was super stupid performance sucked but fortunately adapters to the rescue so these are active DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapters that I acquired for that failed project and I am hoping to finally see some success with today so we're gonna get these bad boys plugged in oh wait oh I had this totally wrong before so when I pointed at the HDMI ports before that was completely wrong the HDMI ports I wanted were down here so these are all just individual normal HDMI ports this is a single input input seven 8k signal input and it's got like cable management clips for and all that shiz so just like that experiment with each separate graphics card running a different quadrant of the display this display does split input seven into quadrants but unlike that one we're using a single graphics card with its single frame buffer in order to drive all four quadrants or rather I should say we're using two in SLI but they're all hooked up to a single one so we don't need any kind of external synchronization card or anything like that it thought should theoretically just work believe it or not this is how they usually run like future panel technology demos at trade shows like CES except instead of actually building them into a real commercialized product they just do it on like a crazy hand soldered thing that sits under the curtain that looks great I'm like feeling the what is it what was it Mac sell or something Memorex but you know that classic commercial but now take KK me no signal from external device hey bottom right grab the signal holy it's on the whole display now hold on a minute no way there's no way it's gonna just run a ke effortlessly okay one of them is running at 50 Hertz why would that be and how would that work that's bizarre why would anyone want that one running at 50 and the others running at 60 okay let's have it let's have a quick boo here so we need to grab some games we're gonna get that going but in the meantime know this did not quite work perfectly out of the box and I do think we have a little bit of configuration to do so let's start by figuring out which one of these is broken I suspect the one that's running at 50 Hertz but only one way to find out for oh man that wasn't it oh boy oh boy okay maybe just enter will do it no of course not did it oh boy what is Oh he's dead Jim this isn't even working in the BIOS now this is more broken than it was when we started I have a way of creating hassle where no hassle existed before okay so it's running but still not correctly however before we move forward I've got a bit of an update for you guys as it turns out at least one of the problems we had was caused by invidious seemingly arbitrary limitation on their consumer graphics cards that only allows you to set up an end the surround configuration with a maximum of three displays so this system is out and my test bench is in so we've hooked this up with 2gb 100 Quadro graphics cards these have 32 gigs of ram over 5,000 cuda cores in terms of their gaming performance they shouldn't be that far off something like an RT X 2080 I mean they're not quite there but they're certainly closer to that than they are to attend a DTI then we ran into another problem remember how I had three of these DisplayPort to HDMI adapter z' well these cards only have DisplayPort outputs so I had to use DisplayPort to DVI DVI to HDMI and then that to the TV so while we are actually running an Nvidia mosaic configuration here and we can see that if we pull up the Nvidia control panel and theoretically when we go to manage GPU utilization here we're running an SLI but the SLI menu item went away once we configured mosaic and it doesn't appear that our second GPU is actually doing anything for now this is what we're stuck with though and damn it I want to see 8k so we've got another one of these DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and you guys are coming with me for the ride of even if the performance sucks finally getting an 8k output here all right once these are numbered oh I see that's a new one I have literally never seen it do that before okay sure why not remember windows 95 guys remember you know who I really feel bad for and all this is sharp they reach out to go yeah you really shouldn't have to jump through a bunch of stupid hoops to get 8k 60 Hertz going on a PC and as far as I can tell none of this is their fault but this is an awful lot of stupid hoops okay so I know set up multiple displays is not the mosaic configuration thing but the reason that I set all this up correctly was that I was hoping that now when we go to set up mosaic it'll kind of grab that everything is the way it's supposed to be and it'll work come on okay well it's letting me click Next and that's correct okay let's try the other graphics card I don't know I did notice that even though we're plugged into the one that would normally be in the primary slot on the motherboard it's identifying as GPU - so who knows maybe this will help there's more lunch frankly I'm pretty close to the end of my rope I was doing some off-screen troubleshooting involving trying older Quadros so GP 100's instead of the GV 100's I did a full platform swap and so motherboard CPU change them out just meowed but I don't know and it's always the same thing I click apply it goes little bit little bit yet and then there's no finish but I do not accept that conclusion and I have decided to try one last thing we're gonna go AMD ok so according to this community post it's possible but I think I know why it might not be where okay I think it might just be grabbing my configuration from Windows and then assuming that I want a four by one okay your display configuration has been updated re-enable Eyefinity display group know why the fact that it's rien a below is what's tripping me out here I don't want to re-enable it I want to enable a new different one that is not like what I had before I don't know how to start fresh when I disable it and it only prompts me to re-enable it just AMD things easy Nvidia things oh it's not working to be clear neither of them is giving me a working 60 Hertz a katehis way well other than the boneheaded driver limitation that doesn't allow me to arrange it in a 2x2 this was a much better experience but due to the boneheaded driver implementation that doesn't let me arrange it in a 2x2 I guess we're going back to our next best lead which is Quadro to see if maybe we can get that to work it's been a few more hours and a lifeline has arrived we now have Oh No if they only shipped two I'm gonna be so upset on two no there's four okay the good news though I also reached out to sharp and I was like what tables did you guys use to get this working because they assured me it would be no problem piece of cake piece of crumb cake and they said they got these cables from PC cable world I guess so these are DisplayPort to HDMI cables rather than adapters theoretically that is exactly the same thing at this point I don't know if I know anything anymore if this doesn't work I'm officially stumped here we go one two Wow okay that did grab 4k 60 Hertz on all four of them really fast you have got to be kidding me [Laughter] so after all that I we could do four times 4k but heaven forbid we want to run them in mosaic on Nvidia with adapters on AMD we could do four by one at 4k but heaven forbid we want to rearrange them like this wait what like stop stop don't do it like whatever you're changing now control panel stop changing it because everything is working this is right stop stop changing things finish finish how could I just could I just kill the task I wonder if I can just kill the task Nvidia control panel and task it worked 100% scaling show me that native a K baby Wow 60 Hertz a K there it is launching a No so what eight K max draw distance the game wouldn't even launch but we've got it at full medium 8k but there's bad news too it drops to 30 frames per second in the menu when it sits at 60 at the main menu this does not bode well for performance wow this is so like disorienting sitting this close to the city one of the issues with this game's interface in general and we're back so one of the problems that I have with this game in general is that you can't zoom the interface out far enough and I especially feel it like this cuz sitting this close to it honestly is very comfortable in terms of the detail of the game like even at the maxim level let's go ahead and find one of our wood cutters again here this guy walking is cow that is unfreaking believable I don't even have anti-aliasing on I have zero anti-aliasing on right now can you believe that Renan will not look nuts and that's crazy I love it so that was it for a no now we're firing up shadow of the Tomb Raider to see how a like a third-person adventure game feels at 8k so far pretty good I mean it's obviously not running great we're looking at about 7 to 20 fps in menu and that's reported by fraps that's clearly not even accurate wow the hair and this is with no anti-aliasing is incredible huh actually in motion it's not nearly as convincing part of that could be the 19 frame per second performance though you know say what you will about Nvidia r-tx and the performance impact and all that but you've got our respect Nvidia for recognizing that resolution is no longer the biggest bottleneck in gaming image quality and just trying something anything else because sitting at a reasonable distance like yeah that looks crisp AF but is it really that much better than 4k that does look real sharp though pardon the pun so there you go guys about 15 grand worth of graphics horsepower we're looking at 20 FPS average pretty thick let's see how many FPS we get in rocket League hey Riley you want to play rocket League for me help me Riley play at 8k whoa it's an 8k yeah it's a keyboard working hold on there you go there you go whoa like it's one thing being this close to like a huge TV like this but it is like actually sharp oh yeah is it a sharp TV yeah like everything down to the treadle like you can really tell that the the video crowd is just balls yeah it looks so sharp I have never seen this game with this good so could you get into playing on a big screen like this size at this kind of resolution I think I could get into it yeah probably so I guess that's pretty much the conclusion of this video is it K cool yeah really freakin cool it's glitchy right now and we don't have the performance that we need for it to run its best but when it works man is that incredible now I don't think that sitting this close to a TV in order to appreciate the extra sharpness that 8k provides is necessarily practical but that doesn't mean that in applications like VR where the display is much closer to your eyes and you really need that resolution so you don't get a screen door effect that it won't be an incredible difference maker moving forward we just need much more powerful graphics cards and obviously some work on the software side but with the whole you know not wanting to crash all the time and all that speaking of not below at drop com so thanks for
