what's up everybody I'm Brian from I'm on Tesla and today we're gonna be testing out stop sign and stoplight feature in the new update for Model S xy3 and future cars yeah we blew through that stop sign quite a bit it's way back there right now it's a beta so we're gonna be testing this out to see what weird things we can find so I'm gonna be doing a lot of stop signs probably and some weird traffic lights and some weird traffic situations that you wouldn't really see too much because this is supposed to be city streets but first off I'm gonna test autopilot like I've always tested on that windy road by my house there is a change I did it yesterday and I was totally surprised at the very end I've always said there's no way it's gonna make that turn but it actually did huge change for autopilot and the tesla team or the autopilot team let's get to it alright so we're all set up here I've got you staring at my beautiful face and my hair my Quarantine hair sorry for that I'm blaming it on quarantine but I cut my own hair so I really don't have an excuse anyway we're gonna be off and we're gonna be on the same road I always test autopilot on we're gonna do 25 miles an hour because there is some construction here a lot of houses being built around here in Mooresville and as you can see right here Road under construction now we're going to get up to speed put it in autopilot 25 miles an hour focusing on the road and we get to see exactly what the car the - we'll see and what the car will see and it does really good here we get really close to this mailbox right up here not sure if we're gonna hit it going 25 miles an hour we shouldn't they'll be really close that is very close but we did not hit it this turn is a little squirrelly sometimes but there is a truck off the side of the road so I'm gonna have to take over but I wonder what's gonna happen here it slows down and I didn't feel comfortable with that but but right back into autopilot and it just does just fine through this section here the major section that I want to point out to you is at the end of this and it's never done this before this is part of the stop sign and stoplight scenarios in the new update 2020 12.6 I think I can't remember exactly but right now it's already showing 500 feet there is a stop sign but it is a blind turn it doesn't see that it just knows it from GPS right now it's 200 feet and it's slowing down it's never done this before it's always blown through this intersection here at 30 miles an hour but right now it freaks out because it's too much of a turn too much of a turn for the car so very interesting on what it did there it's very very good on what the car can do right now but I think it's not it doesn't have the full turns yet so red hands popped up that's going to be triggered to test though right away so they can review that section and that's gonna get better on the next update that's happened before in the past where the car actually went off the road towards oncoming traffic and within a week they had a fix and it worked just fine there so now we are just in cruise control so we can see that the stop signs and stoplights will still work just in cruise control I'll bump it up to 25 miles an hour through here and I'm steering right now so I'm paying attention to the road obviously because I'm driving but the car is going to be taking care of all the speed and the stoplights right there it shows 500 feet there is a stop sign so it's it knows that there's a stop sign up here even in this private neighborhood maybe because I've been I Drive around here a lot but it's gonna come to the stop for me 50 feet there's no line but we're pretty far from it that's let's think if it's pretty far where I would have to creep up to here to really see up the hill to make sure there's no cars coming that's something that Tesla should work on let's see if it stays too far away again it looks like it is stopping too far away from the stop sign which probably is a distance that needs to that needs to happen but when you creep up it takes over it's not not perfect yet coming up to another stop sign see if it does really good because this is a main road that's actually pretty good all we have to do is tap the accelerator now I just tapped it and not my foots completely off of it and it's taking off for me a little stuttery but it's taking off for me 25 miles an hour through here again to the dead end wonder what happens wonder if it knows that it's a dead end and is it going to freak out oh yeah we're just gonna go in people's driveways so that's something they'll fix as well so let's head over to this weird stop sign let's see what happens we're going to be heading down to the marina or the boat launch that I always go to and there is a handmade sign a handmade stop sign it's made out of wood and kind of want to see what happens with this car when it comes to that point now we are coming in kind of hot here I'm slowing down for this and there is the stop sign what's it gonna do oh my gosh we actually stopped right at it from very quickly that's pretty impressive actually because last night when I came through here at 20 miles an hour I blew through it and that stop sign was in the back at the back wheel so that's pretty good maybe it's learning maybe it's not I don't know but let's try that again a little faster maybe or actually let's do 40 let's uh let's see what happens a little faster yeah we blew through that stop sign quite a bit it's way back there that's a good car lengths in between but it did stop so actually we would have stopped right in the middle of an intersection here let's go down to 25 this is probably a 25 mile an hour road here and right away it pops up 300 feet 300 feet again so it should stop I don't see an issue I'm gonna hover over maybe maybe there's an issue okay it stopped directly right at it that's actually really good but I do still have to pull up just to see if there's any cars again another main road here it does just fine just in cruise control so this is really nice this should stop this should stop with no issues at all actually stops with major issue because I'm so far back I can't see the road here I'm going to completely blocked hopefully Tesla's full self-driving doesn't do this because then it's not going to know what to do it's gonna have to creep up to here a full car one and a half car lengths just to see where the traffic is and this is a major thing for Tesla how is it going to know to make a right turn or not there's no cameras facing directly that way how is it going to know if there's a clear path for it to go let's go in a neighborhood where the houses are a lot closer together so there's a lot more streets around and see what it does with those stop signs and those roads can we get an autopilot will it go around cars and autopilot what's going to happen I don't know do you if you know you're probably a Tesla engineer say there's a this is a good one the stop sign is being blocked by a truck and the car knows there's a stop sign there probably because of GPS but I wonder if we're gonna stop correctly we can't get an autopilot that was a stick around over you can't get an autopilot but wonder if we're still gonna stop in the right spot whoa jeez that was a little brake check and it knows where the stop sign is interesting stop signs right over there and it stops just fine let's give it a little throttle and let's go this way because the garbage man is over there it's stuttering through the intersection and again it knows there's a stop sign right up here 100 feet 75 50 feet 25 zero so very good it's done very very well see what it does lines should stop for the stop sign whoa goodness gracious all right so what will it do auto pilot unable to proceed please take over very interesting what if I put a turn signal on will it turn oh it won't turn 40 miles an hour see if I those two that is it's I'm going over the line so it's it stops pretty hard but it stops away in front of it again this is actually really good for the first iteration of a beta stopping at stop signs and stoplights you know it's good just gonna get better from here and what other company can often can give this to somebody for free what other company can give this to their customers for free well I guess not for free if you've paid for full self driving this is part of it but this is an update that just happens to come out this is pretty remarkable technology you know there's always steps back when you do when you push out new things but there's great things in this update that counteracts some of the negatives some of the negatives right now on these side roads this side road right now it used to be I could go 50 miles an hour when the speed limit is 45 now it's keeping me at a max of 45 miles an hour that kind of sucks but there's things that are great about this and things like I said things that are negative so we have to take the good with the bad of course you don't have to do this you don't have to enable this but you're helping Tesla if you do enable this all every time the hands pop up when you're taking when you have to take over control that data goes directly to Tesla and the autopilot team takes a look at all those data points on why it happened that way they look at the camera feed and find out how to make it better and the more you use this the better you help the faster you're helping full soft driving get to everyone and get safer for everyone so as always stay awesome stay positive stay safe and I'll catch you on the next one see ya
