late 1500s there was a dastardly woman named countess Elizabeth Bathory this crazy lady with her Game of Thrones ass name was biting children and full sending their blood also ironically enough the countess Elizabeth Bathory has a lot to do with my next video which is a movie review can you guess [Music] huh stay alive is a film from 2007 that is apparently touted as Disney's one and only slasher film that was definitely my first take don't you say [ __ ] Disney's only slasher film an interesting title to say the least but nothing really too shocking besides Disney owns everything so I don't even entirely believe that statement but it makes for a hell of a clickbait so it's it's definitely true also I'm not a white supremacist just in case you're curious this is just a thing it's an emoji for [ __ ] sake I've always remembered this movie I'm not entirely sure why keep in mind this movie is this old coming soon to theatres something tells me I remember it because this movie was about pork pork yes this movie is entirely focused around a video game and as you can imagine this was a time where people envision gamers to look like this so to all the real [ __ ] gamers out there I want you to go and get your arthritis compression gloves get your gamma ray blue light blocking gaming glasses and let's [ __ ] get sloppy voice also don't forget the gamers upsets crucial the movie stay alive is not ashamed to be what it actually is because the movie begins with a jump scare no no you don't understand me not the first scene the first second of the movie is a jump scare roll the clip [Music] this movie is actually very different from the other horror movies I've reviewed at least aggravating for sure I've reviewed movies like the nun Laird onna to blockbusters that are just [ __ ] boring the hatred Ouija too convoluted dog piles going nowhere American poltergeist ooh a rents worth a budget low hanging fruit it's bad and only backed by passion and then we have stay alive which seems like it would be far from a passion project because it kind of comes off as a cash grab at an emerging gaming industry and I really can't explain it but upon my first revisit to this movie I believe there was passion behind this project I just think this movie is so silly and extremely fun to make fun of Loomis here is a video game beta tester playing this new underground game stay alive and this game is probably the best part of the movie as we obviously get a lot of cutscene like gameplay and constantly mix the two worlds the graphics were pretty good for the time and the concept was pretty cool too I wanted to play when I was younger and I still wanted to play it now even though I'm kind of a [ __ ] with this stuff it was a horror slash survival game that seemed to give you so much freedom and plane in fact when revisiting this I thought they did release a game with it because that would make sense but they didn't which just doesn't make sense kind of a missed opportunity I mean if the salt franchise can [ __ ] out a game I'm sure these guys could have pinched out a dingle barrier to this game but I get it for those kinds of things you know you need money Lumis dies while playing the game and since he's so jacked up on ninja juice he's anxious and frightened he tried phoning his buddy hutch to come over but unfortunately he leaves him hanging actually let's rewind a bit hold on after getting a little spooked Loomis goes to check on his roommate [ __ ] man don't you knock whoa I dudes going ham I guess the feminists are right men are pigs what the [ __ ] is this furry play on a budget is this jigsaws prequel is this what gets you off lady [ __ ] bebop why he keeps his [ __ ] steady wink I had read that the Unrated director's cut was the better version of this movie so I bought it watched it and it showed this guy's bare ass for a few seconds that's literally the only difference in the two cuts no bother watching it for yourself for trying to do any research trust me and the theatrical cut is so baffling to me because it leaves out so much basically vital details and also small bits that would make certain scenes not seem so abrupt and choppy granted there are some scenes that yes should have never existed come granted there are some scenes that yes should have never existed aka hutch bring in this chick toilet paper for like two minutes just tell her you wish you were the toilet paper lomis starts getting spooked and two minutes later these two are slaughtered Loomis tries to call PETA but instead becomes a new chandelier and dies the same exact way he died in the game back to hutch who has a generic ass job with a boss who is also a hard this is April Wood who is a very important person to my life she's my ex-girlfriend of many many years and she was really great in the part that's Adam Goldberg my ex-girlfriend many years many years thank you what Hutch's at the funeral TMZ over here is taking snapshots for the forums on best score but she's cute so it's okay however if that's not an invitation to get punched in the face I don't know what is these two don't know each other hutch is grieving over his best friend's brutal murder and also posting up on someone's gravesite but whatever this dweeb comes over with her extendo viewfinder to capture his heartbreak and then she laughs our night quirky dead friends am i right can't live with them have to live without him my name is Abigail Lewis's little sister gives hutch Loomis's video games as remembrance and Hutch heads to the hardcore sorry is that getting annoying I'll stop doing that it is here where hutch meets up with his girlfriend which took me way too long to realize was a thing seriously though they don't even kiss on the mouth they share the same level of intimacy as she does with her brother her brother Phineas is by far the best character in this movie he's the saint gamer and I could easily see myself being severely annoyed by somebody else playing this role Timmy Simpson is having fun and it translates beautifully holy [ __ ] [ __ ] really Phineas sparks up a lighter and we learned that Hutch is basically the Hound from Game of Thrones without all the charming characteristics by the way speaking a game of Thrones I'm just saying she'd lay off the incensed sister have you ever met anybody in your life who wears these types of hats that are productive members of society how she's terrified a fire because of an incident in his past and he's supposed to go through his character our curry overcomes his here a fire but he honestly kind of doesn't in the end not sure what the mind said there was but I guess how can you have faith in somebody who desecrates tombstones friends owns their own girlfriend and washes their Solo cups you guys want to know what's scarier than a game killing people IRL I'm sorry what are you Chris Hanson's new decoy this outfit here is designed by predators for predators Loreena men's since 2007 Malcolm in the diddle the whole gangs here for lamb Party to play the game that just killed their friend even their new morbid paparazzi friend joins Abigail said mama girl has got body karate going on and you look like you so dialed merchandise on Venice Beach shut up dog can we just play already I got the gamer subsidy I'm ready to go Frankie I know you need some of this with your frail ass come on this video was sponsored by gamers subs instead of an ad read I wanted to take the time to tell you that I am now an official partner of GG subs focus on that [ __ ] GG sub boys got GG trademarked on the front we're [ __ ] made for each other GG sub says G fields top competitor and let me tell you this I already see your comments below saying damn GG you couldn't get G fuel but at least you got these guys maybe one day you'll get an offer from G fuel and you're right in fact that one day already passed when I officially became a partner of GG subs I had two offers on the table one from GG subs and one from G fuel and if you've seen some of my past videos or you've kept up with my social media you know that I wanted to work with G fuel and there they were just sitting in my inbox waiting for a response but after speaking to GG subs learning about the product tasting the product firsthand hearing out the vision I made my decision and I just want to emphasize it I did not settle for GG subs I [ __ ] chose GG subs and the products [ __ ] great Organic caffeine keto friendly diabetic friendly doesn't have multiple decsion another should I can't pronounce like [ __ ] G fuel do you want to help support me the channel our sponsor try it for your [ __ ] self and get 10% off your order using code Mista GG the links are below and i'm also giving away free sample packs at the end of the video love you guys I mentioned earlier how the theatrical cut really screws up some scenes here's a minor example of that this size doesn't matter never played a third-person shooter you're know it's very well possible that I might just be a [ __ ] idiot but this joke is just not set up well so some of you might be sitting there thinking I don't get that joke why don't I get that joke fun fact turns out you have to watch the director's cut for that joke to make sense that's great you know anyone who says size doesn't matter never played a third-person shooter can I have a 42-inch sure you know I like the big ones per usual that's too much information I love how she has the audacity to suggest that his penis has ever even looked in her direction try getting the table lips down before you move south so this gang of true gamers with their marshallers earmuffs and receptionist headsets start up stay alive but are stuck on the opening screen maybe you're supposed to read that voice-activated no way that's next-generation technology hey Siri tell Frankie Muniz he was right did you mean Frank no sorry messages constant messages at the moment turns out the game is voice-activated so they all repeat this seance to start the game and the spooky narrator aka detective Hoffman starts talking about the countess Elizabeth Bathory interscope Forge and I briefly brought up Elizabeth báthory in an old video really to just comedic ly segue into the topic of the video where this guy drinks piss to stay youthful I know long story but some people in the comments were genuinely upset because I kind of got her story wrong I said she drank the blood of little girls but apparently she just bathed in their blood and bit their flesh sometimes - I know I was way off if he didn't know she apparently had slain hundreds of women I'm talking real torturous [ __ ] and just because I saw the comments on that video yes I read that these could be false claims that were politically motivated do I give a [ __ ] no I'm watching a gamer movie starring Frankie Muniz dressed up as preppy be red it's not that deep the point of all that was to tell you that stay alive s villain is Elizabeth báthory you guys feel that hell yeah feel it in my pants once again Phineas is the only break we get from these things on the couch I mean hutch our main character really has no defining characteristics he's really just a glue that brings everybody together today Frankie's the geek head guys the goofball these two women are women and one's a gamer so the point of the game was to discover the secret in this house and stay alive kill what you can and use roses to protect yourself from the dead how about somebody do something Swank those classic 2007 gamers literally just shootin a crossbow but what's right there is something about wardrobe Oh oh nice eye yeah that one was a real tough II to spot out unis 2020 vision to spot that [ __ ] glowstick party in Narnia Hutch's boss who's also gaming with them dies in the game and also looks like a coked-out club owner from miami ii fun fact of this video I didn't see the director's cut before writing that line in the director's cut spoken like a true veteran coke sniffer okay where's the torture chamber cuz I want some ass I don't know I mean I went through a secret entrance you know Frankie shouldn't you be more over there like closer this way I'm worried about there so like I said Miller dies in the game despite the button mashing on his game chair did anybody actually ever own one of these after so many chests air fumes they decide to pack it up and regroup tomorrow the boss man is feeling a little on edge and certain to see [ __ ] I love [ __ ] like that that was funny trying to beat your chest and out spook the unknown - since taking off so even though Adam Goldberg can be a very talented comedic actor and honestly a massive lob for this movie's monotony with their less interesting characters they kill him off because he had better things to do in 2006 like working on the show Joey the Joey show the friend spin-off you've never heard of I love the cover of this by the way it's like yeah I don't know why they did this either Miller died just like he died in the game by the way just in case you forgot that's a thing through this whole sequence of events we can talk about cliches for days but I still can't get mad at this film and I'm saying that right before a scene that has 19 things wrong with it HUD shows up to work with his bummy self and casually walks into this murder investigation now I'm not sure if they would cut off access to the entire building if somebody was murdered or on the 24th floor but chances are you at least be cut off from the 24th floor I don't think you guys get how funny this is random man with tie almost begrudgingly enters an active crime scene his coworker shoves his poor guy just trying to help to the side and then random man with tie just floats to the front lines of this homicide and after Hutch yells out that he had just talked to him the night before he's immediately a suspect in the murder case by the way these guys are the least convincing detectives and I love it so much oh no Carl Winslow and Walton Goggins are gonna interrogate me [ __ ] I'm screwed thank you shut the [ __ ] up also adding to my how the hell were these two dating question hutches girlfriend sparks up her lighter just a foot away from hutch because I guess she forgot he has PTSD hutch begins to think that the murders are linked with the game so he rushes back to the gamer cafe just in case you know my god hold on what are the [ __ ] names of these guys Finn hutch and Swink Brad dave and Chester not gamer enough for you and let's not forget Loomis and Miller which sounds like a department store Finn Hutchins swing sound like phase members ladies and gentlemen you know what time it is it's that moment where all the idiot nonbeliever friends all experience the paranormal at the same time and later regroup as believers great great stuff right there movies write themselves movies write themselves movies write themselves this type of stuff sucks if stay alive was more of this I would probably carry much more disdain for this movie the most shocking thing through all of these scenes is that they sell Red Bull for a dollar I'm guessing because Red Bull gives you wings like an angel it kills you is what off code mr. G G all one word here's another fan favorite when [ __ ] Joe Schmo becomes a hacker overnight this scene was so boring that the crew was like let's throw this [ __ ] in here yeah yeah that's good this did not age well so I don't know if the version I bought of this movie has been tampered with at all but I keep getting these weird audio drops where the audio just gets abruptly cut off it sounds like how the background noise sounds in some of my skits the movies perfectly watchable but you don't need to be wearing one of these to hear the audio fuck-ups throughout hello by the way this is one of those scenes I'm glad wasn't in the theatrical cut because there's no reason you two should have such easy access to your recently slain boss's office at midnight also change out of your work clothes lady gross unfortunately we have now arrived at this scene where Finn died these old town row memes are really getting out of hand the editing choices for the remainder of this scene are jarring there's multiple cuts through Finn sister discovering that her brother is dead and it makes this scene so incredibly choppy and comical but I don't want to keep [ __ ] on stay alive from a technical standpoint because obviously not their strong suit but you so when you die in the game you die in real life have you guys gotten that by now the problem is that Finn didn't play so it seems as if the game was playing itself hutch tries explaining the plot of the movie to the cops and they're dismissive [ __ ] like oh that's crazy talk you're nuts yet no one is even second-guessing the guy who got ran over by a horse carriage big Amish population around here fellas why are we okay with this homicide by hoof lanky douche bag decides to play for 30 seconds even though swing tells him not to and he dies in the game and I don't know if you guys still don't understand how this works but look I already told you I'm telling you friend or no friend game or no game next time I see you on a crime scene I'm gonna be forced to take you when you feel young I wonder how you would feel if that was your friend under that sheet damnit detective can't you see that family matters [ __ ] your brother was the one dying to play it bazinga it was really his fault and if you're gonna try to disperse the blame Loomis's little sister gave hutch the game to begin with that's just really stupendous I know we all know it something's happening something bad wait shut the hell up frankie muniz reaction shots or what I live for so Slenderman goes to his local videogame store to learn more about stay alive let me guess the wife and kids are driving you nuts you look like you're from that 80 show anyways none of this matters Longman dies [Music] the same way he did in the game hutch gives the backstory as to why he hates fire and it turns out that his dad thought his mom was hauling around so he just lit the house on fire the last movie I reviewed also refer to charred parents it's like my movie reviews have their own shared universe the FTF you now these are the scenes that are completely cut out of the theatrical cut Hutchins Abigail actually find the creator of stay alive and questioned them about it but he's not really anyhow so he sends them to the author of a book about the countess and they question her and her toddler country accent is boring as all hell so they just come back to the theatrical cut cost dispatch vowed that she would be whereas it worked and she promised when that day came down upon me I'm sorry lady I cannot take you serious when you [ __ ] sound like this it's a weird battle in my head these scenes fill in a lot of cracks of information but they're also eight minutes that I have to forward through every time because holy [ __ ] is it boring so they finally discover the game is playing itself and Finn's sister is front and center while she's having a smoke outside maybe there aren't any rules her name's [ __ ] October so uh October takes her Columbus Day ass into the dark construction site alone after seeing a dead girl on there and I know this is classic horror movie logic but your brother just died you should be the most cautious out of everybody here [ __ ] month Socktober had discovered the way to kill Elizabeth was by putting three nails in her heart neck and forehead and then burning her blood that's why she's clutching a nail gun here but surprise you can't hit ghosts some of you didn't Bob Chandler's at pokemon tower and it shows I'm not gonna say this movie is a jump scare fest but it definitely has the most unique lineup of jump scares October lets off a one-liner before she's a flat liner and after this gruesome death after her quasi boyfriend balls in agony abigail is like hey I'm homeless and I gotta say what a sneaky [ __ ] hutch is somewhat girlfriend just died and you somehow made it all about you he still has her fresh blood on his hands listen I can't believe that she sliced her neck open like black forest ham and speaking of forest that Bush is actually my futon the remaining gang go to the game developers address and it's the same exact mansion from the game pretty obvious it for a site but it takes our detectives here a couple minutes Swink goes in game remote to help him out and all that really changes here in terms of the cuts is that abigail finds the body of the game developer - and it doesn't explain that edit portion away but that's fine we're almost done we hold up elizabeth is bad Oh spicy [ __ ] I hope you guys nail her they get real ballsy at the end with what they can get away with because swing drops a crowbar in the game and it appears in real life right by hutch and I don't want to go through the trouble of explaining why that doesn't make sense or how that could have been utilized to it insane potential there's no need the only thing that can help you out right now is quality Frankie Muniz dialogue guys alright sweet you will never convince me that Frankie Muniz did not improvise that line god bless and so now we really get to kind of mirror or not mirror but you know blend game world and reality tour you could see like how far this can be taken you know what even if it doesn't make a lot of sense it's still fun so kiss our ass and this swing starts getting [ __ ] with he makes a run for it gets caught up in hutch and Abigail find him dead in the game so I guess r.i.p every character I even kind of gave a [ __ ] about who's left uh Hutchins Abigail used roses IRL to protect themselves until they find the corpse of Elizabeth they get split up and as a sacrificial gesture touch gives Abigail his final rose to protect herself and his thank you she starts suckling on his middle finger and considering he's gotten no action with October he's [ __ ] red-hot starts rubbing his dick against the door and [ __ ] I'm telling you the director's cut is weird Elizabeth chains up Abigail hutch crucifies er but forgets the burner like an idiot but it's a good thing that elizabeth can't stand product placement hutch brings fire to the room any cowards like a little [ __ ] trapped in the fire he created it's obvious that hutch is gonna die if only swink was still alive he could have sent his character in the room and dropped him some courage that's why I don't take him seriously as a character he reverts back to square one and the only reason he even survives is because big dick Nunez is still alive I mean I know they'll say this part is supposed to be the moment where he overcomes his fear but yeah I'm not giving that one of you you guys have already gotten away with way too much PS Frankie's 5 5 but he's 6 2 in my heart well you actually gave this guy another scene he gets a shipment of stay alive games at the end of the movie and now everybody is gonna repeat that seance and everybody's gonna die this guy's name is fidget by the way I learned that shortly after like I said I watched the theatrical cut and then I watched the director's cut and for my final viewing I watched it with directors commentary and it's just two goofballs talking about all the restrictions they had making this movie some of the time they were the ones beating me to the punch line in their commentary it's a director William Brent Bell and writer Matthew Peterman and they can both sit there and laugh at their own movie but they still love it it's their baby makes sense I said it from the beginning they had fun making it I had a lot of fun making fun of it I hope you had fun Washington if you guys enjoyed
