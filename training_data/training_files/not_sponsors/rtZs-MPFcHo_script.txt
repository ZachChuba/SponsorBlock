back in 2016 scientists at a recycling plant in Kyoto in Japan discovered a mysterious sludge that seemed to be engulfing a huge pile of plastic bottles that had been left in the yard outside the facility it look like the growth was actually feeding on the plastic itself which was pretty weird because as far as science was concerned the stuff that these bottles was made from a polymer called polyethylene terephthalate or PT was pretty much indestructible in nature I imagine the thoughts racing through the scientists mind were not unlike those that Alexander Fleming experienced when he came back to his lab after a summer holiday and noticed he'd rather clumsily left the petri dish open containing a bacterium he'd been working on called Staphylococcus the exposed bacterium looked like it was being consumed by some sort of fungus and Fleming realized that nature might just have gifted him something of great significance in Fleming's case of course it turned out he'd accidentally discovered penicillin which did prove to be really quite significant indeed in the case of the Japanese scientist at the recycling plant what they'd stumbled across was yet another example of nature's astonishing ability to overcome just about anything in the evolutionary struggle for life the mystery sludge was in fact a microorganism containing a bacterium that are adapted to digest the plastic down into its constituent parts using the carbon content as an energy source the potential impact of this adaptation was not lost on the Japanese scientists um because they were scientists they decided to give this new bacterium the fantastically snappy name of idea Nellis Sakai ANSYS it is what was wrong with romper stomper plastic Chomper hello and welcome to just ever think polyethylene terephthalate was regarded as a triumph of human ingenuity when de Pont started marking it as mylar back in 1951 up until then plastic manufacturers have been struggling to find a material that could replace the heavy and expensive glass bottles that we use for drinks like colas and other soldiers they were already making plastic bottles but if those bottles were filled with carbonated drinks and left on the shelf for more than a few days the carbon dioxide gas molecules escaped through the polymer walls and the drinks went flat so customers were complaining and sales were suffering the structure of p80 effectively reduces the gap in the polymer chain to a size that's smaller than a carbon dioxide molecule the result was a lightweight transparent tough plastic bottle that kept fizzy drinks fizzy the consequence of that was that sales doubled during the first few years after PT was introduced and those sales numbers kept on going up and up so much so that in 2016 480 billion plastic bottles would produce globally only about 7% of them are actually recycled to perform the same function twice about half of them get down cycled into something less valuable like fibers for clothing or flooring and the rest end up in landfill or waterways this chart from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation shows the growth in plastic production reaching more than 300 million metric tons by 2014 about 8 million tons of that plastic is now floating around in our oceans out there in the wild as this graphic from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows us plastic bottles can hang around for as much as 450 years and the plastic never goes away completely of course it just degrades into smaller and smaller micro plastics that get ingested by sea life and then passed up the food chain to us humans with all the potential health impacts that we hear so much about in the news these days so you can probably see why our Japanese friends are feeling pretty motivated on closer inspection of the new bacterium the scientists found that it actually used specific enzymes to break down the two components of pee those two components are dimethyl terephthalate or DMT and ethylene glycol both of which are originally derived from oil and combined by humans to make them very useful but also very problematic and virtually indestructible polymer chains once they're separated out though both these compounds are harmless and potentially quite useful but the Kyoto scientists knew from experience that there are all sorts of practical problems when you use microorganisms directly for industrial purposes you have to let the bacteria grow to a usable size for a start and you have very little control over whether the microorganisms thrive or die so it's all a bit hit-and-miss and big industrial manufacturing doesn't really do hit and miss so the team drilled down and identified the gene in the bacteria's DNA that's responsible for the p80 digesting enzyme then they reproduce the enzyme and did experiments that showed that just the enzyme on its own without the rest of the bacterium was enough to successfully break down the Pitti that was definitely one of those Eureka moments but as Thomas Edison once famously said genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration and so it proved with idea Nellis psychosis although the rate of PT digesting was hundreds of times faster than the natural degradation of plastic in landfill or the ocean it was still far too slow to cope with the incredible rate that new plastics are being churned out at all over the world so the race was on to improve and strengthen the enzyme genetically so that it could digest far greater quantities of PT far more quickly that research had been ongoing in several abolishes around the world ever since with the goal of at least a 100 fold increase in the digestion rate in 2019 the University of Portsmouth here in the UK established this Center for enzyme innovation or CEI the center's professor of structural biology john mckean recently presented a progress report on his team's research to have rapt audience at M Tech in Hong Kong McKean explained that over millions of years nature has actually evolved its own natural polyester called cuting which provides a waxy protective surface to plants but over those evolutionary time lines bacteria have also evolved they can eat through that cuting layer to get inside the plant and their destructive work using the now-familiar lettering sequences of modern genetic engineering the researchers were able to show that the PE T eating enzyme called Petties contained almost the exact same amino acid building blocks as the existing Kootenai enzymes that Nature had evolved over the eons so now they knew the ancestry of the new enzyme and they could see that it hadn't been quite a great leap of evolution for a bacterium that knows how to eat natural polyester to mutate into something that knows how to eat a synthetic one what was remarkable though says McGann is the fact that this mutation only took 50 years or so to occur and what they didn't yet know is how the new enzyme worked it's magic using state-of-the-art technologies the team purified and crystallized the enzyme then they fire x-rays @ly crystals and recorded the refracted light in ultra sensitive machines like synchrotrons and vacuum sealed proton detectors to build up an extremely accurate three-dimensional model of the atomic structure of the pates crystals which looked like this and when clever folks lab professor McGann are able to see three-dimensional atomic structures they can start to understand how they work and hopefully how to make them work even better when they compared the 3d structure of petty's to the 3d structure of QT neighs the team were able to identify the subtle changes in the PTAs enzyme that allowed it to break down PE T Q today's enzymes break the natural polyester bonds with chemical jaws at this active point where the gap is just less than 310 billionth of a meter or naught point three nanometers [Music] while the research team found was that with only a single amino acid change in its structure the pet A's enzyme had changed the shape of the jaws at its active point to make the gap almost three times wider and that change was all it took to enable the new pet A's enzyme to accommodate a man-made aromatic polymer like PE T the challenge then was to apply some sort of reverse engineering to see where the process could be turbocharged to meet the needs of our global plastic waste problem first of all they looked at the surface of a plastic bottle under an electron microscope over 96 hours while it was being digested by the Petties enzyme as the polymer structure broke down the scientists could identify the basic building blocks of DMT and ethylene glycol accumulating around the edges of the digestion area then with some advanced computer modeling courtesy of the woodcock group at the University of South Florida they produced an accurate image of how the enzyme cuts the bond in the PE T polymer chain to release the individual monomers then came the reverse engineering bit the team tried to manipulate the enzyme to turn him back into cutie neighs the idea was that by precisely controlling the steps in that laboratory process they could perhaps determine what they could do going in the other direction to mutate the petty's into something more effective but the experiment failed to produce a cute innate enzyme instead by sheer chance what it actually produced was a vastly improved pates enzyme these green bars represent the relative sizes of the crystalline structures of the petals enzyme and the accidentally discovered new enzyme you can see that there's a huge increase which in turn leads to a much faster rate of digestion the CEI team don't profess to have solved the world's plastic problems just yet but what they have shown is that it's possible to engineer a more effective enzyme just by making very small changes to its DNA and they suggest that it's entirely possible but nature may have produced other enzymes that have found ways to digest the other plastics that we've created since the middle of the 20 century we just need to do the slightly unpleasant work of rooting around in plastic recycling dumps to try and find them the future of this research looks very promising indeed though professor McGeehan is confident that they can engineer faster and faster enzymes and the outlines what he hopes the R&D roadmap will look like in an ideal world this sort of research should be regarded as essential to species survival and Abaco funded by every government on earth there's some sort of priority in the real world of market driven capitalism it'll most likely be commercial investment belter money provides the key to producing effective enzymes at a large enough scale to make a really positive impact on plastic recycling but the company with the long term vision to recognize the value of this work will also get themselves the added bonus of two very useful and very marketable byproducts professor Anne Meyer who heads up a separate pates research group based at the Technical University of Denmark points out that ethylene glycol can be used directly in antifreeze which is in very high demand all around the world and it's currently manufactured from non-renewable materials it's also possible to produce a hybrid material from paper and recycled plastic components that has the right strength properties to be used as a carrier bag but can also be fully recycled or biologically degraded and the really great thing for our dear investors is that there's very little chance they're going to run out of raw material any
