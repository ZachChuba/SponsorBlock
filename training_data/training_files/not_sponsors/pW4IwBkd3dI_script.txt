hello everybody welcome to another QA I asked for some questions on Instagram and Twitter Ashley and I think asked a bit if they're wrong time because I know what everybody's at like school unique college right now and just here trying to film my video and once I haven't got that many questions but hopefully as we go through I'll get some more coming through a lot of them I find I've answered before so I just try and pick like really original ones where I can fiends stars I'm gonna crack home at the Q&A now first question is bizarre but it says if you offered a human flavored crisp would you eat it I have an absolute addition to crisps I do not take that word lightly crisps are like my life I think if the human flavored crisp wasn't made from humans that I would try it you know how some meat crisps are actually vegan because they're not actually made of any meat I would definitely try that would you ever call your boyfriend such girlfriend daddy or mommy I'd rather pull my eyes out what's one question you get asked all the time that really irks you a good question I constantly get asked why I'm not friends with certain people and it's been literally like three maybe even four years that we haven't spoken a single word to each other but still every single time I do a Q&A I just have an influx of questions asking why we're not friends or if we're still friends or if we talk and it's really annoying like I said it's been like four years there's no explanation needed it's personal and I just don't want to sound why people still ask it's old news YouTube videos you meet that you regret so this is gonna maybe go along with the last question and I think I've said this before but I do actually regret making any videos with friends so when friends are featured heavily on my channel like in all my vlogs just really heavily on my channel I do regret that I think with time I've learned that it's just nicer to keep your friends kind of to yourself and keep that relationship private so that's definitely what I do now you'll see my friends like appear sometimes on my channel but I did used to make a lot a lot of videos with friends and I do regret that because then for years like you still get questions would you ever do traveling short a long length of time I don't think so thought of traveling honestly does nothing for me I'm definitely a homebody I love being in England I don't know why I just genuinely really love England and I always have especially now now I live in Brighton in the summertime it's so hot it's over 30 degrees and it feels like I'm on holiday anyway so why would I then want to spend money to go on holiday that's kind of how I see you I think if I did go traveling it would be in winter and it would be around like Norway Switzerland Austria Germany Denmark places like that I would actually find that really really fun but this the traditional traveling where people go to like Thailand and Australia and stuff for a long period of time no I wouldn't do that it's too hot for me welcome you're only close to your mom and brother and no other family members I was close to my Nana and granddad they were literally like my best friends I can't really answer this question other than to say I haven't really spent a lot of time with people in my family so I'm not close to them because of that like and maybe see them once a year if that I'm talking about like extended family like cousins auntie's and stuff obviously when I see them I'm happy to see them but we're not close because we just don't see just welcome you look pink I'm surprised since you look winter and the dark etc and one of those people who will only ever wear black when I go out all black or like this color or gray just really neutral colors mostly dark there if I could have a whole wardrobe of black clothes I would but all of my pajamas have got unicorns Barbie Disney characters and everything on because I just don't express that part of read to the world so I feel that part of me definitely comes out in my choice of home decor and pajamas and stuff like that I just love wearing dark colors but then is it possible to love something such someone more than your pets I would say probably obviously I haven't had children yet I don't know how old that kind of love feels but I would genuinely put Nellie my cat on the same level as my mom for how much I love them I don't know what I would do without either of them and I can't imagine loving something more than I love Nellie Nellie is my little prince but yeah do you think it's possible I think when I have kids I would be so obsessed with them we always your mental health thank you for asking so actually okay at the minute I went through a time last year where it was really dodgy and I was trying to find the medication combination that worked for me and I went through a few things that didn't work but I've definitely London on a combination of medication that works for me so my depression is under wraps but I also don't feel like a zombie because on some of the depression medication I felt honestly like his on me or a robot I didn't feel the sadness but I didn't feel anything and find anything funny I don't get excited for anything I would just walk around like this just felt kind of dead inside but I've definitely found a combination that does work for me now the emotions but I don't feel them as crazily as I used to and my anxiety is a lot better still do have days where I'm very very anxious usually around my period but those days I tend to just stay my mouse and keep myself to myself because I know if I go out I'll end up having a panic attack that just doesn't work for me I can't push through it if I feel like that but overall my mental health is a lot better thank you for asking what makes you personally end a friendship I feel like I've got two answers for this trust and effort I think once the trust is broken in a friendship then there's no point moving forward I can't build trust back I'm not one of those people like if you break my trust you are gone but then also effort if I notice that I'm messaging someone so much more to check how they are I haven't been what up to like blah blah blah and I'm not getting that bar ever then I think about that kind of plays a part in a friendship as well you've got to put effort you've got to ask how your friends are and just check in on them so if I'm doing all of that constantly that clicks something in my mind and I just think you know maybe they're not good friends what sparked your curiosity about Japan I've always been curious about Japan I think it looks very clean they're like clean things I watch a lot of youtubers who live in Japan so not actually Japanese youtubers but people like tokidoki traveler Taylor are used to live in Japan ships in China now Tara Cates lives in Korea a girl called me can lives in Japan I watch a lot of people who live like in in those countries and I just love their style and their type of vlogging and the surroundings it always looks so beautiful and yeah we're just like to visit if you could mix any two people to make your dream person who would you mix if it was a girl I would mix Anne Hathaway and Cameron Diaz I think they're both so gorgeous but they look so different so it would be interested to see what they looked like if it was a guy probably David Beckham and Harry Styles don't know how about an outfit yeah your some of your favorite youtubers at the minute I am absolutely loving a girl called Amy the channel is a be made in Japan another I guess kind of Japanese youtuber that I watch she makes these military Russian videos where she tries our Russians from different countries so say if Poland has an army they will have Russians and she will try out the Polish Russians and they come in a pack and it was really interested to see her voice is so calming and I love seeing what the different Russians are which he doesn't just make news video she makes so many different kind of videos I love them I love every single one of her videos so definitely go and check her out if you're looking for someone who's just like jail no drama quite interesting leave her channel down there are you bored of YouTube it's changed a lot over the years and original youtubers seem to have fallen out of love with making content as they can't create what they truly want as it doesn't do as well as trends thought there was a time maybe last year or just over a year ago where I really fell out of love with YouTube the trends were definitely taking over all of them like wish videos stuff that I just do not care about at all with a big rage and they seem to be the only thing that people care about watching so everybody would make them and I think just like the normal content kind of got pushed under the rug a bit but since moving I've definitely found my stride with YouTube again I'm loving making videos I don't ever think how many people are gonna watch this or this is gonna get way less views and stuff like I'm back to making a few makeup videos which don't do well on my channel but I enjoy making them so I'm back to doing them I did a Halloween baking video which I wouldn't do well and he didn't do well but I love to make in it I think as long as you've got a mix of what you love doing and what just well on your channel so you can live in get paid because it's a job and like I've got a mortgage yeah I think you're good to go there are parts of everyone's job that people don't lie there are parts of my job that I definitely don't like I really hate all the clickbait stuff and I know you might say like this video is clickbait invoice not because I spoke about the title of this video in the video I see clickbait is like over dramatizing some thing that fee know we'll get a few that's like the tiniest part of a video like one tiny comment that someone makes and then they turn it into the whole title because they know what will get fused I hate stuff like that it's so pre-meditated it's like right what's going to get views today then and obviously like I said people have bills and rent and stuff to baby but I think there comes a point where you just got a chair and just got to make the content that you want to make because at the end of the day your audience like you so if you're happy doing something they want to watch that I did go through a phase where I was like testing makeup brands and stuff because those videos were doing well and yeah I enjoyed making the videos but I just didn't feel fulfilled by it at all they will have treat all I was making and they did well but they didn't fill that need in my heart yeah I feel really content with it other minute I do notice that people have like dropped off the YouTube bandwagon but a lot of the time that's because they've taken up something else like acting or they've now got their own brand or whatever which is amazing everyone's got a grey when it comes to the original YouTube people me included because I guess I started like two years after then what kind of cookie clusters one of the original people we started when YouTube wasn't known for making money so we started because we wanted to do it whereas I think nowadays people think right I'm gonna make YouTube my job let's roll in the dome so they made videos early to get money and I think that's where a lot of the original ones have dropped off of YouTube because one it's not nice to see the new people who are just like Fame hungry money-hungry but also to because we didn't start it to make money a lot of people have been found what they actually do want to do in life first for a lot of people now I think YouTube is what they want to do in life so they like make it a business does that make any sense long story short I'm enjoying it okay the last question are you going to actually stay brunette this time my favorite on you by far I'm massively agree brunettes suits me the most brunette is my natural hair color it's not this dark it's more like a mousy medium brown it's got like blond bits in but then it's also got ginger bits in but then it's also like brown if I could find a picture of my natural hair color put it here but yeah brunette is what suits me the most and I know that but I always have this thing I think when I'm truly happy when I'm in a place where I'm not caring about anything and I'm genuinely just very very happy I really want to cut my hair and diet platinum I want to try that out but I know that most of the time when I dye my hair and then I change it it's because I'm not happy and I feel like I have to go back to my comfort zone which is brown hair that's just where I feel comfortable so when I'm like happy happy happy I want to try the hair that I know I would just die back if I had it doesn't say now straight away that make any sense whatsoever but yeah I would really like this hairstyle one day would be so cool I'm gonna leave this Q&A here thank you guys the questions let me know if you still like these videos in the comments I like them so I get to chat a lot and don't forget to download it best fiends stars in the downbar a little link will be down there give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you in my next one bye [Music]
