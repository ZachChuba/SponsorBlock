they are some of the most unusual aircraft of the past 80 years or so responsible for sightings of UFOs across the United States and became the most expensive plane ever built and all from a principle that they were the most aerodynamic of any plane design and yet they fell into obscurity for almost 30 years this is the story of a flying wing [Music] [Applause] [Music] this video is sponsored by Noor DPM check out this year's Black Friday deal at the end of the video although they might look futuristic for flying wing design has actually been around for over a hundred years and was originally inspired by the way birds fly technically they are called tireless aircraft and in their truest form have no fuselage no vertical or horizontal stabilizers other than the main wing so all the crew fuel tanks payload and associated equipment are all within the main wing section itself the point of a flying wing is that they have the most aerodynamically efficient design of any fixed-wing aircraft with the least amount of drag because there are no other control surfaces to induce drag and as such they could fly faster subsonically further and carry greater load than a conventional aircraft of the same engine power however without a vertical stabilizer they are inherently unstable some delta wing aircraft are also called flying wings like the concorde or the Dassault Mirage because they have no horizontal stabilizer but they do have a vertical stabilizer and rudder both the inspiration for flying wings originally came from birds when people tried to copy the shape of a bird it was found that the craft they made were very unstable the Wright brothers tried this out on gliders and had the same problem it was only after thousands of Windtunnel tests that they discovered that using a vertical stabilizer made the gliders controllable and able to turn and in 1903 they made their first controlled flight in the Wright Flyer and as such vertical stabilizers became a part of aircraft design so if flying wings were so unstable how did they make them fly well the early innovators like JW done around 1910 found that if the leading edge of the wing was swept back and they reduced the angle of incidence the outer part of a wing would act like a normal vertical stabilizer however this creates more and makes the wing more inefficient further work with ailerons and split ailerons at the end of the wings found they could act like a rudder and giving the wings of twist never tips could also make the craft more stable in the 1920s and 30s work on advanced wing aerodynamics by Ludovic print and experiments with gliders by the Horton brothers in Germany showed that by changing the shape of a wing over its length now known as a bell shape the lift distribution drag could be minimized for a given weight and this made the wings more stable and efficient this led to aircraft like the Horton ho2 - 9 which were designed in response to hermann goering z-- 1943 called for a light bomber for a Luftwaffe that could carry 1000 kilograms of bombs up to 1,000 kilometers at up to 1,000 kilometers per hour using a true flying wing it was the only design to come close to the design goals and the first flying wing to use jet engines meanwhile in the US Jack Northrop who had been fascinated by how birds flew since he was a boy was also interested in all wing designs and created the X - 1 6 H prototype in 1929 Northrop continued his research into larger true flying wings and in 1939 produced the n1 M which would prove his theories and leaked of a full-size b35 during the war the Army Air Corps issued a contract for a prototype heavy bomber that could fly from the u.s. to Germany and back again in case Britain fell and the US was no longer able to gain access to British air bases initially the contract was issued to Boeing and consolidated Aircraft Company but later extended to Northrop due to the interest in the flying wing concept initially the b35 used for Pratt & Whitney engines with large contra-rotating propellers which were supplied by the Army Air Force these were powerful but proved very problematic as no one in the airforce would take responsibility for the ancient problems Northrop decided to switch to sink propellers but this then also we used for power greatly so in the end they switch to using eight newly developed allison j35 jet engines and the two jet converted airframes were redesignated the YB 49 more tests were performed and things were looking very good but an issue was found when they were tested on a trial bombing run the aircraft took a long time to settle into stable flight for a run and would drift from left to right and back again and have to be corrected by the pilot until it settled down but this was enough to cause problems with boom Norden bomb aiming site which needed a very stable platform to work correctly this was one of the side effects of not having a vertical stabilizer and the flying wings natural tendency to be unstable though when the autopilot was upgraded to automate the your control as well much of a drifting issue was resolved all over YB 49 was more efficient than the competing aircraft like the Boeing b-47 the thickness of a Y V 49 s wing reduced his speed and meant that he couldn't fly supersonic Li that and the eight new Jets used more fuel than propeller engines and this reduced its range too during this time it was thought by the top brass in particular people like general Curtis LeMay but thin wing jets were more suitable for supersonic flight and that speed to take the enemy by surprise was more important than range but in the end technical issues - crashes plus the politics of the Air Force contracting system and lobbying by conveyor brought about for cancellation of the B 35 + a YB 49 however Jack Northrop believed it was a conspiracy by convair to remove him and his company from the competition because he refused to merge his company with conveyor after who was suggested as the only way to proceed by the secretary of the air force Stuart Symington shortly afterwards Symington left the government and became the president of conveyor further convincing Jack Northrop that Symington had been working for convair all along afterwards the remaining be 35 and be 49 s were cut up for scrap and Jack North what was so disgusted with the way being treated by the air force he resigned from his own company and left Vav Asian business for years afterwards the flying wing concept was thought to have been a dead end in the history of aviation until the 1970s when interest in stealth technology to combat radar detection turned to the flying wing in the 1940s it had been noted that the flying wing had a much lower radar signature compared to conventional aircraft especially from the side aspect due to the lack of a vertical stabilizer in 1981 northrop was selected over lockheed to build the ATB or advanced technology bomber with the designation of b2 this was to be a low-level terrain-following bomber that would use stealth technology and the flying wing design to operate vital penetration missions deep into enemy territory to knock out high-value targets without being detected with the new radar absorbing paint and a flying wing design the radar signature from b-52 meter wingspan b2 was the same as that of a pigeon by this time computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems could fly the unstable design far better than any pilot could do back in the 1940s and advances in engine exhaust routing could hide most of a heat signature from the infrared trackers but soon the huge amount of research that was required into developing both the airframe and stealth technologies pushed up a cost of a program to dramatic levels the ongoing maintenance was also going to be hugely expensive requiring 119 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight and including special air-conditioned hangars to preserve the stealth coatings by 1997 the average cost of each plane including R&D building and testing was about 2 point 1 billion dollars although 132 b2 s were ordered that was eventually cut to just 21 todate no b-2s have been retired from the Air Force all lost in combat but one was lost in a crash as it was taking off from Anderson Air Force Base in Guam over crew did eject safely it became the single most expensive plane crash ever at an estimated cost of one point four billion dollars in 1976 Jack Northrop contacted NASA to let them know of a research he had done in the 1940s and to give him the data he had collected about the flying wing so that it wouldn't be lost soon after NASA wrote back and said that after re-evaluating wind tunnel data for a range of large aircraft designs they could confirm his work and that the flying wing was indeed the most efficient design and load carrier in 2015 NASA started research into how birds can fly and maneuver without vertical tails using the aerodynamic theories of Ludovic print and an unmanned flying wing glider the print D with the intent to find new low drag aircraft designs not only for here on earth but also for other thin atmosphere planets like Mars now online security is
