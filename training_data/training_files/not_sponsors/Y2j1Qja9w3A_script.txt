with scotch regazane
that's right i am very excited to be sharing my first attempt ever
for this incredibly unique and delicious sicilian stuffed flatbread
which i received a request to do not too long ago from one of our sicilian
american viewers although it wasn't really so much a
request as much as an offer i couldn't refuse
but anyway i gave it a try and for a first attempt i was thrilled with how
this came out so with that let's go ahead and get started
with what's a very very simple semolina dough
and for that we will start with some very warm water and then to that we will
sprinkle over just one teaspoon of dry active yeast
and then as usual we will let that sit for about 10 minutes or so
just to give that yeast a little head start and make sure it's alive
and while we're waiting we can take a look at the flour we're going to use for
this which as i mentioned is going to be semolina
which i believe is more commonly used to make pasta than it is bread
and as you can see this has a much more golden look than regular white flour
plus the texture's not nearly as fine so it almost looks more like cornmeal than
it does flour and yes you should be able to find that
fairly easily at any large decent supermarket
and then what we'll do once we've let our yeast in the water for about 10
minutes is go ahead and drizzle in a little bit
of olive oil or preferably sicilian if you can swing it
at which point we will dump in our semolina as well as a little bit of salt
and we'll start mixing and stirring together with our fingertips
to first determine if we need a little more water
which i decided i did so i went ahead and splashed in a little more
and then continued mixing and the reason we want to start out kind of dry
and then add more if we need is because this is not supposed to be a very wet
and sticky dough okay this dough is going to be a lot
stiffer and firmer than we're normally used to
but anyway we will keep working that dough until eventually it all comes
together into a fairly firm ball we're able to knead
and just as soon as that happens we'll go ahead and transfer that to our work
surface where we will need this for about five
minutes or so and i'm guessing it was the semolina
flour but even after about five minutes of kneading it did not become super
smooth all right i think the texture is going
to be much closer to a pasta dough than a bread dough
but anyway for the initial kneading i thought i was fine
and then what we'll do at this point is go ahead and cover that with our bowl
and we'll let it rest for about 30 minutes before we give it a second knead
so that's exactly what i did and after about 30 minutes there was a little bit
of a slight rise to it and i grabbed it and kneaded it for
another five minutes or so before shaping it into a ball and then
dividing it into two pieces and i believe there's two
ways you can do this step i think some people divide the dough in
half and then need these little balls for five minutes
or you can do it like i did and need the whole thing for five minutes and then
divide in two but either way once we have two portions
we want to try to form those into a nice smooth ball shape
and to help me do that because this was feeling a little bit dry i went ahead
and wet my fingers with some nice cold fresh water
which did seem to help smooth out that surface a little bit and then what we'll
do once those are formed is transfer those onto a heavy semolina
dusted kitchen towel and then once placed down we'll sprinkle
some more over the top at which point we will fold the towel
over and we'll kind of fold over and tuck in the edges
so they're all nice and cozy and then once we have those tucked in
we're going to let them rise for about two hours or until they double in size
or at least close to it and after about two hours or so this is what mine look
like right they had puffed up nicely and
finally did feel kind of soft and supple and then what we'll do at this point is
take one of our portions and roll it out nice and thin
using just enough extra semolina so it won't stick
and apparently the key is here to get this as thin as you can
which i thought i did a pretty good job of doing but some of the sicilian
grandmas i watched got it a lot thinner than i did and you
could pretty much see through it although in fairness i'm using a rolling
pin and they were actually using these thinner broomsticks
which i think probably makes it a little bit easier but anyway the point is get
it at least as thin as this and once we're done rolling and shaping
and stretching it is time to spread over some sauce
and top with some cheese and what i went with here is just a basic standard pizza
sauce that i had added a whole bunch of
chopped basil to and i think it's kind of important here not to spread over too
much sauce okay all we want here is a thin layer
going almost but not quite all the way to the edges
and then one sauce will go ahead and top this with some cheese and since i didn't
have access to the authentic sicilian style cheese they use
which i forget the name of or i'm just afraid to pronounce it
or both i'm going to use a nice aged provolone
but what also could work as long as it's low moisture would be like half
mozzarella and half grated pecorino romano cheese
or you know what just use whatever cheese you want i mean you are after all
the chachi of your scotchie and as long as you
don't use too much it should be fine and then what we'll do once that's been
cheesed is fold the two longer sides in towards the middle
so that they sort of meet in the center and we'll give that a very very light
pressing at which point we'll repeat our saucing
and cheesing step and because we're going to fold in both ends towards the
middle i'm going to leave that area in the
center cheeseless and like i said we will fold both ends
towards the middle just like we did with the first fold
only from the opposite sides and that's it to finish this we'll apply
one more thin layer of sauce but because i'm going to be folding half
over the top i'm just going to put the cheese on one side
and please fight the temptation to be too generous with your toppings
as i think having these overstuffed would be one of the few ways to screw
these up since they might not get cooked all the
way through and then once the last of my toppings was on
i finished by folding the other side over the top which in hindsight should
have come all the way over the top where the edge was actually touching the
table so i'm definitely going to have to practice my folding
since i think i made this a little too compact and high but anyway i pressed on
and speaking of pressing as i transferred this onto a cornmeal lined
baking sheet i sort of tried to press and push that
side down a little more so maybe that it would seal a little
better near the bottom but at the same time i didn't really want to crush this
and press it too much so at a certain point i stopped and just
decided to hope for the best and i grabbed that pan and transferred
it into the center of a very very hot 500 degree oven
for about 16-18 minutes or until very very well browned
and i was not exactly sure if this looked right but i did know it looked
delicious and as i turned it around for a little
360 viewing you can see what i was saying about not having that last fold
come all the way over the top so it's probably sitting up a little too
high at least compared to the pictures i've seen
but then again i've seen this folded in like a half a dozen different ways
so who knows maybe i accidentally did it away some people do it on purpose
in any event we'll let that sit and cool for about 15 minutes before transferring
that onto a cutting board and slicing in and as i did that it sure sounded right and i was sort of thinking at this point
maybe my less than perfect folding technique
turned out to be an advantage since that top crust was nice and crispy
and i have to admit i was very happy with how this looked but anyway looks
aside it was time to go in for a taste which really was nothing short of
incredible all right what we have here is a very familiar pizza-like flavor
profile but the delivery system is unlike
anything you've ever experienced right the outside crust and edges are
crispy and crunchy while that saucy and cheesy bread dough in the center
is much closer to a pasta and texture so while this is vaguely similar to a lot
of things it is really unlike anything else just
very unique and unusual in the best possible way
so i found that first piece very easy to eat and i went ahead and cut a couple
more slices and then did a little bit of food
styling with the tip of the knife so i could position that basil
since i am contractually obligated to take some pictures
and after those i continued eating and analyzing
and because we roll the dough so thin and the inside is so moist with that
cheese and sauce i was really afraid that bread wasn't
going to cook and it was going to be kind of raw and doughy
but you know what it really wasn't even though it was hard to see here it was
fully cooked and even though this extremely
minimalist approach with the ingredients turned out so well
i don't see why you couldn't sneak a little bit of meat in here okay as long
as it was thinly sliced or if you're using something like
sausage finely crumbled so this is definitely something that would be a lot
of fun to experiment with and believe me i will be but having said
that this would just the sausage cheese was fantastic and
after enjoying a few slices the best description i can come up with
is this was really like a crispy flatbread
stuffed with lasagna which sounds kind of crazy
but that's really sort of what this was so don't be surprised next year when you
see a video for something called lasagna bread
based on this recipe so stay tuned for that
but in the meantime i really do hope you give this a try soon
