hey guys welcome back to my channel so it's here it's it's here i couldn't have wished for anything else right now the music video is here it's happening now i think we were all in the same situation yesterday we were all questioning what was going on when would the music video drop and what was going on like behind the scenes why did the music video not drop and why did sm not speak out sooner i think the reason why i was so frustrated yesterday is not necessarily because the music video was delayed like if there was anything to be edited out or something to be added or removed from the music video to protect them the girls and et cetera then i would be all okay for it i just wanted maybe for sm to speak out sooner like earlier in the day or give us an explanation the fact that there is such a lack of transparency here just bothers me so much and i really do think that that's why i was so disappointed yesterday the whole day was like why what was going on like do better you know and i've seen the comments saying that it is potentially because the music video was deemed a little bit too inappropriate like there was too many explicit scenes and i'm like i mean you already know that i wouldn't have been bothered with those seasons but i also understand that if the music video isn't is deemed inappropriate or like not fit for broadcast or whatever then marketing wise it would be good for the girls or something like this i'm sure there is a reason behind why they chose to delay it so much after delaying it for two hours and after delaying the whole comeback for like a month but anyways i just think that the girls deserve better and i really do hope that this is the last time sm is that unprepared for a release like this because this was handled so badly with that said give me the explicit scenes i am so ready if there was a 19 rated version of this um i think i think this is going to be one of those videos where i'm like extremely extra so don't be surprised okay i'm just you know that you know this meme that's going on i said that on twitter already but there's this meme you know where it says i'm about to simp that's me that's yoga i'm about to sip like i feel like there's going to be many different theories about this and you know what throw them at me i'm ready let's go so i have the captions on monster let's just go ahead this scene she can step on me oh yeah [Music] like my heart right now you don't even know [Music] oh yeah [Music] oh yeah can you imagine what they removed in the music video they're really going with the more american sound nowadays be scared of me no no no no oh [Music] oh my god this this is this is everything what i mean i would take irene no matter what she looks like [Music] give me the original version i'm small to be dangerous [Music] oh yeah this i'm ready to give them everything [Music] oh yeah [Music] everything about this [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yeah like they could step on me like that it's fine [Music] you know how every time i lost it during the red river's music video whenever there was kind of like those scenes where they were like close to each other blah blah yeah that's that's the climax of everything like this give me the original version how like i was already shook by just this and this is like the the edited version already boy you i need to see the original version please like i um like listen i understand that each society has this journey to do to make for you know to reach a certain amount of like acceptability in the general public i get it but come on like come on like not going like i was obviously more focused on the music video and everything i think this is one of the prettiest music video that i've seen this year like the aesthetic that there is in here is so much different like there's definitely this more dark vibe from it creepy that this is very red velvet but take it another level with the more like sexy and like more jose type of you know vibe you already know i'm ready to risk it all for red velvet like already you know but this one and like none of them are my badass right i don't even really know if i have a bias wrecker in the group but this this makes me question everything the duality that they are giving us in here it's insane i don't think i've ever seen sugi this fierce like she is fierce usually you know she's she can be everything but here like she's really just oozing of this like femme fatale dangerous dominatrix almost vibe in here and i'm just like oh whoa come girl i don't think i'm ready for this you know and i think annie was just born to make this type of concept like this just fits her so perfectly she has this very what is it like metro woman vibe to her the performance aspect of this as well is so freaking cool like obviously we didn't see all the dates or whatever but the small bits that we have seen like the part when they kind of like go like hands on their knees and everything yo i just wanted to take a second to talk about the vocals because siggy impressed me a lot here sookie's voice whenever she goes deeper that was one of the hardest thing ever like that was so freaking hot the control that she has over her voice and the way she just sang those lines got me really bad and you have aiden also when you mention irene what do you think of first i think most people would say visual like she's a gorgeous blah blah so it's easy to forget that she's also a very great vocalist and i think here she's kind of like proving herself again to not be just a prefect if that makes sense she's extremely talented and she's proving it here i think in the past they have proven that they work extremely well together and that this chemistry for sure between them two and so having them two finally in the subunit just makes so much sense and the fact that they debuted with such an impactful and very just like sultry dark concept strong dark concept is everything to me now call me biased but i think this is one of the best ratings of this year so far music video everything wise like the prediction of this is really really high i just wish the music video wasn't delayed to begin with but then again i guess it gives like it creates some type of hype around the music video even more than usual at least we have it which is great and i'm ready to give my all to those girls like yeah there you go get to subscribe to my channel and i will see you in the next video bye i
