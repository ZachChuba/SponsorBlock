[Music] greetings survivors and friends i'm back pointing my laser site at yet another custom rust map and server today and of course you'll probably want to know how you can play on it when you can play on it those sort of things which i will be telling you so stick around but if you remember the video i did on the mars server a while ago then this is from the same chaps so you know it's going to be quality but this time instead of the final frontier they've decided to take on the american frontier and rewind rust all the way back to the wild wild west not only is it a custom themed map but as usual they've rigged it with some custom themed plugins too for that authentic old west experience i twisted their arm to give me a tour before it's actually released for public consumption and so today i'm going to show you what i saw down below or with code shadow franks back to the video this is uh the wild west map all the monuments are based around western theme monuments the size of the map is actually pretty small you're only able to go within kind of this bowl section of the map okay of course there's no helicopters or anything everything on the server is based on uh the western style so horses are your major kind of transportation you won't be able to get aks a lot of the weapons are going to be pythons uh semis things like that right show me around i think first we should go into town it's kind of like a monument there you will find loot there the major point of the actual monument is it actually has a codelock crate there oh and the town's called cobalt yeah we really uh tried to go for originality there hello just a random outlaw waving at me um if you actually go into the general store there's actually a person in here where you can buy it in goods from hello there bit of low grade bit of diesel someone needs to do a courtesy flush i think is that reading material or just the daily mail uh so this is nice yeah i redid the um the recyclers to give them more of a western look i you know made sure to add the sign there so everyone can make sure they'll be able to find it i think that looks better anyway so this is the bank the vault we call it but it's a codelock crate fell through the ceiling when you unlock this within 45 seconds a group of bandits on horses are gonna ride up to this bank and try to kill you for it i think i've got god mode on [Music] the bank is currently being held up by bandits they'll be here any second that sounds like it could be them so yeah basically these are our uh our version of chinooks and heavies and with the western idea yeah they do have their new style loot so if you notice across the whole server there's actually these posters we have a bounty system that we set up that's completely custom and what it is is you basically when you die there's a icon that'll appear on your screen that'll say they ask them you know do you want to place a bounty on the person that killed you um and then it'll automatically find your tc on the server and remove the scrap from it to then put up so it says you are the most wanted but you're also dead yeah i know i got i got killed so when you're most wanted and someone kills you and basically uh it'll show up on the sign that you're deceased but you can still go i want that bouncy you just startled me um so uh well that's the way you know the element of surprise so there's a bunch of sheriff stations all around the map so when you go to a sheriff station you just walk up and hit e and then a ui will appear howdy pardner what can i do you for you're wanted by one contractor after you kill the person come here and you collect a reward and the scrap that you win is automatically deposited into your main tc i see and you actually need a tc in order to collect or place a bounty we didn't want people just to camp the jails and camp the sheriff stations and kill people collecting the rewards so that's why everything's going to be deposited to their home tc i think rust in general like the you know it's scientist i presume what happens if i put this on oh hello yeah that's loot i gotta switch out still yeah it might be a little bit oh well just like our mars server and moon server all the junk piles are custom we made sure they're all western themed so what sort of size is the usable area the actual usable space is probably around like 1.5 it's a fairly small map but i think the way that we set it up but there's a lot of buildable space in here nicodemus he's wanted so i can get the bounty if i actually had a tc i love that shouldn't that swing inwards or at least swing both ways t pickles shame we haven't got poker should we saddle up and mosey on over to the next monument yeah i can show you the train station and the church this is a little train station monument um this there's also a sheriff here as well down here is the church are you inside i am okay perfect yeah we want to create little western themed places you know we have the church here each of these monuments will have probably three to five crates at them um some will have recyclers oh yeah definitely like this aesthetic more well maybe one day they'll let us skin recyclers or have them in our own houses yeah right like a baby version of it baby recycler not for recycling babies obviously yeah that's that would be that just be wrong just down near the uh abandoned oh hello just met a ghost loan thought it was funny to put that there and scare players once in a while um so right there in the middle of the lake this is a monument that was made by kusha for us a buddy of mine it's a way for us to kind of have a similar monument to oil rig on a western theme map so what we did is we made a distillery on stilts and basically as you go through the monument you'll notice it's more of a distillery than anything um but it'll have scientists on there and pretty much this you know good loot for the server yeah and there's a couple of reservations on the map can we have a look at those so these are another monument that you'll find around the server i guess you would call it a a reservation for you know native americans can't get in the teepees they're locked hey the old rabbit corpses yeah we found a use for them these are actually the boat monuments i don't know if you could tell but yeah but yeah i thought looked like amazing for a village or a western uh farm if you look on the map there are a few stables monuments we kind of created our own version of it you know we didn't want it to take up like a huge portion of the map so uh we just created these little mini versions of it so yeah if you open up each workbenches you'll be able to see uh the tech tree any blueprint that you have that comes um default on those tech trees you can't craft those items the reason you have those blueprints though is because we didn't feel right for people to have to pay scrap to unlock an item that they couldn't utilize you can only raid with satchels but players can't upgrade their base to high tier metal is the highest they can go and we may add c4 back to the server you know we really want to try out satchels and see how that works for players we're still thinking about that just a shame the trains aren't working yet so you can't tie other players to the train tracks but the big question of course is can we make moonshine yet uh currently not yet shame we've got the water purifiers we've got the corn that's true there's plenty of yeast laying around so the only vehicles on the server are horses yeah everything everything's 100 horsepower down the server and it's trios only is that right yep population limit of how many were you thinking i think we're gonna go with a hundred for now and see how much space there is eu server us uh us server at the moment a lot of people are asking about an eu server and uh it's something that it's definitely in the back of our minds but subject to change there you go it's a shame this doesn't update in real time there's a weird bug with the horses now if you shoot them in the face their like jaw like snaps around their head it's so weird this is for science yeah absolutely horrific okay chaps so if you like the look of this and fancy something a bit different on the side then you'll want to know how and when to join the how will be down below in the description where you'll find all the details to connect to the server the when is actually about now because it's going to go live pretty much when i publish this so if you're quick you might be able to beat the gold rush no promises of course for any other questions about the server please see the dedicated discord and website again which will be linked also let me facebook discord and my steam group to stay up to date with my content i shall catch you all soon but in the meantime keep calm and stay rusty available now at awdit.co.uk absolutely horrific
