Welcome to another H3H3 classic 'complaining about YouTube video', Got em'! Okay, I want to talk about the YouTube ad boycott. I feel like people, Ourselves included, we're hoping and holding on to the fact that this was going to get better for everyone, and I think for a lot of people it has gotten better and I think for a lot of people it has gotten better But for ourselves, it continues to get worse to the point where Where we don't think that we can continue to even exist? Where we don't think that we can continue to even exist? The problem is that YouTube in an effort to bring brands back has given them the tools to not put ads on anything that, that might seem controversial? But it's so blunt and it's so stupid that it is destroying our channel and our livelihood. That was normally, "normally" monetized and the other ones made pretty much nothing So let me let me take you step through it so "Daddy of five with Steve-O", no ads from day one So one of the notes I was given is that... "Peeing". We did an obviously fake peeing moment? and that was apparently too controversial for... Brands to run on. This is PG-13 s**t, a little sprinkle of water for comic effect YouTube is now more conservative than f**king Nickelodeon. It's in the f**king title in the video. This is PG-13 s**t, a little sprinkle of water for comic effect "Frozen Elsa vs Joker pee on her face prank"! That's way more appropriate... so kids can watch it But adults can't. And I guarantee you this thing is playing ads all f**king day. "Frozen Elsa vs Joker or Pee on her face prank", its a different video But Joker straight unloading on them dude, and it's like a sexual act! Ours was self aware comedy Hila: So it's like okay. So it says that it's a prank here But adults can't. And I guarantee you this thing is playing ads all f**king day. Ethan: I mean, it's worth saying we did cut off Steve-O's balls in that video But we took... We went out of our way to make that s**t look as fake as possible. We literally took pink and white Play-doh and rolled it up into a ball and... And like I mean okay. Yeah, sorry YouTube we actually castrated Steve-O. You got us man. Sorry, okay? Next one. This one's my favorite. This was our attempt at making a brand friendly video! I put Christian in the title, that video was almost completely demonetized. So, why... Why would this video of me and Hila sitting here innocently get like, slammed harder than, than any other video we made in the past several weeks? Because I put Christian in the title. they probably took up like 20 seconds of a 12-minute video. Brands go, here are the options and then there's like "religion" and it's like: "oh, why would I run my s**t on religion", but it's not about religion There's nothing to do with it. This is this blunt force so even when we try to make something brand friendly it gets fucked We changed it to Facebook moms against dabbing, it didn't help. It's still f**ked. I thought it was worth the shot. The Tai Lopez one, (smack), was fine "Pepsi saves the world". Guess what didn't make any money. You want to know why? slammed harder than, than any other video we made in the past several weeks? I was told is because there was blood coming out my eye and then... Ethan: I was drinking a Pepsi while bleeding from the eye Controversial. Very controversial. Not ad friendly. Demonetized. uh, "political" no money; "Is YouTube over?" About the Wall Street Journal, "political", no money; So we're looking at... So I mean you can kind of see the issue we're in. I mean... uh, at this point it's just f**king funny because we tr-... In our attempt to try to make a completely brand friendly video, wh-... is the one that's making the LEAST of all the ones I mentioned. Would be enough to get slam dunked by a Bradberry. Hila: The problem is that you get no info. There's no, like report. Like, okay? This video that you made, Hila: got demonetized because you did this, this, this... Hila: You get no info. So they used to demonetize your videos and you at least understand and have a chance to appeal. is brands, they [YouTube] give them [the brands] categories like "controversial", "profane"... There's no nuance. There's no subtlety, so if a brand sees something as controversial they click off it, right. So they don't tell you, right, that you've been flagged as controversial. ... it says "It's all good." "Underneath" tags that says this video is "controversial", "violent", "sexual", whatever that would make up like eighty percent of the brand's click off it Which is what's been happening on our past like seven videos. So it says monetized, but we're at this point We're seriously making 16 cents on every dollar that we used to make. Wasn't this about racism? And Like ISIS videos with ads on it? So why... As a comedy satire channel, why am I getting killed? because we tr-... In our attempt to try to make a completely brand friendly video, Racism, and now, controversial satire channels are losing their revenue? Like uh, I can't help but feel like YouTube is... capitalizing on this moment to clean house. And just get rid of the challenge that they never wanted to begin with. Why's all of our videos not making any money?? there's a wonderful article on wired.com where they talk about what's happening in YouTube right now since the ad boycott: of ad quality raters; these are real people who go and watch videos on YouTube and rate them as "offensive" or "sensitive". profanity, hate speech, or "other". Watch out for those "others". They'll get you every time. sensational or shocking; as well as profane and rough language. So these are the new tags, and I'm pretty sure there's just one f**king guy sitting at YouTube studios right now ... it says "It's all good." I swear, how many times I share my opinion, how many nuts I've cut off How many people I've pissed on and he's going: "controversial", "rough language", "drug". You know all that fucking good shit? 
-Hila: Other. So many "others" dude. Oof! And then you know the brand's obviously when they look at it like they're like, Ooh. Wow, this, this is horrible. I don't want to run on this, y'know. Make like ten fifteen percent of what we used to but... It's still enough because we have enough views but NO one NO channel will ever become popular on YouTube again that that makes similar content.
- Hila: Hmm hmm. Ethan: And channels like Fillthy Frankie you love and adore? I GUARANTEE you George, Filthy Frank is not making a dime. Here's what Youtube said to Filthy Frank one of their original and most creative influencers on the whole website which brought a ton of people to cherish and love Youtube here's what they said to him: And we're getting the "bye!" too now Like uh, I can't help but feel like YouTube is... capitalizing on this moment to clean house. And just get rid of the challenge that they never wanted to begin with. We're not doing anything racist, so... Why's all of our videos not making any money?? If you guys think I'm being like paranoid, or conspiracy theory, there's a wonderful article on wired.com where they talk about what's happening in YouTube right now since the ad boycott: Since this has happened YouTube has hired HORDES of ad quality raters; these are real people who go and watch videos on YouTube and rate them as "offensive" or "sensitive". They have such tags as inappropriate language, profanity, hate speech, or "other". Watch out for those "others". They'll get you every time. They're even allowing brands now to opt out of content that is sexually suggestive, sensational or shocking; as well as profane and rough language. So these are the new tags, and I'm pretty sure there's just one f**king guy sitting at YouTube studios right now Just watching a video every time we upload it and like counting however many times I swear, how many times I share my opinion, how many nuts I've cut off How many people I've pissed on and he's going: "controversial", "rough language", "drug". You know all that fucking good shit? 
-Hila: Other. Ethan: Oh, "other." So many "others" dude. Oof! And then you know the brand's obviously when they look at it like they're like, Ooh. Wow, this, this is horrible. I don't want to run on this, y'know. We can get by we can still make videos on our channel and Make like ten fifteen percent of what we used to but... It's still enough because we have enough views but NO one NO channel will ever become popular on YouTube again that that makes similar content.
- Hila: Hmm hmm. Ethan: And channels like Fillthy Frankie you love and adore? I GUARANTEE you George, Filthy Frank is not making a dime. Hila:  You say to George, "bye!" Here's what Youtube said to Filthy Frank one of their original and most creative influencers on the whole website which brought a ton of people to cherish and love Youtube here's what they said to him: "Bye!" And we're getting the "bye!" too now we're getting the bye so I feel like me and Hila are at a huge cross road right now because I just I Honestly and Generally for the first time in our YouTube career feel like this Isn't going to work. We need to find other things to do, so this is what our solution is, were Definitely going keep making [videos] on H3 that's our bread and butter But probably not at the same frequency for now like maybe once a week instead of three times a week Just because it's like I mean you know I've got to keep the lights on so what we're what we're working on is we're going to be posting more vlogs on our second channel because Smile more and be happy just don't express your opinions guys go to our second channel ethen and Hila We're dropping some hot hot vlogs and having fun doing that YouTube still pays us for those we are very excited to announce that we're moving to H3 Podcast to Twitch TV. And we'll be live streaming It there it should be starting in a week or two so hop on over to our twitch TV If you can't make it don't worry, we're uploading it to our new H3 podcast channel Which [is] also in the description so go subscribe there it will be up there one day after it appears live on twitch It was just an important like wake-up. Call. I think to all of us because We were all so comfortable on YouTube, and so now we got to figure out new things but I think you know we will figure out new things and It it's not the end for us no f**k. No, but f**k no dude. Yeah This ... I feel like this video goes beyond complaining. Out of our last like eight videos, we've had only one video By the way, this is like PG s**t Here's a video that I just, I just typed pee on face right, There's another one, HIla: Look at the camera and tell the viewers, "guys this isn't real okay". Let's get back to the sketch Ethan: Right. So we originally called this video "Christian moms against dabbing" okay, and um, And we mentioned this group called Christian moms against dabbing And we briefly mentioned a Facebook group called Christian moms against dabbing So here's here's how I imagined it They have such tags as inappropriate language, They're even allowing brands now to opt out of content that is sexually suggestive, Ethan: Oh, "other." We can get by we can still make videos on our channel and Hila:  You say to George, "bye!" "Bye!"
