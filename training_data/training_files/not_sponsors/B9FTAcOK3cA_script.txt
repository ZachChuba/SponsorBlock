My mysterious heart Oh make your smile!
Ooh yeah Pretty flowers falling down outside Look at my reflection in the window My heart races, butterflies in my stomach All I can do is smile
(Make your smile, yeah!) Like a kid, with a heart that keeps skipping beats I¡¯m waiting for you When I blink, everything will change I¡¯m ready Up in the sky, the stars, stars, stars Follow the stars What if I find you, you, you Where should I go? Will you notice me? Shining like that star
I¡¯m Tinkerbell, aha aha I¡¯m Tinkerbell, aha aha
Feel me Where should I go? Will you notice me? Let love rain down, let us shine like that star I¡¯m Tinkerbell One spring day, maybe I¡¯ll see you I thought about how you¡¯ll smile Lovey-dovey with you, so cozy and cute We¡¯ll share a beautiful dream together
(Make your smile, yeah!) Like a kid, with a heart that keeps skipping beats I¡¯m waiting for you When I blink, everything will change I¡¯m ready Up in the sky, the stars, stars, stars Follow the stars What if I find you, you, you Where should I go? Will you notice me? Shining like that star I¡¯m Tinkerbell, aha aha On my search to find you It¡¯s strange and awkward
(Keeping my eyes closed) Dubi-duba, I¡¯m going to fly up to the sky Up in the sky, the stars, stars, stars
Follow the stars What if I find you, you, you Where should I go? Will you notice me? Shining like that star
I¡¯m Tinkerbell, aha aha I¡¯m Tinkerbell, aha aha
Feel me Where should I go? Will you notice me? Let love rain down, let us shine like that star My story for you
I¡¯m Tinkerbell
