[Music] yeah so old school runescape is in this weird limbo period right now where no one knows what's going on since old school is not getting any updates everyone's kind of sitting around twiddling their thumbs not knowing what to do with themselves people are burned out of this game and i know why this right here trailblazer league it was a great time you know you get the dopamine of the massive xp rates fast levels got this checklist to do and once all that was over we had to come back to our slow boring shitty accounts it's just a perfect recipe for a burnout so naturally when a player burns out of their favorite game they're looking for something else to do maybe even another game what game might spark the interest of a runescape player that's right ladies and gentlemen runescape for as long as i can remember all old school players have just been on the sidelines just pointing and laughing myself included very guilty of that not really knowing what's going on but it just felt right people are kind of turning their heads seeing what's going on over at runescape 3 because you know they've been getting updates too this whole time we've all been at old school just voting in polls making our voices heard trying to fight for pvp or new iron man pvm content but they've been there too they've been doing updates not very good ones recently very bad updates recently i would not ask them about the updates of their [ __ ] recently but that doesn't matter what does matter is that people have been logging on to runescape 3. old school players for the first time probably ever are beginning to migrate to the original game but you know i'm sitting here on my time-restricted account things are a little dull right now and you know i think i haven't given runescape 3 a fair shot people still play it there's got to be a few good things and i just want to say there is so much to unravel about this game i am not going to touch on things nearly as in depth as i'd like to i'm going to try and sprinkle a little everything in here but uh this game is packed there's gonna be things i wish i would have talked about later things that you wish i talked about we're just gonna dive in and see what movement and take care of your pair back to business the one thing runescape 3 players have been telling me is if i'm going to try it i should make an ironman that way challenges and bonus xp and easy money making doesn't get in the way of my experience like i said trailblazer league was the last thing to really pull us in the easy xp the fast money making the dopamine rushes of just seeing all of the numbers just go up so fast all the time that's why i'm here that's what i want i want that rush i want this runescape 3 easy escape experience that i hear so much about i'm not making an iron man i've got things to do i am here to be spoon fed xp items gp i think the true runescape 3 experience is allowing all of these uh frowned upon things take course and and let them happen so i guess uh we're gonna see what the 2021 runescape 3 experience is like the first thing i knew i needed to do was create the perfect character framed settled sofa they've been playing valorant and that is because they are obsessed with jet doesn't ring a bell let me show you she kind of looks like this and it's going to bring them to me hello runescape 3 thrives with cosmetics and character creation fashion scape all that not only did i want to maximize my xp through micro transactions but also my odds of getting free [ __ ] he's never been so [ __ ] satisfied by seeing a new player in his entire life hates to see her go loves to watch her leave okay i get it i'm right next to you don't need a wave yeah the fire is looking good that's a good looking fire i gotta be honest i also could have swore they removed tutorial island i remember that being like a big deal but apparently it's back i don't know if it's because i selected that i'm a brand new player and they'd put you here but this tutorial island is kind of [ __ ] pointless you may find some adventure in the cave under my house what the [ __ ] does that mean buddy maybe he worried that differently the combat is complex there's a lot of layers to it that i still don't understand vanica here basically said go click that rat and i was done there was nothing that happened after that no range training just one little melee rat kill good to go wait what he didn't teach me how to do anything when you get off tutorial island you're not in lumbridge you're in birth or i gotta give them props because they turned one of the least inviting ugliest cities in the game into a new player's paradise they've got a starting mining area combat area agility course a range a [ __ ] ton of trees you can do a lot with trees fishing spots a slayer master a slayer cave even no matter what direction you head there is something to do on a fresh account in birth or i can't be controlled i'm crazy now i can loot all of them at once that's so op how do you feel terrible i'm gonna puke i just murdered all of them i thought it was great in the moment but now i'm thinking about it a little too hard i hate my life let's go cook this is where the real fun starts we've got a bronze full helm i'm not wearing that yes dude i'm wearing it but you can't see it because i'm using my own face as my cosmetic can i get this out of my way please please i think as far as first impressions go the one thing that really bugged me is the interface good [ __ ] god the interface i have no idea what's uh what's going on every time i had to find out how to disable an action bar so i didn't have an empty floating thing on my screen i went cross-eyed trying to figure out how to get rid of it you can put anything anywhere you can [ __ ] destroy your screen however you'd like as cool as a completely customizable interface is it's awful i don't think a single player has figured out the right way to organize any of this let me explain to you what happened here over the years they've put so many menus and interfaces and icons micro transaction pop-ups and there was no way to organize it so rather than cleaning everything up taking some stuff out making it uh more appealable they were just like uh let's make them [ __ ] organize it they can they can deal with that put whatever menus in pop-ups i don't give a [ __ ] if a new player found this game and they had to google every five seconds of how to get rid of [ __ ] ability bar six seven and eight that's enough to make them leave and never come back there we go this guy is so [ __ ] touching on the combat of this game i kept the default combat bar for all three attack styles and just clicked on things which was fine with me because that's how i played the normal runescape the combat isn't that big of a deal yeah sit down oh he gave me what is this peanut butter and jelly he gave me a rabbit sandwich good old 5xp per cut that's what i'm talking about that's the old-school way that i like to see wait guys before we go we've got to do this [Applause] there we go here we go so here's how this [ __ ] thing works you get these keys from either doing challenges every day completing quests even just logging in gives you two and when you get these keys you open these chests here these chests have bonus xp cosmetics straight up cash and i gotta say it is pretty [ __ ] low whoever's running those campaigns because every time you use up your keys whether you just get two from a quest or two from logging in right away you get this interface that pops up telling you uh different ways to earn more keys buy keys earn keys which just redirects you to the buy page for the other rectangle buy bonds and right under that little [ __ ] of what you could possibly win with your next key if you buy them i would be completely hypocritical to criticize microtransactions i am guilty of buying way too many cs go cases and keys oh my god oh my god oh my god is that that track all the money back nice let's do it again after this i've purchased skins on valorent and even a chun-li skin on fortnite that is by far the most worth it purchase i've made the thing is is this is gambling mtx if you hit the jackpot on this thing it doesn't matter i mean you you get to reap the benefits in game but uh you still lost money buying keys i don't understand why it's even taunting players to buy more keys to get this uh 300 silverhawk feather drop worth four and a half mil six percent chance of that happening by the way when you can spend 35 bucks on five bonds which gets you 114 mil in game all that's telling me is that treasure hunter solely exists to take advantage of players who have a gambling problem people that find euphoria and dopamine of seeing a red or purple thing pop-up treasure hunter should a thousand percent be taken out of the game anyway um back to my rightful winnings so after my first quest i got two keys and i decided to open them my first key i opened the multiplier for some promotion they have going on that gives me double of whatever chest i open so the next chest i opened which was doubled uh was 80 springs i don't know what the hell springs are or what they do or who buys them but people do buy them because suddenly as an hour old account i had 160 springs worth 3 500 gp each 531k for doing the easiest quest in the game oh my god welcome to runescape 3 everybody so you know i'm streaming this while it's happening and a lot of people were telling me oh 500k is nothing in runescape 3. it's not that big of a deal that you have it i still have 500k on a brand new account i can buy all armor for the next four to five tiers already from shops i can get all the supplies i need i'm set my incentive to do skills gone wait why the [ __ ] am i doing this i have a billion dollars and i'm not an iron man i can just go buy this [ __ ] value of stack 1k i just killed a chicken what do you mean 1k what is it oh the raw chickens are 700 gp each i see all the bones are worth a lot any raw meat from animals they'll make you rich i guess summoning uses a lot of these things to make the pouches which lets low levels make money i don't know what invention is because you need 80 and three different skills that i'm not going to ever get to 80 to try it out but i'm assuming it uses a lot of materials too skills like this get put into the game and the economy balances out it really makes me wonder how runescape 3 presented this to the players to get it to pass the poll oh yeah that's right uh they don't [ __ ] do polls because they understand that most players have no idea how an mmo works we don't want everyone overhearing your assignment so i'm gonna write it down on this piece of paper if this dude hands me a note with his phone number on it i'm gonna [ __ ] log out kill 13 birds there's a lot of bird watching clubs around here and i would hate for them to know that i really want you to start massacring anything with the wings on it so as the quest guy i felt obligated to dive into some of these quests that i hadn't yet experienced and get a feel for what they've done with the old ones there is so much going on with the lore nowadays it's almost impossible to come back as an old player and try to take everything in what is this [ __ ] thing it's like the pit monster from star wars oh my god look at this spooky [ __ ] stop look my eyes are up here ghost my eyes are up here i hope this is still where i needed to go you guys have a basement around here you guys get rid of that thing what the [ __ ] is that jared are you gonna kill me now uh yeah what are you waiting for finish me okay [Music] felt like a lot to unpack but i did look up a strategic way to do the quest they told me to do these two christmas quests right off the bat i guess these christmas quests were like made permanent and as much as i love helping little orphan girls feel like she's a part of this abominable tribe of whatever these things are and decorating christmas trees in april wasn't into it i'm sure it's a great quest but i i couldn't give a [ __ ] good xp though really good xp also they added some voice acting to quests i remember them doing that a while back but uh i hadn't really heard them i i kind of wish they hadn't added that it's it's not very good wait listen to this guy talk what can i do for you oh my god that sounds like fake they couldn't find like an old guy to come in and voice act for him but yeah the more i got into it the more i wanted to bring my friends along the entire purpose of making my jet character was to lure my friends in had about a 33 success rate it worked on the one person i knew it would work on so i got kevin to play damn i'm like pac-man i'm meeting up these white dots [Laughter] except when i got him into the game we didn't do exactly what i had planned to do dude i feel really bad for you dude i love droughts

gonna put uh nothing in the well of goodwill because i deserve all of this money why do they not do that in osrs like why not have a permanent well of goodwill don't they have to donate actual money if we give it enough money yes yeah that's why they don't do it like you're actually a [ __ ] adventurer hero in this game because you just breathe fire out of your [ __ ] mouth yeah there's just so much going on like there's too much going on it's it's like literally it is just too overwhelming for god for people i think i don't get why ariana is doing this marianne whatever she just hates

swing it ah hot tub stream hot tub stream if you don't like it it's cause you're sexist come on let's go look at my feet and this is free we him got this i'm tanking oh yeah yeah he tanked him he doesn't give a [ __ ] about me he literally does not care that i'm punching him right now i'm literally just punching him he doesn't do anything maybe it's because he hasn't done any damage yet probably he's gonna hate when i do damage new giant mole killing method oh no my screen's turning red quick rest do it i think overall uh i had a good time on runescape 3. the key to enjoying it is approaching it as if it's an entire new mmo experience and i'll make it clear right now i am not doing by release on runescape 3. if you suggest that you have not thought that through for me you're selfish for suggesting that but maybe i'll come back to this game at some point who knows i don't know it was a fun time i liked it that's all i got i guess i'll see you guys around what the [ __ ] is that why is it getting dark what the [ __ ] just happened what are these jackass doing what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that thing the [ __ ] is going on is my mouth [ __ ] up again what the hell is that what the hell is that chet from cs go don't question nothing just csgo just does what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] thing what the [ __ ] is that what's that what the [ __ ] [Music] do [Music]
