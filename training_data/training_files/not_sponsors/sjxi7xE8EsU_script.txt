- what is this am i hearing an airplane coming here is it a bird is it a cyber truck is a Lamborghini so we called them then the magician here in the office because we have a joke that he can do anything and it's not really a joke because Dan was just like oh yeah I could probably shoot ok I could probably fix the Gatsby and we were like ok give it a try and then it did well now the door is broken but guess what then we'll fix it bad things happen when the Gatsby house everybody welcome to the h3 podcast Wow what a joy what a thrill to be here on this beautiful used what is today Tuesday Thanksgiving week what a treasure what a joy so much to look forward to with our friends and family and loved ones does everybody hate their family serious question before we get into that thank you to hating your families brought to you by Brooke Lennon and commanded does everybody hate their family like does anyone enjoy Thanksgiving dinner like genuine like 100% with all their heart because I feel like I hate love it don't ask me what do you guys think Ben does dan has like your normal family yeah I don't hate my family I'm not a big fan of Thanksgiving know why because the meat I mean sort of just I'm not a big fan of Thanksgiving food meat or broad well I don't that braz Affairs nothing I know people are gonna call me on American even Turkey let's be honest the worst the worst meat I mean it's just boring yeah I always hated turkey we're actually we're making brisket this year and I think I'm going to make the one exception you are I don't know I'm on the fence but I would what an exact do you like Thanksgiving or do you hate it [ __ ] hate it is it the family you hate or the face different kind of suck I it's the food I mean this year I'm gonna be with my girlfriend but we're going to you know with my family but it just there's always such a drama always such [ __ ] the drama the cleaning yeah someone always doesn't do enough and then the person that does too much is pissed terrible and then if you go to someone else's house the food it really sucks the turkeys do dry and then you everyone's a gossiping about how bad the food was yeah and it's always so awkward it's like thanks yeah Thanksgiving I say this Thanksgiving we all order Chinese food if I'm I thing is if you're spending time with your family and you really want to be with them order food ends your brighter said that is gonna make broccoli Kish and that is what I'm excited about I think I might hit that answer and I think from now on Thanksgiving should be about broccoli quiche just says then ADA this is the Native Americans once cooked Americans will hate me Ian do you hate being on the show because you never answer me every time we switched you people have commented on it that you always look miserable no no I like it thank you like it I like to like it well I like you too in and I like you being here but the question of the moment is do you like Thanksgiving I mean I'm inclined to like those guys my family they're cool it's just it's too close to Christmas it's a little double-dip and I think yeah like it's like good it's like the shitty band opening up for the act like you're really interested yes that's cool but that is kind of what's cool about it cuz it's like holy they seasoned and started it's the official people are taking time off and going places and doing stuff and buying stuff ft r ez yeah I mean ft r seems kind of harsh I mean it's still a band I hate this candy it's not candy it's a bandy and I don't understand the analogy I have an especial exciting announcement Danny's trying to fix the door let's get a shot of this I think I [ __ ] it up good man I actually knocked it off the hinge for sure it's off the gatsby's unfortunate this is awesome Emily's about it's not off the rails Bobby did Bobby took the whole frame off the wall I just stick the hinge off come on Dan you got it use all your strength this podcasters off of the hinge we're in but we're not getting out I think I don't think we're getting out off the hinge thank you perfectly thank you now guys we haven't had merch in a long long time it's been a long time since we've introduced h3 merch well just in time for the holiday seasons we have special limited time only at h3h3 shop calm let me show you what we've cooked up here today in spirit of the holidays and spirit of this beautiful team that we've assembled here on the on the podcast we have made a t-shirt to pay homage to each cast member you can pay homage to each cast member and and we're splitting the profits evenly with all of the cast members this is a elective this is a going to be a beautiful moment for everybody we are going five ways on this so let's see we want to take bets on which designs gonna sell the best so let's start with mine now I think mine is sell the worse and I'll tell you why yeah it's like it says Shalom everybody which is great and I love the dogs in the apartments for the outfit and then you've got a feeding window with bagels interracial if you don't understand bagel dough burger well from here next to a Jew it looks like bagels and that's what I understand but like I don't think many people are gonna wanna wanna rock walk around with shirt with like you know Jewish paraphernalia on it so unfortunately I kind of agree with you but I think the design is really funny if you have the balls to rock at home everybody then you're gonna look what if you're Jewish you might want to wear that to Hanukkah yes maybe you're Jewish it's a great shirt feel or if you're a goalie and you just want a four rep your nation I think it's a great shirt for you too I'm given I'm not saying you can't I'm just saying I think there's a lot of people that would not want to explain why they're wearing a shalom everybody shirt but the Hasidic Jew and dogs with yarmulkes on it now on to ILA's I'm over it I think this is gonna be the top seller and this one is just phenomenal it's got ela I'm over it and then in the Gatsby really blur its juming out of frame bro don't really blur spread each in this shirt is unbelievable that mobility blur is just genius come on and we have to give a shout-out to our boy Abe he does a lot of our merch she's a character he's a comedy genius and he is the pioneer the brain fine actually this one was done by should I say who did this Dan or never why don't you say who did this well a Abe did the original design and then there was an overhaul that my girlfriend actually did thank you know now we've got Dan the wizard cuz he fixes everything honestly and with a with a bag of chips now originally it was called devil's advocate and it was me as a little troll which I liked I just like you know myself as a little troll with with demon tusks but this one is is clearly much better if you could see the old ones you would understand no apologies to Abe the concept was beautiful but honestly yeah we got to go to break it says so dance is really wearable stanzas are is a is a really good option now this one is kawaii as [ __ ] this one with my Abe Dan the salaried employee Hawaii yeah Indian god Danny Valerie employee white eyes and cheeks I gotta pee so bad in the cellar employee The Bachelor everybody loves and Kanye as well who made that Wow guy named kuba sent it to us once he upgraded to a salaried employee we needed a new new vertical [Music] beautiful stunning so I think that one is gonna do very well and now Ian made this one and I'm like Danny and what am I paying freelancers for what any Mayo the Joker is that white paint or Mayo in her face AK odd I guess it's left for the imagination I guess no it's up for interpretation so this one actually is awesome there they all are right now at h3 h3 4.com it's perfect for gifts it's perfect for yourself it's a perfect stocking stuffer it's a perfect stocking I don't know anything about Christmas but if you head on over to a spacious yeah we're calling them stalkers I forgot that they're stalking yes so there you have it guys the five holiday shirts only now limited time only available for two weeks will be in time for Christmas and everybody gets paid so now if in I know we only pay him $1 a month we'll actually have an opportunity to make a little bit of money lord knows that's right so yeah he needs it badly I've been hearing I need that second dollar I've been hearing really hard times for in the salaried employee so that'll be fun looking forward to seeing if I'm just being honest I think it's going to be ela and in are the top sellers what do you guys think I I kind of agree I think you look evil us definitely that's gonna be number one you know I think that I hate voting for myself but I didn't make it I just thought about a design design with that mobility blurs I mean and you're awesome everybody would love CeeLo too so that helps but I think Dan's gonna be a bit of a dark horse though I like it honestly is pretty mainstream at this point playing I don't like my refer to it mine is you there can be number two or lost people just want to rep the nature you know what I mean the people just want to support the host the leader the God really if I'm gonna be humble about it so I do think that mine will either get to or last shredder Alfredo with the little I love that I mean come on I mean come on right so but we shall see there you have it h3h3 shop calm cheese cheese let's see let's get this out of my face today mother effers we've got a special episode mm boy you we got a lot of [ __ ] from last week's episode people get angry when I show I can't show videos but we talk about elective McDonald's fights mm-hmm so we shouldn't do that anymore people were really upset oh so some people say suggest just putting the links in the description so long I mean is it or what we still get in trouble for them no you won't get in trouble but I just don't think it's a good idea oh really - link - like no to talk about something you can't show I agree I think in general I I I kind of already had that feeling before we were gonna do it I thought that they would enjoy hearing the the sound of a man battle through a glass window but it's not his noise yeah well the more you know what else we had a lots of other feedback people were scared I think people are just generally scared about shoenice yeah we got a bunch more to come on that but before we get to that I want to get to the Papa John pizza reckoning now it's been a dark time and the Pizza halls of fame order pizza category Papa we haven't heard from in a while we tried desperately to get an interview from with him I want him on the show he just did an interview which is making waves in media and this is just some nobody if he came on this show we could really talk about pizza slice by slice you know what I mean we could take this we could take this story slice by slice if I did a documentary about Papa jonno called slice one for chapter one mm-hmm very poetic thank you so there is a lot to break down here but he is he's coming hard for these people who took his pizza throne and the first thing I want to point out is that he's so wet it's kind of like I don't wet here he's kind of like you see like I'm full if a person could be a pizza right that's how much of a pizza guy he is he's like I have become I'm like you know how you're like sis or bi or whatever he's pizza that's his orientation they gotta add a P LJ Thank You P plus P for Papa John pizza P plus um why is he so wet though for real he just came fresh out of the oven he does say in this interview that he's eaten 40 pizzas in the past 30 days and I think at a certain point you just start sweating pizza grease but let's go ahead and hear from the Papa God himself I mean this is a much-anticipated we've all been waiting breaking the silence her dream the people that I care about I love that I've made multi-millionaires would do what they did it was the cart reversal I need to point out that that is not a Papa John uniform this guy cannot put away the past he's where it is it's a closest shirt you could possibly find to looking like a Papa John uniform that's not what is that logo - it's not a fashion brand it's just unrelated it says Jeff baseball oh that's that's a yeah you never heard Jeff baseball no he literally just found a shirt that looks like the red work well yeah pop John this is Jeff baseball I'll stick the papa of Pizza looking back now do you think that you were set up oh there's no question about it and in the public knows that this do you think they intentionally had a block due to interview him because he got outed for saying the n-word a bunch so they're probably like let's see what you know let's put his let's put his pizza to the in the let's put his feet in the pizza oven that black guy let me go back because I don't miss a word set-off oh there's no question about it and the public knows that this is I love that the public knows that yeah it's such a big a story I love that he thinks that every public is bawling just pizza stories no but he used to be a big shot used to do uh used to be the sole sponsor the NFL used to do commercials with like mega celebrity Peyton Manning is that who I don't know who these football players are yeah Peyton Manning I guess he's a big deal this is John Schneider side of the story and it's loaded nothing so loaded with olives it's loaded with that free topping loaded ism is a pizza reference you say fully loaded in the truth sooner or later all comes out for the first time starter is talking publicly about the firestorm that forced him to walk away from the company on there he built into one of the nation's largest pizza chains they made this all up they fabricated it and shame on them it all started in May of 2018 sinara admits he used the n-word during what was supposed to be an internal conference call on diversity training he used the n-word on a conference call about diversity training because he got in trouble for using the n-word because he got yeah because he caught in trouble for saying racist stuff right then I mean I think I'm saying no no it wasn't he already in trouble before the n-word thing no I don't think so but I mean it was diversity training yeah not a good time to bring up the n-word I don't think there's a really a good time to bring up the n-word and take that from me as someone who said that n-word and uh it wasn't a good time then either no stay away from that one folks do you think Papa John says then where when he does rap songs in the shower and I'm thinking probably sister country music he doesn't if I had to guess Garth Brooks you think he says the n-word in country music yeah all races ass country music I like that but says he did it to convey his hatred of racism he says in charters use that as an opportunity to push him out I just didn't know what what happened from people on the inside doing this I thought it would come from the outside and he's willing to name names Steve Ritchie and Lilly currently the board of directors all used the black community in race as a way to steal the company and they stole the company and now they destroyed the company Steve Ritchie was snotter's hand-picked replacement but after years of friendship the two were now is strangely Olivia curtly is a Papa John's board member living Carly and Mark Shapiro should be in jail well that's that bad what they've done is just and they've heard a lot of people Ritchie resigned as CEO earlier this year but Schneider is still critical of his former Protege is leadership everybody knows what that person's make it everybody knows last year that Steve Ritchie got six million dollars plus 2.8 million to leave and be quiet and they got zero bonus they all know that and sooner or later they you know who wants to play that game in February understand what he was missing I think what are you saying is that all the lower workers are upset yeah because they brought in a new CEO and he gets paid like whatever he just said 8 6.8 million seem like that much for the CEO of like the biggest pizza chain but the workers from their perspective get nothing so I think that's what he's saying but Papa John was making more than that and they were making the same amount of money then I in one year papa he's like a millionaire for a CEO to get paid in one year and that's a lot CEOs like a lot of big companies that's a lot I guess that is a lot by golly my colleague Jeff Smith was named chairman of the board and Schneider says there's not a lot of common ground the one thing he and I agree on is that Steve rich is not a CEO we that's one thing we do agree on the new CEO is former Arby's president Rob Lane oh they brought in the RB CEO president Oh president so he wasn't even which he calls him out for that too it's not even what are yo material do was gonna happen to Arby's without their president what's gonna happen man imagine poaching the dude from the wolf shittiest food on the planet earth to come work for your pizza place or didn't I start putting roast beef on there he's never been a CEO he has no pizza experience he's never been in the pizza category that's a dismal harpy's that feel like he doesn't have the passion for quality he's like have you had Arby's I love that he has never been the pizza category he hasn't you can't just go from roast beef sandwiches to pizza you got to be in the pizza category for at least ten years but I have to say in Shatner's Papajohn Shetty's defense we have gotten Papa John's since he was ousted and it's not as good I swear I got it weak I wasn't even slide wasn't even cut the pizza sucked it was like a f tear when Papa John was in office with Bo in the house that Pizza wouldn't an a every time sometimes SS careful with SS controversy that's I mean that's up for John for Papa John to decide if he's SS or not I've been watching a lot of Hitler documentaries on Netflix yeah it's fascinating I was watching one about these war criminals who are like there were so many should I is this a tangent but it's a plus material here papa original you know just as an aside quickly did you know that like of the two million Nazi war criminals who exterminated people like only 100 of them ever went to jail like the Germans didn't prosecute anybody it's interesting fascinating one men even say it's fascinating okay okay bloomer how dare you say that to me he doesn't have a passion for people all changes Chartres says he hates people fashion front for people by the way Papa John Shetty's the one when the health care reform committee bomb you know is that I refuse to raise my pizza prices by two cents to give my voice the health care coverage yeah talk about a passion for people though so far he's called him out on not being CEO material not caring about quality are being about people right and not even the pizza category and being in the pizza category he's like when you look at him what do you see a dry face looking at what do you see greasy wet I'm soaking what that's what pizza cat I look hot out of the shower but the last time I shout was a week ago Blaine that you got a sweater we don't that's right which spy ring they've heard people that wake up every day and make this company great I mean it's a miserable place over there I mean they're losing all their good people this is good people does anybody specifically told you that and I love it cause about what they're miserable I've talked to every high-level executive that's left it's like well so many people on the streets yet exactly and we're talking to half a dozen executives I mean they've lost more executives in the last 12 months than I did in 10 years and after years of touting better ingredients better pizza Snyder says it's ultimately the customers who are left with the bad taste in their mouths I've had over 40 pizzas in the last 30 days and it's not the same pizza Papa Johnny boy here has this guy's my hero 40 pizzas over 30 days how is that possible let Mesa go look at him that means ten days of the last month he had pizza twice I think he just hate orders Papa John's you know what I mean mmm interesting I think he's hate ordering Papa John's is like okay let's see how let's order it from this branch and this branch you think in this very diverse know that he doesn't work there anymore yeah I don't know what happens to the tip no the tips not so big anymore I wonder if because he was all proud of the Papa John calm and now it's not even his Ari tips them big and he's like joined the movement I'm gonna cut net you know what I was thinking I was like dude you're billionaire just go start another pizza joint but I was like he can't even use his own name cuz they own his name dude today Papa John it's the name of the company you should start one in the name of Bo Bo's in the house yeah I'd buy that I'd buy the effin love and crap out of that the same product it just doesn't taste as good the way they're making the pizza the way they're putting the pizza together is just not fundamentally sound to what makes the Papa John's Pizza Papa John's Pizza it sounds like you're saying that that it's taking a huge hit since your departure would you ever consider or do you want to go back right now I don't want to go back but this is still your baby it's got your name on it your point stuff on it it's hard to watch this I mean every single thing you can possibly do wrong to mismanage this company they're doing even pick the location because everything is red you're on him yeah why would they shoot in this auditorium whatever it is in stock and is no longer the largest individual shareholder my metaphor is there's no reason to be in the car when the car crashes even if you love the car if you were to walk back in there's no big car crashing though cuz I remember when we checked the stock it was going on up when they hired Shaq which by the way I think Shaq I haven't seen him on a Papa John it's in a while I mean I've not heard of Papa John's Pizza since you left quite frankly Papa John stock price oh let's look at year-to-date other there they're doing good actually oh they're on the rebound but man yeah Papa I mean sorry to tell you John you slammed that stock like sure this is the stock in the last five years this they were killing it this was Papa John City then also a Shatner starts dropping the n-word and diversity training and then like yeah I'll see you later and then this is when they hired Shaq everyone loves Shaq oh but maybe we don't like Shaq and the pizza stuff but then suddenly I don't know what happened Arby's president came to a picture Rob Lynch is the CEO actually that the big drop was in 2017 right right here yeah yeah the the n-word controversy was in 2018 sure he was actually dropping before that so it's that little I know that's why they fired him though cuz he was already blowing it cuz he was there was a lot of Papa John controversy right i refresh myself way down the NFL NFL was Bo he said he didn't want people in he'll because it was affecting pizza sales one [ __ ] shut up idiot that's broke you want to control what the NFL does because you're shut up because he was a big sponsor of the NFL and he felt like their business was suffering because of the association because controversy going on yes yeah that's when they started to you know there's a lot of stocks to buy on the market I just can't imagine investing a Papa John's to become with they were doing it's just I don't know you want to be in the pizza game me I'm not in the pizza category like owning Jule stock or some [ __ ] it's like it's the pizza category you're right okay let's get back to the NS CEO what do you think the employees would say if the management team was out leave and I went back you know they'd be they be cheering maybe even backflips they'd be bouncing off the walls I'm now was up on the street says he's committed to giving back he recently made big donations to Simmons a historically black college and his alma mater Jeffersonville High School this is Jeff hi there I started mistake John he made donations to black colleges and that's what the shirt is to okay oh but you know that it looks like that because he made them change it to look like puppets on Jersey he bought them on the observation is that we're gonna change everything to red yeah I mean Papa John has weight here too right it's identical I would just say stay tuned the day of reckoning will come boom the record will be straight why not set the record straight now I mean what is it about the record a sincerely sorry stay to the joke costume stay tuned sooner than later the day of reckoning is that man maybe it's a boy working on a new brand he says the more he says the truth will come out though so it's some kind of expose did I never works out whenever people say that they got nothing Matt Hoss said that like five years yeah I'll still wait just wait you know would be epic if Papa John just murdered a bunch of people and that's what he was talking about they're like damn we should have known the day of reckoning is that an how would Papa John check out what dance and dominoes stock yeah it's blown away by how valuable dominant stock is in comparison oh wow dude what $300 for share oh they took a [ __ ] though let's look at that let's see if there's any correspondence Oh Domino's is killing it huh well yeah wow they really since 2016 I was a good time to buy Domino's seriously holy [ __ ] and three years their stock value tripled Domino's is good I got to tell you I've been getting Domino's huh a pizza no dominoes dominoes dominoes pizza [ __ ] and little seizures so there you go puppies in the house he's making threats and what can I say that's meme quality Mikey can you can't do an interview without shaking the whole world dude it was all over 3,000 views and when I woke up this morning is that six million I think I think in in Papa John's mind he thinks that people are just the public cares about his story and not the fact that he just looks like a greasy sweat pizza it doesn't matter not to Papa just why does the Papa John come on the show I think there was a moment when he we were able to maybe get him no never when there was somebody that reached out that said that they can maybe get him on yeah we yeah be able to say that kind of stuff oh yeah well I wish it well I just want the old pee Papa John Pizza back cuz right now it sucks it really does suck Pizza has taken a strong lead in the Pizza wars and the day reckoning is at hand just fire bombs Papa John headquarters kills 300 people blocks all the doors from the outside we're like wow that's what he meant ok fascinating now let's move on let's talk about you nice we gotta take a break that was really when we come back we're gonna close the book on shoenice we got to decide what are we gonna do about the shoenice situation how do we address this what do we think about this and a special little twist that you guys are gonna love stay tuned do not look away the day of reckoning is coming right after this commercial break promo code h3 Brooklyn these are the best sheets ever hey guys we're back people always ask why we running if we're not live why do we act like we're live catch my breath because I was running because we are live technically we are basically recorded like we're live so the deal is that we want to we want to get it all done at once so then there's no editing so Ian back there is live switching and clicking and then when we're done boom it's done and we upload it and I like the live feel it's raw it's live it's the same show you we don't edit it there's no cuts I might just go off the rails right now but I'll keep it in we don't cut right Dan right 99% of time we have yeah we should all the stores we have had to cut yeah what did we cut before we've cut when when we knew something was gonna get hit for copyright okay yeah actually you know what's great is the reason that we're actually not doing it live yeah because people get blocking it not claiming it blocking it right and we have sponsors so we can't afford to just not have the video up so now what we do is we upload it unlisted and we can see if there's any claims if there are any claims we just cut it out and then upload it the next day you go but it's live baby we are here run into the bathroom running out of breath it's all happening shoenice now a lot of people a lot of people in space and why did shoenice flip on you yeah he was clearly happy to be on the show when he was here but then after the show it was all about i trolled h3 ethan is such a dick you know I got him I always went and we were wondering like what his that was that part was intact but he keeps going with it and it's looking like I don't know anymore just doesn't look right whatever is going on well there was one really insightful comment actually that I'll read to you guys that is the most plausible explanation that I've seen so here it is this was written by Ken Tama shoenice possibly has borderline personality disorder or bipolar again I'm not here to diagnose the guy but the rest the rest is what makes sense my father's very similar with mood swings shoenice is probably angry that you touched on some very personal and touchy issues for him and that it was all a troll video was his way of trying to broadcast a sense of control of the issue to show that he isn't embarrassed or weak and that he's a winner it's probably a mindset that he has subconsciously bought into over the years in order to stay afloat and keep his life moving again I've seen the same behavior from my father who had very similar life experiences this shoenice aka broken family drug and alcohol abuse war trauma and from my perspective he's angry that you were able to get so close to his personal demons and feels humiliated that people are pitying him I realize just now that I initially wrote the wrong disorder this is an edit I'm just committed now though they can share a lot of similarities depending on the circumstance well you know what let's not read the whole edit but I thought that was an interesting analysis that he's embarrassed or he doesn't want he's overcompensating so he doesn't feel weak or pitied or something so that's his way to take control of the situation and it's mine he's like I told you I wasn't so and furthermore he seems to be obsessed with the fact that we didn't even pay him from a trade straight I'm in a train station in Denver Colorado and I got you bro I love that bought me a four loco by the way there's this crazy channel called shoenice deleted videos with like the most dedicated hater of all time jealous and frustrated shoenice wants undeserved payout from h3h3 after almost 0 bumps and views I wonder if she oh nice deleted is sure nice himself if he'd what if it's oh that was my theory I think she nights is shoenice deleted video because who would be this dedicated yeah and then so he'll posted on shoenice erase it and then reposted the shoenice deleted and I wonder if in his mind he thinks he's getting double views or something but they're also like if he is if this is this channel it's super depressing because look at the titles shoenice is mad at h3h3 and he's on the streets pretending he's famous jealous and frustrated shoenice wants undeserved payout shoenice drunk humiliated damage control after HD podcast embarrassment I don't know the titles are like super brutal yeah the whole thing is just kind of I just don't know his world was going on yeah shoenice humiliation damage control part 1 sure nice is pissed that h straights tree exposed and humiliated him I don't think we humiliated him that's the bad thing no we didn't humiliate him I thought we all had a good time yeah and so I feel like only in his mind he would he see it that way I don't think there's anyone that cares enough to do this except him I feel that this has to be shoenice but be that as it may he's clearly upset that we didn't pay him first time we don't pay any of our guests but we wanted to find a way to compensate him we wanted to find a way to bury the hatchet and so what we did is we went over to shoenice his cameo and we purchased everybody here in the office a cameo from shoenice to celebrate this holiday season Danny and Zach ela and myself all got a special shoenice cameo so guys if you want your own shoenice cameo you know where to go it's cameo dot scott ever [ __ ] cameo but shouts assurance so Dan this is for you so listen boy yeah enjoy hey Daniel knows everything about editing yeah Logan Paul tried to comp him and look at his podcast a joke were you gonna do either way thanks for buying me Danny's guys tink ya know each cameo cost 10 bucks so we gave him 50 bucks essentially although I wonder what cameos cut is a good point like 25% or something probably yeah might be less I was he he got real nice in the cameras I was expecting more [ __ ] talk he just [ __ ] talks Logan Paul and like every cameo for some reason there's one for Ian in happy Holidays to you from show night hey everyone shoenice again well basically this is a shout out to intern Ian the dude is no joke but you better listen to Daniel he will bust your ass like you give us Jake Paul's ass there from whatever that thing was called

shout-out to Zack one of the greatest producers anywhere known on any podcast Wow that I can pull he's nuts yeah yeah there you have it your cameo turned quickly into an insult to Logan Paul I'm honored you should be yellow this is once for you I got worried about this one because you kept making really weird sexual comments about ela but I think he kept it clean for you though hey everyone shoenice again well basically this cameo is just a shout out my really good friend Neil a really good writer way that prettiest girl on YouTube makes jenna Marbles look like a poodle either by doing what oh wait I got me killed yeah he what's it almost got me killed him Oh probably because he was saying rude [ __ ] wrong everyone almost killed him I don't know but I find that he has a hard time complimenting somebody without insulting somebody I know it's like you're the best and this person is worse compared to you so Jenna Marbles I'm not sure what she did to incur the wrath of the shoe and me I was most nervous of all for this one I was expecting like ethan klein this is your address I'll see you tonight at 10:00 8:00 p.m. no but he hey everyone shoenice again well basically I just want to shout out my boy Ethan good boy Jake Paul and his brother here's the song here oh yeah all right I wouldn't I'd be lying I think it's time to put the shoe in the box to pay less by the way um um it's so funny on cameo oh dude he's got a [ __ ] ass load he sold 500 review that's a lot this guy's active four point nine stars to the man love Shoei um the weird thing about cameo is that every cameo they make is public you can watch them on his neck so determined dog shoe yes in a way it's good to keep people from getting weird on the platform actually that's all very transparent it's right there it's actually up to the person ordering whether or not you want it to be no because they're they're celebrities I mean and if they do show their dick then you get what you paid for I'm just not sure if that's what can you know why show me his dick for 10 bucks maybe for 20 I don't do I have the option of paying more damn I didn't see I didn't see a way yeah it's just an extent there's no negotiating I'll say show me your dick or buy another one he's actually making a lot of money from this let's see what this who's this guy YouTube star Cameron Karl let's see what he has to say to his fans I love this [ __ ] dude can you start closer to your face what is this if you want to shout for your birthday Christmas whatever but you know speaking of so that's it we're as ela said this time to put the shoe back in the box are we getting a refund are we just putting at Natick i just storage some did you save the receipt no are you donating it to Goodwill are you keeping it I just put it in a storage unit sword unit that means it'll probably go in the garbage in a couple of years but you're not ready just yet yeah yeah what kind of shoes are they like like Nikes adidas it's like used up Reebok not good yeah Reebok used lots of mileage lot of mileage yeah speaking of cameo one of my favorite stories of the decade came out of cameo you remember mark McGrath from Sugar Ray popular band when I was a kid bad app I'm bumper how's it going every morning's and combated embedded it that you know that song I just got claimed because I was so pretty perfect every morning as ransom bad medicine bit you guys know what I'm singing right touch no a baby don't say a word every morning shut the door baby don't say a word Sugar Ray every girl wanted to all the guys wanted to be him and all the girls wanted to [ __ ] and now he now he all a lot of these handsome guys I'm I found you know they say the trope is that men age more gracefully than women and I and I and I would say that you know I see the blood they mean by that but a lot of these pretty boys try so desperately to hold on to their looks and they don't they refuse to age gracefully and I think now they don't embrace the aging yes and they still try to look like when they were eggs back then rule bro he's like 50 and he still got frosted tips like that that's doesn't work anymore I'm Frost the tips you know what I'm saying but so mark McGrath is on cameo for $100 by the way his net worth is estimated at like 8 million mm-hmm why the [ __ ] would you do a cameo for a hundred bucks but wait see you watch I don't know everyone is on carrion so it's so easy just do it in your spare time dude seeing it's it's public it's like dog you're not okay I don't know it's good for some people but it's like your mind come on Sugar Ray it's kind of great for a lot of people like tuna you know consider doing cameo Danny and Zac it's great for you guys you guys world make some money on that and you see so just a minute ago you said I wouldn't do it but they should do it I just think it's not it's not for you without you know cameo man I want to see you guys on cameo I'll do it back you could play little tunes for people 25 bucks Ian would you do it I'm cool thank you Wow okay - good exactly what is that would you eat like a spoonful of mayo for 25 no that happy birthday anyway mark McGrath accepted a cameo request for a hundred dollars a girlfriend wanted to break up with her boyfriend via mark McGrath his favorite band so imagine getting this cameo from your favorite artist saying that your girlfriend wants to break up with you I mean you got to see this it's like it's amazing it is mark McGrath from the band sugar ray off the charts but always in your hearts is oh by the way all of his cameos he says off the charts but always in your heart hey thanks bro he's like branding himself are they off the charts I mean I don't think they've been on they are off the charts oh is that but in your heart okay so he's yeah I thought he was saying like off the chart no off the chart okay so I approve that I like it what do you think about the hair you look and I feel like I'm watching a fear factor you

wants you to know that you mean a lot to her you mean the world to her but she's having difficulty staying in this long-distance relationship I'm you know it's tough I've been on the road for years and I've been with my wife a long time and the biggest arguments the biggest you know obstacles in our relationships is the distance between us it makes it very difficult when around the road and it's hard so Cheyenne is trying to let you know brain that it's very very tough for her to stay in this relationship she still cares about you a lot you never know what the future may hold and she still wants to be friends with you because obviously she cares did she give him all that information he must but I think he is improvising like you don't know yeah there's not an ounce of humor in this that's what's striking to me is that he sees himself as a legitimate mediator here and it keeps going man he just he keeps going but I understand you know you gotta work on your thesis and life goes on and you know I'm sure there's big things ahead of you in the future Braden but Cheyenne cares about you got a great day let you know I wonder if he's gonna get a slew of breakup video requests now I kind of want to get one for you for April Fool's video from a divorce [ __ ] breakup a divorce video from mark McGrath hey Ethan so ela wanted to tell you that she has given me the papers yeah and I do have a black pen here for you you just need to sign this the papers are in your nightstand eva has moved out already here's the address it's already pre and look is this maybe a little hard but

passed away it was a quick but I did hear that you're a fan of me so you're a fan of me so we thought that would soften the blow so I'm honored that your fan but yes this your mother is dead so would they already had the funeral they didn't want to tell you you know and it is your fault that that Mexican food you made for her was too spicy and she blew out her colon so she apparently broke up because of their long distance the kind of sounds like an excuse yeah of course it's an excuse you got mark McGrath so someone's phone oh yes phone is not muted I swear to god it's on do not disturb

the style yeah this was cool in the 90s or whenever he was Oh to see now he's now he's what do you think about that it his nips are really like showing with a lot of tattoos you know they got successful on a fluke it was a fluke song what does that mean so like when they they were originally a punk band and they came out with this song fly which is like I just wanna fly that's where that's omputer oh is that like a goof song in the exactly was Jenny became the goof exactly he got lost in the thaw exactly so that's why they made that like reggae type either do you like the frosted tips and goatee look or not I hate the girl thing the goatee was such a thing that's my problem such an awesome look back then yeah what is this put your shirt down look at this picture of Ashton Kutcher why doesn't let me scroll up man I like it I can't you guys it doesn't let me go up all right I'm out I don't know look at Ashton Kutcher just with this shirt up like who'd you rather [ __ ] mark McGrath or Ashton Kutcher go ahead is it not obvious no I don't know I think rooster oh you write it stir hmm no insane I won't fly I think that's kind of like unquestionable no he's um he was a model yeah yeah but he's also wasn't what what did he do something like that okay just looks like I did with the goatee yeah hmm don't know insecure since you said you want to [ __ ] oh sure I don't mind if I can do one just being on let's get off this well Don asked me this question King no I'm glad you answered honestly it was interesting Jesus we'd rather [ __ ] astronaut you're too nice honestly let's not use the f-word no I'm kidding I'm not insecure I'm just deeply disappointed cuz you're secretly into um mark mark I want to I want to I was jealous of his hair because back then in middle school second if I only had frosted tips and short hair I would have a girlfriend right now and the reason that I'm not don't have a girlfriend cuz I have curly hair only yeah but today who's got the better hair you there you go [ __ ] you mark [ __ ] ass on cameo loser I should make him say like you've got the best hair mark McGrath congratulations on having awesome hair you cannot be super jealous now you know well that was fun if you guys by the way come up on any other crazy cameos I want them I live for these candies I want to just inject it into my veins I love crazy wacky crazy that is what else we got Star Wars okay Mandalorian amazing I love the Mandalorian it feels like Star Wars it feels like Star Wars everything about it it's gritty it's awesome it's not overly campy as perfectly can't be it's fun it's exciting it's got baby Yoda I would literally I think I would kill my cousin for baby Yoda a cousin I would kill a cousin I was I was going down the list of family members like mom no dad like well no not really he is my dad after all and then I was a cousin yeah I'd killed cousin I probably kill all of them for baby Yoda what is the what's the scenario why would you if someone was like you hat you here's a gun you have to kill one or the other hmm I would kill my cousin for sure I would probably kill my whole extended family you're gonna buy that baby you'd emerge chain but the reason that I'm talking about how great the Mandalorian is is because the new the final Star Wars of the new trilogy the rise of Skywalker came out and I have to say I don't [ __ ] care about this stupid-ass trilogy these movies the mandalorian as far as I'm aware is the new Star Wars like watch how stupid the [ __ ] is and I'm so over these movies watch y'all dumbasses they release this being like oh this is awesome this is a hyper click first of all this feels like a generic action movie no that's all it is and you'll see the dialogue just makes me want to die [Music] why would it do that like that the new make sense I hate that I hate that it's awful it's horrible it's not funny I hit all those characters and by the way the guy who's driving the thing who's like they fly now and the first one he was fine and the second one he was so obnoxious so unlikable I hate that character I hate everybody there I hate the [ __ ] even local actors know the character yeah the actor I've no beef with ya you know in the mandalorian it's all perfect amazing uncontrived well great pace episode and thrilling story it's so good I like it I like it I like it I like it I like I like I like I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I I'm over it I'm over it I like it I'm over it I like I'm over it I like a kiss cheers cheers Cheers I like it I'm over it I like it I'm over it Cheers fascinating over years doesn't this look so awful it's so I I saw it and I immediately erased it from my memory I'm so glad that they made the mandalorian and I'm so glad they gave it to John far for it's his name Avril Favreau because this is a Talent this is a guy who lives in British Star Wars and comic books and fantasy this is a guy who who cares about the craft and the Star Wars universe he honors the Star Wars that people know and love this is a bastardization this should never have been made the Mandalorian is the real Star Wars I love it I approve this is trash I hate everything about it they fly now and we still haven't seen the bill bar cameo oh yeah bill burr Mandalorian I'm waiting for that enemy of the show you know you say friends of the show bill burrs enemy of the show I'm kidding of course no Neela's like mmm enemy at the show that's a very American [Applause] [Music] I want to know why they're I mean I guess maybe I'll make sense in the movie but as for [ __ ] stormtroopers why are they running away from four stormtroopers I know those guys can't shoot for [ __ ] and raise a [ __ ] Jedi No right just own them just take out your lightsaber and murder them there's probably more back there do some 11 who cares the movie sucks they are awful I mean the last Star Wars was joy look at trailers this is awful there's just a teaser it's not really a trailer I like a Z I hate it I'm over it I like it too slow Zack so um you guys all been watching Mandalorian right yup I'm caught up love it hate it think it's okay I'm still liking it then are you starving it's true are you just eating I heard you live up to the man man are you starving I'm hungry it's true we starting late again he's always eating chips back here yeah it's it's authentic what flavor you got these spicy queso they're gonna say are a little it's a little disappointing the jalapeno ones we're good I'm getting a while before your heart I know I'd me too meeting way too many of these chips that's right you're healthy boy you're vegetarian you know what it is it's like with the I quit the no that's true appetite suppressant well that's got to be better for you than that slamming chips and I think maybe it's true might be a net neutral we're all very proud of you by the way good in banking that's great news don't go and die on me I mean I need you died like from a heart attack from eating or what I mean ships no from vaping oh oh don't go get a double lung transplant that happened to some poor bastard who was vaping you had to get a double lung transplant no I think I think it's been pretty much confirmed now that it was it was all down to the THC stuff not the not the drool pods by year but don't lie you've been you were spooked to smoke that [ __ ] a little bit but I also just wanted to quit so it was it was sort of like the last little push yeah it was a good reason to finally do it I mean I started doing month right it's been longer than yeah dan stop when we was already running at that point I think that was the last day that I completely cool Star Wars oh this is a this is such an awesome story I'm not even - you know incredible it's amazing it's like entertaining it's got twists it's got turns this is something that you think only happens in movies but the biggest jewelry heist in history took place recently and traced in Museum it's estimated that the thieves grabbed a billion euros a billion euros worth of jewels that's insane it's like the biggest heist by far of all time it's so incredible I've got these visual aids here here's an amateur album as I as I so here's the case that they this was like the biggest collection of medieval jewelry owned by kings and all this in Europe and you could see that wasn't necessarily medieval was more like 18th century yeah honestly oh this this by the way look at this one million dollar coin whoa isn't that awesome they stole that [ __ ] by so look at this diamond oh look at this [ __ ] okay nice whoa that's a surah but what can you doing it now oh so I'll get to that and this is like some huge teardrop diamond pen oh my god so they stole all this [ __ ] and so much more a billion dollars let me read you that the facts of this here there's a video of it um let me play the video cuz there's no sound and I'll read you the the facts jack so here they are the details of this heist is amazing and my favorite the green vault my favorite part of this heist is that they were reportedly extraordinarily tiny people right because there was just a hole they pried open in the bars was the size of a head huh so they they you know like in these heist movies they go and get like some Vietnamese from Jesus it really uh some hot little twink oh yeah they literally did that in Ocean's eleven yeah they got they got a little Vietnamese like trapeze twink really yeah suitcase yeah and so they they literally did that that's all that should do so so let me read you the details thieves in German city of Dresden have broken into one of Europe's largest collections of art treasures making off with three sets of eighteenth-century jewelry of immeasurable worth and what Germany has described as the biggest such theft of all time the popular German daily build says the thieves grabbed jewels worth 1 billion euros the dramatic heist took place on Monday after a fire broke here's where it gets crazy a fire broke out and an electrical disturbance deactivated the museum's alarms and plunged the area into darkness German media described the strikingly small thieves who managed to get through a tiny hole to enter the vault as leaving behind bulky objects such as vases and pain mmm-hmm the correspondent for german broadcast described the whole the thieves got through as being no larger than my head that's crazy the thieve the break-in only lasted a few minutes the emergency call was made at 5:59 a.m. the police arrived at 5:05 a.m. six minutes afterwards but may 6 six minutes later five four five I understand that I said it wrong 559 a.m. and the police arrived at 5:05 a.m. they say that right no you didn't know how do 5:05 know four one nine five Oh what did I say 59 ok 459 they arrived at 505 6 minutes ok now it makes the police arrived a mere 6 minutes after the emergency called but the thieves had already fled the scene Wow investigators ago for oh so the investigators linked the same gang stole a estimated 4.5 million dollar coin from the Museum of Berlin in 2011 that was third item 17 did this and the heist the burglars used a ladder to steal the huge gold coin featuring the bust of Queen Elizabeth the second that's when I showed you I think on the front from the bode museum according to the build up to a billion euros worth of treasure was stolen I already said that extras of the museum who once boasted that the collection was a secure as Fort Knox said today that the items stolen were of immeasurable wealth and pleaded for the thieves not to destroy them so get there because the pieces are so famous there's no way that they could sell those yeah what market listen to this manager for the art auction house told the tabloids that if the objects stolen had a value of a billion euros as initially estimated by the police even if they were broken down and melted to the raw materials they would still be worth a hundred to two hundred million which makes it well worth stealing them isn't that just the raw materials the building was being patrolled by two guards in the center of the building according to German media the first officer arrived on the scene within minutes but that these have already fled in a get a getaway car that was waiting outside which managed to elude immediate attempts to find it in the surrounding area and on nearby highways the police told reporters police later confirmed that a out e86 matching the description of the getaway car was found burned in an underway parking lot and raised him isn't that insane they blew the fuse they somehow put the fire out a fire and put the power out had this getaway car they sell fire so really like oceans dude they got in six minutes they disappeared they had the whole city locked down and these guys had this crazy getaway route and they were unable to find them a billion dollars the outter so the plater can free yada-yada-yada investors the investigators suspect that the fire and of an electrical junction box near the museum which took out the street lights at the time of the robbery was linked to the crime the outage affected lights in front of the window which they gained entrance and somehow getting through bars and safety glass to reach the jewel room police said they have established a special investigating team comprising 20 specialist officers to solve the case my only question is this when does the movie come out I wonder even if they wanted to just sell the materials if they would still get caught because the material sound really rare here's what I would really miss if ik and I'm sure they're much smaller smarter than I am melts it all down to the base materials and then sell them all over the place you know they like a really raw diamond or really unique shaped diamond I think I saw another article where they they guessed that the diamonds would probably they would recut them you can just read sad ham that is sad yeah I mean these are precious that it is sad that they are but at the same time I'm kind of stoked for them isn't that sick they got these little Vietnamese twinks to crawl between the bars I mean I hate that they're gonna ruin this crazy jewelry what historic but I am kind of stoked for them I like to watch it as a movie but I don't like it in reality because you know in the movie they'd be like cool and charismatic you know in them rooting for me and Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio you know yeah directed it sucks yeah in reality they probably like [ __ ] killed people there are some like super rich people that would buy this stuff like to put in their own collection I don't think you I think it was a way too risky to buy the the actual the actual piece I mean if there's a serious investigation if I'm assuming they would be looking but yeah I think they're gonna melt that it's worth 200 million bucks mm-hmm damn now that's a payday though it's just crazy that this stuff actually happens yeah hmm it's amazing I'm just thinking about these little twinks and uh I wonder if they had Paul McGrath or Paul McGrath mark McGrath's hair and I'm just wondering would you want to [ __ ] a little Vietnamese twink with Paul McGrath or mark McGrath's airhole nah no baby no for deer hunting season is open in Wisconsin you'll be happy to know yellow and in the opening weekend alone four people were shot thank you keep shooting each other isn't that amazing I think more people got shot than deer at least four people were shot in Wisconsin during the state's opening weekend of deer hunting one a 38 year old man was hunting and needy yeah I hate pronouncing like when I see some a word for the first time I've got like oxd I get like existential dread because I know I can't read it oh and eid aight how do you pronounce that i don't know what would you use for what when you get eggs existential oh are you one expecting angst okay fine it's like some egyptian does it use or something no it's not almost that I get in it I get existential office every time I heard and correct me uh twenty eight year old man was shot in the foot what did you send me dead a donk okay [Music] what is this some stupid Star Wars [ __ ] get off my screen oh my god I can't close it Dan I'm having lost I can't close it why what is this [ __ ] okay no I good doesn't work I mean what the [ __ ] I'm not watching your [ __ ] you know I might skip that movie I might just straight-up skip it I'm serious [ __ ] Star Wars I'm Mandalorian all the way at 38 year old man was shot in the foot the same thing happened 29 year old woman I shot a hunter shot at a running deer and struck a 19 year old woman the left hand another man can you imagine you're like oh hi mom whoops oh hi mark another man was shot while deer hunting the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources asking for the public's help in the case which is still under investigation more people got shot than deers oh that's my nose a joke I wrote myself they should rename it human season I wrote what I wrote more people got shot in deers they should rename it humans season they Shanee season who famously shot his friend in the face during deer season did you know that yellow eye the vice-president his homie in the face it was duck hunting Oh duck hunting excuse me and then and then Dick Cheney made back I apologized to him for a while eh yeah for standing in the way yeah for causing him grievance Andy Dick Cheney Dick Cheney sued him I don't think I know I don't think he sued him Dick Cheney said apologize I'll finish the job Wow but what happens if you shoot someone is that not a crime can you just go murder vice president dude but now seriously if you're deer hunting can you just go shoot people it's like all good it's like whoops I mean if it's an act like you're already Monday field no one cares about you who's to say accident from attempted murder Dan oops you know I'm saying yeah and that's that what that's what I tell the judge you have a good point thank you but let's put that aside and let's just enjoy this story because I think it's great I agree I don't like people don't mind like when someone dies at the hands of like a or like a tiger or elephant I'm like dude you're [ __ ] dead bro you got owned it's so outrageous that these hunters think like they Trump the Trump boys who go out there and kill [ __ ] elephants you know it's done yeah the Trump's boys should there is a distinction between hunting deer and and big game on yeah there is a little different I agree because they're I guess they either that deers are in some areas too there's too much and the population needs to be cold yes we we made all the Predators extinct so now that deer population is like running away so got to get rid of them like that but it's just so outrageous to go kill a [ __ ] elephant to fly to Africa thing with Ellen Ellen what said I'm definitely with you on that yeah you know there's all this propaganda better to like oh go seconf a shin do these come these countries are so corrupt you think it really makes it they just just one goes to concert they say they always say dude I go hey I'm a the government to get a license to kill an elephant and all that money goes to conserving so it's a good thing that I'm going to Africa and killing ones yeah they that's I always hear that in defense of these big game hunters who by the way are giant [ __ ] they go sneak up on elephants in enclosed environment they have a basically a ranger who knows how to crack them they just follow some local and then they go okay theory eschew it's like you're a [ __ ] who cares that you shot the Elven you didn't do anything all you did was pull the trigger bro if you want to go kill an elephant and be a man go out to the saw go out there by yourself and hunt some big game otherwise you're a [ __ ] I'm gonna pull up these pictures of the dumbass Trump by the way Trump's kids I mean no offense I know people like them but they're the biggest [ __ ] goons on the let me just look at him you know what I'm saying Eric and what's the other ones Donald don't Don jr. I mean look you may like Trump as a president and as a guy but you have to admit that his sons are the biggest [ __ ] goons look at these boat look at that bro look at these two idiots look at these guys why do you look like a dude he looks like the woods sloth he literally looks like sloth he looks like The Hunchback of Notre dance all right this is on Snopes we should roll down that's true balls so where's the real one I doubt it's much better oh yeah look at his hair look at these go and by the way Trump has a fat daughter that nobody knows he has a daughter cuz he hates her because she's fat I swear to God he has an extra daughter you thought it was just the three them right yeah but there's another no and there's the little boy no but there's a secret daughter that's fat I swear to God Donald Trump secret dog my name is Tiffany oh you see Tiffany yeah it's not a secret but no really ever heard a Tiffany Trump I mean I've heard of her yeah you're right that she's it's not in the public eye when have you ever seen her ela never exactly he doesn't like her cuz she's fat I heard that and she's not pretty that's what he says he doesn't like this daughter when have you ever seen her I'm dead serious I don't know maybe she doesn't want to be no dude I'm telling you he doesn't like fat people and he definitely doesn't like women at least unless they're you know he had himself done he wants to grab does he hate himself cuz he's bad because I guess it's thicker than a snicker don't you think that the kids are just the biggest goons ever I don't like this I want to go back to the hunting well okay so the point that I brought up these goons is a trump sons big our songs sons big-game hunting so I wanted to show you this here they are with a leopard yeah look at these uh hotshots wow they probably tracked that down by themselves why would you want to do that look at this beautiful animal a lot more beautiful than these goons that's so sad it's it's it's horrific I mean here here's a look at him with a nut bro really deeply wrong with you come on don't do that it's you wanna kill [ __ ] but killing humans is illegal look just just posing with a dead carcass that's your idea of a fun time with this beautiful majestic creature by the way a leopard these are rare these are not look at that beautiful creature No and look at this hideous monster of a man I'm not down with that I don't care what the [ __ ] anyone says I don't care about yeah I don't care if they gave a million dollars in Bob way for just a million dollars there yeah you care about conservation a million dollars up guy if these guys were crawling around the desert floor like a predator with mud on their eyes and smelling like feces maybe I'd have a little respect for the big game hunt that's not what's going on here no they're being carried in their van by some local eating eating even like that the whole setup is being set up for them and then they're like okay here it is shoot there he is okay here's the gun now they probably put his finger on his finger to pull it you did it oh you're so great so brave you sent me something Zach would you send me oh yeah I mean it the fake one definitely looked the fake one definitely looked like that the real one was yeah agreed so I don't like big-game hunters I don't like this [ __ ] either by the way you know that's the guy that killed that wine the dentist they got all the [ __ ] okay here oh look at this big game hunter oh my god that [ __ ] who probably weighs more than the lion itself nobody likes a good feed bro look at that creature not he not him look at that beautiful lion let me tell you this picture is everything that's wrong with with humanity and correctly look at that majestic beautiful lion this is a magical creature just let it be why do you need to go kill a line you fat [ __ ] bro did you did you were you literally going through the desert in a wheelchair and like a in a mobility scooter yeah an off-road guy oh that tank one yeah I hate these people I really do I think they're absolute low life scum bags sickos Psychopaths mm-hmm look at this one get it bro when you when these guys die and go to hell I hope this images of like on all walls other held prison dude this guy just killed a bunch of monkeys like my god eriously dude what is wrong with you so yeah I'm happy when these people

else what else I hate these people I'm a vegetarian now say you can't even say [ __ ] about me I saved the world [ __ ] am i doing am i being hypocritical cause I've eaten meat my whole life a little bit sure but at the same time I think they're raised there is a there's a difference in that the cattle is raised for consumption these are majestic wild endangered species and I agree that that that you know it's probably unethical to eat meat though because of the way they're raised do I care then I'm being hypocritical well I'm a vegetarian now which means I'm a saint and I could say what the [ __ ] I want Dan do you agree and disagree we got on this whole topic because we were talking about the deer hunting those are the people that got shot the deer hunters are fine if it's if it's part of ecologic if it's part of you know maintaining a healthy ecology is it always like that in America it is I think in Wisconsin which is where the story took place likely yes there's a lot of basis of know there's a lot of places that they because all of the Wolves got run to extinction and the wolves were what kept the deer population in check so now the deer are the out of control and mm-hmm they have to call the herd basically call the herd but you eat deer by the way you don't eat lion yeah I'm completely with you yeah [ __ ] the people there is literally no making a distinction between the two types of I agree there's there's no purpose to killing a lion other than that you want to murder something beautiful pretty much yet a deer you can eat you can eat people love venison when you're helping the environment thoughts I'm over it we're deep in the episodes because should talk [ __ ] about Trump more no raw is a big fat burger eating [ __ ] he is gotta buy an ass in and what he's literally wears a diaper Donald Trump wears a diaper I swear to God look at picture of him playing tennis I'm not even causing uh rumors there's no pizza experience be President if he has no pizza experience that's a great question I think that's a platform to run on oh I think Trump has been in the pizza category you seen that please okay do we have a funny story TR all these stories are sad what about a police chief lean on funny you don't like the police chief dude I'm so jealous very frosted tips we were so stupid that you doesn't like that story let's skip I like it I thought it was okay you're right t I what what did you think that it's funny well you can't I mean it's not funny but it's like you can't you know it just happened you got [ __ ] yeah I'm just goofing on her hair I mean hello that's the Internet right you just got to own that ball master sir but people are so stupid her hair's not like it's not even that crazy it's dope would you rather [ __ ] her or mark McGrath [Laughter] you're right I shouldn't talk about homosexuality and what Jesus Christ well Jesus Christ isn't down with the homos and I said either don't have sex with a woman quote is off the hinge what the door okay so here we've got one that we'll all enjoy ti we've spoke about because he wanted to control his daughter's vagina but he is trying to but he said that he takes his daughter every year to the gynecologist to make sure her hymens still intact he's and he said I'm happy and proud to announce that she just turned 18 and up until this moment and man's penis has not been inside my so okay so we went on Facebook on Will Smith's wife it's called the red tabletop like a podcast show on Facebook which is highly produced by the way I yeah I was really impressed with the quality Facebook is really putting and them they're trying to make real content the problem it is that it's on Facebook wait is that is this a rift in the Smith house she's got a Facebook show yeah nobody's got a YouTube show no yeah yeah it's a pretty popular thing the red Table Talk but um sit on Facebook so that's the problem it does look like TV quality content I agree it's really well produced I mean they are have a lot of [ __ ] money and there's no rules mm-hmm copyright law doesn't exist shed hell even international law even the Geneva Code don't even exist on Facebook [Laughter] here he dressed with ti Will Smith makes a little appearance if you want to show that in the beginning he does tea I was like are you gonna say with us and will is like no I'm staying out of this one oh that's funny I feel like this myth family loves attention like well as a bro yes yes he'll I don't know well just got you know I don't know so a pillow liner right thanks Scientology oh don't do that family there's been rumors that they are Scientology he donated money to a Scientology school but so far have denied being members of the church but I think Will Smith is a perfect candidate for Scientology is it confirmed that he donated I think it's confirmed yes doesn't that mean that he's a saint I think what he said about that is that they were curious about it and looking into it and it's not it wasn't for them I'm not sure I believe that okay I guess I could you think I'm famous enough to get VIP treatment with Scientology like The Celebrity Center I think don't care about a Hollywood I don't know do you think they would recognize you don't think they have a new media division no I don't think I've never heard of a new media I hope they don't know yes but that's if they could get me I hope that all the young Scientology kids that were born into it are managing to run away don't you think that they have a good opportunity to convert me like I could really get a lot of people into it mm-hmm god they must do how do your your Satan's feel I mean my faden's aren't down they don't want it they don't want it kinda it's the ghosts that haunt you or something yes that goes the haunt my thetans don't believe in Scientology but I do on the line it's good some Howdy's go so anyway let's let's watch the Will Smith say he doesn't want to be involved greeted and honored properly [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] and Facebook watching hey did you know that Mark Zuckerberg sells ads to the Russians they don't care about democracy brought to you by Facebook tough stuff no easy babysit for because it's quite long may I ask you one question reputation why does he talk like Yosemite Sam and you'll see what I mean I say I say I say I do declare you'll see what I mean well there's some of us that know you like everything don't ya do you understand the sensitivity of no really I did not do you understand it no I understand it now yes I do absolutely however my intentions I think have been terribly misconstrued and was conceived let me go see like Don King meets Yosemite Sam I don't know all these references the guy said it was 70 Sam yeah you sent me on for somebody sad Yosemite Sam here's the guy was like I do I do what is that's foghorn leghorn bro nah this is Yosemite Sam well I mean that is Yosemite Sam what's the one who I was thinking of you're talking about foghorn leghorn the big the big chicken did I say I say oh it's it oh that's what you're talking about yeah I guess I thought you said me Sam no he's not talking like that big horn Yosemite Sam but let's have a talk I don't see it I like it castrate I never said I was in any exam room that is an assumption right that is a falsity god I didn't think he was in the that is a falsity who talks like that is a falsity he goes that is a falsity look who's talking you're making up a word like every second he's trying you guys know what I'm saying he talks like he's doing a schtick he's got he's just got a little bit of a southern accent right okay whatever we don't need to bait this tensions have been terribly misconstrued and miss constrained set this record straight I never said I was in any exam room that is I didn't ever think he was in the exam room that would be horrific I think a lot of people took it because everyone was talking about it so maybe you didn't say but maybe if he's in there exam room or not it's still gross yeah if he's an exam room that's like I don't think the doctor would allow that it's an assumption that is a falsity god I never said that it was being done present date right as it did say that anyway I can't tell you because I watched the whole thing basically what he's saying is that it was kind of obviously are they kind of trying to make an entertaining story out of something that is based in reality but he was exaggerated and I can understand that because you know I know what it's like when we tell stories here you try to make it a little more funny or whatever but they do they try to explain to him why the whole topic is so sensitive and it really shouldn't like why it was wrong well he was still every year getting the hymen examined I don't think they were doing it every year like he was saying in the story but he also said in the story he told them he said as of 18 years old her hymen is still intact yeah I think he was just like trying to be funny you think so you don't think he's just backpedaling no I don't what about the tweets is done he wasn't bad it was he was sitting there and taking in whatever they had to say about the he his daughter likes about saying how this is he said that she doesn't like that he's talking about it and he apologized to her and should i watch its long I I think there's like a 1 minute stretch here he talks about 18 year old 16 years old at the time and I never said that her mother wasn't present right right you know he was just you know most of fathers don't go but he was just present right and he didn't make the doctor's appointment knows already you know appointment and all of these things all of these this narrative this false narrative has just been sensationalized so at the time her mother welcomed your presence and your daughter did - absolutely right she did have a problem with me talking about it I was right and I understand it and I'm incredibly apologetic but ultimately he was still checking his daughters hymen so ultimately is that he isn't the wrong and with the way he views this whole topic and I think he didn't understand before and he's starting to understand now like she told him do you know for example that it could break from riding a horse and he was like no I didn't know that and well he goes in his story she ain't no Brad no horse she do no athletics not sports he goes athletics because it's tik toks liking somebody Sam I don't see it do you guys see what is saying I don't see what do you say knows what I'm saying I do I do agree and do you know what I'm saying and do you guys afraid that I'm making like racial jokes cuz I don't think I know I just don't think it's a cute box like that character like he has he has a unique cadence can we agree just a sudden it it's not unique it's just a southern accent he's from Atlanta I can see why you're making this comparison but I think it's funny when everyone denies what you're saying yeah okay so just hanging out to try but he agrees Zack agrees Ian and Dan are too woke apparently to college the obvious that he sounds like Yosemite Sam yeah Dan and Ella are are soon awoke and I'm calling them out right now I'm very protective of the Warner Brothers any of these weirdos who you know just kind of toss lies around for me yeah she understands my intentions that she knows who I am she knows who I've always been right and I think that that allows a certain level of understand I mean it's just the outside the noise yeah yep it's distracting is can is confusing it's hurtful it is is hurtful and embarrassing she was horrified well I definitely understood why she would be you know feel like you know was personal to her right Jase is a quiet child she doesn't talk a lot you know okay this goes on forever I think I do I do I do I do the class it definitely represents like a wrong way of looking at this things cuz he put so much like it's so important to him that when when she loses her virginity and like that and he said with the right person or whatever here's a quote from that I pulled from 950 here so we'd have to watch the whole thing you know from 950 let's see the idea that people thought you were trying to control your daughter's virginity versus now cuz that's very different question okay ask it okay first of all the word control is very but you know that's what it sounds like no but in order to guide or direct you must have a certain level of control of any do you agree with that no that doesn't make any sense you can't guide and could direct and control right you guide and yeah yeah okay so okay so so how do you want us to understand your level of control in which you were speaking on well I think that in the age or the time where our women black women are the most protected that's ten and I guess regarded yes women on the planet yeah I'm being criticized because I'm willing to go above and beyond to protect my right and I'm talking about all of the little slimy grimy chippy fingered little boys who want to just come in defile and destroy the sanctity that I have I'm saying I just find that whole yeah it's a strength bro it's your eight-year-old daughter what the sanctity she's got a liver life right that's not every dude is slimy chubby fingered sometimes you can decide me chubby finger your vagina on putting so much emphasis on like losing your exploration she's gotta do what she's got to do I don't know you know what I mean like yeah and if she ends up with someone was not a good guy then she'll figure it out for herself own you guide her you don't say you have to break up him because he's got chubby greasy fingers like Newt Gingrich remember that video yeah that's a callback what do you call us what do you have we'd invite now we need a new name for these handheld device right I don't understand anything that is the most important thing to me in my life I am going to deal with that with very far reminded me of like me being a teenager having to deal with my dad because obviously everything he did was because he wanted to protect me and he cared so much about me but it was so like I couldn't do anything don't let me go out with my friends wouldn't let me you know whatever everyone else was doing I couldn't do and it's just so frustrating it's too you just it's not a healthy way to have a relationship with your kid mm-hm I understand that there's like good intention behind it but it it's good it don't mean anything else yeah you know I mean for example you know when I you know when I use the bidet to wash my [ __ ] my tensions are good but ultimately when there's [ __ ] water on the floor and a whole mess cuz I don't know it ease the bidet my intentions are good but there's [ __ ] all over the walls and that's why I don't step into that right I like it and I don't understand how that is looked at as being so wrong in order to control for that to be malice there must be ill intent mm-hmm if I'm going to the stupid point hey dude you just because you don't have to know one cent doesn't mean that everything you do is right and it doesn't have a negative consequence yeah I feel like I know exactly where it's coming from because because of my dad yeah it's that old-school yeah 70 Sam should know of controlling you but okay but if I'm going for the purpose of being a protective parent and there's nothing this is overprotective there and unprotected look one saying that's an insane statement to make like I feel like he doesn't even ki nobody believes that it's true no I think it's really there's no such thing as overprotective when I just lock her in a jail cell right hey baby there's no such thing as overprotective he treats her like she's a car and his collection hey baby but you in this vault with gold coins at least he's willing to have this conversation and they did it seem to be like interested in learning what's important to you though because I don't think it's so much about virginity as much or was it what I say I say I say I say I say I say I say there's no such thing as being overprotective I say doesn't sounds like I say I say I say I do declare to quote him one more time all the slimy grimy chubby fingered little boys want to just come in to file and destroy the sanctity that I have and anything is the most important thing in my life I'm going to deal with that with a very extreme care TI clearing up the misconceptions finally we have dj khaled trying to crowd surf imagine how this goes you don't you can't you can't crap you can't do that bro that's like I mean come on dj khaled just kind of like you just like right to the floor people like home and we can't lift you your Khalid it's like he lost five pounds all like you know he's feeling good about his way I'm glad that the camera man's like oh [ __ ] Khalid yeah he just thinks he just sinks that's Khalid for you still the character still a meme still doing it up Rob Schneider uh I've always disliked Rob Schneider I don't think he's funny I think he's a douche his show sucks he he puts a filter on his show on Netflix called what is it called I don't have a name for it no his show on real wrong real rod the whole show has this unnatural blue tint to make his blue eyes pop more I swear to god the show looks like a joke because everything is so blue and the his eyes just shine so blunt brilliant blue I'm sure that he and post-reduction instructed them to just put this incredible blue tint but anyway here he is now Howie is a notorious germaphobe OCD crippling germophobia and Rob Schneider comes out knowing that and [ __ ] with Howie has returned to work this time taking on Europe please welcome deuce Bigalow himself Rob Schneider you know the producers by the way or like don't touch Howie like Harold don't shake his hand don't touch him so the wiseguy Rough Rider he doesn't put his hand out he grabbed his hand nice to see ya can you get over it how is have you got to get over it I actually use that to surgeon that I do this to I get the back he's mine just trying to understand right now what's going on in his head oh look the lady's right there and the second role has antiseptic wipes throw it on them [Applause] let's talk about your life a little bit you were recently or how I have to say if you're that OCD though not the best profession huh yeah host if the producers have to be like don't touch him don't breathe on him but Rob is still douche and the show sucks and he's not funny sorry also he's got the super young Mexican wife that he the fact that she's Mexican I don't that doesn't know she's just exotic is what I mean South American and in real Rob it's his real wife she's like in her 20s and don't think she's in her twenties let's look it up she's actually anything a writer on the show oh well that's why it's no bad it's bad I mean she's not a comedian that's what I mean Rob what's his name Schneider might be being a dick nobody's laughing she's 31 so when that show came out she was in her 20s she's 31 that show came up five years ago bro she was like 26 I don't even know the show existed yeah yeah you should dude you should watch it like I'm a fan because it's one of those shows that's so bad I'm telling you the whole show is tinted blue to make his eyes sparkle I'm not kidding and so his young wife like he has her in exercise equipment and tight spandex doing yoga there's a scene where you could see her ass and vag bro because she's like she's like this and tights workout spandex that's crazy dude don't why you got to watch it am i crass why why is nobody either looking like what's going on here yellow what's going on here talk to me I don't know I don't got nothing to say to me yeah the exact is a the show he would be Zach hold on I enjoyed it I wouldn't say it's my favorite show he's such a dick on the show you like the real Rob it was enjoyable I wouldn't say it's one of my that I think I figured out Zach he just likes everything I can't hold it against and the guy likes Arby's is a car aficionado I hated it I thought it was so bad it was just dumb do you know what I mean about the blue tent yeah it's so weird he's such a dick on the show though that's the thing he was trying to make like a Larry David Kirby yeah there's him except there was nothing endearing about him it wasn't funny he's a dick and it doesn't make any sense like the opening scene is him let me let me show you I'm gonna show you this opening scene where he refuses to tip a barista and I think let me show you you know the reason I got into is cuz he was on Howard and he was talking about him promoting it so hmm here this is

cheap bastard I'll let you bastard I tipped 100 percent actually it's 125 percent but I'm working in a coffee shop and you're rich you could share some of that never happened that's my thing and by the way the worldview that it expresses it's all like this like Rob Schneider is this he's this he's this rich successful millionaire and the world just hates him because he's so successful like the underlying this would never happen and it's not the dialogues not funny and he by the way he's such a bad actor rich you could share some of that that's how Rob sees the world as everyone wants a piece of them I even has like her she kind of music he's like you could afford more you could afford a hundred he's like I could afford a thousand you know what I mean damn got him so then somebody was watching a customer was watching yeah and the only tip five bucks hey you only tip this guy five bucks I thought you were rich you made all those movies with Adam Sandler how much I'm supposed to

Wilkinson up on Kansas and you know with the decade coming to an end I just had a couple or just one question really about what your guyses means of the decade all you guys I'm curious Mima the decade I don't really live the decade I'm not really like so plugged into meme oh yeah this whole thing you know what I mean with a decade in my opinion is I'm over it alright that's my answer do you guys have anything that comes to mind decades a lot [ __ ] yeah ten years ago was like where are some of 2010 memes you remember I don't know doesn't I don't know that's a rough one I think it might be Ken boon oh thank you I feel like I take credit because I'm in bone a little bit and part of Ken's legacy you were certainly part of the legacy yeah I can be that's pretty that's Ken's bar Ken bone was a greater good and Ken is just the best I then like how it turned into him liking preggo porn it just in like episode it had legs I think the humongous was a pretty prolific name to Azhar not right like when Bona does it have his longest right now Penn boned was like the triple threat yeah I mean the guy has it all damn I just searched 2010 memes and like dancing baby is some crazy [ __ ] man show me what do you guys is it like rage comics yeah a lot of rage color yeah that's a hit she's a lot of image macros bad bad luck Brian remember that bro that [ __ ] ooh yeah rage comics are single-handedly those were the worst why you know upvote antoine dodson that intrude should I do like that true ders still [ __ ] funny hey I wanna know they raping what we though wasn't such a good one for 22 what about double rainbows at this decade Oh double rainbow that was right around the same time that was like schmoyoho yeah rainbow all the way across the sky wow so impressed I can't believe I remember eyes that the double rainbow all the way across let's catchy I think schmoyoho his name with a decade a lot of hits a lot of hits Shmuel yo the my favorite one dude before I actually was a youtuber quote-unquote I was like the biggest Mojo ho fan mm-hmm they were just the coolest [ __ ] thing ever like I think sumo yahuwah's me mother decade like let's review his declaration chair incredible content if I sort by popular isn't Schmoe just Michael it's he is Schmo yo ho but it's family it's the brothers like Bed Intruder I wonder he probably won't claim me for this right this is 2010 funk you to 45 million views yeah and damn cuz they raping everybody up here you know it's crazy on YouTube these days you couldn't even this couldn't go anywhere cuz he says rape in the first 30 seconds and it has 145 million views we're gonna act like this isn't one of the best videos on YouTube like [ __ ] you YouTube double rainbow song was I want to say that was even the same year they were on fire think it was this was 2010 yeah same time rainbow I met the sky cat you to those invited me to his cabin in Yosemite wait was he trippin yes he was he said no he said no but obviously how could you react this way if you weren't on that he said he was oh yeah I got a fish mojo hos meme with a decade come on good for them just do it that was like huge the one there's this one of this little kid that I want to show you guys I was thinking I was gonna go year by year but right off the bat in 2010 there's some pretty solid contenders they're Sunny D and Rahm is good where's the one with the kid it's so good what kid we're kid where he goes mommy said well mommy said Oh where's that so the parents where is that hmm oh yeah good debate though I feel like maybe we we should invite well the audience to hear weigh in on this a little bit listen that this was also 2000 was the year of memes yeah listen LAN the song is a legit hit [Music] you heard him having say yeah and daddy [Music] I loved it on the huge screen that is not the truth [Music] there's no reason that schmoyoho shouldn't still be getting hundreds of millions of views except the algorithm [ __ ] them and your red table you're in trouble yeah I listen to this [ __ ] like a trillion times so I give the reward there you go I hope I answered your question I think I did let's move on I'm Tom and I'm from Chicago and I want to know what happened with the mobility scooter and did us fix it well I think we answered that Wow Jay Simpson fan of the show bullet ominous of a message but I'm glad to hear that Oh Jay is a truly thank you for calling in shoenice oh here's someone concerned about shooting us I just wanted to share my concerns about you tonight I really don't think that you guys should meet up with him he seemed like a controller that's what I've been saying and you guys never take me seriously right now I've seen a lot of videos posted by him directed at you and the vibe that I get from that man is not good and I personally do not think it's a good idea to have him on the show well too late for that you have a security guard I don't know are you I would no no Scott yeah okay now I'm searching before he comes in I don't think it's a good idea but wait you well you guys were laughing when I said let's put him in a straitjacket and put a mask like Hannibal Lecter but I think that's ridiculous no but it's a good idea but you know it's a good idea if he ever comes on the show I'll do that that's the only way I'll let him in this room if we put him on a dolly we strap them to an ollie I think
