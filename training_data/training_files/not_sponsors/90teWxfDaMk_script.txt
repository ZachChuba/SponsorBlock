[Music] what happens when you take 20 000 players and stick them all in a small minecraft world where mystical and mysterious things happen on a daily basis my name is jack and this is what minecraft's religions look like on the stoneworks minecraft server the first world building town building role play geopol and history making server in all minecraft you can join and start a culture and nation on the server today here is the ip for java edition and click the little white card at the top right for a starting tutorial as someone who's studying history and religion in college i think it's fascinating to see all the cosmologies rituals rules gods symbols and stories that players come up with they follow many patterns of real religions but at the same time they exist in a totally unique minecraft setting the point of the stonework server is world building and religion is a place where stories politics and culture all come together so it really is the backbone and in my opinion one of the most respectable parts of the server so let's look at some of the most successful and unique religions that minecraft has to offer first let's travel to the land of the modern aldevere empire sacralism the uncreated one sacrileth banished to the darkness and ignited light to create the sun stars and earth and from earth with water he created life eventually darkness came to corrupt humanity and the people despised sacrileth their creator and he left them so his presence would not make them suffer but he promised he would return and have the darkness of mankind finally banished so he left but would continue to watch over them during the day in the coming period sacrileth sent four prophets that would guide those who still remembered him establishing the early sacrilete cannon and in the city of azethir building the central temple called the sanctum of the judge the temple contains the eternal fire an important symbol to sacralists representing the gods uncreated light their other symbols are the tree how deeply rooted faith in sacralith in existence and life is and the moon which is sakuralit's protection even when he is not present at a much later date during a religious festival in azithvir the sanctum of the judge was attacked by player cerberus 22 and a bunch of even bandits after some fighting they were pushed out and killed by the worshipers in the city but as they returned to the temple they saw the eternal fire was extinguished before their very eyes the players there prayed and they felt sacrolithe among them in his fervor the leader here player the last sven started levitating sacrileth gifted him gold and leather for wealth and protection and then sent him through the roof to ascend into the daytime skies after a while the last zven returned from the heavens and appeared on the ground of the temple the people prayed more for the eternal flame to return so sacrileth built a bedrock pillar in its place in front of everyone there the pillar shot up into the sky and then burst into fire and lava after this the last zven took the title of prophet descendant and revived the faith through what he learned in his journey through the heavens sacralism thus spread far throughout rathnir and azathir became a holy city to many peoples later as it turned out the sacralists would find a similar faith growing in neighboring yemu aodal the theosists as they're called essentially worshipped the same god and for prophets but they developed differently so for brief time sacralism and theosism merged but i think they've kind of split apart again recently we'll update if anything happens bring me joy so thank you namaste [Applause] okay let's move on to an ancient cult that operates in the shadows abyss mysticism is a secretive mystery cult that was prominent in the early days of rathnir when the waldrich imperial republic was dominant this group of mystics had a lot of influence in vir's politics and world affairs but since they're still rumored to operate i can't reveal too much about it to you who knows maybe i'm a part of it what is known is that there is an order of abyss mystics who inherited occultic divination arts from even older religions of the area one form of this is scrying using obsidian tablets that were found in a glacier but fundamentally the backbone of the religion seemingly is a collection of esoteric writings that detail the true nature of rathner's existence and the universal order one of the most important backstories to abyss mysticism as it seems to me is the descent of the player prophet assaderapal into the abyss this took place after the cataclysmic destruction of the first world in stoneworks minecraft called jagdis [Music] asar direpal walked through the abyss and came out the other side to the new world of rathnir the abyss showed him how all the gods and things of existence are part of a greater prime principle the one below the deepest void in the darkness above the platonic consciousness one of the mystics allowed me to share with you a fragment from the book commentaries on mysterium tenebris which plays out like this my name is only beef moons and blind fish unaware of the coming of the deep sea i am the reason and order who uses the chaos and change to create i am the mind and all flesh is just a vessel for my reflections and finally i am the mirror that beholds only itself thus casting infinite reflections freaky like i said some say the abyss mystics still exist but their ancient holy place remains hidden and it has only been visited by a few people who follow the spirits of the mystics here i'm going to be making another video that explains how to make your own religion in minecraft if that's gone out already you can click it on the top right here that'll explain the rules regulations and guidelines that we have around religions on the stonework server particularly it also explains how sacrifices and prayers work which are really important for the players to communicate with their gods when they come down give them advice or holy relics something like that also this will have an analysis of how to establish a religion and spread it because that can be a really daunting task even in minecraft but if you're interested i want you to look at that because look at this like a third of the whole server doesn't have a religion that's ridiculous in a world building server so you know who's gonna be the one to change that you i task you with converting the non-believers to your true faith whether by crusade or building beautiful temples and rituals as long as you follow the rules now kind of in the opposite vein as the dark abyss we now turn to the holy light of lux lux is a temple-oriented religion based in the country cilicios the gods that they worship are lux and tenepris lux and tenepris are pitted in the cyclical eternal war that brings night and day now when you die for good you are weighed on your nature and you will either go past the stars to lux's eternal flame in the heavens or you will be cast out into the void and annihilated the luxites traced this faith back to the original desert nomads in umarnu preceding the player's arrival into rathnir a long time after the temple was erected and dedicated in the city of luxios with a giant sacrifice of golden blocks the top of the temple started blindingly shining a figure appeared before the high priests and from it a small sun grew and remained hovering there as such the temple of luxios is the spatial focal point of the religion here is the eternal flame which is believed to be lux's lifeblood in rathnier the worship of lux was stable for a long time at the grand temple but one day the player beast killertya logged on to find that the eternal flame was missing and in its place there was only gravel around the city all the chickens started speaking babbling about the void the sunken isle of tessel and the flame being trapped underneath players beast killertya peter5885 and unk murr spoke around to the other players and figured out what was going on and so they traveled to the isle of tessel where there was once a void pit that played host to an ancient void god the pit had been sealed for ages following the turtulonian wars which i made a video about earlier but now it seemed that lux and the eternal flame were torturously trapped underneath so the three journeyed there and dug down to the void pit where floating torches and blazes spawned almost like it was a twisted distortion of lux's true light they prepared a lavish sacrifice there and unk murr was thrown into the void by the other two to save the god of light as soon as he died a jarring scream was heard all around the server and the void pit opened up to the world once again as you can see by the reactions to this many on the server did not take kindly to this avoid pit opening even if it was to free the god of light players all spent a while filling the malevolent pit again as is the mission of the famed auroran order which was actually started on the isle of tesla that's a story for another day the luxites meanwhile returned to their temple to find the eternal flame restored and the hovering sun above the temple shining brighter than ever the luxites were able to retrieve the head of unkmer that the void spit back up and now it remains on display as a reminder that the eternal flame burns because the people sacrificed for it [Music] time for an ant i'm a cat who loves to snooze it's kind of a meme religion but once you get into it it's weirdly real and uh i hate to say this but it kind of mirrors the early history of islam there was a group in the nation of sarafini that moved to an old accretion fort across the border there at the outskirts of their town green stem in front of a group of players a giant striped pillar appeared and on fire at the top there was an item a pie with power 10 called arbuckles lasagna this revelation gave to them all the teachings of garfism which were written down in six books the garfists soon after came into conflict with the accretions whose territory they settled in the equations did not appreciate this new group and their heretical views so they attacked the holy place of greenstem and the garfists fled to the north to the sterling crown lands and to bardonia there was some persecution of garfists and acratia and a little bit in these new lands but the leadership was most settled in bardonia this is why this period has social unrest and this kind of garfield propaganda based orange and black striped pilled but when a brutal drawn out war broke out between a croatia and the neighboring country of lathe the garfist would come back in full force and they'd attack a creation green stem with their allies taking the city back and consecrating the holy site killing 12 accretions with no losses you're going into orbit you stupid mod [Music] this is literally like the story of muhammad being pushed out of mecca and returning with an army and god at his back you know except it's stupid i love it god damn it according to the arbiter and bishops of garf's will when you die you reincarnate until you become worthy of ascending to the eternal sunday garfism has died down a bit due to stigma and persecution around the faith there's been some toxicity killings and reacting to garfist discord messages with the clown emoji that's what persecution amounts to in minecraft but some of the most common religion books in rafnir are garfist so you tell me [Music] people often ask me stony what is your religion in game this is the face of gonf he is essentially jesus here i plan on making an extensive video covering how he saved the server during its very first week the battles miracles betrayal and written testaments that created the dormant religion of gonfism but for now know his face the anglerfish face of minecraft jesus in rathnir's sister world to the east eldum we find the zavtranian pantheon two players called lion leon nine and pibbenal set out in search for a home at the top of a mountain the goddess ophelia appeared above and she showed them the promised land of cardivia a place of roses where they would prosper and be protected the two players journeyed through caves on oceans and over mountains until they reached kardivia where the first thing they built was the church the next day the god co manifested and he spoke to them his voice coming through a common sign he erected three pillars of glowstone to mark the god's presence in cardivia now the thing about eldom is it has a lot of bandits and violence raids and killings are rampant this has ruined many a small town and sent many players fleeing so likewise a swarm of bandits eventually descended on the fledgling cardivia and many were killed in the streets the rest held up in the church fearful that they'd be murdered and plundered but then ophelia appeared before them she spilled her own blood on the ground in front of all to witness and told them that she and co were love protection and life and that they must follow in these ways and spread them unto others after this the people went outside and all the bandits were cast out or dead cardivia was safe once again the zavtranian pantheon has gained a lot of traction throughout eldum and even in rathnir as it spread throughout the now fallen empire of plaguetea however it still has many worshippers and a massive new temple in the middle of cardivia that sports many holy relics and a sacrificial altar go check it out in eldum it's honestly super cool now let's return to another religion of darkness noxism after the destruction of the first world jagdis a mass migration took place to the new world of rafnir on the first night that rathner experienced one player from the old world named darkblade t2 organized that the entire server should sleep in minecraft sleeping is normal to skip night to avoid monsters and thunderstorms but on a server that at the time had 30 to 40 people in it this was a crazy feat of coming together in cooperation out of this grew a tight group that gathered together who would try to get the entire server to sleep in order to skip rathner's day-long reigns they would call themselves sleep gang and they set out to the north of rathener to establish a home for themselves as they were traveling in a strip of land called helmia they stumbled across something that i imagine must have been astounding and shocking there in the new world was an already built ruined temple of an old god of the night the sleep gang entered it and they learned about the ancient noxists and it would be here that they had found the city of sovdal and bring back the old native religion the noxists of sovdal would become one of the preeminent forces in the north of rafnier founding the kingdom of noxnor altogether they would lead the server in sleeping about five times even as rathnir grew more and more populated but after a month there was a massive werewolf attack on many of the northern kingdoms and when some bandits came to settle in the region's wilderness it became clear that the kingdoms of the north had to unify to bring themselves protection and prestige and so the kings of the north met in sovdal and here they founded the silver coalition being named after the glow of the moon and the glint of the silver werewolf hunting weapons with knoxnor being the heartland of the coalition noxism took a prominent place as a world religion now the religion worships six primary gods the main figure is afton bringer of the night in the early days of creation it's said that he defeated the sun to make the moon and the night supreme the ancient noxists would burn incense and say nightly prayers to the god whereas the new noxists would make flint effigies of him in sovdal's festivals afton protects all who sleep and he spawns the creatures of darkness to put everybody in bed so he is wrathful but if you follow his teachings and sleep well he will be good to you there is also luna the night sky moon goddess shinto the dream world god baldemar bringer of dreams and auroras war and protection goddess the last god is aoron the sun god that was defeated by afghan he was adopted into afton's family while being quite the outcast as the god of sun clouds fire crops and sunflowers you'd might expect it over time in knox north there grew an isolated faction of sun god worshippers and after a brief conflict they were expelled to the undeveloped lands of northern bardonia it is here that the city and state of auron's peak was founded which nowadays lives as one of the monuments to bardonia's historical power and prestige now the days of knox nor the silver coalition and the sterling crown lands are all far past but there are still a couple of holdouts of the noxist faith mainly the founding players who still happen to be active perhaps just like the god afton the faith just lingers in the dark [Music] next let's go to a place i've wanted to talk about for a long time if you travel to the far reaches of the west to the lands of the outer lenormalande and rhizan you may encounter the fanatical worshipers of twin dragon the universe is held in balance by the harmony of all things light and dark this harmony forms the natural order which must be obeyed lest the universe fall out of balance and existence itself be threatened the forces of this harmony are carried out by the guardian dragon gods sen and lin who circle the worlds of stoneworks minecraft keeping balance and defending the life force of all players from the greater heavens realm that's called the vale several beings would descend to the world called celestial matrons which were tasked with bringing harmony and balance to the world of players they would do this by establishing their own empires but some celestial matrons failed worse than others in bringing harmony a true celestial matron ushers in the veil mandate the process of bringing balance to a decaying empire or state and they ensure that all beings are living in accordance with the harmonious flow of the universe against the temptations of the discord driven wraiths the true celestial matron on rathnir is believed by the twin dragon worshipers to be the velarev of the valante player coffee cubas aka sara riel lelia ircala i had to say that 20 times to get that right as the god empress of her realm here anyone in the out of the north velande must adhere to the tenants of the veil mandate and of twin dragon else they face severe retribution for attempting to throw the mortal realm of salea out of balance while in the presence of the celestial matron if you wish to pay tribute to the celestial matron or worship sen and lin you can travel to the holy city of lumar here lays the imperial palace the museum of divine artifacts and the central temple where the celestial matron preaches i really love this one because it's a great instance of religion embedding itself in the world of the national politics and culture of the outlander valente for this reason i encourage you all if you're in the valante seek balance and keep close to you prayers to sen and lin when i talk about religion in the stoneworks minecraft server this is the elephant in the room so lay in so leonan is the worship of the god solaris he is the creator god of the need and player race of rathnir as well as the god of fire passion and refined emotion and for a long time he was trapped in the sun solaris is worshiped alongside his moon water goddess wife cylene as well as six lesser god aspects a bunch of saints and ancestor spirits this faith is inseparable from the ancient asharian empire you can see this in one important story to the faith in the early asharian empire the town pax romana rebelled and killed the emperor's envoys well as the asharians marched on their fort the rebel players started flying and speed glitching and they were swiftly wiped from rathner entirely solaris himself is then said to have descended on the town and smashed it flattening the entire area on top of it the asharians built this monument to the divine intervention now a town or nation could convert to soleanine to earn the sympathy or protection of the asharian empire and since this was the largest empire on the entire server or even in minecraft history probably the faith spread far and wide in response to various threats this map shows where solanin is documented as having existed at one time or another the faith is so huge that about twenty percent of the religious players on rathener belong to the church in some way or another in order to devote yourself to solaris and cylene you have to be baptized in waters that flow eastward now i called this a church that's because the orthodox view called herlinen i think i'm pronouncing that right has a strict hierarchy the emperor is the spiritual leader of the church and under him exists a system of cardinals priests and mystics that uphold the faith to everyday players there are three levels of involvement with solandin ranging from regular everyday followers of the big gods to the elite circle consisting only of the mystic emperors where they know the real secrets of rafnir only those who know the deep lore truly know the character and tradition of ashariya and solayanin now let's talk holy places because silent has a really expansive history i talked earlier about the void pit on the island of tessel but this is actually more of an unholy place early in asharya's history there was a brutal war on this nearby island where asharians fought the nation of void worshippers so leianin recounts this as solaris himself being ensnared in the void pit and the asharians having to go free him and drive out the heathens sometimes the pit opens back up but they do their best to close it and hide it but sometimes you can't stop it you can't stop it now a really holy place the sonicure cathedral is the centerpiece of the old capital of asharia lilianen this is where they'd hold a bunch of ceremonies and cardinals would give charity out to the town's inhabitants you can visit the cathedral in the flooded ruins of lilianan but being broken and destroyed it's a shadow of the glory it once had going really to the west of rathnir there was a town called jedu salem yeah it's exactly what it sounds like but this is where solaris himself appeared to the past emperor zika ost and a monk the current emperor king zelorm this was at the site of something like an obsidian ka'aba in the town center which they then moved to the temple of il kabuli in present-day yemu aoudal it soon after turned to bedrock and performed many miracles and lastly for holy places stone circles are prominent in solenoinen especially if they're nature groves or mountains it's like they're considered to connect our realm with the greater magical and spiritual realm the animarium and i have to talk about a ritual involved here at one big stonehenge in asharia's heartland on this past january 31st the most dedicated souls of the asharian empire gathered and performed a ritual sacrifice a sacrifice of themselves they communally recited a poem and jumped into a pit of fire supposedly ascending to their afterlife the luminarium this was called the asharian ascension this sacrifice was so monumental the head of the asharian empire was cut off and the whole thing immediately collapsed the eastern ocean sea levels rose destroying the capital of liliana and sinking the island of tessel to finally defeat the void god in cosmic battle the remains of the ascendant players wandered the old asharian empire for weeks and months as spirits attacking anyone who settled it that didn't submit to solaris generally under the leadership of player debbie the spirits would go on to fight all around the world even conquesting the mesa and reestablishing the long-lost state of sewer mafia god this is getting so wacky asharia took a long time to reform but eventually it coalesced back into a familiar successor state the aesperium nidaea so leonan became much more decentralized during this and the new ideas and traditions began to take hold and there's a big contrast between the ancient ashari and solanin tradition and the new ideas that have been added to the mix now with how widespread soleanine is it has a lot of diversity intentional or not in asharia the church is relatively standardized and heresy can get people kicked out or killed but most salient worshipers outside of here worship without using asharian symbology architecture or as much focus on the imperial cult of the emperor the most official offshoot of soleanine is the soleviel faith which claims to trace itself back to the ascension of asharia it rejects the political unification of sulayan and under the emperor and heavily emphasizes unity by faith alone very protestant however celeviel still reveres the saints and gods but not the militaristic saints that are involved with the expansion of the empire you can find its center in the town moviel in the simulani empire in rathnir i really like this it's such an organic process of history and motifs and ideas and big events happening just it's what minecraft religions ought to be [Music] thank you for watching like i said you can join this server literally right now with this ip address play.stoneworks and i will be making another video on how to make religions in minecraft so stay tuned like and subscribe comment whatever you want to do i just want to shout out my awesome patrons who are able to make this kind
