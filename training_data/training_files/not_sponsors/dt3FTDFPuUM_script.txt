welcome to my 10 hp hardcore iron man in the last video i killed eight chaos elementals so i could get the p-plus plus poison and then successfully got my revenge on shadow of the storm oh my god we did it with west point 10 000 ranged xp dark play unlocked but now it's time to finish questing on the account and to do that i'm gonna have to risk my 10 hp's hardcore status again so what if i told you that a certain random event could really help my account out would you believe me well that random event is the dr jekyll random and you see ladies and gentlemen if you have a torso on you and you get a dr jekyll random event he will give you a stamina potion in exchange for that torstel but here's the problem torstels are locked behind 85 farming and that's not really early game content so we need to figure out another way of how to get torsos well that way turns out to be getting 58 hunter and catching nature implings for a one in 100 chance of getting two noted torsos and you're probably saying yeah that's great dude you're gonna get a couple torsos and then you're gonna get a dr jekyll random and then you're going to get a couple stamina potions and you're going to quickly use them and they're going to be gone in like 30 minutes no that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is we're going to save up the staminas we're going to get to 10 stamina potions and then i'll be able to make the revitalization pool in my player owned house what pisses me off is i've already got five or six dr jekyll randoms and i've just dismissed them because i didn't have the torso so i'm gonna start off the episode by getting a hundred kudos so i can go to fossil island and then i'll be able to do birdhouse runs is this historian gonna give me more kudos yep he is 83 88 93 okay so we're actually just seven kudos away from fosso island so i'm going to be doing shield of a rav so i can get another quick five kudos now on this quest you want to join the black arm gang so you don't have to kill anything so for those of you who are tuning in for the first time i'm a high risk hardcore iron man so i don't use the help of main scouts or other accounts but on this quest unfortunately i'm gonna have to to get the other half of the certificate thank you and thank you that's uh that's incredibly opie that you can be given both ends of the certificate i've never done shield of rob that easy in my life we're up to 98 kudos now and we're just two kudos off of fossil island and doing bone boyage oh and we actually get an antique lamp here let's go with hurbler thousand herbert xp all the way to 25. so we're going to try the observatory for our 100 kudos i haven't done this quest in a long long time and this is probably one of the first quests i should have done on the account so bad planning on my end but the whole goal is not to get leo because that gives me hit points experience and obviously i also don't want to get virgo as that gives me defense experience please don't be virgo please don't be leo preferably not be any experience i would rather not get any attack or strength as well and we get oh we got spoons we got sagittarius this is maple longbow uncut sapphire two quest points 2250 crafting xp and uh the five kudos this is gonna get me up to over a hundred kudos so we can start point voyage and there's 43 crafting coming in as well and i just continued to get very very lucky on this account fairy spoons if you're enjoying the 300 subscribers away from 40 000. now let's go upstairs one more time talk to the historian minus and we're gonna be a hundred and three kudos all right i can now do bone voyage at 100 kudos we can also talk to the information clerk which is going to give us some extra experience and prayer mining crafting expecting solar hunter oh wait wait wait i don't want prayer quite yet though do i says i'm only gonna get it in crafting and mining so let's proceed with it okay good up to 49 mining here it is boing voyage completed balsa island unlocked and now i can lose my hardcore status by trying to unlock the mosh tree number three now i'm actually not gonna do that but what i am gonna do is i'm going to be doing my first birdhouse run the issue i have right now is i'm only eight magic and it takes forever to get here i don't have 45 magic to enchant a ruby necklace into a dig site pennant so what i'll be doing is i'll be looking at my quest list to see what other quests that i need to do before i raise my magic level oh you need a clockwork [ __ ] well i decided what i wanted to do next i came to the master farmers to pickpocket some seeds and we're about to get 62 thieving there it is we should have enough guams for at least one full inventory of gothic's rests so since we just unlocked fossil island what i want to do is i want to go mine some soda ash so i can make ultra compost and there we go this should be 500 volcanic ash so i think we're gonna stop here and we should have enough for a decent amount of ultra compost let's go ahead and plant the first guams on this account this is crazy our first ultra compost coming in on the account at just 26 farming that's insane there's our first farming level coming in in a long time 27 can i make apple trees look at that sweet corn it's growing like iowa corn very tall and looks like we got some good some good soil that soil is very fertile hey there's 28 farming coming in can now grow wild blood hops so we're here at copper long tails and what i'm going to be doing is just getting some hunter levels while those seeds grow so here's our last copper long tail this is going to get us to 12 hunter what we're going to try to do is the ascent of our chaos this requires 12 hunter to do i'll get 2500 hunter experience from it which will help with the early grind a little bit so here we go ascent of our chaos this one is going to be very very difficult and you're going to see why in a second here we go first one's going to be easy the next four are going to be very challenging we have to do this all in one go first one down you have to block the ghost before splashing i see i see there we go just like that oh we're close let's just stay stay there we go two down oh here we go now go to the right what why does why there we go three down and number four down just one left all right here here it is it's set up right now oh no it's set up now perfect what nine men oh my now it's the end of the world i'm i'm literally pissed nine magic from this are you kidding me and that's all five completed that actually was not too bad it's funny i've never done that on my liability but i did that on something so i'm pretty sure a trap soul is gonna spawn here i don't think i can use cannon but it should be a hundred percent fully recoilable there we go traps sold down this should be a scent of our chaos completed 1 500 hunting experience coming in 500 room crafting a favorite certificate memoir page and one quest point as well that takes me from 12 to 16 hunter and it takes me from one to five room crafting as well we can now make water runes so we use the favorite certificate which gave us another ten percent on our chaos we're now up to 55 percent we're also going to use our dark disposition on our crest memoirs that's going to give me a new teleport to zea right here and 29 farming coming in you can now grow gout weed if you've completed edgar's ruse got weed gootweed i don't know how to say it just like every other runescape pronunciation every mac age video has at least two mispronunciations and that's probably being generous all right let the hunting games really begin so we're coming in on 23 hunter and then i'll be able to do wild cabots and see you later copper long tails and ruby harvest i totally forgot cabot claws i can use this to three tick manipulate the wild cabots were actually awful and the copper longtails and ruby harvest just got really slow so now what we're going to do is i'm going to head back and see if i can make those guth xt's so we can go ahead and do the getting ahead quest get to 25 construction so i can make the clock work and then get back to hunter but on fossil island here we go the getting a headquest and once again our 10 hp high risk hardcore iron man is on the line oh that's awkward i need 26 construction for this okay it's not on the line quite yet and it looks like we just got our last plank here we have about 200 planks that i need to make into wood products since i'm a construction noob and then we'll finally get after this new quest and see if the rng can be on my side one more bookcase here and we're going to be 26 construction and we are ready to officially start gordon let's start my friend getting ahead i'll give you a hand and so it begins so the next part is to do this boss we're gonna make our way to here and we're gonna try to recoil it so here's what we're gonna do we are going to grab our 26 gothic seas and three rings of recoil let's make sure we're full charged uh 37 that should be okay and that's gonna come down to rng that's the bottom line good luck to us hardcore status officially on the line again so before we begin a lot of you probably don't know this quest this is called the getting ahead quest it only came out about a month and a half ago on the 25th of november 2020 obviously and during this quest you have to fight a level 82 headless beast which hits tens which is of course my hit points level so in order to not die and preserve my hardcore iron man status i'm gonna need gothic's rests which temporarily heal my hit points level above 10. that combined with recoiling i hope to take down all 100 hit points but it's gonna be very very close all right wish me luck so we're gonna gothic's rest up and we're gonna quickly run to the safe spot okay and we're gonna go back and forth and eventually you're gonna see a special attack which is a range attack which is just like that oh i like the side swipe better oh holy [ __ ] that was chance stop talking there's chance number one okay focus oh did you see that that regen there's chance number two that thing regen hit low oh my god are you kidding me oh my god oh my god oh my gosh no no no are you kidding me jagex oh no no i hate to do it boys but we're not going to risk it so here we go here's some clockwork mechanisms so we can finally do birdhouse runs on the account so let's go ahead and build this chest there we go and now whenever i need to bank we could bank right here that's perfect and finally the moment we've been waiting for let's build our first birdhouse is on the account oh my gosh all that work just to build a measly willow birdhouse oh one xp okay one more now there we go 33 hunter and we can leave so barb tailed cabots are going to be over here so what i want to do is i want to go to remington so we can get to corsair cove and that way we're avoiding a lot of the monsters over here in felder pills if we were to go to summer lake castleworks and run south and this should be 37 hunter can now trap prickly kevitz and we're one prickly cabbage away here from 43 hunter and we can move on to the falconry area is it gonna be this one no is it gonna be this one yes there we go 43 hunter coming in and you can now catch spotted cabinets uh it's been a moment man since i've been at this place since liability honestly [Laughter] the nostalgia of throwing a bird at a cabin ah i love it i love it we're very close just two more spotted cabots one more here it is 50 yes you can now catch eclectic implings and we can start the ranger boots grind so i know a few of you are asking well how in the world are you going to get to piro piro without the quest lost city well let me explain to you my friends there are these things that are called crop circles within a wheat field they're different on every single world but if you hop enough worlds you'll find a crop circle right now i think the best crop circle for me is going to be just southwest of the ge what i'm going to do is i'm going to world hop until i find a crop circle and here you go about five hops later we've found a crop circle so all you do is enter how cool is that my friends and we're off now the only downfall that i just thought of about this is i'm gonna be getting some strength xp every time i push through the magical wheat they're eventually gonna change this to agility xp but so i think we just got everything to get a magic butterfly nut there we go so with the help of a friend figured out if we come here on the west side and they stand to the north you get two chances at it two chances is better than one because a lot of the times i'm getting them on my second chance and here it is our first medium clue karamja so here's what i've decided i've decided to do every single quest down the line that i can do so when i go back to doing medium clues then i'll be able to get my magic level up so the first quest is like i said right down the line it's going to be black knight's fortress for every quest that it's available i'm going to be using the quest helper i said this in the last video i'm taking complete advantage what i'm also going to be doing is i'm going to be bringing my magic butterfly net everywhere i go so when i see eclectic gameplays like this if they don't run away from me then i'll be able to just catch them and maybe just maybe get myself a medium clue scroll alright i got it yes we got it but here's another one so that was about three minutes to complete this one this is gonna be black knight's fortress completed and the first of many quests complete there's three quest points for a two second quest that's funny this should be doric's quest completed these free to play quests are very very short one quest point 1300 mining xp and the ability to use these anvils so when i was hunting i had to start the corsair curse and it's next on the list so i decided that i was just gonna finish it you have to kill a level 35 and i'm at that point in the quest he hits sixes i believe with magic so i should be able to fully recoil them or i'm hoping that i can fully recoil them but we're about to see we're starting here's another example of why you don't want to have high magic because stuff like this happens you guys could be like well mac h why didn't you just get your magic to 25 when you do all these quests look at how hard of a time he has hitting me and i'm like nine magic yeah i'm not magic this actually heals pretty quick so i'm just finishing up pirates treasure right now we just have to kill this gardener but i only have a couple of free to play quests left we have witch's potion which we'll probably do next and then i gotta figure out a way to do corsair curse dragon slayer has defense xp so i won't be doing that one imp catcher you get magic xp so i don't want to quite do that one yet the restless ghost i'll be getting prayer xp when i do do it but i'm not going to do that one yet either and vampire slayer will give me attack xp which i'm gonna hold off on as well oh okay you can just run away from the gardener i went back to go get my cannon two quest points and one eyed hector's treasure so i misspoke witch's potion gives 325 magic xp i totally forgot about that so really the only free-to-play quest left i can do for now is corsair curse so i'm going to try to do the corsair curse quest again this time i've gone to cockatrices to lower my magic level from level nine to two so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna quickly attack the cockatrice oh it's already attacked me even better get ready for the poison that should be good okay cute magic that's good enough oh my god it hits eight shut up wow that gave me a little bit of a heart attack i thought for some reason that those only would hit fours or sixes at the most never my mind did eight cross me but thankfully i ate up to full hp i really can't do much better than this looks like we're gonna be just a little bit short unless a miracle happens he's flashing at just nine magic nine magic and he's splashing uh you imagine that wow oh so unlucky man again another quest where i'm so unlucky and now we're gonna run into another issue is i'm 16 xp away from 10 magic and i gotta get more recoils so i could do this one of two ways i could risk it at founder rune for free or i could just enchant these and honestly i see ba going to found a rune right now and losing my account so for this next attempt what i've done is i've brought iron armor that way ithoy's magic attack will hit me more frequently and hopefully we'll be able to recoil it quicker what a sad game man ah how pathetic dude finally we're gonna do it rng is on our side this time five cakes left as well we didn't even have to go into the potential plan of ticketing cabbages oh my gosh dude that was such a pain in the ass this should be corsair curse completed two quest points corsair cove bank access and 73 total quest points now in the next video i'll once again put my 10 hp status on the line only this time while we try to get love okay in favor so we can continue questing on this account if you guys enjoyed the episode please leave a like that really helps me out subscribe if you're new here and i'll see you either on twitch or in the next episode take it easy peace you
