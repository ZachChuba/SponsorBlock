[Music] this is a Finnish Defence Forces 24-hour combat ration it weighs only two pounds 13 ounces yet it contains 4131 calories with freeze-dried main courses and a high calorie content this ration is perfect for cold climate operations so let's give it a look okay so right off the bat got a content sheet then some chicken flavored pasta some curry yellow curry rice looks like something may have burst in this pack I think it might have been a pack of sugar some Apple Cinnamon porridge packets issues a sports drink citrus flavor banana peach chocolate protein bar we have three plastic spoons cocoa beverage powder and these are some kind of crisp bread maybe like a a rye crisp bread I'm guessing a vacuum-sealed pack of honey roasted peanuts to more sports drinks both Cola flavor that's different and another citrus sports drink everything is coated in a light sheen of powdery something yeah I think it's sugar I've got a 50 gram dark chocolate bar feels like it may have melted and reformed a little bit two tea bags for hand sanitizer wipes and then two tubes of pate it looks like then at the bottom here Nescafe gold and two packs it chewing gum four packs of creamer and two packs of sugar okay so there's everything laid out so let's first start off with breakfast you know what they always say breakfast is the most important meal of the day so apple cinnamon porridge some Nescafe gold to go along with that cocoa beverage powder an 85 grand pack of crisp bread citrus flavored sports drink all right let's get the style on your tray nice okay so we're first start off by rehydrating that Apple Cinnamon porridge man that's that has a really strong apple cinnamon smell to it it's tart it just makes my mouth water just smelling it [Applause] [Applause] while that's doing its thing let's check out that coffee and cocoa beverage powder that's a rich cocoa smell you know that right there almost smells good enough to have on its own but it looks like a light roast right there freeze-dried oh yeah the sports drink it smells like paper like bleached paper with a slight citrus undertone to it all right so now this has 10 minutes we're about four maybe five minutes in gives us enough time to check out this what I'm thinking might be some kind of ride crispbread has a nice whole grain smell to it what are those that it's a really interesting whole-grain hard crisp bread a little bit broken up like this piece here I gotta try that out tastes like a combination of whole wheat bran and a little bit of rye now this is here those like I'm gonna put over here that's kind of messy yeah that one broke up took the brunt of shipping I believe any nicer I don't know nice for something and then the pate in a tube it's very like it's like white is that cheese hold on no that's pate and tastes like a rich savory looking pretty spreadable pate that oh that's fascinating right there you know this is this is really something else I just want to dig right in there we go I gotta try out some of this crisp bread with pate that is the perfect combination right away I noticed how light and airy both the pate and that whole grain whole wheat crisp bread is perfect for breakfast it's not heavy a savory moderately salty very flavorful that's a oh wow that's top-notch you could eat these on the go and with the tuba pate that's that's user friendly I think it still has a little bit of rehydrating left to go feels like a little bit of water still settled at the top even though it's so crispy crunchy and whatnot it's not hard on your teeth and that's really a plus it got followed up with army Mochaccino we'll see how it is without creamer or anything else well that's the coffee itself you add two packs to it I would estimate that was like nine or ten ounces in this cup it's perfect the coffee itself it's light that right there it's not bitter at all the cocoa it's rich but it's not creamy you could add the creamer to it and it was lighten it up and add that you know more familiar Americanized kind of hot chocolate where it's you know like Swiss Miss and whatnot it's really creamy and sweet this is not overly sweet as a relatively high cocoa content that's a more crisp bread this magnificent the pate it's not metallic just very whipped and fine maybe a hundred grams of fat a that's that's generous I'm gonna end up finishing this I can't help it the hot chocolate itself a lot of people would say it's watery on its own if they tried it they would probably want to add the creamer but I'm saving the creamer for the tea there is your cocoa powder and a little bit granular in appearance but the texture going down it wasn't alright so let's check out that citrus sports drink not too much food coloring yeah sucralose but that's not the worst thing in the world not overly sweet kind of a lemon-lime now it's time to check out the Apple Cinnamon porridge a little bit lumpy now let's get this away from that oh wow that doesn't mix very well and it's not too bad it doesn't look too good either try out a bite of this oh wow that's bland I mean a very slight actual undertone of apple and cinnamon the way it smelled was like intense you could spackle a brick house with this I mean really the way the texture is it sticks to the roof of your mouth hmm I think I'm good on the porridge it's just not doing anything for me absolutely the best part of breakfast right here finish this up then later on today I'm gonna take it over to lunch okay and we're back with lunch our main course is gonna be chicken flavored pasta then a banana peach chocolate protein bar some honey roasted peanuts a cola flavored sports drink and then some tea all right so let's get this out onto a tray nice okay so we're first start off by dehydrating that pasta it has a nice herbal kind of smell to it smell garlic and curry like a yellow curry right off the bat [Applause] I'll add more water as needed but that right there it's probably going to be enough I don't want it being too much of a soup fest like that last one let's go for that tea let this steep up and the sports drink holder mmm that smells like Cola and some kind of dish detergent all right so then these peanuts is there a hiss I couldn't quite tell I open it too fast oh yeah those then the banana peach chocolate protein bar oh that's odd a chalky soy protein base with somewhat overpowering artificial peach flavor with a pretty nice chocolate coating but it's sucralose and mallets all you know as a sweetener oh wow you know that's making my gums feel like inflamed like almost as if I'm allergic to something in that let me try that again I don't know why cuz I'm hungry but that is not a normal protein bar it's not very sweet even though it's filled with sweeteners I'm not sure if the peach and banana is a natural or artificial flavor and taste artificial it's not that great you got to get your protein but that's unpleasant I want to follow it up with some Cola sports drink what I like about this it's not too much food coloring you know it could be like really dark with an artificial caramel kind of deal and they didn't do that which is a plus and that tastes like flat coca-cola with electrolytes and sweetener like a really flat diet coke that's interesting I'll give it that let's check out these peanuts mmm the outer little fried shellac part that makes it it's like having fried peanuts with a well roasted peanut in the center slightly sweet he can't taste much honey quite frankly if it didn't say honey on the outside I'd hardly know it was still quite good so let's check out this t2 creamers and one sugar that's strong Z I'm glad I threw two creamers in there that's perfect some bold English breakfast tea that it's not weak perfect for 8 to 10 ounces wow the hydration really brought that back to life it does has a fantastic like yellow curry and garlic very creamy and rich smelling look at that kind of soupy not bad so that's lunch the flavor is great the pasta didn't fully rehydrate I let it sit for 20 minutes but let's see here it's very creamy it's somewhat sweet oh wow yeah there are chives I thought I tasted that nice it's chicken flavored but so you see these little bits in there it kind of looks like chicken that's soy which soy protein bar so a pasta this ration it's almost vegetarian outside of that pate the only off-putting aspect of this is the the pasta that doesn't fully rehydrate it's pretty crunchy if you let it hydrate for like 25 minutes of be are you 22 to 25 minutes it'd be perfect they say 15 its minimum 20 follow it up with some tea I don't like the cola the tea though that's a bold English breakfast tea it's very flavorful and adding to creamers and one sugar you think it really kind of take away from that it doesn't it's that's perfect back to this though oh here's a bite with a bunch of soy protein a textured soy protein that was like mock shredded or pulverized chicken let's check out on these hand sanitizer wipes you get four of them you feel almost dry they're not very moist they don't smell like anything and they're very weak well they get the APRI substandard moist towelettes benzalkonium chloride that's that's no scent I always like alcohol wipes more but benzalkonium chloride is still an antiseptic and it does its thing so I was a little bit of a mixed bag for lunch as well from have passed on the rest of this cold drink and protein bar this thing was just not my thing but the rest of it not bad about three or four hours I'm going to take it over to dinner and now to finish off of dinner our main course is gonna be that yellow curry rice and for dessert a dark chocolate bar some more of that citrus flavor sports drink and another t-then the cleanse the old palate with some fresh mint chewing gum all right so let's get this out onto a tray nice okay so we're first start by rehydrating that curry rice [Applause] Wow that's just a another strong yellow curry smell I think it has chives again slightly redundant in the comparison to say lunch 2 very similar dishes [Applause] and that's e citrus-flavored sports drink [Applause] all right so then the dark chocolate bar so it melted and has a teeny bit of fat separation or bloom at the corner but that is some nice-looking dark chocolate right there take a bite of this real quick it's rich dark chocolate good quality but a little bit waxy which is great for being in a ration even though it was slightly melted the corner there it's still pretty heat resistant those tubes of pate and the crisp bread and that Mochaccino blend that's what makes this ration worth finding other than that so far it's kind of a novelty things like this citrus sports drink it's questionable still it's far better than the cola that Cola beverage base I'm never gonna drink that again I can't imagine anybody liking it then the yellow curry race that looks like it hydrated a lot better than the pasta big old pilot race right there Wow that sees virtually the same as the last dish it's just with the yellow rice instead of pasta we rehydrate it more efficiently taste strong of yellow curry and chives maybe a little bit less sweet equally as savory and I'd have to say there's probably not enough sodium content to it it's a little bit underwhelming I think it would have been nice if one of these main courses had like some shredded white meat chicken or like cubed chicken or something because both being yellow curry with a relatively strong overtone of chives it's just it's kind of boring I came into this one hungry and I have a feeling I'm not gonna end up finishing this main the rice rehydrated well and it is well seasoned but I feel like there needed to be something different between the two menus maybe like a beef stroganoff and then like a yellow curry chicken with rice that would have been better I feel like give a little variation for a ration you want to make something that's so palatable so good that the soldier finishes their food you don't want to leave half of a portion behind because things got so redundant they they got sick of eating it and the sodium content is somewhat low and that's because it's a cold climate ration that's he's awesome so like a soldier isn't getting dehydrated with this very high protein high sodium ration you know requiring more water to assimilate and process the entire thing but the soy I don't get it I mean you're getting meat Pat say it's then the fresh mint gum 100% is a little cool oh wow it smells like peppermint candy canes that is some fantastic gum it's a little bit firm like you bite into it but the flavor is great it's not overpowering so this was a Finnish Defence Forces 24-hour combat ration not a bad ration but also not one of the best either well anyway this is Steve 1989 I hope you liked the video I'll be coming back at you it's something new world all right cool see ya [Music] you [Music]
