I’m in two minds, in an awkward situation I just stare and say ba-ba-ba-baby Every day I only imagine Without asking, I talk in a casual way and call your name baby But we don’t even know each other Beautiful no matter what I wear Just the two of us in the mirror having a fashion show show This time, for sure sure, I’ll be the first to talk talk But it’s only in my head, always only in my head Nanananananana I start humming, then before I know it I feel like crying I don’t feel like myself, this is not like me at all I love you so much Think I’m all grown up now I’m free to make my own choices, but why Why can’t I have it my way The more try to I push you away The more I am drawn to you and attracted to you baby I’m like TT
Just like TT You don’t know how I feel,
you’re so mean you’re so mean I’m like TT
Just like TT Tell me that you’d be my baby You say I’m ridiculous, that I don’t live up to my looks Doesn’t cheer me up at all ba-ba-ba-baby I’m going crazy In all this mess, why do I feel hungry I eat all day and I’m still hungry Slap slap slap the innocent doll I sit and lie down all day, and time flies flies flies What’s with the dull skin again Keep wanting to just complain Mom keeps bothering me why why why why why Nanananananana I start humming, then before I know it I feel so irritated I’m so upset I’m normally not like this I love you so much Think I’m all grown up now I’m free to make my own choices, but why Why can’t I have it my way The more try to I push you away The more I am drawn to you and attracted to you baby I’m like TT
Just like TT You don’t know how I feel, 
you’re so mean you’re so mean I’m like TT
Just like TT Tell me that you’d be my baby Do you realize what’s going on inside of me Don’t disappear from my view like this This time, for sure sure, I’ll be the first to talk talk But it’s only in my head, always only in my head Think I’m all grown up now I’m free to make my own choices, but why Why can’t I have it my way The more try to I push you away The more I am drawn to you and attracted to you baby I’m like TT
Just like TT You don’t know how I feel, you’re so mean you’re so mean I’m like TT
Just like TT Tell me that you’d be my baby
