with that said let's get on with the video one of the longest-running feuds known to man is that between the manga reader and the anime fan for decades the two factions have looked for a way to coexist in peace but thus far for negotiation efforts have been rendered useless as neither has been able to find a solution for the other side's problem anime fans biggest problem with margaritas is that they just want to be left alone to enjoy a show in peace without being spoiled or judged for enjoying it in their medium of choice and margaritas biggest problem with anime fans is that they exist the earliest documented instance of this feud goes all the way back to 44 BC during the assassination of Julius Caesar from what we know of history Caesar was assassinated by a group of up to 60 conspirators where he puts up a valiant fight until he saw one of his closest friends Brutus was one of the assassins stricken with grief utterly aghast at the sight of a friend he treated like his own son betraying him dying in despair Caesar uttered the famous phrase you too child and then Brutus replied you would have known this was coming if you read the manga today we will be studying this conflicts breaking down the reason this divide exists so one day we will hopefully be able to see if the two factions will find a way to be able to live together in harmony when we look at the two groups one of the biggest reason for conflict is the sort of perceived class discrepancy anime fans hold on to this notion that margaritas have this kind of superiority complex and think they're better in every way and this might actually be a misunderstanding because on the other side's country to popular belief according to margaritas they don't think they are superior to anime fans at all they know they are and to get to the root of this reasoning we first need to understand how both factions operate internally if we look at the anime fans they can be split up into groups consisting of Shonen fans mecha fans Idol fans seasonal goers Maui lovers casuals hardcore elitist cosplayers meemers sucker and 3GS animators voice actors and that one person is only seen Dragonball Z and on the flip sides margaritas consists of people who watched an anime than read head of the manga and people who watched an anime than read ahead in the manga this gives what marguerita's deemed to be a kind of superpower that gives them the ability to see the future enabling them to act as a sort of prophets always knowing what will come next when the anime fan won't they call this holy ability for sites while anime fans call it being an impatient prick and this is where the root of the issue lies margaritas just want to be able to discuss the latest developments of a story openly and share their excitement of the newest chapters but of course if they do so will face backlash from anime fans who have not caught up as far as them through this they've come to master this secret technique called spoiling in plain sight see in this current era there is a certain etiquette when it comes to spoiling people can be seen as our souls if they are just straight up posting spoilers especially on their social media but margaritas have found a way around this the trick is to only leave cryptic messages that may Li hint at future events but making sure the hints are subtle enough that they can only be deciphered by people who read the manga and also people who are watching the anime people who aren't watching the anime people who don't even know what anime is and pretty much anyone who has a higher mental capacity than the crippled ape suffering from Alzheimer's and thus by spoiling nothing they are able to spoil absolutely everything hence spoiling in plain sight let's look at a case study of how this is done I just really like that character oh oh okay why why are you saying you like that oh no reason I mean I don't want to spoil it for you or anything just just don't just don't get too attached or do it's your choice he's an out-of-context image telling you how foolish you are you know I'm not a [ __ ] idiot right like if he's not dead now I know something bad is gonna happen he's an out-of-context gift showing someone crying when I think of that character great now I know he's actually dead oh you're overreacting I mean there's no need to lose your head if you know what I'm saying you don't know what I'm saying I didn't even know that could possibly mean can you just stop you're pissing me off and I don't want to say something that could hurt you all right but just so you know there's nothing you could say that could possibly hurt Comey son is never getting an animal you take that back you little piece of [ __ ] this is a peculiar phenomenon because of the information discrepancy as in the margarita knows more than the enemy fan we can see them start to disregard anything the enemy fan may have to say oh you have a theory of what will happen next ah that's cute oh you're so cute when you think certain characters are bad right now and the series hasn't done well to develop them yet see in order to have a fully formed opinion you need to know all the available information of the series in question thus manga readers won't listen to the opinion of anime fans until the anime has caught up to the manga however this is a catch-22 as the manga will always be ahead of the anime therefore the conclusion we can draw is that anime fans just shouldn't have opinions this effect is seen in full force when a discussion comes down to which medium is the superior way to consume a series while anime fans are able to consume a show as a passive act margaritas are stuck in a constant state of spot the difference whereby they will make a mental checklist of every little scene cuts every piece of dialogue that is different and this can hinder their opinion of the show this puts any adaptation on a tightrope where manga readers have a subconscious expectation of how the anime will play out and the smallest thing can offset this negatively from the voice acting not sounding as dramatic as it did in their head to the anime not using the exact track they had searched up on YouTube to play when they were reading the scene in the manga please tell me this is let's the famous phrase the manga was better a winning statement that can be used in any and all situations to trump any opinion that may be said about franchise and is the closest thing the anime and manga community have to a real life reverse you know guard well you know I thought the anime was good when I watched her the manga was better look I just prefer having movements color voice act music and I didn't have a problem with how it was handled the manga was better I mean this was an anime original show and it didn't even have a manga the manga was better which begs the question was the manga actually better well even for the most stubborn of anime fans it is impossible to deny that manga has a lot of examples with many advantages currently reading the One Piece manga is the only viable way for newcomers to a hundred percent speedrun the series often times the manga continues the story far beyond what the anime can and there are a few series now universally agreed that should only be consumed in manga form like Tokyo ghoul for example people swear by the Tarkio ghoul manga and for a pretty obvious reason that's right the manga sex scene was way more detailed on the anime completely changed everything but whatever this concludes all the available information that could be found at this moment it should be noted that it is rumored that this type of margarita is simply the vocal minority and that most people actually enjoy both anime and manga and there may be even some manga readers who actually read manga that don't even have a corresponding anime adaptation but it is often impossible to discern them in the shitstorm that gets left behind during any conflict scene in a public setting until then anime fans will continue wondering why another group of people would want to look down on them for just enjoying a show in their medium of choice who will then continue turning around and laughing at anyone who decides to watch dubbed anime while we did not find a solution to how to stop the ongoing feud between the two sides we can still hope that one day the two factions may be able to find some common grounds they finally agree on so yes that's it there's just nothing we can agree on yeah I guess you're right hey guys how you do get the [ __ ] out of here go why are you here neither of us likes you [ __ ] off what an awesome right I know right [Music] hey guys hope you enjoyed that video thank you again to King of Fighters
