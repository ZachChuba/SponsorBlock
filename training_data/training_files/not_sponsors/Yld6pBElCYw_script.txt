hey so if you saw my last video again this is a continuation of the last video of me Nicole diseases and this time we're focusing on the little buggers that are protests but again just to refresh quick in case you didn't see the last video communicable diseases are caused by pathogens and a pathogen is a microorganism that causes the disease there are four main types of pathogen so we've got viruses bacteria fungi and protists practice along with plants animals and fungi are classified as new cards so they have a membrane-bound nucleus and a number of membrane bound organelles unlike the cells of prokaryotes but protists exhibit more structural and functional diversity than any other group of eukaryotes and they are an organism that is not considered an animal plant or fungus protists are also more nutritionally diverse and other eukaryote groups so they can get their energy from various sources some protists are photoautotrophs and contain chloroplasts so that means that they get their energy from the Sun like fats some are heterotrophs so that means that they're absorbing organic molecules or ingesting larger food particles so just like us some protists cannot manufacture their own food and instead obtain energy by taking in organic substances and then there are others called mixer tropes which combine photosynthesis and heterotrophic nutrition so protists are super berries and how could separate into five super groups to help things along so we've got excavator chromel Violetta Rosario archetype Listeria and uni canta excavator include parasites such as Giardia which can infect people when they drink water contaminated with containing the cysts of the parasite they're actually quite cute but they will give you bound area criminal violates include some of the most important photosynthetic organisms on earth and include the brown algae that form underwater kelp forests as well as important pathogens semi-important pathogens I guess such as blood mo diem which causes area and we've got Fido for that's how you say it which calls up potato famine known and then we've got archetype Listeria which includes red algae and green algae along with lamb plants Rosaria consists of species of amoebas most of which have per se no pod√≠a that are thread-like and shaped the unique 'enter also include amoebas that have loop or tube shaped per se Livadia so we're going to go back to the supergroup chrome alveoli and take Plasmodium the parasite that causes malaria which lives in both mosquitos and humans the search for malaria vaccines has been hampered by the fact that Plasmodium lives mainly inside cells hidden from the hosts immune system and Plasmodium can kill new changes of surface proteins just to be the little shift so this is how it all goes down you better take note so when an infected mosquito bites a person they inject the Plasmodium sporozoite in a saliva into the percent the sporozoite then enter the person's liver cells after several days the sporozoite undergo multiple divisions and become merits which then go on to penetrate their blood cells the muroids then divide inside the red blood cells at intervals of 48 or 72 hours depending on the species large numbers of Marilu it's break out of the blood cells causing periodic chills and fever some of the muroids infect other word blood cells and some form kavita sites at this point another mosquito can bite the infected person and they can pick up the Plasmodium comida sites along with blood so damage then form from comida sites each male cow me decide reduces several male comics fertilization occurs in the mosquitos digestive tract and a zygote forms an oasis there was no zygote and a lot of the mosquitoes got the assists then releases problems of Sparrow lloyd's which migrate to the mosquitoes so everyone and then the cycle of infection continues so over all protists are a diverse collection of organisms and are generally just super interesting to read about I mean there is so much to to sing it so let me know in the comments if you do thanks for watching bye
