all right everybody welcome back to another episode of eggs Aria brought to your first month through those links so anyway so what's up dude anything new since last time other than broken audio so it's up i here's the ME system is down so I'm trying to figure out that would be problem it would appear there is a there is power flowing through wires there's actually there is power go I just do maybe it's not enough power I think I think that probably depends on what particular wires oh you're a new mazuma magmatic Dynamo has new diamonds in it so I would imagine that's the that's the problem yeah that is also the problem is all of our everything in Oh it's been down for a while but on the positive side we can get diamonds that's good I'm generating the the diamond boom boom right now I just got a diamond out of it oh okay see you you had some ready I there was actually a lot backed up in the thing inside the void miner tell me I'm experience with being backed up so are you your constipation issues did okay so the numismatic seems to need some of that yeah we it looks like we're out of diamonds in the system so do you Vicente auto export yes yes ah gotcha it ran through until it could not run it could run no more understandable told you I could fix it so I'm supposed to ask you what's in world 1 1 P blocks do we do we do we not want to talk about it P blogs P P blogs yeah huh I assume that was a hands wide question yes actually reporting in for duty yep no it's allowed kaboom booms yeah all right I need me some star metal ingots there's a way to automate the boom boom okay block of lead through star light transmute ah she own it leads to star methyl or ogre the altar is oh I see mate I see like pulling out everything that this is making like and we're not even I don't know whether we're recharging stuff or if it's just using it as fast as it's coming in but we're not even storing anything yet Oh weird it couldn't be exact no no it doesn't but it could be like it uses is it feeding it into a different battery perhaps it could be it could because I think that must be what it is cuz there's mad power flowing through these ones here and it just could could be going a different way powers just angry okay natural alters I see and must go to do this yes all right I'm gonna get some star metal dude yeah oh it's time I can only be made with a higher the Frick we're trying to think through how would I do a redstone timer that is literally all I see for making the star metal is lead you're trying to make star metal yeah yeah I know the only way to get star metal ingots is from smell things terminal or and the only way and let's start dust star metal or isn't that the one where you take iron ore and you beam beam at it with the Asheville sorcery stuff and and it turns it into the different order yeah no star metal ore but the only way to get star metal or its it's a block of lead not iron oh yeah that looks like trans mutating block a led to me I would agree with that yeah the rammer is like star metal or you can turn iron ore into star metal what ok so there's there's transmutation but there's also one where you can take literal like literal iron ore not an iron but if you can get literal iron ore then you can aim the star beam at it and and it'll swap it over it's not shown I don't know where are the recipes I don't know whether that's a new thing whether it's an old thing or whether it's not a thing in this mod pack but that's how it worked in previous times and places and the in destruct what the I'm just gonna find this freaking altar thing because ain't nobody making any sense over here at all I think you make sense so could I make one of these like far away that doesn't boom-boom but that we can do I just I'm trying to think through like a better system for life when you figure it out let me know I think we could all use a better system for life because I've been crazy busy and I need to not be crazy busy I woke up with a headache today so I took the day off of my day job oh wow and so it was I I like I got to clean the fruit fridge out I got the defrost a little it wasn't like I just things that need to happen that I ignore around the house like I was able to do and it was like this is new and unique and exciting and I would recommend do stuff get stuff done yeah I think I might be getting sick which is kind of a bummer what's the last time I was sick was like July or something in a while yeah it actually is actually been a while sick like three times since I was last sick honestly it's been like since July I don't know what to tell you use the crystal to link you take the crystal thing and you put yeah I know what are you talking about I don't know whether I'm not getting any explanation at all though there's like a distinct lack of communication it's oh so it is a LED block not iron huh oh yeah yeah yeah there was your near-death experience with your staph infection on your you're infected yeah you know so okay so that's why I was like freaking it's a resonating wand I don't know what I use to link this I have no idea what I used to link it [Music] it's the resonating or is it the molten pool it's not the rekt the linking tool seems like a good thing for linking linking oh that mothertrucker understood understood alright let's go grab the OL linking tool a let's go grab the Lincoln Logs power going I don't know of any batteries that be I mean check you checked all the above batteries it's all going into it like as soon as I disconnected this stuff really and some yeah yeah yeah huh and suddenly Lorna is improving what why is the weight which which one was sciatic right there and everything was the meadowlands user oh I bet it's the induction here I bet it's the induction heater right here oh is it on I went there it is it was on just you turned off just needed to turn it off you can put it back down otherwise otherwise your power bill goes through the roof hey fine now okay don't worry about it how was your day nice dude listen I mean honestly that could have been either one of us who left that on I know i 100% will claim that cuz yeah cool but oh well so I'm trying to think like quality of life improvements you're trying to do start metal actual sorcery I mean honestly we need to do we need to do a couple boyos we have we have both the astral sorcery and we also have the other stuff or whatever it is the yeah the tech the tech progression the tech progression right liquid power with these liquids or even gas turbine controller okay do the stuff make it good Jesus know I'm talking to the expose led to starlight it gets a new metal which I will call star metal it has some interesting properties I should create summon use it in my research should you know oh this is going to be slow you say can I just link the moon to my wait why did it stop linking why did it stop linking did you not link the Moon I linked it it linked can i link all the things or oh that's right I was working on an upgrade for that to make that faster - oh yeah I can do all of them boys it can do all of them we left off right of me making having the conversion kit bro this is cool what I have accomplished here is truly next level what have you done how have you become next level like where did you ascend oh that's gonna be very slow that's probably uh probably a few minutes I can come back though oh do we evil wait we need to make a chunk loader it sounds like so we need to do we can make one of those right i I've made one there that's what was hanging out around the the void minor so actually yeah I could just eat that one Wow hmm are you I mean alternatively you could just not used I feel like we have a pretty decent amount of resources there you know okay I mean are you attached to that one I am attached to my ways of life oh okay cool so yeah that's that's all it's fine I feel like we've been getting like too many did this I'm all caught up on where we are electrum silver gear and then the bad glass electrum this is bad glass man bad glass man I think you should get better glass if you think your glass is bad what does that even mean like we're like get some gorilla glass or something okay yeah sapphire glass is gorilla glass maybe sapphire I think something's made with something I know that that's I yeah good hypothesis yes I do believe that something is made with something yeah you can definitely make something with something if you do it right all right so now I have that oh yeah that loads quite a few chunks this was the important which was the important bits I was there a way to shrink it down though it seems like there was a way to shrink it down you don't know we'll see do a shift click on it no no all I can do is a right click toggle I just need to immaterial how do I make any dear young I know knots but it shall be fine I know that what do I do help help I just realize I'm dividing the moon back between the blocks but at the same time I believe I can focus on other things okay so I need to you get more of the a starlight liquid and I need to put it in a cobblestone generator but keep it farther away yeah I don't want you to go to the gym today and it's very very disheartening and like how do you live huh I honestly don't know it's hard to but I've been but a very busy day and it makes me big sad to not go to him yeah I mean that's good you know like the fact that it's so important to you to go is it's good which is what I said hi how you doing I'm pretty discombobulated like you know there just the way when things start up the way that it did then like I'm just gonna just put you in your funk you have no idea what's going on anymore a B word but yeah I mean just like I'm sorry I I apologize I'm not I'm not on my game at it harder per se because it's just like I was about ready to eat my computer across the room that is never a good thing to do my sir you say that but yet I so desperately want to sometimes usually it manifests like into I would like I'm I'm good enough to not flip over the table but I have had to replace headphones before like that's you know the poor headphones isn't this supposed to eventually give me what I need yes eventually you're supposed to get what you need [Music] yeah so good luck with that I hope I feel like this wants me to automate stuff like the modpack wants like automation and all that but all the different ways thing it to also took away all the convenient ways to automate stuff so it's like I have to make 18 metal presses in order to have automated wire creation and stuff like that like it's just it's a lot it makes me it makes me tired and want to take a nap this is some Frick you've got some Frick this is some babu Frick right here dude Frick reporting in for duty this is some Babu Frick I'm sorry for your Bobby the Frick was a you point yeah it's just okay just yeah it's our usual kaboom boom bah bum oh my god dude this is ridiculous slightly better wearing redstone redstone glass that's slow ironically I need more glass out of the thing that was making flat I don't know if it's a higher name or just any more glass got an ironic about just glass this is insanity this is insanity I have gone through nearly frickin three stacks of this and it doesn't give what I need I would have to I don't can I get silk touch I have a soul touch upgrade on my ax expectable chick axes from divine RPG chick axe is a throwback going you're going old-school with that one jeez hey if we ever need a sand generator right I've got it I sand generators actually would be nice really I mean yeah right now the only we get sand as I mind I mean it's not difficult I just need to use the bane of cobble and get a stack of cobble and then I convert it that's the only revenue we have to sand right now all I got you did you got me high four stacks of sand and zip nada nothing all right well what a stupid challenge what a stupid stupid challenge that requires you to not even do it the way that they recommend weird I feel like we're getting grumpy about everything here at this point like I am I am Grampy I am happy grumpy dude we're getting at the end of our ropes I got it dude I got so touched seems like an easy peasy lemon squeezy little thing to do nice you easy peasy lemon squeezy that little thingy we need to eat is unnecessary so now let us make you oh that's literally all that's there all right so we have some vacuum tubes what's really no rice and no slime what what are you heck you can go down to the plants but we've never really gathered rice up dang dude you even boiling copper plates and now we're out of the red that redstone crap set dost thou hast wool dis some balls he's not good he's bad I guess oh wait we can make wool out of stuff right definitely narrowed it in on that one but you made wool out of hemp correct is that a thing I think you can take the hemp and make it into string and then you can take the string make it into wool yeah yeah yeah we out here no I just need to get some bone meal or something nope do we have any bone meal I guess not no that's a bum bum bum bum mm-hmm sometimes you just look at look up at the TV and you don't know what's playing and you're like oh that's a bum bum pretty much all right then that should give me the augments or actually I can make these boom three of those and then boom all of those and then now we can go even we can we can take it up to eleven oh wait we freaking wait this other stuff we have for this you do the adhesive or what have you actually that sounds really expensive Frick yeah you you made adhesive before and it was like a lot of yeah that that actually had to do something with the embers Blair what is that that's down that's on and then bucket oh of course he's not that what's wrong no no nothing is ever like reasonable everything's got to be difficult but do I I have to I want bones I have to just go collect those skeleton things good yep give give very nice exactly what you'd been hoping you could spend your time doing I do like doing that greatly dramatically greatly dramatically well these are once again the most ridiculous things in the world but we apparently there's literally will only run off of BC stuff instead of RF so here we are oh that's some easy peasy lemon squeezy boys you find a better way to do the bones yeah dude fertile I prick let me out fertilizer fertilizers the weight the route yep dude mm-hmm and what do you do with fertilizer uh you used it as bone meal make sense so you were wanting to grow something and I wanted to use quick grow rice because rice seems like the best alternative to slime balls right as as it naturally would you know as one does yes you're like how is rice an alternative slimeballs like don't you worry about it I'm not worried about it because I know I'm not worried Oh glug glug look look look look look look look look or alternately I could have just made a second one of those and been good but here we are wonder if I could make one of those just type it into it whoo yeah dude you know we would leave it on and then we roll through everything we would we would end up wasting it all on frivolous things and fruitcakes why would you call a fruitcake frivolous someone might find it quite delicious is that person out there like is there someone I dare someone exist who likes something you don't I I didn't say how dare I was just like I was questioning the how darest now the validity of the statement was questioned not the validity of the person oh god I need to freaking fill multiple buckets up are there multiple buckets there's I just with multiple buckets and no there's not no there ain't multiple buckets so that's do you can make buckets pretty simple by way of the bucket making the bucket maker the bucket making recipe it's fine I just don't want to waste those resources you know I don't think we have enough thousand plates so ten thank you you only have ten plates I know I'm just just bringing bringing that blood pressure back down everything's fine I'm rolled let's make an emerald splash up in here and emerald splash up in here mm-hmm is that a Joe Joe reference the number of facepalm / size you just got why is that what what what do you mean what do you mean facepalm / sigh what the heck is this stuff over here you've got starlight pouring into our cobble generator yeah that's the sand generator you want to see the sand generator you want to see how worthless it is because it doesn't make me the thing it said it was this is here you go Sandra I mean you stand over and then deity collected and sand well you're all that sand don't even need a vein of sand you just do it with your chick axe sand question is does it have to be up like that yes yes it does it do there's a reason I did this for a reason you you want to know the reason is the reason is that because the Starlight moves slower than water the lava will slowly slowly slowly inch back until it destroys your source block so not recommended gotta put it up one block don't you have the sand that would automatically save it nope the sand will start inching towards the Starlights sand the sand inches towards the turf starlight does don't freaking don't ya they'll question me someone's feeling a little defensive today and don't question my authority wow wow there big guy I'm only four feet tall so I wouldn't say big okay alright alright settle down concrete blocks is what this once where's the concrete blocks they're over here how do we make concrete blocks I want to make this into is that the concrete that I need to be it's um okey though he alrighty so alrighty good times here I have acquired a so touch for my flexible pick Bowl somehow I must find the ocean there is no ocean only Zuul I guess we don't need the sand over here anymore because we have since Frick I forgot where the ocean is I feel like you know hard to miss mm the direction though you're in like st. Louis or something and you have no navigation I feel like it'd be pretty hard to find the ocean you'd like start walking in one direction actually this would be pretty equidistant so maybe maybe st. Louis wasn't the best nope you've ruined your whole thing I did I really did but let's forget that the premise is now lost let's forget that and instead what I'll say is say you're in like New Jersey why because it's closer to ocean right but you don't have nav and it's also nighttime and you don't know how to use the Stars because who's that smart you start walking West you don't even realize it and then all of a sudden ah short balls I could have gotten to the ocean in like ten miles if I went east but instead I was I used my colors huh maybe you don't have a compass dude I put on my robe and wizard head and that spawns one for you have you been to Harry Potter world did you get robe and wizard hat no I have not been to Harry Potter world sounds lovely though it is pretty lovely I would recommend it personally yeah okay so I was making redstone chipsets doing stuff just trying to remember what it was that I was going to do to make you be happy I'll never be happy BRB though that was bleak the first man thank you for two months uh Falcon they give this up whoo buddy there thank you for doing five sub gifts that's very generous and appreciated all that good stuff John doublet thank you for five months promise I won't kill you my next animation thanks I appreciate you John devic thank you for also doing two sub gifts that's pretty cool craft your red dragon menu for five months joystick mythology thank you for the sub Parzival TV stream thank you for two hundred bits and then three hundred bits and FF trip thank you for two years of summit much appreciated and stuff do we have that do we have two we had two boys's for all the blizzards we've killed we only have two blizzards we fight a bazillion blizzards I know those aren't blizzards those are like blase z-- or something like that yeah yeah I always appreciate you yeah when you know you're just kind of full of it but you're just like running with it yeah settle down no remember your pills I don't take any actually and you take a multivitamin though are you freaking me not at the moment it's so slow it's so unless we're these buckets coming from yeah mrs. freakin was there anything you had to do to set up the chunk loader no I put it down that was it okay cast magic missile with the darkness all right all righty well um back to the chroma Tom's in his access to the moon what do you mean wait what for more lunar wait what so I have to dig a hole in the roof I'm getting so many mixed signals and feedback dude it's rough are you working on a metal block do you say kind of it was hard to make out I was I was nuzzling my puppy oh that's that's cute what about what about metal blocks what do you want me to make you something we actually have the composite metal we just need to research the thing there's no way what happened to our all our composite mallets in here our composite mallets in here now it's in here now it's and now now it's is what brings us here together all right this is what I was doing the end of the last freaking episode it was like we needed you just picked up all my lumia you're welcome dude you yelled at me when that happened I'm nice throw nice nice throw clearly you should reload with this metal press somewhere worth less in the way of my stuff like that was impressive like like the words aren't even like I don't want to say the words that that was but well done I'm impressed at your arrogance right conversion kit okay so energy generation what are we gonna do here is going to be thing two Pistons I can do that I can't you're yes too pissed in my Cheerios you get no you would be wrong you expect too much of me [Music] not saying that not saying that all right these are getting these are getting sped up look at look at us crank through now we only have like me getting learnt look at me getting learn sup in here are you are you learn ting ya energy generation one completa fide tools what sort of tools would you wish to why can't you do this oh that button to i Ronen gods oh I can do that one wow there's a lot of ingots in here from Gringotts a swing area fire why it's just like the in order to learn this research you have to just eat resources it just takes them and just goes away well I just barely converted the system to automatically smell cringe out of the the powders that we get so that's why you have a lot of that's nice I've just researched scrunch you just dirt no a scrunch aren't you familiar I am unfamiliar with springe how the scrunch stole Christmas you're you're a mean that's regular scrunch yeah I do anything with pulverized coal since I have you know mm I can make Bernie him cool particle customizer what the it's not that interesting at all your reduction research has finished thank you now how many other things must I scan before happiness the follows me or her before happiness but falls me I don't even know what I can and can't scan like can i scan you is there something to do with scanning your face Oh scan composite metal that is a good coal into magma crucible into there's a liquefied coal which then goes into a compression dynamo which then adds more power ah so if I scan and it gives a red X does that mean it's just kind of unscannable yeah cool thank you I don't know guys I was just in my way okay this is actually ball sacks because if this thing wanted to properly create a dam search algorithm all they would have to do is you run an auto check for all these different categories like imagine if you wanted to search something in Google and you had to select which websites you wanted it to search when you just wanted to search the whole web and Google was like oh you can't just search the whole web we you have to choose these websites one at a time I agree it was none of them none was the correct answer that's not what I like guests though okay circuit board was fine I can do that now how to make how about a heck do i how do i oh heck quarts of chips twit sets Oh does that mean I do that no how do I make you there's the redstone chipset I mean do I just do it same with quartz so just quartz it with the quartz you trashcan okay you absolute trash can the formation block is a thing composite pickaxe whoa you just started okay you Inc does this work I don't write compile wait did just do another one it just did another one I can't remember how to do this there are others to do now Oh My lordy this is the worst I'm I'm I'm lost I don't know I know all I'm doing is trying unnecessary permutations not necessarily how that's to what there's more there's more than two associated with this crapola okay this is the worst thing I'm sorry that you're struggling and I recognize I just wish that I knew more of how to help you and could get you out of this situation in a way that makes you feel valued and appreciated and recognized composites paid wait so it's just gonna I there's another thing that means for composite like axe and then there's the worst mmm I don't even know what you're working on right now so it's it's I don't know what I'm working on either I'm just trying to unlock research for crapoly just the future craft stuff again mm-hmm future crap stuff am i right am i right yeah composites paid all that you do what I need oh I need to give you feed you a golden shovel but I have to feed it a golden pickaxe omnomnom I'm gonna it's very slow to eat it I want these to be hey maybe it's giving you a chance to be like oh no I didn't want to feed you that but no it wants to eat it it wants to eat it there oh I'm sure there is more on the previous item [Music] what is the yellow bar I don't get what the yellow bar is dude this entire thing has just become us staring confused at various things going I don't know what you want with me mm-hmm I don't know why you gotta be doing that to me like oh my god this is balls hold on the yellow bar means that the item has been fully scanned so this composite metal has like it has me I've scanned two things from it and the bar hasn't even moved so it's got like thousands of possible permutations move undo all buttons and press scan okay that's puzzle piece hanging here Oh stupid lasers to do this stupid thing that they can't stupidly be automated because it doesn't take stupid power oh I see it hasn't updated oh my god dude I carumba la Bamba or fat in my diet do you yeah I'm mitt a hundred percent carbs 100% protein four percent fat Amen environment I thought you meant in weight three percent of vitamin 30% vitamin oh my god dude your health must have tanked I've literally I just been eating fish and chips for a while cuz it's like fills me up completely it's pretty great good old fish and chips but maybe it's it's like hey maybe an apple and I got okay I guess but I just noticed under my effects that I had malnourished woops my bad do each of these things like do you have to do it in a particular order there now my vitamins 6% what do you want from me hmmm then how if you don't have to do in a particular order then how is it I haven't gotten puzzle Pete yeah I scan metallurgy before on its own and it didn't give that to me so there must be order to it order must matter an order of the finest I think this is the last piece I need for this also what else was the other that was axles and decoration is metal block yeah okay 100% dude order does matter on this where did I find where am I supposed to have found Stygian iron ore do not know oh yeah hammer wait I can't make it if I can't make it oh it's done Zoda wow it's done zode I did it I did it yay I made a metal block out you figured it out I'm so proud of you okay from this point forward I will be looking up a guide for future pack and have it tell me everything neon energy research that just that just sounds like cheating I have advanced my research abilities now I need energy for this researching only one of these tasks needs to be completed to fulfill this quest you don't need the oh man it's a really a tall capstat hard it all caps tit okay oh god oh my pulverized iron is now gone cool did you do a boo-boo what you doing there dude what why is why are you the way you are holy balls oh I must redeem any things oh that's why those are nice so what did you do that was bad I don't want to talk about it what did you - that was bad nothing I think you did something that was bad what did you do I don't want to discuss but you do oh I really do but what I mean is I don't I think you do silver sheet metal that's silver plates I need iron ore pulverized iron MEK Diddley isn't that pretty easy to do what no really you can't just put it in pulverizer I mean I maybe we still have let's see the thing what the hell is a pulverizer but no the see the thing is you say what the hell is a polarizer what the hell's our pulverizer let me show you it's right next to me I am literally there there's the full ver eyes ER wait does it actually work on that if that works then that's great because I'm in the middle of making other students right there and also like are you okay also yeah we don't grammar we don't have any more polarized because he auto set it up to smell it so that's why we so I realized what the polarizer is right there so unless you like the problem is you put it in oh you put the polarizer iron you got back into the ME system anyway [Applause] yeah you don't need the grinder though that we the pulverizer works too so we're gone it's fine everything's fine how's it your day it is fantastique other than the part where I think I might be getting sick and the part where it was too busy to even get to the gym and I'm probably gonna be too tired to go to the gym after we're done streaming so otherwise not the best okay all right took that in a direction there now magma wait does that mean that I could just press this little set okay fine it's fine everything's fine oh I picked up your things why because you put your metal thing too close to my crap what'd he say it I don't know why I wish he could find peace in the world that I could find all of our machines all of our tech and Here I am with a hammer banging on a play with the lock my lava just went away why did it do that sometimes lava it goes away you fool fly you fool my lava just disappeared from my hand and didn't go in the thing okay cool it's pretty neat that's a trash can right there dude I feel like that's a trash can is like a new things it's a new thing ah yeah yay alright so then I can smelt this oh no I'm okay everything is fine don't worry Mike what did you what did you do now I went to the wrong place yeah okay now I am okay Kay I take take care of you I try I went for a swim oh no hey I did a quest thing oh look that worked the lava disappeared the first time but now it's there now I need you hammer you hammer you hammer um and then I need ya anvil cool what is this oh nice I guess I do have I'm off by one son wow that was some anger right there holy shorts dude I can't take it anymore I don't I'm gonna you're gonna kind of log on and pretty soon you're just gonna come in and they're just gonna be lava and flames laughing in the corner like watching it all light going yes Bar IP headphone users my god dude ah the headphone users are fine no one heard a thing they hurts many things Wow Oh scrunch that's the scrunch I was looking for right there mm-hmm oh I got a lot of silicon wafers what am I even doing with my life okay and doesn't sound like it everything is fine off by one [Music] I wonder what I do for other things here suvolte parts is it does it need the recycler because that sounds like trash ok cool now as I recall I take a magma block and I put that like there and then the magma block goes like there and this goes what oh you're just you're just making more stuff easy right I'm making the right stuff you Shh the right stuff I mean I didn't say it was the wrong stuff more stuff I'm doing the things that you do not have the research to accomplish so it's true I it's never been made entirely clear to me how we're supposed to research stuff like that because it's a pain in the dick the old pain in the dick huh why not do it all instead of duo just a little bit okay so you are that how we can make neon coils make neon the coils [Music] you're missing the scrunch can be made using the I Ron rod [Music] so close give it yeah okay so the only thing left is the cow blaze little happy hoppy sand and I do the conversion to this with something other than OS I can use the hammer just a craft with you eat or a mesh yes oh oh I put this Indian curry style into there I understand what I must be doing no no wait what do you must do I must research the neon cristal know what that doesn't research what what get right out of town research the table to get the cable what do I hit it with is it the hammer no I put the thing down and then it's like I get the hammer and then it's like okay and then that there no mmm oh god do have another tech table now God I didn't retrieve another new I don't want to break that it has all the resources already in it balls it has the resources and it's balls the resources in its balls don't question it there's there's a lot of resources too I mean if you think about it what am I thinking about yeah the tech table has been fully researched no no gosh darn it it's really hard to remember all the sequence of events that's the prescient viewing and right clicking and then prick know what's the forge you boom you boom you boom no that's really harness feel like it should be a
