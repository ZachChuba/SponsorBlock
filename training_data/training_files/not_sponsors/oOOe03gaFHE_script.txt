I have been wanting to do a day-in-the-life and a Tesla full self-driving video for quite some time however my life is not exciting as many other day in the life videos one I don't have a life and two I don't have friends therefore I will combine both topics into one video I'm stating the obvious because I don't want you my two lawyer viewers to think that I am showing off my $60,000 Tesla 74 thousands including autopilot for self-driving tax and registration no what I have a software engineer of one of the top engineering company not at the fact that I'm extremely good-looking I am self-classify as a vision like an Asian but less intelligent even though one might think having a software engineer title makes a lot of money I on the other hand make very little a number were mentioned received responses such as I thought you a software engineer you make less than an uber driver and my favorite do you Asian I love morning I love seeing the first sunray smelling our freshly grown garden flowers and hearing bugs consummating unfortunately I live in a freezing winter land so everything is dead however even though working up in the morning is the second hardest thing I still manage to get up at 5 a.m. every day I wake up early because I like the feeling of knowing that most people are still asleep I say I'm preparing for the day it gives me a sense of self-control and feeling that I have a head start I also appreciate life as I never know which morning will be my last I used to start my day by making my bed it is a small task that would influence the rest of my day and gives me an early sense of accomplishment that unhelpful more productive throughout the day unfortunately I'm married now and Nikki is an angry sleeper so the best way of waking up is not to wake her up I eat two bowls of cereal and prepare a Gatorade for working out we have our own mini gym in the basement this works out well since I stay at home order exercising in the morning prepare myself for a long day ahead as physical activities stimulate the release of dopamine and serotonin this brain chemical boosts my mood and overall sense of well-being one good thing I have going for me is the lack of driving and I had to do since the purchase of autopilot and full of driving we gambled $10,000 total for promised that we will have a complete full self-driving by the end of 2019 however like many of Alon promises the time frame is a little off it was not much of a problem for Nikki and I as having auto steer for highway was quite enough we even use it in the city although not recommended we just have to manually take over at intersections stuff for traffic lights stop sign and people to fully appreciate full self-driving I need to take you back in time to three years ago I was a young bachelor then with many viable options and happily engaged to Nikki I was deeply in love so in love that when Nikki spoke I thought I heard bells as if she were a garbage truck back in I remember every single detail of her like when her hair glisten in the ring like nose hair after a sneeze her eyes were big and round like two brown circles with big black dots in the center her face was a perfect oval like a circle the Hat is to side gently compressed by a ThighMaster my last ride was a sports coupe a menu transmission Biasi imagine a Porsche but cheaper way cheaper I had everything going right a new very little of tests light for self-driving you see I love driving stick shift but after a while my wrist gets soared that's not the only reason why I was sore but it adds up my morning commute and involves dick shifting into traffic at five miles per hour fast forward three years later I'm now married but I am a proud owner of a Tesla so I got that going for me unless we split they suggest the house and then the Tesla would be mine and mine alone studied this show that the number one reason for divorce is marriage stuck in traffic is no longer an issue the Tesla monetary will keep the distance between the confront and keep on driving without interactions pair that with an immersive surround sounds tuning into I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor I'm as calm as Vladimir Putin to an election day I arrived I work at around 6:30 and 7:00 and most time get my favorite parking spot which is next to the curb and nearest to the entrance you see car has four sides not counting top and bottom so if I park my car next to a 90 degrees curb the chances of accidental touches reduces by 50 percents yes I know car get scratches and dents no big deal that's like saying don't get married because 50% of marriages end up in divorce I badge in and get straight to work speaking of badge I used to look around keys like I was a prison guard now our garage automatically opened when paired with the monetary and house door auto unlock with my 1 plus 60 is near resulting in no keys carried this is what I carry every day for cards and a 1 plus 60 imagine one day when we can go full digital and only a phone is needed when heading out that is the future I look forward to most people would read their emails I mock or a thread to jumpstart the day most day a fix bugs some days I pushed to master our team has to stand up every morning at 10:00 we end up with a joke 99% of the time I provide a joke I'm also a scrum master for a team I have a scrum master suit but it's long expired my company doesn't know that and I plan to keep it that way for those who don't know a scrum master is the facilitator for an agile development team scrum is a methodology that allows the team to self organize and make changes quickly in accordance with agile principles I had to Google that maybe I should renew my scrum master suit our main programming language is Xi sharp this is my standing desk these are my chairs I use all three as I never stay still this is for nice standing this is for high ceiling this is here in case I ever needed I avoid going out for lunch to save money hence the two bowls of cereals in the morning I was raised in poverty so I am used to eating only two meals a day my company rotates snacks every quarter so it's not like rice krispies oatmeal's kind and cliff boss when I do get hungry I leave work at 3:00 since going home achoo is considered leaving early and frown upon I do not bring my laptop home because last time I did I left it on top of the car and it increased my drag coefficient plus I like to separate work and personal life it's the same reason why I go to work when I can work remote one hunt going and leaving emphasized on such separations and getting off work gives more meanings imagine if Christmas was every day Christmas would no longer be special I look forward to leave work as I can be with the love of my life my Tesla monetary the Korean auto stares in beta and since I commute in the city I have to manually drive in the neighborhoods and at any intersections and of course it does not recognize traffic lights and stop signs yet we received traffic light and stop sign control update on April 25th the years stay at home and limited toilet paper protip this was the beginning of a new era the time when we can all look back and wonder if this was the year to start a Skynet if Tesla is successful we will not only see complete full self-driving but also the birth of Robo taxis where dreams are made of and futuristic movies are based off fully autonomous cars that can pick up and drop off people and we are at the forefront of this technology we are the one that will help Elance dream come true and in return make the future a reality to understand what this update has to offer we need to understand that the current full self-driving package does not allow for fully autonomous driving despite the name implies but only a smart cruise control a very intelligent cruise control it can stop and go by following the car head while staying in lane and even changes lanes on its own therefore this new update is a big improvement on top of what Tesla has to offer traffic light and stop sign control is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs slowing your car to a stop when using traffic aware cruise control and auto steer this mean that this update will work for people with autopilot and people who paid more for full self-driving this feature will slow the car for all detected traffic lights including green blinking yellow and off lights as your car approaches the intersection your car will indicate the intention to slow down via notifications slow down and stop at the redline shown on the driving visualizations to continue to a stop line push down a gear selector once we find that using the gear selector is much smoother than tapping the accelerator pedal if you favor using the accelerator pedal like we are turn on chill mode to ease acceleration since our Tesla have instant torque this feature will be conservative slow down often at first and will not attempt to turn to intersections over time as Tesla learned from the fleet the future will control more naturally to enable shift your car into park and tap control autopilot traffic light and stop sign control I have a feeling that the ability to turn through intersections will come sooner than expected and will bring us closer to fully autonomous driving my dream daily commute is to only need to get into the car and it drives me to work without any interventions however there are still many problems need to be solved one be able to get in and out of a tight garage our Tesla monetary is equipped with homelink so we can open our garage door inside a monetary this should and can be automated so once the driver is set the gear selected drive mode it will open a garage door and head out to navigate on autopilot inside neighborhoods where there aren't any lanes three recognized traffic lights and stop signs for turn two intersections five recognized four-way stop in our testing test I will slow down and stop at any traffic lights later not the camera can see the traffic lights a 500 feet away and will recognize traffic light colors at 300 feet while making this video we receive another Tesla update on may the 4th be with you this update makes auto pilot capable stopping at crosswalks and driver will get a brighter traffic light visualizations Tesla seems to have improved the speed of smart summon as our monetary was able to navigate out of the parking space faster I know a some of you are thinking this is not even close to fully autonomous and you are right but it is the beginning of something very special something beautiful and unexpected something extraordinary because we are the one helping Tesla soon fully autonomous a reality as we are the one sending data back to Tesla we will look back and remember that it was this day that started it all the beginning of what might be the end but not like an iRobot more like in wall-e where humans no longer need me to drive although full self-driving is not fully autonomous what it is capable of now isn't enough to make one life easier traffic are no longer an issue well it still is but I no longer road rage long road trips are fun you no longer need to focus on driving but rather having your eyes on the road in case of an impending doom you can keep your hands on the wheel or do what most people do and use your knee to nudge the wheel when Tesla checks up on you only a full self-driving Tesla has changed the way I Drive this is how I sit this is how I Drive this is how I make lane changes this is how I park and it's probably gonna go reverse this is sweet look at that camera Oh oh my god Wow it's gonna stop noise and this is how we meet every day after work this is my Tesla Model 3 with autopilot and for self-driving for self-driving will not work now now in the future with roads that do not happening markings this mean back roads off-road and even in the neighborhoods are our the questions once they are lane markings it would dry comfortably on a fairly straight line once there is a turn especially in the city it was struggle to keep up as it has to recognize the curved lanes the adjacent cars and the curbs separating the roads the current autopilot can do it but it will be too slow calculating all those scenarios and therefore it is better with human interventions on highway is where full self-driving shines to be fair Tesla does recommend to only use it on highway which is the reason why out of stairs currently in beta you will hear autopilot and full self-driving used interchangeably and that is because they are essentially the same except different autopilot costs three thousand dollars and includes traffic aware cruise control that matches the speed of your car to that of the surrounding traffic meaning it will follows the car in front of you even after a stop it also come with auto steer to assist in steering within the clearly mark lane and uses traffic aware cruise control full self-driving cost seven thousand dollars and includes navigate on autopilot which actively guides your car from a highways on-ramp to off-ramp including suggesting lane changes and automatically engaging the turn signal and taking the correct exit once you turn on the turn signal Tesla will intelligently calculate every safe to turn I must have feature to make it easy for the driver you can turn on automatic lane changes without requiring the drivers interaction in our testing current lane changes is - but early smooth when you initiate a lane change and another car is already there it will wait for the car to pass or be out of the way before it changes Lane my number one fear in changing lang is that the split-second I have my eyes away from the front that you're looking back or checking the side mirrors before I turn there will be another car slowly getting into the lane resulting in a collision this is no longer an issue after you switch on auto lane changes Tesla will change Lang when ever it feels that the other Lane is faster but still keep the highway speed in mind auto park is another great features but only you can activate it there's the P indicated on screen when Tesla senses an empty parking space however it rarely shown on screen it's like trying to catch a Sun rare Pokemon if you can successfully activate it it works wander the most anticipated feature is the smart summon every day after work I would summon my mother tree and we would meet each other in the middle it gives me a warm feeling to know that other people are excited to see it in action like I am smart summon is still quite new therefore it does not react fast enough to be usable in a crowded parking lot the time it takes for it to get to your location you can get to the car faster many times my mother tree could not find my GPS Who I am near building so I have to walk a little bit far out and then I can use smart summon however it is a great features if you are parked far away and do not want are unable to walk to your car someone is also useful in tight spaces such as when two big trucks squeezing your car in between you can use the test lab to reverse or forward your way out when I'm home I spend time with Niki and our birds we have hobbies such as caring for our lawn having team projects and watching movies and TV show on our tablets in bed even though I have a computer science degree I don't have a well-paying job no ideas exciting you should know as there's no such thing as an exciting job unless you're a banker and knowing every detail of the bank before you rob it I do however enjoy people and people make a better workplace my life is not glamorous as other in the day in the life video it's not always sunshine and rainbows people exaggerate on social media don't let other people's life belittle you you are you you do you and you will find happiness your way PS the people that always answer your how are you with living the dream they are dead inside you
