hello everyone it is Chelsea Fagin and we are back with I know I always say an extremely exciting episode of the financial confessions but this is truly a very very exciting one because we have a guest whose book I can honestly say changed my life in many meaningful ways and I cannot wait to talk to her but in our description or our show notes as I mentioned a guest who is so exciting I cannot even tell you how nervous I was this morning but I've kind of calm down now she's very approachable in real life Kelly Cutrone hi Kelly hi everyone those who may not be as obsessed as myself who are you tell us a little bit about yourself I started a PR brand strategy public relations and fashion show production company in 1995 called People's Revolution and before let's just back up in 1987 I moved to New York with no  clue as to what I was doing I was a total party girl I wouldn't wake up before 5:00 p.m. because if you're out partying all night long at nails and save the robots it's hard to get up early and Anthony Hayden gasps - inspired bonfire of the vanities Bruce Willis actually played him and bonfire of the vanities told me one day I had to get a job and I couldn't because I'd already been evicted from my apartment by this point I was living on his couch and he said you need to get a job and I said well I want to be an MTV VJ and he said oh you're far too smart for that why don't you be a publicist and I said well I don't even know what that is and he said oh it's what you do you just talk all day and put people together which is not what PR is I know everybody thinks that's what PR is but so anyway I interviewed for a job with Susan blonde and from that I became the director of PR it's been which I was the director of myself which was a rock magazine that was a competitor Rolling Stone and then I started a company called Cutrona Weinberg which ASA mine Berg which is now called untitled it's the biggest management company in the world they manage like Naomi Watts and Ashton Kutcher and Penelope Cruz and people like that I sold that when I was like I don't know 25 26 and then I became a tarot card reader because why wouldn't you after that on Venice Beach I lived in Topanga California philosophy and then I started People's Revolution in 1995 which is a brand strategy fashion show production in PR firm and then about 2001 I got a phone call from Anna Wintour that they were leaving a show called the hills I didn't know what that was like you know I don't even know who's running for president basically so I wanted okay and I always played the role of Lauren and Whitney's boss I'm not show and then I was on the city and I got show Bravo call kelenjar that I was a correspondent for dr. Phil and I was a judge on America's Next Top Model four seasons 18 through 22 I think and then I wrote our New York Times best-selling book called you if you have to cry go outside and a follow up book which came out the day after Osama bin Laden got killed oh my god it's God works for me days later Arnold Schwarzenegger said that he had a child with his maid is just not the best time to release the book but I was kind of happy because I didn't want it to come out then and I was told that I was hysterical and I should shut up and make nice for the book company so I did what they said and we've got them because so I think a lot of people who are listening to are watching this so as I mentioned your book for me was life-changing and that's what made me want to talk to you before this show but I think a lot of people who are familiar with you out there and audience let's say because they're not fashion people okay no offense guys I'm sure maybe Rob maybe you are well that I thought that they're not fashion people proposition people look better than fashion well you know I think it's probably financially healthier for them to not be fashionable fashion people but they're probably agree with you from reality television and we were talking right before we started recording about to what extent any of that was real and I'm so curious first of all about how that came to be or how real it was and the finances of being on reality television okay I can see that do it well let's just start with hills not real not real at all finances great did it I did the first up the first season of the hills I did for free because I got a phone well I thought it would be good for my client yeah I mean I had no idea what the show was but I didn't realize that they were getting higher ratings than The Sopranos and Sex in the City combined and it was a big show it was the highest-rated show in the history of cable I mean it was huge those girls were on the cover of Rolling Stone like blake beverly so they had to be pushed there's a little news flash i don't think anybody's ever said that i they were calling me like you're a publicist tell them it's good for them it's good for you somebody says do you want you know but you know people wrote songs on the cover of Rolling Stone you know it's good to be on the cover of Rolling Stone so on that show not real great for me because we would shoot three episodes in a day first season I did for free second season I think I got either 7 or 17,000 and app then it was time I had a great lawyer which is always important for whatever you do like just I have five lawyers tax lawyers all different kinds of lawyers just save your money so you can pay worse because if you ever the right lawyers you can make way more money and in this case the way my lawyer had negotiated my contract my contract had come up and I was pretty smart that I was like not only playing the Cruella De Vil role and like you know shooting down kids left and right making them cry and like you know staring gaze at each other and like somebody had to do that on a show everybody was blonde I mean I was like the closest thing to like a mafia chick I can shoot everybody in leaf and which was the role that I played on tomorrow as well did you consider it acting sure yeah yeah yes I considered acting I mean of course I drew on my experience of rain fashion producer and an agency owner mm-hmm you know because the situation's were very similar to my daily life so it wasn't a stretch it would be like asking Juliette Lewis to play the cool girl not that hard for her right you know what I mean yeah so but by the time I left the show so at that point I think my agents were like you'll be lucky if you get 35,000 in episode and I knew the girls were making probably close to 80 or 100 in episode and I was like this is like I'm bringing back drop by bringing all of this and so you know women have a hard time asking for what they want you know so I was like this I'm not doing this so I start for free and a typical TV talent by two and a half seasons I'm like this I want 60,000 and F three halves of Bremen and then they're like and then they were like you'll never get it and I said well don't negotiate for me and I got it so you know there were times that I would make like 180 G's a week you know I work one day and make a hundred eighty now of course you don't get to keep all the back you have to pay tax and then you have to pay your agents you know 10% your manager 10% your lawyer 5% so that's 25 government gets 33 to 45 depending on how you do everything but still it's great that's huge money and so yeah but it becomes really crazy because then you like see a painting that you like you know and then it's like 30 grand and then it's half enough like that's like a starting good way to measure yeah I know it's you know the show is gonna end which it did obviously so it's like you can't mentally I mean this is pretty this way abundance is abundance and yeah you know what about calendars finances reality a reality show totally real finances $20,000 an app a 160,000 hellish experience hated working on Bravo hated being a Bravo Liberty that was I was very nonconformist they didn't love me I definitely did not love them by the time we were shooting I think the second or third week I was already going back to MTV and um telling them I didn't want to stand Bravo and I wanted to come back got a pilot on MTV but then Liz Gately and Tony de santé over the head to the network were planning their departure which affected to pick up up my show what was so bad about being a Bravo Liberty in particular well I think that Bravo treats women like and their messaging is pretty horrifying and I'm not gonna say like I'm friends with people that are on the network some of the people but overall I think that the message that they give out you know to people is that women are hysterical and out of control and drunk and crazy and jealous and you know they want you to like do like stupid Greenstein green screen stuff like you know who was really good at it like Jeff Lewis and his assistant I don't know what her name was okay yeah like those people are great at like green seem like oh look we're having a fake picnic uh like I'm not like a party picnic girl like people probably know that I'm just not like a Bravo Liberty I don't excited about red carpet stuff I'm not a team player if I don't believe in the captain of the team yeah I love a lot of Bravo shows oh no I do uh like down below like the Real Housewives oh you do but I often find myself like might when you know my husband will sometimes watch you know see me watching in the kitchen or whatever he's like mmm you hold yourself to a higher standard like these women are being portrayed to your point in such a way that often makes me feel even in the moments that I love it the most very uncomfortable can I recommend like 90 day fiancé because I was like everyone says I have bad TV I just don't like TV that diminishes and demonizes women there is a 90 day fiancé these girls are just as bad as the guys hanging out wait so there's an eat yeah it's you know but on Housewives it's always like hair extensions lip injections drunkenness setups betrayal and then four guys in a suit going honey are you ready to go and I just kind of feel like yeah and I know people that have been through that process like Kelly Bensimon is a good friend of mine I really like Llewellyn a lot like Caroline Manzo from Jersey like literally wanted me to marry her husband if she died like I was in place like that was the joke yeah Bravo because we I met them because you have to go to those probably Bertie things and so when they get ready for the season you have to go there and do that green screen stuff if you noticed like I was never in any of that because they just like they were just like she's not even playing by the rules so but Caroline at one point it's like just so you know if I died I told Elle I want you to marry him and then the joke was like coming up next season on the Housewives of New Jersey there's a new girl in town and I like kill jeana's dog or whatever not I don't believe in animal abuse I'm vegetarian just um I find it compelling but also sometimes very dark is how on a lot of these shows there's obviously an enormous pressure to portray a very very high level of wealth and in every franchise there's like multiple housewives and husbands who get you know out of this being frauds or embezzling or fraud most of those people have any money well that's what I'm saying but I think they can't talk about it is the thing I think they would be very reticent to talk about even just the expense of looking that rich on television you know like a lot of them are in deals with their condo buildings to get an apartment or read a film there a lot of celebrities are you think oh yeah I mean I think I know I'm not sure and I don't have any proof of this but I live in Soho in the building across the street I think that celebrities like Justin Timberlake okay who lived there we're enticed like I know for a fact that real estate developers I can say this generally speaking that real estate developers cut deals with talent to move in so they can say oh lenny kravitz lists in the building or like fi'in a-- oh you know Nicole Kidman or somebody has an apartment here you know you got X amount of like highly visible people and then the rest of the people who want a similar lifestyle so 90 percent probably if my neighborhood are foreigners a lot of Chinese people you know a lot of a lot of like international and then very few celebrities actually live in the neighborhood and then you have a ton of like really rich Wall Street people but those are the same people that want to go to Goldeneye and see Kate Moss topless mmm do you know what I'm saying yeah but I guess I mean well that's an interesting question from the PR industry because I'm very very unfamiliar with it as well as the fashion industry yeah but what seems pretty striking is how much once you become famous like you don't need to buy anything anymore because basically everything you're wearing the things that you're doing are often gifted to you in some capacity I think it's a kind of Fame I don't think people want to give to reality people know that's probably true not very often but most celebrities for example when you see them wearing things even in the street I've heard that often times most of that stuff is gifts yeah or they get paid to wear it they get actively paid like $250,000 Jesus really yeah and but you obviously must have established that that hasn't an amazing ROI for you to do that even if it is to it well you know what people don't ever it's really really hard to check our o eyes you know these days I mean yes if kendall Jenner wears you know a baby nape sneaker that secrets gonna blow out right you know or if Gigi Hadid like when she was doing was it Stuart Weitzman like this or Weitzman boots yeah like she blew that round up same with Tommy so there are people they do it but then there are people that are really questionable or people that you really do want to dress like tapeline chat or Tilda Swinton but they're not really gonna they're not driving the same right I mean like Halle Berry okay yes she won an Oscar right I think for monster or something but before that you could name the five Valentino dresses that she wore that Philip block put her in you couldn't name five films that she had done it right you know you have all these red-carpet personalities and nobody's never you always like you know me I already I've been here I know who no-one is but it's like you know nobody really knows what these people do but they just all show up have you been to a Hollywood red carpet where they have signs I've never been to anything oh okay so they have signs where they just like have the name which i think is really weird like I mean I was never a red carpet girl I would always go around paparazzi and then just go to the back or we'll go into the event but there are people who stand there and wait and then their publicists have a sign with their name on it and then they go down the red car and then they go like Susan Miller or whatever and then everybody goes Susan but like nobody and then they have like a little sheet like what shows these people are hot and stuff but it's a great corporate culture but do you find that in the fashion the PR the Hollywood industry's there's like an extraordinary amount of it seems from the outside of artifice around money that people have around the cost of things just a hole seeing things seems very obscured I think that the whole value system is like totally like a speck weird upside down and 90% of it is fake and like what kind of things that tend to be fake most people in fashion and entertainment don't have any money I've heard that often they don't have any money I always say the definition of a fashion person is a masochist who has who likes to travel and I only want the best I want it yesterday and I'll pay you in 90 days that's fashion person do you like talking about money personally sure I can talk about money what about so I think one thing that I'm very curious about and to get into your book a little bit so it obviously you should all read it if you have to cry go outside yeah I'll just email me I'll send you a copy for free since my company never sends me checks anymore well one thing that kind of sticks out in the book is you kind of have to me anyway is it seems like you have a pretty normal background economically average no below average although I grew up in a socially economic challenge families that you say my parents didn't have any money well I'll support my mom yeah totally but our financial planning whatsoever in my family what I mean by that though is when you came into this world you were probably surrounded by people who came from the opposite who had you know who came from an enormous amount of money would you say that's accurate when I came into the world of fashion and NPR oh yeah I was in way over my head I mean culturally I mean I grew up in a place where cow-tipping was a sport and like fish fried fried and pizza was like a night out but I have to say at the same time there was a really beautiful upside to that too yeah because people had to be they had to be more interesting because you didn't have things to cover up the fact that like you weren't at the car lot right you know any mean when you're at a fish fry you don't want a Friday night you kind of have to talk to each other like you know Eartha Kitt's not gonna come out and do it dance like you have to figure out what you're gonna talk about I'm always very interested in how people who came from backgrounds that were you know working-class middle-class etc and come into a very different environment where you know as you mentioned a lot of these people in these jobs aren't making money so they usually will come from some kind of inherited or generational wealth in order to do courses you either sleep in the stable is that worse or you have six there's nothing in between and I'm always curious with people like that what that felt like did you feel insecure at first ever I felt really bad I felt I felt not prepared for the world at all that I walked into until this day any of the advice and my mom graduated high school that she actually given me the best advice in my career whether it's been paid or unpaid people like that really just has some really like oh just you know like mom if I don't get 69 thousand by tomorrow dollars by tomorrow I'm gonna like balance my payroll Oh get over it do you know how many times just pull your tenacious you always end up on your feet pull yourself up from your bootstraps you'll be fine you know like yeah really you know is really good but when I got into the industry I felt really bad I felt really unprepared you know I'd be at tables and people would be like oh well then we would go skiing in Gstaad and you know we spent the summers in Capri I had no idea that she Todd was in Switzerland Rick he was in Italy I I didn't know anything and then we would be at a table and there would be like a lot of silverware and I was just like oh my god like there's silverware like above my plate yeah you know because the only information I got was like start from the left and work your way in but that's it include like four spoons to the right a fork a knife and a spoon above a dummy's house cop bah bah bah and back in those days there used there used to be payphones in the bathroom right and I would go and call my mother and I'd be like I'm at a table and I don't know what to do and then she'd be like you know it's like calling hija to figure out what to do a dynasty she didn't know what the hell to say like she would wing it but you know I would watch to see what other people were doing and you know it's hard yeah you know but then and I was really embarrassed to say where I came from yeah you know what my education level was you know that you know a lot of these people I'd like to use and they went to boarding schools like around the world you know and I would just always hope that it was the one time in my life where I didn't talk as much like hoped it would just pass by me you know yeah but then when I got into my 30s I just learned that that was what made me special and I should celebrate it but that pathway of getting to own that and be okay with it but the one thing that I did have was I had good basic manners so right I knew not to open up any plague these were the skills that I came with like never go into anybody's refrigerator always say please thank you yes send to think you know if you have good manners and you know how to read you can go anywhere in the world so that those are like my potatoes yes and from those like potatoes I could make a gourmet meal by building on that basic skill set like that's all I had yeah you know it's funny I I have a very very similar kind of trajectory in a lot of ways we were very poor when I was little and by the time I was more adolescent we were more middle-class but also in an area where a lot of people had a lot more money than us so you actually felt poorer even though you technically had more money and it's funny because I always kind of now will go out of my way to categorize that as average because we try to remind ourselves like the average income in America is super low like our experiences growing up are much closer to the vast majority of people listening this than New York but I had a very similar trajectory where for the first couple years especially in New York I felt constantly like everyone could tell I was poor I don't have a college education I felt like you know very similarly like they're gonna find out you know but very similarly felt like that manners thing that you know ability to communicate effectively was like the one card to play but me I I found that I was not able to overcome that feeling until I had reached financial stability and I'm curious what your advice might be for someone who maybe isn't yet at that place of more financial stability but wants to get over that feeling of maybe being a fraud or being out of place or being ashamed well I think part of it is like a lack of consciousness about currency mm-hm you know we talk about currency as money only but there's a lot of other forms of currency yeah and you know love and truth are like really major forms of currency so you know I've worked with plenty of families from the Gettys to the Rockefellers like a ton of families and sometimes that type of wealth can be a curse you know I have friends whose kids wake up in the morning and they go to school in a bulletproof car in Guatemala and they have five armed bodyguards around them all the time that's not fun when you're little I was like getting pizza pole or parlor you know and hanging out at skinny outlets lake and going for a swim off the diving board no I don't know because I'm not that person but I think I probably had a better childhood so the first thing is this kind of concept about shame from what we don't have right you know what I mean and I know this is a show about building wealth but there's a lot of different kinds of wealth I I would specify one one thing that building wealth I think we do talk about it I wouldn't say it's our goal but I think building wealth is obviously for some people a goal and it's something that's important and there are strategies to get there but I think for us the bigger issue is getting to a place where you can transcend money where it's not in control of you or it doesn't absolutely define you and it doesn't haunt you and cause you shame where you really feel as though you know you're the same person no matter what is you know in your bank statement and for me personally a big strategy for that has been living way below my means because that gives me a sense of control and freedom what are you know really actionable ways aside from the shrine and that kind of thing that the altar that you feel like you can transfer in your day to day life well I don't really think that I'm a good person to be in charge of myself on those things it's something I really don't because I wasn't brought up with any type of wealth and my mind doesn't really work like that and and I think that being able to take an accurate inventory on your strengths and weaknesses are really important so for me you know I have people around me now that are really major and they keep me like on track in order to have let's say the type of financial security which is what I think you're talking about yeah versus like wealth you know like so like my need for financial security my burn rate is sick right I can imagine I mean it's just a sick burn rate I mean just I have two dogs like just boarding my dogs for today is two hundred and forty dollars that is a lot of money I mean I feel like I should leave them in a holiday and and hope for the best and just pick them up in exactly it'd be a lot cheaper it'd be like ibc that would be thrifty yeah but instead I think it's probably not polite to leave your dogs by themselves without a walk and out and yeah but two hundred forty dollars is a lot of money when you live in New Yorker in the Hudson Valley to board your dogs for two a day but you feel it so you feel like I'm just going to accept that that's the person I am that's when I spend money well what am I supposed to do I'm a single mom you know my daughter's not gonna go out at 11 o'clock at night and walk the dogs by herself you know and she's that's a lot to put on a 17 year old as far as like a responsibility you know if I have to like this weekend or even just last week my dogs were boarded for four days because if I'm doing shoots and stuff oh and I have a dog walker and by the way I also have to pay the dog walker exactly who's not walking my dogs look at that you see just a day for the dogs that's like 120 to 160 bucks just for the dogs in a but you so and sometimes I feel like just letting them off their leash and let you listen especially in April I'm like you want to go for a run they're Huskies they have to be off of all the places to skimp I would certainly not encourage to be on the dogs well-being no but that's still a lot of money like the Bernie know it is you like garbage pickup cell phone bills I mean I have a pure company you know how much money I spent on cellphone read lawyers HR labor attorneys I mean the the burn rates like crazy that give you anxiety no but it just makes me not want to work with anybody it makes me wanna peel you never so do you never have those moments of pressure of like are you kidding me I mean I think I have PTSD I think I mean a fight-or-flight response I mean people are always just like why doesn't she brush your hair it's like I don't have  hair okay I don't yes I I mean I don't know about anxiety because I'm I do probably three to four hours of spiritual practice a day I'm a big like yogi got it you know in the sense that I I've done a lot of you know I would be dead or in jail or in a mental hospital if I didn't do the spiritual practice that I do with the stress of my life because not only do I have the stress in my own business I have the stress of all of my clients business right and I work in the number one highest risk investment business in the world I work in the fashion business you know you find somebody wants to invest in that business they're looking for a tax deduction or they're totally crazy or they want to you know live the glamorous life thing about media yeah it's the same thing and one of the in our description or the show notes I actually have a question for you um I've been a huge fan of you for a really long time because you were one of the first people I saw on reality TV that like cut the and sort of just like said what things were and especially coming from the background I come from which I'm like from Long Island where that tends to be the vibe but also like I was adjacent to the city where there was a lot of people doing and a lot of people that I felt like we're talking around things rather than like saying what they were and I couldn't understand why people were doing that and I wonder if you think your background has made you uniquely positioned to succeed in an industry filled with bullshitters so the people who are trying to trip yeah yeah I've worked against me really telling the truth yes successful on so many traditional metrics I'm not I'm not successful like that it's not true I look successful because I made my truth but if you lined up my truth with other people's perceived success I have freedom which is different I'm a free being I don't get caught up and I'll give you an example okay I'm currently working with a client okay they pay me $15,000 a month which is not a lot all right I know it might sound like a lot but it's not because there's no way that people can pay me for the experience that I have because I've invested 25 years of victories and mistakes and my own money and my clients money and also being honest and really having my word means something right so that people to trust you well sometimes they do and they don't I'll give you an example so I'm working with a brand right now and they came to me for representation they wanted PR I said well your brand looks like okay and nobody's gonna want to write about it because the imaging is all wrong and they're like we want to do a story about a day in the life of a blogger and like nobody cares like this is completely wrong and so I was like you know fire the photographer who cares about these bloggers Blonde salad whatever nobody cares okay they're like a joke it's all an illusion and you were always right no no no no no we're gonna get Chloe Sevigny steve aoki skateboarders in that and i like went through the whole thing so i creative directed and ree change the brand okay now of course we know there's not a lot of PR going on while I'm doing that because I'm only getting paid $15,000 a month and that's based on retainer time right also they don't have any stores in the United States so the way they came to town from another country the other day and I said to Simone in my office it's like this is sketchy to me why are they here two days really I they're interviewing people behind our back I just that they are so this is about money and this is about truth and this is about telling the truth so I was like you better send them a text message right now and tell them that I run a major part of this town and if I find out that they're doing this behind my back it's gonna be straight to Cal okay like it's not gonna be good okay and we were supposed to go to dinner with them and now granted this is the end of the year nobody wants to lose business in fashion at the end of the year because this is the time that we all get fired okay people drag you into December like the back can on the back of a car getting their billing up up up up up not paying on time so this is like you know we got real like guns out okay well everybody else is like having cocktails the PR and fashion worlds were like we have guns and switch bites okay we're like trying to get our money and we're also trying to slow down this very fast-moving train so we can at least just take five to seven days where we're not working okay so they come to my office okay and I say to them you know are you interviewing other other companies they say no we're actually looking to hire an independent publicist in LA I said please don't lie to me like I've been doing this for so long so finally I said I want you to look me in the eye and tell me the truth right so they look me in the eye and they tell me that you they're like whoa we kind of are but we love you and we want to work with eisah listen I'm not gonna renew my contract with you I don't want to work with you you don't deserve to be in my presence but and I said it's really interesting that people on the team are against me when I'm the only one who's getting results ya see what I mean so if you have a group of people that want to be mediocre okay which is corporate America let's just face it the people who are successful for the most part in corporate America are not ballbusting entrepreneurs they're the last people that anybody in a corporation wants around including the founder because they don't like it they just want an agreement so no it's not good for business I'll be honest but what it's good for is freedom and I would rather I would rather have both okay but freedom when freedom is something that's so important you know and like what you're saying like you like money because he gives you a freedom to know that if you do want to get on a plane to go to Salem Massachusetts or the Maldives that you can do that or maybe you can't sometimes or if you want to be able to go out to dinner or if you lose a job that you have six months or a year as some sort of a protection I've been running a much different type of lifestyle game I'm a single mom you know I have a huge overhead my lifestyle is very very fast and when you run fast you burn money yeah absolutely one thing that really sticks out to me and you're in your book and just your general vibe is it's not it or something no I mean I've heard to like happy happy can this is my idea of cheerful you talk a lot in the book and I about essentially having an extraordinary sense of clarity about what was your inner voice what was right for you it was not right for you leaving situations making decisions that I think a lot of people would have a very very difficult time with correct how do you differentiate between what is like this is my inner clarity this is what I should do versus the noise the anxiety the you know chatter in your own brain I wrote a chapter my first book called warrior to warrior hmm and so at the beginning I'd say probably the first 15 years of my life I was in probably a panic state because I was getting hit all the time it's just being like smashed by waves into the side of Iraq so when I started People's Revolution I really wanted to recreate a family system which is totally about idea if you're starting a business I unless you come from a really sick twisted dysfunctional family then you'll feel right at home because you know the workplace is not the place to our family right it's just I don't care yes sure there's an exception to the rule where like Betsey Johnson she had the same two women working with her their whole life sure but for every one of those there's ninety eight ninety four percent of the people that you meet in life or at work are gonna disappoint you mmm that's just the way that it goes and I'd say out of the 94 percent sixty-two are probably gonna be by letter dangerous to you and that's just the way that it is whether they're guys who cheat on you employees who steal money from you take your you know all of these things I've had to learn like one lesson at a time and they were brutal too I mean I know people think I'm really tough I he's just like when I started in the business I was a really skinny cute blonde I think you know this is how I ended up but the truth of the matter is is that it's brutal yeah you know when you're running a business especially like the business that I run so you know each one of those lessons were super hard like at the beginning in People's Revolution there was no time to come to work it was a company I don't know how long is it gonna take you to do the job it takes you three hours it might take me eight hours just get the job done that's what I'm paying you to do if you're done by 2:00 I don't need you sitting in my office too late yeah but human beings are incapable of that what would you say is one of the worst career tips that people give women to make nice mmm you know I'll tell you the one thing I noticed about women you want to hear this this is young women especially like 94 degrees in New York City you're in a nice beautiful hotel you tell your team to come and meet you there might be two guys in my case there's usually and I I don't discriminate it against men but at this time there were two guys on my team and probably six women and we met at the Soho grand and it's really hot now and so you know the waiter comes up to the table and says hi good afternoon can I offer you something to drink the guys oh I'll have an iced tea there guys I'll have a coke and the women said no that's okay I'm fine and I was like wow why do they think they shouldn't order a drink and it was like even in not being able not even being able to say like yes I would like and I was like why are you saying that you don't want a drink and they're like I don't know they aren't you HOT yeah I'm always last time you were saying you drink a while ago so you actually like something to drink yeah is that the same for you yeah is that the same for you yeah is that they say for you yeah it's the same chick who will be starving and give her boyfriend he'll be like or you don't and he'll she'll go okay you know so women are taught not to ask for what they want that's true and I feel like they're also very very quick to apologize for things that they did not for sure my daughter does it show the I'm sorry mommy I'm like sorry for what like sorry could I have a glass of water why are you sorry for having a glass of water and it's funny too because I think a lot of people don't realize how normalized those don't those dynamics are until you are confronted with them in a situation that's so black-and-white because otherwise like we our whole team as women Ryan is a man but generally speaking I interact with all women all day our audiences basically all women so I don't those dynamics never appear to me in the day-to-day but then when you go to a situation where you'll have you know ten people at a table Half Men half women and the women are the ones who get up to make sure that the coffee is like porno how about this this is my favorite work thing still to this day this happens to me I'll be the most successful person on the phone call with four men mmm and we'll be on a conference call and then somebody will say should we get jack on the call and they'll be like okay oh they'll be like Kelly can you get Jack on the call and I go why are you asking me to do it and it'll be like well I don't know how to do it and I was like okay you have an iPhone yeah great well there's a little button with a plus sign it says add call can you see it on your phone okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna hit a call and then you're gonna dial the number and guess what when the number starts to ring it says merge the button actually changes to m ER GE and then you put your finger in Jack's pinky whatever freaking finger you want and you touch it and guess what Jack's gonna be on the call sweetie so go ahead and dial it yourself I this drives me crazy and drives me crazy flying first-class let's talk about that flying first-class next two men oh okay the arm rest now I know this is really sweet Larry David up his service class but okay told me a business class yeah no they do it especially white males more than any other group I actually can say I've done a survey because I watch it yeah they go like this they go like that and I'll be like hey do you want keeping like you're lying also I don't like to share breath with them so if there's like a button where you can like put the thing up give me these first class Chris Klein - I wanna hear about how the arm the arm wrist is really bad sometimes they look at you to see how half of your bag is cuz you're like so stupid that you ever packed and you can't lift your own thing yeah that one of like oh let's do she's gonna be able to get that big-ass Louie - okay we'll watch this boom it's down you know or how about this one excuse me excuse me I can see that you know these are so much worse in coach I tried to order before you yeah you know cuz there the guy is just like it's really I mean sexism is alive and well it really is I will say though I have very alpha energy at restaurants for ordering for the table like they always try to go to the man and be like what does everyone wanna know I know I will tell it on dates it's embarrassing we can really hello because okay so this is another thing that I have like if you are a chicken you are like in the game it's hard for a guy how interesting well I've kind of found the opposite but oh no it's really hard for the guy so like if I'm coming to my weekend house and I bring a guy and you walked in my parking garage and the the parking guys call you boss mmm they go hey boss and I go what's up guys and then like the guy that's like rollin with you it's like this or you know you go out to dinner and they go oh good evening miss Cutrone would you like to have a bottle of the prisoner or something like this and then they bring the wine - you taste you know after a while there's like very strong no-fly-zone messages like you're a single mom there's no picture so they're like any of your ex-husbands you have more than one of those you also have a baby daddy I'm the parking garage guys call you boss um you know they come to you at the table for everything how about the fact that they also bring you the check so they that's all so can I drop the check but you're on a date with a guy well I mean guys just like one for a decade but you guys do not like it okay here's the part we have to step back a little bit I think oh you have to decide what it is that you want your life to look like like I think I took my life a little too far and I got this I'm good because I watch my mom who had no money have to deal with my father all the time where there is a huge percentage of women I don't have the exact number but I see and talk to a lot of women who are really unhappy in their lives and they and I watch my mom do it you know I watch my dad do like really kind of like complain about the food and yell at her about dinner and I was just like this is never happening to me and by the way we had one bathroom and like three bedrooms and I think our house was 800 so he was like the king of like a Lego okay eighty-five done yeah and her whole life was about building that up instead of just being like yo take it down four steps and like Jack it up sweetie if you want to like be that dude oh no is that yes Lee no Lee okay and I was just like that is never gonna happen to me now I think I took a too extreme hmm you know so if you're looking you know you have to decide what it is that you want like if you're looking for a really happy family life or entrepreneurialism in the fashion business not the way to go do you do you feel rich is that something that you feel I mean I felt every I've had every feeling about money and now no I don't feel rich nothing I'm not rich because that my daughter's private school seventy-two thousand how can you be rich you have oh my god and all these things yes you slapped in the face by yeah we don't have kids you have children no okay well don't I mean or move move it's not gonna be okay no I mean the word self-care and kids don't even go together auntie anybody so I forget that I mean no this is at a time that I'm rich I mean I been rich I mean I'm not rich you know no I don't think I'm rich some people might think I'm rich but I but I think I'm rich in the sense that I have freedom right there's nothing that can happen to me with the exception of something happening to my daughter okay and even me like if somebody shot me or nothing can touch my soul and my my be nobody can take that away from me so you know like I kind of tear up when I talk about it because it's there's so much power in that you know so I've looked every fear that I've ever had like straight into the eye down the barrel of a gun it's just been an owning a company like over the years oh my god I mean I've been threatened by them off yeah we hired oh my god oh yeah we hired some set builders for Jeremy Scott fashion show and I'll do it and I didn't know that they were connected and there was we didn't have a force majeure in the contract there was a force majeure for the sponsors in the contract and there was a hurricane in Florida which had the sponsors pull out and we were left with a fifty thousand dollar bill and these guys came to my office it wasn't a People's Revolution debt was a Jeremy Scott debt but I was the producer right and so they were at my door and they were like if we don't have this money by tomorrow we're gonna burn this building down and you're gonna be in it and I was like okay it's time to dial for dollars which is something that we made up at People's Revolution it's called sponsorship money and I called Davis factor who owned Smashbox cosmetics at the time and I was like dude my ass is like in his sling like these guys are gonna come for me like they're outside my door like they're in cars like they were watching us come and go it was like not a joke it was like real Sopranos stuff except they were Irish not Italian and I was like really I was pretty scared because I didn't have the extra money to just forward the money and get it like we knew that we were gonna be either going to the Mafia for more money to borrow it you know what I mean I was or we didn't know what to do so I called Davis and I told him what was going on and he was like all through it I'll sponsor it smashbox will sponsor the show he put up the money and i said if you do this I'll never forget what you did for me this is a true story he did it and then that season I brought Jeremy Scott Patricia fields Alvin Valley I think as for Heather at all out to LA and it was right at the time that IMG was trying to go up against Smashbox for their fashion week and those shows that I gave to Davis as a thank you caused IMG to buckle and come over and make a deal with Smashbox so they would partner on their Fashion Week's which ultimately led significantly to the acquisition of Smashbox by Estee Lauder how's that for a deal I am blown away I have to see I told you this is going to be different than the other people I'm like it's funny we often talk about like do you think it's an issue of scale though or the industry because I feel we often say to people like I own most of the business and my like biggest issues with the business or like we're only seven employees but so the biggest issue that's a lot but employees is a lot you know what you're in the same position you are but like are we it's inconceivable to have a thing like that happen our problems are so miniscule in comparison to don't say that don't tempt fate oh that's true listen we just you just don't know what's around the corner you know what I mean like but do you think it's more the industry or the scale of the business no because I don't think my business was any bigger than yours at the time really I mean I don't know I don't know what your numbers are but you know People's Revolution is not a ten million dollar a year company it never has been yeah I mean People's Revolution has always been this I mean it could have been like there's so many times we're like we opened an office in Chicago in London and Dubai but I don't like that like I'm like the musician who wants to be on stage yeah I don't want to be at the record label it's like for every hour or two that you get on stage you have 20 hours of I don't like management I don't care I don't want to hear that your mom doesn't feel good and your dog needs I don't give a I didn't sign up for this I don't care it's funny I extremely give a about it well you won't after a while and you'll just be like okay great but are you giving me part of your paycheck back because what starts to happen you know is they wanted sixty percent of the work for a hundred percent of the salary you're a finance person so my business I've had all different shapes in my business I've had thirty employees I've had two employees I've had eight employees in this day and age I think it is absolutely not okay for an entrepreneur to run a business with more than eight employees I don't think they should be allowed to I think that it should be against the law like you should have to have a driver's license to do it because entrepreneurs that are running businesses by themselves that are really busy you can't watch the backend of your business and my biggest mistakes have been about not paying attention to my back-end like you're just it's such a litigious environment it is that if you don't have a real back-end and the and the problem with it is the people who appear to be really together are the biggest criminals in the world so all of a sudden you're on like third Avenue in 63rd Street and some swankiest accounting you know place an oh well really great ok you know you have to pay 300 thousand dollars this year in tax and they're like robbing you but like left and right well that's why everyone has to keep a close eye on their own books the books are the most important thing oh by far ok and if you don't if you don't watch your own books you're oh yeah ok that's like really my message like watch your books and get some lawyers because that's the only way to do business you have to just in my opinion if you have a business and you're in a business and you're an employee here's another thing for employees here's a little tip when people hire you they want you to stay go figure mmm so most employees sit at their desk all day wondering if they're getting it fired what a waste of time what a waste of your time as an employer and what a waste of their time is an employee because when somebody hires you right they have to also pay an extra 33 percent of your salary yeah right people let's make a hundred thousand it's costing the employer 133 times absolutely also to that point like obviously in things like mass layoffs there's not a whole lot of you know Germans trying behind it but if you're actually being fired for cause like that is a work up process on the part of the employer like you don't just walk it maybe some people do but generally speaking for both liability reasons and also because your point like it is extremely difficult to replace someone even in really good circumstances people don't want to fire you generally first know they don't want to one if you want to have your own business I really think it's an amazing experience and opportunity and you should do it I don't think that you need to figure out if it's a good idea or not like if I knew what I was doing when I started my business I probably wouldn't have yeah to be honest so if it's something that's like really playing of you that you want to try as long as you don't have to like sign a five-year lease on Broadway and personally guarantee it you know maybe start it small and grow it and see how it does that's one - did you not do anything without a labor attorney do not open it and then make sure that you incorporate an estate that makes sense I'm just saying that make sure that you have a really good text attorney and make sure you have a really good labor attorney and a great accountant and a good bookkeeper and that you understand how to stay on top of quarterly taxes because I can't tell you how many people I know that are entrepreneurs that have had businesses that have eaten it just over those things you know and that you have a good employee handbook and that you sit down and that you go through formal reviews were the people who work for you and that you're very very buttoned up and at the beginning when I started my business you know people knew I was like this wild like the andre agassi like black blackness girl you know and I was advised several times like whoa you're moving too fast hey you better but you got to get buttoned up nice big buttoned up this is the Wild West yeah and you know what it is not a joke man you know I don't think Lauren Hill ever thought she was gonna be doing time jail you know for tax evasion you have to do it right you know and you have to do it from the beginning you know it's like if you're gonna go to the Hamal use you can't just show up with a sleeping bag on your back like you need to understand oxygen you need to understand the weather most people go with a Sherpa it's the same thing with business to not go out this alone yeah and the problem is is that no teaches anybody this forget about women but nobody like my daughters like learning calculus nobody's teaching her how to meditate nobody's teaching her yoga nobody's teach her what Accounts Payable for the first five years of my business I would sit in a business meeting with my business managers and I would be like what is this APA our thing with 30-60-90 and they'd be like really Accounts Payable are the money that you owe that's the AP accounts receivable for the people that owe you money and the 30-60-90 is how long this games been in play yeah you know but what do I know so these are the things that if you are a creative person and you want to make a difference in the world and you're a renegade really like I would pray like maybe I'll just start praying for all entrepreneurs to be able to take a breath really put together the right team in the right structure and start out on the right foot let's go with you can do either fashion or PR for this question whichever is more interesting but sure what is the big financial secret of your industry everyone's broke that is everyone's answer it seems like everyone's broken every and it's crazy um what do you invest in versus what are you cheap about I think I'm cheap about cars okay I Drive like a 2008 Ford Explorer and a 2006 Range Rover so pretty nice cars people offer me like five or ten thousand for the range and it's only guy has a blue book value of like 3500 even I'm getting it fixed always cost like three times the value of the car itself and what are you invest in your daughter's education notably it might definitely invest in Ava but I think art you know I you know I usually I know a lot of artists and I do a lot of stuff for trade and I have yeah art what has been your single best investment and my daughter Ava's been my best investment she's about to go off to college next year I heard jeez she might not want to go isn't that funny five hundred thousand dollars later oh my god what has been your biggest money mistake and why it was probably not having the right back up in place and being a better listener I mean I think you need a killer team around you yeah you know and I think not being a better listener when people were warning me like you need to slow down you need to look at this and I'd be like it's good everything's good I got this that's not a good attitude for a business owner what is your biggest current money insecurity that I won't have enough money when I get older I mean ballade basically no one has enough money for retirement it's actually very very scary let's not talk about it I loved illusion and the illusion there my friends like the plan is dying very early okay mmm what has been the financial habit that has helped you the most my intuition knowing when to jump and when to pull back I think has been you know the best thing with money with everything about my business when did you first feel successful quote-unquote and what does that word mean to you specifically well the first time I felt successful was when I was Susan blunts assistant and I saved up enough money to buy my first Chanel jacket I don't know uh Nell but she wore Chanel and like she was my queen you know so like when I got like my first Chanel jacket and let me tell you something that was a good investment and I'll tell you why one it got me more jobs so when I started my own company when I betrayed Susan and stole her client oh I still about I call her every year and we're dear friends but you know I was her assistant and I got offered a job by one of her clients and that was a really good learning experience I went to her and I said listen I've been offered this job and and she goes oh I'm really sorry to hear that and I go don't you want to hear how much money I'm making she is no I'll just she never even looked up it was like so Devil Wears Prada oh god it was really scary she goes oh no no no no this happens a lot you know so you know I have a rule like you cheated on me you already a tennis instructor so now what you want me to beg you to stay no I don't do that you can go but when you leave know who you are that's what she said to me oh my god yeah I could never even withstand the intensity of such a comment well it was a good lesson yeah no it sounded it's something that I I stole from her so what is the word successful specifically for me my idea of success is that is is that word freedom is that I'm a free soul like I I know myself you know like owning my own business has been like the greatest yogic experience like they say in India there are 3 times 3 ways to serve the divine one is with your heart it's called bhakti-yoga one is with your mind it's called pundits and and then the third is called Karma Yoga through what we do and serving the divine through our actions so owning a business is a really incredible spiritual practice because you get to confront all of your fears you know and really freedom is a lack of fear right so I can't tell you how many times I thought I was gonna die or be killed like literally as I shared earlier or that I was gonna lose everything or that I wasn't gonna be able to make it through another month of my business or that you know my husband was leaving me I mean all of these things that have come standing next to people like Gisele Bundchen like you know you stand next to supermodels after a while you kind have to figure out what you like about yourself because you're not looking like that you know you have to find so it's been an incredible opportunity for me to really sculpt and whittle my soul from the back seat up into the front seat to be fully present and to be conscious and to radiate you know as much truth as I can I mean I might be 70 looking at this interview and going oh my god I was such a punk I thought I was like so full like but I am proud I don't know we're kind of in for Zico but I'm super satiated with the experience that I've had you know and and and what I believe in and what I stand for today and then I also feel that I can speak my truth and I don't give a if anybody likes me or not and when I got into this I got into PR because I like people and I love to talk now I hate everyone and have nothing to say but that's not true but um you know I like the fact that it doesn't matter like I used to be really cautious like are these people gonna like me am I pretty enough or cool enough I don't care about any of that anymore mmm you know and my business has been you know my business has never cheated on me you know my business has always been there it's been like a constant thing in my life and it's always made me a better person you know it's a hundred percent the best education I've ever had in my life which is why I don't really care I mean I know it sounds horrible like I would prefer that my daughter goes to college but if she doesn't go to college I don't I don't really think it's a death sentence to mediocrity how do you I mean I need people who go to college that are so stupid I mean listen I can't say I disagree with that how do you let go of what you really want her to do my daughter well again because I'm already a conscious person I realized that she has no relationship to me really I mean she has her own soul like we're both children of other children of the mother or whatever and like I'm just further down the plank so I kind of you know watch her for God you know until she can watch herself but you know it she it doesn't that's how you feel like oh my god your daughter looks just like you I'm like that's the worst thing to say to a kid you know or are you gonna be like your mom like I hope not like I hope you're like yourself you know so I mean she's made choices that I don't agree with you know that I like from people that she's dated to other things that she's done that I don't really agree with but at the same time it's her life yeah you know I mean my goal is to not want for her to be a good listener to her and help her kind of weed through herself to find her own self-confidence you know about what it is that she wants to do and where she wants to go like my opinion is meaningless so obviously we have talked our description or our show notes well thank you so much for joining us for this boom elastic experience yesterday you did not you promised the most interesting interview and you really did not disappoint really well I think it's good to tell the truth because I think that people feel bad when they see all these people and they assume that things are a certain way you know and and then you're sitting there and like you're going but why is like collections like so amazing and like she's so cool like no my lease you know yes I've been blessed but let me tell you something I  paid for it you know I've like the working hands to prove it you know I've gotten a lot but I've received a lot but I've lost a lot and I've given up a lot and it's so it's just like if you're doing this don't think because the Kardashians have a 20-foot Christmas tree you know and Kylie Jenner has a billion dollars that this is the way the world works most people don't make money till they're older a historically that's true and B things aren't always the way that they seem especially in worlds like fashion and entertainment so don't feel like if you're I don't know developing laser or eyeglasses or whatever that you're not in a sexy you know profession creativity exists everywhere you know it exists in banking and exist in the art world it exists everywhere and also do not think that if you see anybody who's successful that you know I always say that when you see a band at Madison Square Garden they're the band who played the bar when five people showed up and they didn't quit yeah you know what I mean you don't get you don't just go right to Madison Square Garden you have to play those like shitty ass clubs in order to get to Madison Square Garden and that's what people need to know like you have to like build your steps and every once in a while there's a noose or a gun or a mudslide that's gonna pull you backward and if you want to move forward you just have to kind of get up and like and then learn from your stupidity absolutely I mean I have made a lot of stupid decisions people think I'm really smart I'm not I just I keep going you know and you guys have to keep going - bye guys see you later
