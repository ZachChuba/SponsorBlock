damn right you are Eponine over here mm oh I just saw New Zealand which is that's awesome sorry I they're still playing and I love that I love that um well for those are just tuning in we are about to watch probably the first three episodes likely for most likely I like first three that's like gives me enough closure yeah the first three episodes of the anime Hunter x Hunter and now if you don't do the following it's going to be very boring and you're just gonna watch two guys some people are into that and that's fine that's fine but if you don't do what I'm about to do just to you you're just gonna watch two guys on a couch talk at the camera about something that you can't see so they should play a game where they guess what two anime we're watching what you and that's an entire you know so we can't say there's a market for that but if you want to do it the regular traditional way which I highly recommend cuz there's a lot more fun where you actually watch with us the best way to do that is to sign up for your free 14-day trial of crunchyroll premium that means you get to watch with us with no ads which is really the only way to frickin watch anime you know what I mean otherwise

crunchyroll.com slash jack or crunchyroll.com slash comics take your pick either way either way you get 14 days of unlimited anime seriously crunch rolls got every limited everything I heard people talking about Dragon Ball super the other day saying it was a very emotional saying that it's so far ahead now I feel like I'm getting left behind because I haven't started I know but I'll bet with 14 days you could binge watch and keep up and catch up which I'm just saying it's it's been done it's not impossible so with that said make sure you're all signed up and caught up because we're about to get started with the first three episodes of hunter x hunter equals I don't know countdown clock is is we're all right here oh we got a countdown clock but this is I'm holding this is very very important we're going to this is to make sure you're synced so if for any damn reason you get lost you know for someone's speakable reason you go ahead or you get lagged behind we got this handy-dandy clock that will ensure you guys where we are watching it I can't see it but you can I hope rightfully its CGI you know we have a we always have the beat of our shops and New Zealand working on it you know you know LucasArts it's real fancy stuff we spent a billion on it shall we uh shall we continue hunting right yes I'm ready oh I'm absolutely ready you guys settled ready to go cue it up alright who you want you wanna count still I would love to have the power here count down from 3 3 2 1 Hunter x Hunter oh we got to analyze the intro utilize the inserts the best part lamb leg day oh he's got spiky green hair that's weird that's very unlike anime protagonist and then nice beautiful sky shot title but what I hope you learned a lot do you think it runs a lot yeah yeah finish your drink run loops man they save time dudes don't run like that take it from an animator also his glasses are very impractical they're like half the size of his eyeballs you notice that it doesn't need to see no upwards just down here alright so catchy runs with his hands in his pockets I can't be comfortable heroes of all shapes and sizes alright so there definitely is action in this okay you think we should guess like what the plot is that just by this the plot is really cool fly-fishermen what are they hunting it's based on the river runs through it aren't true but in anime form okay so we got our main antagonist here obviously right right all he's gonna get him he's gonna get it I'm gonna stop right then and there for the time you'll never know you got reezy Road oh here's some monsters we got some mythology some lore being established starting with a beginning of time mm-hmm it's not the Joe Joe mask that looks like a gentleman well crossover night right interesting so there's magic in this in this universe they are known as hunters oh close it shut it down I was gonna say drag mark your X Y and X friends departure X and that to write them I don't think that sounds like a bad myspace in this world they don't have spaces everything is everything's an axis that's their space so between everywhere like and like the counting like X ok so there is fishing I wasn't that far off when I said it's fly-fishing the show the Lord if you like do you think that's they're like Loch Ness monster maybe yeah totally we can't possibly you can catch it with New York Tom that's very heart of the cards hmm of course beautiful we guys think that says mom or something I mean it's gotta be I mean judging from the age so this is gone guy he's hearing you ever gone fishing yeah in a lake yeah I tried once very poor oh he got some but Willy you catch what he's catching oh his green hair got revealed that means he's the good guy he's oboy okay I didn't try this when I went fishing it's got a genius right around a tree who knows yeah cuz that way you get the hold you got though that leopard leverage there it is pull he's gonna snap you broad yeah why didn't I think of that nice it's anime fishing they made fishing look cool somehow not easy it's cool you offended two people in the chatter yeah all to viewers that yeah a very specific niche them did he catch it the what was it easy the fish is huge yeah like what they said it's so more the lake that's it the lure of the lake it's been 20 years I think I'll eat this discussing it's like that scorpion fish yeah it's got way too many legs for fish people are too calm I know they're all I've seen this he caught it when people would be like that's an abomination Oh Shane happy he didn't say mom so I guess that's not its mom yeah you're right that's some kind of authority figure teacher mentor tutor Oh lovely I'm gonna stick with mom okay so he needed to catch that fish you need to catch the fish and she ain't happy she ain't having it huh not my boy no now I'm not hunter exam gone and his dad ging and his mom gang okay so it's like some family tradition of catching this fish at 12 years old did I can even tie my shoes at 12 Wow okay so something happened to the dad I think there's some tragic hmm you know we got our first question yeah okay there you go got it daddy issues he abandoned him oh that's how I look at it what so he's like he's totally cool about is that leaving yeah dad he's like a dream - yikes no man that is a supportive son yeah right chase your dreams dead it's somewhat refreshing he's gonna be a hunter x hunter no matter what I get it you really are Jing's son jin-sang that right is Jane's son yes no go out there and be the best hunter x hunter around all right what do you think the exams like do think it's like SATA other fish it's just fishing fish it sure like 12 seasons pinkie promise I like that pinky swears it's the transcend brush here yeah in this world and yeah in the world of crazy ash scorpion fish right right that somehow translated in okay there's a little more advanced than ours that was weird mmm that did not translate well my boy be safe my little hunter x hunter for those who are just tuning in I'm sorry we're getting some really good exposition though like yeah so it's just really set in the stage in a beautiful way and you said in sail dude he's the only one on the boat yeah that'd be great I'm the only one who caught the fish I guess right hit my mama so my boat now what do you think being a hunter entails like what do they hunt ah those mythical yeah well they show like monsters okay those that's what I'm yeah here comes the dream killer there's right always a skeptic oh boy the crew is like eight times lower than he is why here we go oh it's guarded vital secrets with glass oh your God another guy that was a guy I thought that was a lady huh I'm gonna stick with the guy for now okay it's a safe bet I mean it's animated serie oh you'll never be a hunter

the exam all right do you think they're actually gonna make it to the exam site this now this is a test it's always a test these guys are way more helpful I think the examiners earned the navigators are gonna lead them on don't fall for it I'm broke woman right John you're 12 you don't know you have no concept of money don't do it don't do it John you're too pure for this don't do it Wow he's gonna give you this money costs all of my money right he's gonna get corrupted he's not gonna pass it's gonna break my heart I'm gonna turn this off in that order all right okay the navigators like I believe that's not very reassuring I haven't done this in 12 years I'm sorry navigator I think this is a place I should but I don't know how maps would buy it's just a blank piece of paper I can't read this he's eternally hopeful just how dad felt when he left me I love you dad following his footsteps I too will abandon my kids right I really think he's too dumb to procreate but time will tell that's not a real language by the way it's um hangman the letter I and half a percent it's hangman the restaurant yeah you ever dined there I make great ramen they make they make great divide sign that's basically what that thing is dude language is just math it's it's confusing it's a test it's test test test yeah that's the password for three Oh how would you like medium rare right that's all cuz they're like Co Thompson got it then they all fall through a trapdoor to the death because that's what that means whoa see three things of I'm gonna assume three chairs for a three year this is um an Alice in Wonderland they're gonna drink it and get small or something he was actually hungry just like Goku Goku is always hungry he's gone kuna I hate to draw this parallel but he's Goku thanks navigator don't do it don't shake his hand no one's ever shake my rad I was gonna say no one's ever done this before huh and then I knew Wow next year what does that mean okay it's an elevator this is some Willy Wonka going on it appears the elevator hmm bastard you put me in an elevator Denis no I'm allergic my one weakness the elevator Oh mm oh I see to come back next year and retake it it's already so hard to go to the test right actually no way the test when does the test end this guy is just financially driven he's only in it for the money apparently he's a doctor he's expecting the dough he's a doctor who wants to be a hunter isn't there let the doctors help help people he hunts people injures them and then cures them but there's some is there yeah he is a con artist with way too small glasses that are just impractical to his face so like the size of his pupil there really are so they are monster hunter it's true huh you weren't wrong yeah they're like bounty hunters you know I mean this is like cowboy bebop ish too many parallels right what it it's the lazy susan okay I was gonna say I was wondering what yeah is the DJ's it wasn't very well yeah yes the twelve-year-old will understand fame and money yeah so he's he's becoming hunter for like Pride and or whatever his name is John actually it's not gone I just turn off your oh thanks I just want to I just want a hunt stuff guys I just want to find my dad who abandoned me and high-five him for being so cool it's not a fish it's right yeah you wouldn't ya see the fishing poles a sign of simplicity

guys a rifle he's doing it right clear like a bow okay we got flubber over here right you should get that checked out dude error 404 you face they just I just stick sound like that yeah he's on the high ground he must be important right yeah I could tell because you just got given stickers let's do a hideous oh my god you should just you take the exam like once a year so he's at least 30 days I mean he's at least like 40 right dude also not body shaming he does not look physically fit to be a monster hunter I'm just saying he used to be 35 years ago right thank you nope I'm the only one he's rubbing it in there yeah yeah it doesn't know yeah it shows like a bag of bones like a literal skeleton well that guy Oh sumo hell yeah that guy means business he's meditating he looks like he holds grudges yeah that's the look of the grudge holder right hell yeah oh she that guy that guy's seen some stuff he's getting old but still badass I don't like him I just don't like him they got no history it's like the triplets from Pacific Rim there were triplets in specific room it's been a while so this thing that I want to think so yeah you're gonna see uprising I think so yeah it's like it's like mega swords oh yeah yeah you can't say no to me oh he's here he too is a hunter huh main antagonist what the just poisoning what the pardon my language but we asked for death and we received a peculiar you turned into clovers hmm you turned into flowers my bad he has the voice of an antagonist absolutely wait he just bumped into him and then his arms that psychopath hey maybe don't let him in there like hey he's back that out again why again why is there a second and third time he killed six people last time right right hey maybe maybe just qualify him guys he killed an examiner hey maybe this kissy-kiss oh thank you okay I'm glad I'm in they're not the only voice of reason here so he's like pure evil and then let him come back cuz cuz he's good nice yeah he turned that dude into flowers are dangerous appeared how does how does everyone else like so calm about the psyche right has this guy took his arms yeah is he gonna give it back meanwhile nobody's like did you see that

back to maybe they just got to run like him that's how you conserve energy honestly I mean I was saying that I was honestly like is this yeah cuz he doesn't even break a sweat yeah also he's in the suit and try running like you try running for hours and this yeah not easy he knows something that we don't hmm he was right running on sand like H yeah that sucks oh that's it the only last I lost that little people hmm I really do that like I'd really do like that they show the guy like who couldn't make it alright that was solid okay that was solid I'm glad we stuck around for episode 4 that was that was a nice change of pace they ran for like three episodes they really did it really was a bit Dragon Ball II but in a good way in a good way it was it was truly an endurance it was truly thanks and endure and so if you are just tuning in you missed a hell of a party but we just finished the first four episodes the four of Hunter x Hunter an anime that you can watch on crunchyroll comm that was really really fun yes ending song ever it's a good ending song I will give you that and I like honestly like it's the hype it keeps a Hyneman I like most it's kind of a stereotype that these seconds that the ending song of anime shows it's kind of like usually like female vocals and piano like Inuyasha example or bedtime bedtime yeah it's like a sonata or like Stein it's like hmm yearning you know bittersweet feelings of yearning and this is just like math about that monsters yeah it's kind of a nice change of pace I dig it I dig it so yeah man's that was episode 4 of hunter V monster x hunter or slash ready slash draw bright 0 reserved and yeah dude I'm just reading your comments what else we got up in here it was a Dragonball Z move they pulled Oh good pun 5 out of 10 pawn hands things because puns shouldn't be rated anything above it 5 but that was a good pun entire series it was like 100 episodes is it oh is it one of those yeah I mean I got time not just yeah yeah I think we're we're in need of it we don't have lives let's let's do it anime over YouTube is really you know um let's see is this star the running mark I mean probably it kind of are yeah I think it goes for eight episodes that's fine my animators must love that's gotta be I was gonna say that's got to be fun how many angles do we have to animate right exactly that's gotta be pretty tedious well I will probably continue this now that I've started it yeah I want to know when they stopped me too I want to see where it goes I do like I've got one honest thing that I do like about the show is the actual like the riddles and the puzzles yeah you have the second-guess everything that you think is right right I like twists it's good it's a full of twists like they did a double bluff in the last five episodes of that episode we just watched that was really clever and I have a triple one next time I'm sure they'll bill up the ante like I love stuff like that you know like riddles like in The Hobbit with Gollum and all that all that all that dirty coming right uh but um no let's see I want to die yeah totally totally great comment please watch it again another time Scarlett we just might we just
