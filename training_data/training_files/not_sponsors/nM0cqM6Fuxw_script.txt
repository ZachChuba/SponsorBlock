hey guys welcome back it's my favorite time of the year and I'm so excited to finally share with you all my decorated Christmas tree I went with the snowflake theme this year because I love the snow and found a really pretty snowflake ribbon that inspired my theme I wanted my tree to be neutral glam with the colors this year so I used silver y in a touch of champagne decorating a tree can be time-consuming especially picking out the right pieces and stores so by the time I got home after shopping for the tree it was time for lunch I didn't want my family to be hungry so I went ahead and made a delicious quick and easy meal before we get started into decorating thank you hella fresh for sponsoring this video this is the first year we have an artificial tree and we absolutely love it the flock in this tree is so pretty and even though it does have a little bit of fallout it's worth it and I just vacuumed it up right away my husband went ahead and put the trip for me so I began fluffing each branch out [Music] [Music] the tree already comes with LED lights so this made it even easier to get straight to decorating to get started with decorating my tree I made sure each branch of the tree was nice and fluffed out this also helps to see if there are any gaps to be filled up using ornaments picks garland or ribbon for the bottom of the tree I wanted to make a mountain of snow effect as if the tree was sitting on snow so what I did was add some pillows under the tree and placed the faux fur throw on top and curved the throat to make a circle shape around the tree now it's time to add these ornaments I placed the larger ones first to fill in any gaps and have nice statement pieces I bought these from Hobby Lobby and HomeGoods [Music] [Music] next I added medium-sized ornaments and I went with these white sparkly pieces because I'm going for a snowflake theme on my tree the inspo behind the theme was from a beautiful snowflake ribbon you'll see later on in the video I scattered the white ornaments all around the tree and followed by adding these glittered silver ornaments I found from Dollar Tree I thought they were too pretty to pass up and for such a great price I added ornaments of all sizes so that when you look at the tree don't see just one shape but you see layers of all shapes and sizes this really helps to compliment each of the pieces these acrylic icicles are some of my favorites to have whether it's for a tree or garland they make such a beautiful glam addition and I scattered them throughout I've never seen snowflake rhinestone ornaments so I had definitely had some purchase fees there from Hobby Lobby I bought a couple of them and I just put them throughout the tree for that extra Sparkle here's where the inspiration came from I bought this Weiss snowflake ribbon from Costco I knew instantly that this was going to be my theme on my tree and in my house decor the silver glitters snowflake ribbon is from Dollar Tree and what I did to make an even wider ribbon is cut two pieces of this silver ribbon one white ribbon and placed it in the middle of the silver ribbon pieces then I folded the top of all three pieces twice and did the same for the bottom of the ribbon you can hot glue all the pieces together if you think that would be easier for you but this method worked out faster for me because I was on a mission to get this tree done in a day now all you do is stick the ribbon in the tree and add as much as you want you can make the ribbon longer and go straight down from top to bottom or have the pieces diagonal like I have them [Music] for the finishing touches on the tree I wanted to have something really glam and make a statement to complete the look I was going for so I made my own tree topper the pics are from Hobby Lobby this was super simple to do honestly I had no idea if this was going to look like what I had pictured in my head but I gave it a go and started placing the pics one by one at a time I made it form a rainbow and then when I added all of the long picks I added the smaller ones to make it look fuller that's it super simple and you can make this 100% your own using colors you're decorating with [Music] yeah how come is absolutely beautiful I hope you take something from today's video and incorporate it in your tree decorating I would love to see how you style your Christmas trees you can tag me on instagram at LG queen home decor this beautiful tree itself is from king of Christmas it's the eight-foot king flocked tree with warm white LED lights since I have this snowflake theme I didn't want to add too much on the tree but something that was just enough and beautiful you can fill up your tree as much as you want with your favorite ornaments picks and ribbon I personally love the look of a flocked tree so I didn't want to cover all of its beauty with decorations for the centerpiece on the coffee table I added white and mercury glass trees a deer and an arrangement in one of my favorite vases the flock Pixar from Dollar Tree then I added a small glitter pick in the center like the one on the Christmas tree then I added silver poinsettias
