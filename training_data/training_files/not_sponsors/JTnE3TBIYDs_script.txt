so you've got a fancy textured phone skin you've got the sickest decals on your elite controller you've wrapped or painted your car so it looks and definitely drives like Lambo but your once fresh and flashy PC looks like a generic pre-built with nothing but boring old LEDs well my vain friend do we ever have a solution to your supremely first world problem now hydro dipping is nothing new we're just pretty sure that nobody's ever done it to a $1200 RTX 2080 TI before speaking of things no out today at ifixit.com forward slash Linus [Music] for those of you who aren't familiar with hydro dipping it's the process of transferring paint to an object using water Hydra dipping can be achieved with almost any three-dimensional object whether it's your favorite boring coffee mug that needs revitalizing or a bland set of car alloys that need to look dope for the fast-food drive-through now I know what you guys are thinking Linus please paint and computer hardware that sounds like a recipe for definitely success what can go wrong yes but hold on guys unlike some of our previous arts and crafts projects involving paint this time we won't be relying on a perfect masking job or steady hands because hydro dipping allows an entire object to be coated simultaneously and hopefully evenly for a unique look so this right here is actually our first attempt at this a gtx 1060 from a soos that we used to make sure we were doing it right and to make sure that our orange black blue and white color scheme looked good for my part I think it looks awesome so then it's time for us to do this for real step 1 then I guess is clear some space on our trusty gamers Nexus mod mat and disassemble our r-tx 20 atti i've already pre loosened some of the screws for the back plate here and it was actually one of our new writers who's on trial who did this so I am surprised to discover that a lot of the other screws are pre loosened as well so there you go the card is basically disassembled Wow wasn't that fast gamers Nexus computer disassembly gear highly recommended you too can be this fast this card really looks like it's been taken apart before because like there's some clearly kind of improvised elements to this biz thermal pad on top of thermal pad but only here in here like here it's not like that it just looks like you're struggling to put for the Cheaney oh my god it's good yeah the genuine question that what is the difference between fettuccine and linguine I think the amount of thickness okay but you know what I don't know but that sounds credible enough that I believe you for our next trick we need to heat up this plate right here because Nvidia in their infinite wisdom has decided to go the Apple route of sealing up their products with glue rather than with screws why they would do this the problem with heating up something like this is that it's literally a heat think like it's designed to have a lot of thermal capacity so it takes a while neat oh cool for our next trick we'll be moving these four screws which will allow us to remove this PCB that's something we don't want a hydro dip because it will read it the next thing we're gonna do is remove these four screws followed by this one which will allow us to pop off what this shroud II do death and then pull this ribbon cable out of the part of the cooler that actually makes contact with the GPU itself so there you have it that's the actual cooling core of the r-tx 2080 Ti so there's your vapor chamber there's your fins cool we can put that aside we're done with that for now we don't want to paint that because that would actually hurt our thermal performance one thing we definitely need to do is pull these fans off here the last thing you want is paint in your cooling fins quite literally the last thing you want we seem to have had a bit of a roadblock here during the assembly process and video routes these cables through kind of small holes plug them into this PCB and then glues them in place why they would do this once again we don't know this sucks it's just so unnecessary all right and of course the PCB itself is glued in we ain't done yet folks so now that everything's completely disassembled we're just gonna give it a quick wipe down with isopropyl rubbing alcohol just to make sure that any surface contaminants have been removed this is painting basics 101 just making sure the surface is clean before you try and paint it finally we want to mask any parts of the card that we don't want to end up with paint on them such as the thermal pad contact points on the back of the backplate here and remove any decals that we intend to put back on when we're done so next is priming right now as with any good painting project and even shoddy ones like what we're doing the key is a good even coat of primer so see vanish remember kids lots of thin coats don't try and do it with one thick one like what I'm doing right now because my time is limited today [Music] alright guys so our primers dry and it's time for us to apply paint to the surface of the water now I've never done this before but I'm assured that it's very easy and only a complete idiot could it up so hopefully I managed to do it correctly how close do you get nervous I've never painted water before it fifteen ten years is that enough okay [Music] okay and then this white shirt dang it okay and then we're gonna do a practice one with like a stick okay and then this is my stick for shushing away all the other stuff shake it around shake it off shake it off you know get mighty Swift okay so definitely needs more white leave more white leave more white now you can see this stuff's dry so this is just a mess and then when you're when you're done with that attempt do you just kind of shoosh it over into the side and then you just go again so what do you think guys are we ready to do a piece of the graphics card here we go oh that was not oh that was not good okay so then I'm gonna kind of go okay and yeah I can see why people do this outside oh boy oh man oh this one's gonna be just all blue and my hands going in oh good okay well I did say that if I couldn't do it I'm an idiot okay I think if I just go a little lighter with this I can control the pattern that I'm getting a little bit better so I just want [Music] like a stronger industry okay that looks pretty cool that one's not bad okay this is fun I like arts and crafts hmm okay that one I'm a little iffy on okay ready here goes fight you covered your eyes there wouldn't blame you at this point oh I can't get it to go in at an angle oh it's going into my gloves oh no thanks Dennis you're truly wonderful human being what's so bad okay so we left it overnight and actually I gotta say I'm I'm kind of coming around to how it looks I think this is gonna be pretty sick so the next stage before we can reassemble it is to give it a couple shots of clearcoat and then we can put it back together and hope that a it looks good and be that card that was not reassembled properly last time even still works at all so here we are guys the card is reassembled almost there we go and I think it looks pretty freakin fantastic I wasn't sure about that back plate when it was first done but actually you know what it worked out pretty darn well so the last thing all that's left then is to find out if it still works all right let's press this power button hey it works at least a little that fan might be dead though so maybe that fan is just not quite in there so it's uh do you happen to know which one is that fan there it is nice it works don't celebrate too much yeah we still gonna launch a game or something so here we are we're in rise of the Tomb Raider now I think the in-game benchmark for this game is actually kind of broken right now but as long as it runs at all even if the results aren't reliable that'll still tell us whether this thing is indeed functional looking pretty smooth there so that's it then folks hydro dipped r-tx 20 atti it's still working freakin fabulous we're not necessarily recommending that you try this at home but we will say that it was lots of fun and looks really cool and you could do it at home we're just not recommending it speaking of things we recommend available for Android and iOS today so go check it out so thank you for watching coming along on our journey
