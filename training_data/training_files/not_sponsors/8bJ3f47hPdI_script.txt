continuing my quest to follow through humanities development through history I've now completed a few basic flint tools ceramics in some native copper tools next up it's time to start building some more major projects using these base tools I have now constructed specifically a bow and arrow and a dugout canoe and for that the first major challenge I'm gonna face is needing to cut some pretty sizable trees so while I was making flint in copper tools I'd analyse working on a second type of stone tool that became common later after chipped Flint tools but shortly before humanity started to use copper a salt or ground stone axe becoming popular in the Neolithic era sometime around 10,000 BCE they proved to be a powerful tool for felling trees and clearing land a bit more time consuming to produce they are made by grinding a stone into a blade shape rather than chipping it offering a more resilient cutting tool but first I need to find the perfect tree for my bow on the hand right now for a good tree for the bow there's a few different options the Kree would probably ideal for this area although I just elm ash maple any of those will probably a decent bow probably fairly straight how many knots to cut down got my copper X copper adds champion so check it out now let's find a tree to cut down just fine money good split with me at 75 bucks they say money doesn't grow on trees just right there there's just $75 in cash and a fishing pole now is this like a trap what the weird forest written all right so we just gained an anonymous $75 patron so thanks for that well I finished my hunt for the perfect tree let's see how Annalise is doing on the stone axe I'm gonna take this rock and turn it into an X I'll be using a pecking and grinding method with these hammer stone and this granite rock I'm gonna hopefully shape this edge into a 45 degree angle that will turn it into an axe head once we put it in a handle [Music] [Music] with copper being such a soft metal I'm a little skeptical my tool they're gonna be adequate so if they prove to be uneffective this should be a good backup I've ground down the stone into a axe head I used it to cut the end here and it works pretty good all right so I went around the forest trying to find a guild tree for a bow and came across this elm looks really promising super straight it's got a few small knots but not many it's fairly thick I think about six inches in diameter which should it was enough material to make a few different staves from potentially make a few bows there the challenge is gonna be cutting it down now cuz it's pretty big and I only have copper tools to use this blade is about the same size as oats ease which is know it for being a pretty effective tool for the arrows in I have my doubts too well it'll work for actually cutting on tree and as a backup I have on Elise making a stone axe that might work better little bit awkward crooked timox it harder swing accurately [Applause] doing pretty good it's pretty slow because each one right into is just the integrity of the actual tools I made starting to bend outward I think that's because the stick was not a complete 90 it's up a little bit so when I strike it it pushes it and causing it to fall apart so which I've been able to find some better sticks probably have gotten a better result with this so you take it back retune them and hopefully a little bit better results like half an inch so now I'm going to create the hole in this half for the oxide to fit in I've started it with this piece of Flint to make this notch and I'll just put an ember in this and then keep feeding it oxygen till it burns all the way through and I'll have the start of a hole that I can then continue to widen until the stonehack set it fits I'm just shipping out the burnt stuff [Music] so it took a couple hours but I've burned through the log and now I just need to focus on getting the whole wide enough for the rock to fit in but there's a herd of turkeys and I'm gonna go chase them first we're gonna go chase turkeys where are the turkeys they're over there I love turkeys they're so dumb I'm gonna catch this one dance [Music] now go chase him dad I'll hold the camera you know so just gently bother a flock of turkeys don't hurt him all right I have managed to burn all the way through the log now so I'll just keep using embers to burn out the rest of the hole until the rock fits and then once I wedge it in we'll have an axe but keep losing a rock now we have connects introducing a stick 2.0 it's bigger it's straighter and it's stronger it's a little bit more support for the blade so it should hopefully not move as much and it took its suggestion from the comments of adding some charcoal to the pine pitch and make it more of a glue so hopeful that holds a little bit stronger working easier to swing and for reference I brought the flint show what that would look like got this bit this still a little sharp yes it's pretty slow definitely improvement so we're not going backwards [Music] yeah this is wrong [Music] I left it long we can't do it start a new tree this one just doesn't want to go got it oh that was a lot of work at the same time a lot easier than expected a good stick makes a huge difference can't believe I cut that with just a piece of copper hello surprisingly effective I will have more respect for old see he's got a pretty good tool after cutting the tree with copper in a little over an hour I tried out analyse the stone axe next to cut it to size [Applause] alright stick broke there's have to finish it by hand and see how long it takes and make a new stick later so far seems to be working pretty good though this might slow down a bit with the upcoming boat project some more tools I'll need are a few sets of wedges to help split the log so I took a few more pieces of the flow copper we got in Michigan and cold work them and sharpen them into some rough edges next up I need to get the tree for my dugout canoe in preparation I've seen that this process can be incredibly slow going even with modern steel tools which I don't have however I think there are two important things that I can do that should hopefully speed up the process first using a dead and dried tree instead of a freshly cut one so that it'll burn easily and I can let the fire do the majority of the work and by not being overly ambitious on the size of my canoe my inspiration I'm pulling from what is believed to be the oldest dugout canoe the Pesa canoe made from a Scots pine around 8000 BCE which is roughly 17 inches in diameter trying to find a tree with these exact parameters was a bit of a challenge but eventually found a really good candidate up near Duluth okay we're up at my brother's property and he has a stone pine tree that is probably the best candidate we've been able to find for a possible dugout canoe it moved on a windstorm a few years ago and has been drying out since and hopefully is not rotting too much so we're now dealing the tree cut it to size drop it down split off the top third and start burning what we can do it with the tools we have yeah hit it with a stick [Music] [Music] oh that one takes a bite I'm guts holding it might be bad in the copper actually because getting deep chunks there's a whole is a little too big like rock kept falling out there's a little piece of wood in there and seem to be doing the trick hope the rest of the wood doesn't break and this is actually working out pretty good I think it's doing better than the copper is just because I can get a lot more of a swing it's got bought more weight so you get a lot more penetration and take out some deeper cuts so don't age not too bad oh we get a crack it cuts well but not super deep [Music] [Music] I think this guy's holding it up if I cut it out I put a little bit just enough pressure on it to snap it hopefully feel gets really close I don't want to get too close and have it snap unexpectedly as a lot of weight I could kill somebody so see this does it anyone move further away just a little bit more [Music] [Applause] it fell over all right now to do market [Music] oh they're alright so took pretty much all day I finally got the tree down got good way through it with the copper and the stone so I'm not really sure if copper ore still works better it seems the handle makes a huge difference and the handle and one needs some improvement it broke off the copper is pretty sharp you can cut but it can't go super deep so I'm still not certain which one is actually better but I got through and now we have the log ready to be turned into a boat we debarked it got started trying to split it with some of the wedges I made but they not splitting - well I think it's a little too white I'm just gonna let it dry out the next week come back split it start a fire burn our way through [Music] if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and check out other content we have
