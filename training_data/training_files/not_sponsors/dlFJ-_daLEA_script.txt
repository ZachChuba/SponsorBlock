top of the description if you're 18 and remember to gamble responsibly if I had known I was about to get raided me or my I would not have opened that door and poor old me was now on a timer because I was just killed by another team elsewhere and you know what the worst part of it is this was my starter and my starter was stacked with everything for a main base which I was about to build metal fragment stone sulfur weapons a level 2 workbench actually hurts just to think about it so everything I did beforehand the resources I found the items I crafted the people I killed it was all for nothing GG fellas what are you breaking I'll tell you if there's anything worth spot for the oil refinery they were nice enough and only wanted certain things out of my base which was charcoal for some reason offering to give me some of it back which is why I didn't do this to them like three hours ago no go ahead what the [ __ ] now you take it my torch is out still now you guys want it fair and square I didn't want any of it back they rated me fair and square so we abandoned the ship taken with us only a few tools and a weapon to defend ourselves the fresh-faced actually find these parts of rust the most enjoyable I've always been a work towards something to feel a sense of achievement kind of guy and that's just something so satisfying about putting down a 2x2 and filling it with

alright mate alright and just like that I was off first things first the runs our outpost along the way I'd need to hit as many barrels as possible because we've now moved to an American server and we had no blueprints I'd need a tool to hit these barrels with and it just so happens I got lucky and ran into two friendly people howdy hello fresh I'm starting up sup dude I'm just trying to get a start I don't even that'd be like take this wow thank you good luck mate you luck mate I'll remember your name wait what's your name thank you see salutations okay I just got a metal pick axe and hatchet to kind Rose is the Canadian server now with both metal tools in my hands I was set to hit the grind water should have 1200 cloth 353 scrap 1.5 K metal frags and I'm cooking up a prepare - I've already learned [ __ ] 300 scraps with this stuff I got a right mind to [ __ ] go put a stash down with his ship the scrap the metal friends the cloth and the high quality metal and some other things were now nestled snugly in a hole safe from any bandit who would try and murder me for my goods we now needed walls to protect us in a roof over our heads I ran off with my jackhammer into the dusty desert getting stone for our home and to trade for wood at the outpost now that we had the wood and stone sorted it was time to carve out a nice bit of real estate for ourselves we decided on a little spot between two rivers near the coastal line now this base design is what I've used many times it's one of my own designs and it's never been rated before it looks small but it also looks like it's more trouble than it's worth if you'd like to see a video on this design let me know in the comments below [Music] the first stage of the base was complete the following morning I planned on heading out to do some farming and then I saw a guy I began to creep towards his base but he heard me howdy yeah I'm just looking for nodes what are you talking about I understand your content what is content creation and I respect that it's okay I respect that dude you got a unique voice though do I have for [ __ ] sake nice to meet you too come at you with the next fight we live right over there

thank you that guy was cool so we built right near a big active Zerg the main pain machine a guy with over 10,000 hours on Ross was now our our ally we began to roam with him a little even getting him into our discord however an opportunity to screw with him quickly showed itself now I've got an OG name I don't know if it works up he knows like digits after names like number sign pound sign him in and then 250 numbers well you're like an old day I think like six six hundred of his daddy name since the beginning beta stages of book look I'm on because I created discord so I have the hashtag zero

numbers with your [ __ ] when you have what's it called discord [ __ ] not sure you change your numbers or whatever you want [Laughter] [Music] that's embarrassing [Laughter] well I mean like am I supposed to know you [ __ ] little quick Google search you're created discord [ __ ] yeah no exactly no [ __ ] wait soon after this pain spotted a kid at guy outside of our base we decided we try and rob him of his weapon yes buddy there was a failure but we did learn something that these guys were our neighbors you neighbors in fact they just moved in which was odd because they already had our walls up they must have come from a different area of the map and they had weapons of blueprints which didn't bode well for us this would trigger the great arms race and who could get rid of who first now let's skip ahead a couple of hours and you Ally had given us his siren a med pen which I promptly research and from the crafted sir I researched the 556 we were now weaponized and going on a mission we had never done before the large oil rig I've heard many tales about it now powerful it is to get weapons scrap and high-quality metal something we needed right now and our experienced friend wanted to take us there as our guide in order to become friends with the guys that base over there I had to make them a good role player base and before I ran over to the house like a few times actually likes at least like eight times I ran at them naked just like making weird sounds in chat and eventually like what's wrong with you you warmed in I saw like one clip is said at the top right Lily bastard I don't press D on this I don't know if it's still a they have random Eagle signature that let's all stick together though whatever side we push up let's just all Oh yeah it's likely that although this is the recycler it's a blue card right here the way you can't for now as recycle awesome blue rim is actually right next to the recycler so like right over here [Music] get a bunch a little simple scope sometimes you can't really shoot to this staircase it's like it's like you can't shoot this backside it's a case or it does no damage this is the military great room right here it's by the way then you take a left and there's always the usually like a scientist left right and maybe sometimes do a thing it's like either this one he was glitch I didn't see him he was glitched he was inside the box I didn't even see him no way yeah [Music] I know you can't even run away yes iTunes to run and I got dumped yeah I was just thinking that wow they got like a little fancy setup and everything up here they opened doors no there's even a grill up here in a couple of chairs to sit on your grill I'll sit on mine again all right never I'm looking the boxes [Music] [ __ ] you playing with a youtube video brought it to see the look for the people no I chuck it on the ground have a look I'll load I said hey listen you did me that's right yes secret or hidden nests and people say but I just caught a lead round the top one I just called Red Room or whatever there's two entrances to do it on either side but like right here there's no scientists that are inside this one lucky for you you ain't going you ain't going to be definitely better I've seen sea floors have done multiple sea floor big record is the frequency that's the frequency I was talking about every time you fill in the Chinook for that frequency is all are on that rig I start it and run to this ready you go run into that room [Music] that's like at least three dead right there Oh always oh don't want him to run in yeah they listen to our doorway is that what one directly across away hey kelp you killed me I told you one of the straightedge Johnson look it's so bad it didn't happen it never happened it never happened oh I haven't slept one to that scientists like ran in and like Japanese like I couldn't fathom it I was I was there about to [ __ ] like you that I was getting ready myself and then you were like ah let's go no dope with the door so he doesn't ruddy notice and did you open the door dear I need honest [Music] [Music] [Music] let's say [Music] we had returned victorious laden with the great riches of the large oil rig we were now one step closer to taking the lead in the arms race but as you'll see in the finale the Zerg rears its ugly head on us and it's everything I could do to keep all the loot ain't got trapped with oh there's like three good kids coming over more looking lunches directly the way Lee around oh my god the seminal dude [Music] right
