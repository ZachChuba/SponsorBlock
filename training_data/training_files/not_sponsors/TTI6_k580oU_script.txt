so I'm going to try to recreate the water leaf soup that we saw Babatunde and his wife cook in that recent video in Nigeria hmm they're so good so I've been off shopping to the international food store imports wood and I managed to get most of the ingredients that I need so let's have a look alive most again so jot some carry so dried cassava granules so this is to make the aber Peppers scotch bonnet peppers now I'm gonna make a smaller portion of soup then we saw on the video because there's no way I'm gonna get Jenny to eat anything that's got that much pepper in it Jenny doesn't have such a high tolerance for chili although I'm not sure that I do either but Jenny really has a very low tolerance for chili so I'm just gonna cook for myself Maggi or Maji stock cubes these are tiny I don't think these are the same ones but this is the closest I could get so these are tiny little things about centimeter in cube so you might have to use a couple of those onions I managed to get the same kind of pink onion that we saw in the video now for fish closest I could get to the dried fried fish that we saw in Babatunde video was this stuff which is stop fish which is just dried cod basically so we're gonna have to soak that because that's really tough stuff for the red oil palm oil I've got some palm oil here that's the only part I could find in the shop and it's kind of a solid that might just be because of the climate here it's not quite so hot here in the United Kingdom so it might well be that yeah cool a climate that this tends to be solid but anyway we've got unrefined palm oil there and I couldn't get the locust bean paste because well the shop was kind of half depleted anyway but I'm not even sure they stock it under normal circumstances so I had to kind of improvise for that and we're gonna be substituting miso so got some miso paste here which is fermented beans fermented soybeans so not the same thing as fermented locust beans but hopefully same kind of idea similar kind of flavor profile and hopefully that'll be close enough to be good enough so that's our ingredients obviously one thing missing is the water leaf now again I can't buy water leaf in this country couldn't find it anywhere there were lots of different vegetables in the international food store but couldn't get water leaf I imagine it probably just doesn't transport very well so we're going to substitute something else and I think that's gonna be goose foot and we're gonna go and forage that now okay so these are the fields where I quite commonly take dog oh for a walk and they've been left uncultivated that is fallow for a couple of years now and I think I've just seen the plant that I want over there so yeah this is the stuff we want here so this is each foot this is called goose foot it looks like we may be actually looking at several different species of goose foot here it's actually really difficult to identify which species were dealing with this could be good king henry it could be one of the other goose foots they're quite difficult to tell apart but as a group they're really easy to identify so we're gonna pick a bit of this goose foot it's very plentiful here so go wander down and find a nice lush bit make sure Eva doesn't think it's been weed on by dogs and then this looks like a good spot here so gonna pick some of this and this is gonna be my substitute for water leaf okay so I'm only making a half portion so I think that's probably enough there so let's head for home and make our fake water leaf soup okay so the first thing I've got to do is pick over these goose fat leaves very much like with the water leaf they'll be bits in here which are more desirable than others so I'm just gonna pick over the leaves probably discard most of the stalks because the stalks have a tendency to be a little bit tough well take the tender stalks see some of these are much more delicate than others now one of the things you might have noticed in the video we saw from Nigeria when they were making water Leafs if twas cut the leaves before washing them and I don't know what the reason for this is I would normally rinse things before cutting them I'm wondering if it was something to do with the way of cutting actually that taking a big bunch of this and then cutting it by hand might be less safe if the leaves are really wet well maybe there's some other reason so I'm gonna do a one rinse before I cut I'm not gonna try and cut them in my hand because I will just cut my hand off these leaves are dusty and they're gonna need a good wash now this isn't going to be an exact substitute for water leaf but I can't get water leaf in this country at least I couldn't find it in the shops and I don't suppose it probably travels very well so after to make allowances for the fact that this is different however my research suggests that water leaf is actually quite a mild tasting vegetable and this also is a multi steam vegetable it's not closely related water leaf is related to carnations and Campion's whereas this goosefoot is related to spinach and beets but well the idea is it's a mild tasting leafy vegetable hoping it will be close enough okay so I'm not going to try that business with holding them in bunches while you slice through them my I don't have that skill and I would probably just lose a finger so I'm gonna chop these on the board here now impression is that we're aiming for pieces about maybe one centimeter squared or smaller so I'm gonna chop that way and then run the knife through the other way it looks about the right size maybe a bit finer I think we'll just go one more time through that with the knife okay and now we're gonna cover those with water and give me little soap to rinse any remaining dirt off of them as I say this is unusual to me to chop a vegetable to chop a leafy vegetable then wash it but I suspect there might be a reason for this it wasn't mentioned but another water leaf contains oxalates and I'm wondering whether chopping and then rinsing helps to rid it as some of those oxalates before it's cooked interestingly goosefoot has the same property it does contain oxalates so we're hopefully doing the same thing here that's just a theory anyway next leap peppers and onion so this is the part that might kill me I've got myself some scotch bonnet peppers here I'm just going to take the stalks off these are closest I could find to the peppers we saw on verboten days video I think they are a scotch bonnet type pepper that they're growing up in Africa they're obviously not exactly the same but yeah I think what we saw there was was definitely some local variety similar to this I'm making about half the quantity of soup that we saw on Burton days video so I'm using about half the quantity of peppers okay I don't have one of those funky little hand food processes so I'm going to use my electric food processor and grind up these peppers with about what I think it's about three quarters of the onion because I did notice that 1/4 of the onion was just sliced into pieces and put in hold I don't know if that was intentional or if there just wasn't room in that little processor but I'm gonna try and follow along with that so I showed up the pepper some fret I didn't get that on camera because I wasn't recording with 3/4 of the onion the misreading of the peppers is already making making me cough and catch my breath a little bit so yeah this could be interesting so couldn't get fermented locust bean paste song they use miso paste instead hopefully close up close enough analog so there's no preparation required they're just just gonna now do the fish okay and this stock fish cod is a bit tougher than the fish we saw in Bebbington days video because it's a it's a bigger fish hmm I don't know actually what the fish was that they used but this is a bit kind of more substantial and meaty I'm gonna take the skin off because the skin goes really rubbery on this stop fish so just gonna pull that apart and I'm gonna cut these into smallish pieces from otherwise it's gonna be great big chewy chunks of fish which whilst that might be nice it's not quite what we're looking for in a soup okay so big pan and I've got my palm oil here which actually got a warmer day today so this has gone slightly liquid so need to be careful how I open this so yeah it's still fairly solid but they go so that's the the red oil I think that's probably because we're making half as much and that's probably about the right amount and I'll get that very well what's interesting there is the smoke point of this oil appears to be really really low I imagine that's because it's the unrefined I think I've got too much oil in there so I'm actually gonna fit that out quite a aroma to this oil in with the chilies and onion the peppers and onion I think I might have more pepper them I really need that we're not gonna worry too much about that that sizzle for a little bit softened down quite nicely so any with the fish and I can't remember I can't remember what happens next I have to stop cube and the remote has been pasted now these little stock cubes here are tiny compared to what we saw these are like a centimeter cube so I think I'm probably gonna need at least two of these to make up the equivalent of half of one of the regular cubes gosh they're really fiddly so can i crush that in the packet I'm a sprinkle it in yes I can I mean I'm just doing opening the wrong bit here because shouldn't be this fiddly right okay and now the miso paste well that much maybe a bit more okay one thing I can say is that there are smells coming out of here that are very unfamiliar to me I think the palm oil has more flavor than expected or certainly has more aroma than I expected and so that palm oil is a real it's a flavor component in itself so that's going to be interesting and the last little bit of onion so there's no liquid added it's just the moisture from the leaves is gonna cook down that's the theory so turn that right down lid on and give it a simmer for five to ten minutes okay we're about five minutes into cooking I still think that needs to cook down a little bit I think those leaves I'm not quite soft enough just yet but it's coming together and it's starting to look kind of authentic given that we have to wing it a bit on many of the ingredients okay I think that is done so I'm gonna turn it off and we've got a nail make the ever okay now I couldn't find a recipe for how much water to Gaby that you use to make ever so I just got a can't wing it so I got my daddy here and apparently you just kind of pour it in until you can't see very much water left so yes and then we just distr this and need it yeah it's got an interesting aroma it's got a slightly sour sort of aroma to it I'm starting to get doughy that's good we just keep up this for a few minutes until until I guess we feel like we've got the desired texture I'm completely out of my depth here so I don't even know if I'm doing this right but it seems to be more or less resembling what we've got about 10 days video it's now coming together into a dough I think I might have got a little bit dry here I maybe should have added a little bit more water or a little bit less Daddy but no mind right so let's serve up well there it is let's go and get outside of that okay here we go I'm gonna have to apologize for the dog barking in the background she's outside playing ball with the family so finger Bowl and I think this is not only just to wash my hands but I think this might be to start the yeah to stop the diba from sticking to them quite so much so got a little that and then okay good need a moment to process this it's really really spicy but actually not not desperately hot it's really got a good spicy chili flavor but it's not it's not beyond my limit so I'm gonna enjoy this mmm it's where he tasty I'm struggling here cuz obviously I look normally with a knife and fork and spoon but I thought I try and make the experience as authentic as I can gonna say this is probably the most unusual thing I've eaten for quite a long time it's really spicy the flavors in here that palm oil I've never really cooked with raw palm oil like that before but that brings a flavor dimension to it and yeah I mean I guess with the authentic locust bean paste there would be another dimension of flavor in there which I'm probably missing here but hopefully the miso has given it something similar so yeah I mean what an amazing thing totally different to really anything I've had that I can remember so there we go I'm not gonna talk anymore because the chili is really challenging my palate but I'm enjoying it it's the I would say the spice level is below that of those two times spicy noodles but above shin ramyun probably if that gives you any kind of handle on what the spice level is in here it's really nice it's a chili burn that's on the lips but also right the back of the throat so it's not one eyes ones that just hurts your entire head those scotch bonnet chilies we've got a nice warm chili heat in the back of the throat and a burn on the lips but my tongue mercifully is not on fire future shrimp here I'm editing the video that you're now watching that's weird how's that work and enjoying while I have my lunch break the leftovers from yesterday's fake water beef soup I'm adding this bit in because I realized there's a few things I probably forgot to say mainly because for one thing I was overwhelmed by the chili heat of this but also the whole experience actually was just quite alien to me and I was struggling to find the words to describe what I was eating so I've revisited this today I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about the flavors and about what this is actually like to eat so the first thing to say is this is probably too much chili for me so this is a level of spice that's just beyond my comfort level so it's pretty darn hot a little bit too hot for me to eat comfortably but I did enjoy it anyway the other thing is that eating soup what's more like a stew but eating soup with your hands it's a skill that I just haven't been brought up with so I'm today using a spoon as it's my cultural background but it was quite interesting to have to have a go at that yeah not gonna master that now not at my age so we don't have rant and rave about what is at its heart quite a simple dish here but I do want to talk a little bit more about the flavours and the aroma this is a deeply deeply savory dish and the aroma of because it's called the dried fish in there and this something that these green leaves do as well the compound that fishy flavor that just makes it quite a pungent dish I would liken it to the experience of my first authentic Thai food dish it was like just this wall of aroma hit me and it was quite overwhelming and and could have been off-putting same is true of this there is a very very pungent strong aroma from this soup which could have been off-putting but my experience with these things is that you just power past that and the flavor is all there it's no different to the idea of Stilton cheese if you get a piece of Stilton cheese and shove that next to your nose the smell you smell there is not in any way something you could describe as pleasant but you power past that and what you've got is a flavor reward that's really well worth it and this is the same so this is this takes a little bit of adjustment of the taste buds and adjustment of the expectations but actually the flavor that's under Nix there is kind of amazing and part of that is because it's just it's just full of sensation oh yeah so so the ever the starchy staple we've got with this made from cassava made from Kerry is how to describe that so if you like suet dumplings you're very likely to like a bar it's not the same but it appeals to many of the same sensations and tastes so yeah I was expecting it to be really really bland in a way that some starches are but actually its flavor is comparable to that of wheat flour bread sort of flour but it's so it's got a nice starchy flavor of its own so the other thing to say is that the all that greenery we put in there all those leaves did some kind of chemistry thing with the other flavors in the dish some kind of alchemy type of thing goes on here and so with the strong aroma of the dried fish and the spices all of those red peppers the green leaves did something that was quite unexpected for me and so yeah the end up they end up with a flavor that yeah I wasn't expecting to find in there so do I think I nailed it who knows I really can't tell obviously there could be some subtle flavors from the water leaf though there are absent from this because I used a different leaf and I had to substitute a few other things as well do I think I got close I reckon maybe I don't know maybe we're 80 percent of the way there with this I think maybe this is a eighty percent authentic flavor representation of what Babatunde and his wife cooked who knows maybe one day I'll get a chance to test the authentic thing the final question is should you try this well if you're if you're a person with the average British palate like I generally am so I like I like things like fish and chips I like some some quite subtle things like cheese omelets and so on which are not powerfully spicy and a lot of people might think they're bland but I would prefer to describe them as subtle and you're gonna like this well you're gonna find this a challenge you're gonna find this an assault on your senses but I'm gonna said it's worth it why not it's worth a try you might not like it I'm not absolutely certain that I really like it but it's been tremendously stimulating and it's been a real surprising experience so I'm enjoying it just for the fact that it's something different something outside of my experience and I just enjoyed really going there so anyway I'm gonna shut up now and hand you back to past shrimp so there we go as close as I can make it water leaf soup from Nigeria with a bomb thanks for watching Babatunde I am interested to hear what you think of this please rate me on my efforts here I did my best I don't think I've really quite nailed it but this is really interesting and I've thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks for watching I hope to see you again soon [Music]
