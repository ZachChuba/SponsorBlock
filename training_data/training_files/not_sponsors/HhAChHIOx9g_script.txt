careers and billions of dollars are made online every day from people who know how to use the internet to their advantage stock trading blogging graphic design freelancing of all sorts those are just a few the list is truly endless and from the comfort of your own home why not use the internet to make some serious dough well creating those online endeavors take time effort and skills skills that many people don't have the patience to learn and like most things the internet has a dark side a very dark side hence an underground but growing industry online scamming these scams come in loads of different forms a nigerian prince may need you to save him and trade for the royal jewels or a russian babe is really interested in your pokemon collection and needs some money in order to get one of her own but my favorite one of all the gift card scam please wait don't leave the computer please don't touch your computer leave it for me oh honey i just placed the order it's fine and when they're not getting grandmod by kit boga they make a killing an estimated three billion dollars is what is taken from americans every single year from scams and that's just what is reported these scammers make enough to get an entirely new phone when their screen cracks but never enough to pay becky a 10 tip after a night on the town there's an underground currency out there that some scammers will do almost anything to get their hands on that includes blackmail coercion manipulation provocation ddosing and doxing this currency i'm talking about has been around longer than bitcoin and it's something you might not expect runescape gold that's right the online gaming currency has been exploited to transfer millions of dollars from the hands of innocent runescape noobs to line the pockets of scammers for years this currency is a serious thing it's traded for cryptocurrencies and cash all the time there are entire websites dedicated to purchasing and selling it for a profit some redditors claim that this currency alone is propping up venezuela's shattered economy and people have been sentenced to jail for stealing runescape gold although player run gambling has been officially ruled a bannable offense by the creators of runescape the worst place in gileanor is the dual arena because if the game creators are hosting the gambling system then it's okay right this is the place that kids are lied to and cheated this is the place where players quit the game the place where gambling addictions have been sparked and been fueled for years on end where real-life bank accounts have been overdrawn and others have been topped up [Music] [Music] of course i've fallen victim to a few scams here when i was younger but now that i'm older i can play ball against these scammers that prey on all of runescape's players i've done it already and i'm doing it again but this time the stakes are higher the methods are different and there are a lot more scams outside of the dual arena to thwart i've pried into the underbelly of the runescape community and have insider information on how these scammers do what they do more on that later but you should know that these scammers are predominantly american and british men literate people with plenty of opportunity around them that may have even had goals of starting a real career but through one bad decision or another now spend 8 to 14 hours a day scamming children instead sometimes when we don't have the patience to learn we become the worst part of ourselves [Music] i'm only going to enter a stake as long as i'm sure i have a good advantage over the scammer so i first try to demonstrate to them that i have a good amount of money once they see that two things happen they get interested and they offer a very high amount at first that's good for me because the more i can get out of these scammers the better adding one mill at a time here very slowly made me seem more like a vulnerable noob that this scammer could easily exploit he doesn't have mage is this the first yes this is it baby this scammer was doing the food on scam but he didn't know about the staff of the dead not only does it venom my opponent but using the special attack halves all melee damage also i'm healing with every single cast blood barrage heals me a quarter of the damage that i deal so this one was a pretty much instant win yes good fight and good riddance with half hp left no food used 15 mil win and another food scammer that falls victim to the staff's powers oh he did it yes 20 mil win baby this is the perfect opportunity because he only had a few food really he just doesn't have a chance like he only had five food don't get ko'd friend come on bro gotta make this uh exciting for me you have a one percent chance [Music] goodbye yeah that's what i'm talking about did the same thing with this guy but he only wanted to stake six mil six mil i'll take it pecker love nine advertising a steak for whipping or ddsing but if we take a look at his inventory we see some other items in there that help him get the advantage over unsuspecting players i type in my offer of 280 mil in the hopes that i can get this guy on rules where he has no chance of winning and although i couldn't put movement on to have a 100 chance of winning i was pretty happy with my odds he matches my stake of 280 mil and accepts the first screen this time i don't have my staff of the dead but just like him i have vengeance i quickly switch my spell book to ancients and we duke it out with the dragon daggers i knew the code i won with blood barrage was better than the rapier i did take a statistical advantage in entering this stake which my opponent did not like but it was a bit too close for comfort [Music] here i tried to duel him again but he didn't like the fact that i both vengeanced and then switched to ancients during that stake the reason that this mage anti-scamming works so effectively is because the clients that calculate the advantage that they have over me don't do that with magic versus melee they only do it melee versus melee however this is only a simple excel sheet i'm sure the clients that they have to calculate odds and make sure that they're getting at least a 55 advantage they do much more elaborate things than this i recently did an entire runescape journey from scratch on a new account in my playing runescape properly series i bring it up because i started anti-scamming on that account which is partially the reason why i ended the series anyway i uploaded the entire series in a single video it may be in your youtube recommendations in the next couple days so check it out if you get a chance my goal to make billions of gp off of these movement on tricksters at the dual arena [Music] there's a mechanic in the game that doesn't allow two people to die at the same exact time there has to be a clear winner in every duel there's a clear winner almost every time just by assigning one player in the duel first priority on hitting the opponent that means their hit shows up first take note that this guy goes around a corner and then manages to hit me first which shouldn't be allowed that's what these tricksters do they turn movement on or obstacles on in order to get the first hit on unsuspecting players i managed to do the same exact thing to him and take back first hit [Music] i should maintain focus because these stakes can always turn around fortunately even though he did manage to get the first hit on me i still won the stake [Music] two free hits that steak could have gone three probably if it lasted longer i don't know what this guy's doing he thinks i'm just a youtuber he thinks i'm so bad at the game that he just keeps giving me his [Music] money [Music] [Applause] the majority of the dual arena consists of scammers and odds takers that take advantage of the normal players of the game but surely there are benefits to the dual arena that make eight years of manipulation justified no in fact my findings are the opposite okay okay look what i can do whoever has one bill type one i'll check the one bill i'll give you one point two on the win if i lose it i owe you 1.2 this live streamer is just one of thousands of people that have become latched onto gambling because of the dual arena he just offered 20 interest on a loan of 1 billion gp giving away 200 mil just to have another shot at winning a stake and the way i see it is if you can spend if the best money making in runescape is 10 mil an hour doing really efficient theater of blood or whatever and you can go steak and win 100 ml from one steak your mindset and your attitude to the game will forever be ruined you will not enjoy normal gaming you will not enjoy normal gaming on runescape because your head will just think i could make this in three seconds at the arena so everything loses its value and it's just i couldn't have said it better myself and that is perfectly demonstrated by this next clip take a look i mean it makes sense the people who are mad at me are all iron men and pvmers like like they said they sit trying to pvm for for three months to make what i make in a day but it's all good oh good i understand why they get mad that's right these guys get loans from their viewers and go billions of gp in debt he got out of 24 build debt and now three days later has 10 bill debt okay okay as expected these guys take loans from their viewers and sometimes give 20 to 30 interest but what about people that aren't live streamers well they go out and buy gp lose it to the scammers and then buy it back from the scammers afterwards not directly they probably don't know they're doing it but they do it all through third party vendors like websites no but like walla mythology like like the funniest i've ever seen in my life so there was the streamer i'm not gonna name names he was in debt and he was faking it all he was rich he was very rich at one point and he got clean and he would rwt to buy gold and try to make it back and try to sell and [ __ ] and i know this guy right and i swear to god bro i am not lying as i say this i swear to god i am not lying you just see random [ __ ] in his house disappearing i'm talking about his new curtains disappearing like 50ml seven like i'm talking about his is his pool sticks his is disappearing on craigslist man you you see like his like his his laptops and everything this is disappearing and then you know what happened some guy came in his stream and said yo man what happened to the tv in the back i swear to god he put his head down and was like we don't talk about that no more [Applause] oh [ __ ] his new tv disappeared from the back bro there's no way he sold that his daughter's toys and everything man i i zpa man the flat screen too that's crazy yeah so paul enjoys to take he's done 10 one thousand percent returns on loans for staking oh my god and he his max goes up to four thousand percent oh my god uh um on top of the four thousand percent you also gotta realize he's done the title for his car well almost done that he didn't actually do that but it wasn't it was it was on the table and then he bought gold i think instead so did the person that was getting offered the title for his car just declined no he was he was gonna take it kind of waiting for it to happen and they ended up like i said just buying gold instead and going through that way because he got he got paid from work and when this guy offers these lens the payments of you know 300 four thousand percent he's legit right has he paid he's done it he's paid it back and tell me again what he does with the money when he earns it loses it buys more gold goes back does the same thing again because once you buy gold and it goes wrong you'll just keep buying can i get it i mean until you make back even that money that you just lost to buy that gold like like like okay listen i i know people i'm not gonna say names like i said i'm telling you bro it's very i know like over 20 people like that i know somebody that lost like 40 50 grand like like bitter sea staking like it's scary man it's scary [ __ ] voila but let's talk about the beneficiaries on august 16th of 2018 the dual arena tax was implemented into the game and on february 28th of 2020 jagex released a statement that 17.5 trillion gp had been taken away from the game because of this one percent tax sometimes the tax is less with lower stakes but i'm just gonna assume it's one percent by multiplying by a hundred we have an approximate amount of gp that was circulated around the dual arena during that time 1.7 quadrillion and by extrapolating linearly to the current date we have a much higher number for how much was circulated my math by using an average runescape gp price brought me to the conclusion that approximately 2.7 million dollars has circulated around the dual arena but that's only in the last two years since the tax was implemented and this has been going on for many more years than that crum is another youtuber that has made videos on a lot of the scams that happen in runescape it's not my fault that you feel that i am a scammer and but i'm telling you that i'm not gonna keep any of this you're gonna get it back it's not my fault you're compulsive bro all right and you feel this way that's not my fault hi crum how's it going hey not too bad in yourself good thank you so you've had experience with covering the story of the duel arena tell me more in detail yeah so i covered odd staking this was nearly a year ago now i actually got into like one of their discord servers and you know the people that that were doing this were making like very big money we're talking like uh like it was thousands of dollars a month i forget the exact numbers and most of them wouldn't talk to me i was warned before i made the video from the guy that ran the clan not to do this right and other people in the clan saying hey don't cover this at all until like this is fixed by jagex otherwise we're going to be very mad at you and uh anyways i found one guy that would actually talk about it and he was like very vague like his whole aim from doing that video is he kind of wanted to make odd staking look like it was good for other people who didn't have the odds to do right he wanted to bring more customers to himself so i took advantage of that i asked him a lot of questions i cut a bunch of his bs out and i uploaded a video that ultimately exposed odd staking showed that these people make money in the end and that you lose money in the end and the result from that was you know hours after the video went up i was getting death threats people had found my facebook account people had sent messages to the email of the head instructor at the college i was attending at the time saying that i was going to bring a bomb to the school tomorrow right so like i had to handle that situation and eventually like i just removed the video it wasn't worth it whatsoever you know for the amount of views that it was getting for these people to be potentially involving the fbi you know bomb threats are a very serious thing and they don't take that lightly so for these people to risk getting investigated and potentially imprisoned for doing these things they must be making a lot of money in order to have the resources to do these things as well as risk it yeah it was uh i mean some of it was like an astounding amount of money more than i've seen in any of the other illicit activities that take place in this game um i think if i remember right some guy was making upwards of like fifteen thousand dollars us a month from this um yeah and like you know their discord server is full of of like gold websites that buy and bulk from them like a billions in a time because they're one of the biggest suppliers so it's an hours game you know the more hours they put in the more profit that they see and they've uh automated this too right because you can't sit there and play the game 24 hours a day and if you want to make massive profit like 15 grand a month you need to have bots and many of them running 24 7 7 days a week and that's what a lot of these guys in this server were doing i i seen a see i've seen a screenshot i'll see if i can find it where some dude had like 30 accounts running at the dual arena all x staking when i upload a video on these illicit things that are taking place in old school runescape if there's any sort of money involved people do message me not to the extent that they did with this x taking video um but you know to some sort of extent with threats where they want me to take that video down because they now fear because i made a video on it um that jagex is finally going to take some sort of action and prevent them from doing what they're doing right they want to keep their their uh their investment in place they don't want to lose that what do you think the probability is that they're actually going to take real-life action against you or maybe even me after this video goes up i don't know it's happened in the past people have died from swatting true if i was to react now if as to go back to when i first uploaded that x-ing video absolutely do not take the video down that's the worst thing you can do with the threat if somebody threatens you you know uh don't cave to it whatsoever because that gives them power and you think that's a that's a good powerful move you can make to kind of take power away from these negative horrible people that's remarkable the lengths that these people go to to secure their their revenue well chrome thank you for your time and your insight is there anything else you'd like to add yeah actually there is i think if your viewers tried audible with your free link in the description they would enjoy that my man [Music] once again these movement on tricksters have lower stats but they believe they can compensate for that by using the edges of the arena to get an extra hit in the stake which is a lot better than just a few attack and defense levels but sometimes they overestimate themselves and that's where this biggest stake so far comes into play 495 ml [Music] [Applause] [Music] he tried to counter my first hit switch but he didn't manage to do it if he had stepped one tile southwest instead of where he did he would have been very likely to counter my move and then win the stake despite my big lead in the beginning he almost came back there and with an almost 1 billion gp pot the stakes were high to hit that maneuver correctly but we're not done there time for the 1 billion gp stake oh my god i won oh my god oh i've won one bill against one of these tricksters yes i won [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so i have a lot of money now there are bots at the grand exchange that detect when people are wearing gear that costs a lot of money then they are targeted for lures and scams i was at the grand exchange to trade a friend when right afterwards a guy approaches me he told me to bank everything and that's when i turned on my recorder he told me he's making a video for his youtube channel blah blah blah basically trying to get me to a secluded area at which point he teleports out to barbarian outpost and as i'm the anti-scamming guy i follow him just to see what's going on and to document my findings i'm intentionally playing it very slow pretending like it took me a long time to figure out how to get to the barbarian outpost obviously i've been there thousands of times before but anything to trick this guy he then tells me we have to be matching mummies implying that he's going to give me the full mummy outfit plus the ferroceptor which all of that combined is actually worth quite a bit but first he asks me to reduce my health by drinking lots of xamaric brew doses he then tells me to wear the amulet of avarice which gives me a school above my head and makes me lose all of my items if i die he then trades me as if he's going to give me an extra set of his full mummy outfit and the pharaoh scepter now this is the point where most people would think okay this is too good to be true enter the second lure he tells me that the pharaoh is a one-click teleport and if i go to a pvp world and click that item then it will take me to a multi-zone in the middle of the desert where i could easily die now you might be thinking that's a very good thing he's warning you about the lore but that isn't the lore these two are working together to give you the impression that you know what's going on when in reality it's a double lure okay i have suspect that this guy is part of the lore but he just told me what the scepter does so it's definitely not gonna be the one click teleport scepter alert it's gonna be something beyond that if this guy's a part of it which i do think he is so yeah we'll see though at this point i knew exactly what the lure was this building is incredibly dangerous in fact the tile i'm standing on is the only safe area in this entire place anywhere else and i could die given my low hit points level it was time to do what he said and pull out my gear that i had at the grand exchange but also a few extra goodies the lore is to trade me and get me to walk away from the safe tile but with one eating animation i was able to heal up to 80 hit points so it'd be very unlikely that i would die from anybody sneaking up on me plus i was watching the mini map i just wanted to see how this lure was done so i didn't plan ahead all i brought out were manta rays brews and karambons but maybe if i had time to get myself some weaponry and a super combat potion i could have a fighting chance at killing this guy [Music] oh my god no way no way holy crap oh my goodness oh my goodness that is the that makes the video that makes the video oh my good god my god look how much i made off this lure i just piqued 56 mil off allure yes holy [ __ ] big shout out to sir pugger for exposing these guys in lots of his videos he drops the respect yeah can't say the same for you i think that was very much deserved good riddance good riddance to this day i still have no idea why he was taking off his robes as he died maybe if he wasn't focused on that he could have been eating instead and he probably would have lived but yeah no idea what he was doing i made an entirely new account just to track these three lures in case they ever changed their names added them to my friends list so if they ever do i'll know that they did but hopefully by the time i post an update on these guys at least one of them will have been banned not keeping my hopes up though i have a lot more anti-scams to show you but this video is getting just a bit too long and i don't want to take up too much of your day but for more anti-scams and my next update on this situation all i ask is you try audible for free with the link in the description below once again the money i made in this video is a droplet in the ocean of scams that happen every day but it was good to give them a much bigger taste of their own medicine
