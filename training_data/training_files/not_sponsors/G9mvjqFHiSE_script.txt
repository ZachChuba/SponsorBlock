Hello~ Solarsido This is Solar. Today, I'm with Colleague 1's dogs, Bak Woon Gang I came to a dog playground to walk them. [So to tell you about Bak Woon Gang] [Daebak, male (3 years old) -
Lives and dies for treats] [Haengwoon, female (2.6 years old) -
Likes being alone] [Geongang, male (1.6 years old) -
A personality that can't be still (Similar to me ㅋㅋㅋ)] I'll show you. You guys, 
Bak Woon Gangie- aigoo x2 (Busy) Dad, he pooped! (This guy's traces) They're excited to see their friends, come here. There are other dogs as well,
so let's put their leashes on. Come here!
(Putting on leashes challenge) Be still a bit ㅠㅠ Gosh, he gained a lot of weight. (Chubby) I got this one. (Clip) (3 Welsh Corgis) They're so strong! Unnie, you're going to get dragged
around now. (Prediction) [Correct] Look at his legs shaking! - They're scaredy cats.
- He’s a scaredy cat. He may seem strong, but... (Shaking...) [We prepared this for you!] I really ambitiously prepared this. Do you know what this is~? x5 This is... Oh. What. Is this. It’s a dog translator. It’s a hot [new technology] lately.
So I bought it. I bought it about a week ago. I’m going to see what Geongangie
wants to say so much. (Puppy power) (This is the stamina of puppies) [Oh gosh] - Can we rest for a moment?
- No. Haengwoonie came~
(Unnie, have strength) (Barkbark!!!) He's barking!
[Getting chased again] (Growl) Hold on!
(New technology give me an answer) (Serious) Interpretation complete!!! Oh? Make me have fun! (Make me have fun) Geongang wants to have fun. What do I do?
How do I make him have fun? Daebak, Haengwoon, Geongang, let’s go!!! Let’s go! (Though it looks like she’s running by herself) (The dogs are following behind her) (Together) Let’s go!!!!! Let’s go! Geongang. (Getting water) Haengwoon come here. (Water, give me water) How is it? [She who isn’t speaking...] I told you it would be tiring. Come here. [Sigh...] - Geongang!
- That’s Daebak. Ah, this is Daebak? (I’m Daebak...) I think they’re slightly exhausted because
there aren’t any treats. I think I’ll have to buy some treats. [Treats leggo] Should we go together? (Let’s go buy treats) Go there and play. (Jump) [Reunited with Geongang’s dad] He recognizes his dad right away.
(Only looking to dad) He really likes dad.
(Only looking to dad) He knows his dad! (Instinctive speed) He knows treats well~ This is a place to take pictures! A place to take pictures. Here, here! (What’s wrong with you?) 1, 2, 3! No no! (Escape attempt) I’ll let you down. [Grunt] [Went out without being able to buy treats] (Dad) (Discovered dad) Geongang, come here. - Are you still over there?
- Let’s go in. (Dad) Come in.
Daebak, Geongang, Haengwoon I’m going to lure them in by the treats I bought. I think they took notice. Oh~ You know it~
[Puppies gathering] Wow, this is the first time they gathered
together. (Deeply moved) Daebak! Sit! Good job, you did good. Haengwoon, sit!
Oh, good job. What’s your name?
[Puppy they don’t know] Gucci, come here; Only he is sitting. Sit. Oh? Good job. (Geongang also sat) Daebak, come here x2 Daebak x2 (I’m full, so bye) (Ah, I’m exhausted) Sit, sit. [Mandu sit~] (Cheerful) - You two, be still.
- (Warm-hearted Moon) Ah, Mandu~♥ㅠ (Warm-hearted Moon) Manduㅠㅠ♥ (Scary Moon) Hey, why are you
doing that to Mandu (Warm-hearted Moon) Mandu, come here. Mandu. (Mandu reappears) Sit. Oh, it can’t eat this. [Wants to give it,
but the snack is too big for Mandu] Geongang, sit. Sit. (However, Mandu doesn’t know how to give up) Sit, sit! Look at her sitting! (Unnie!!!) She satㅠㅠ♥ Behind you. (Unnie, Mandu is here)
(Cute)(Tiny)(Peeking) Wait! Wait! Wait. (Stern) [Patient Daebak] Eat it. Oh~ Good job! [Good boy Daebakie] Sit. (Paw) (Here) Sit. Paw. (Here) [Good boy, white doggy] (Cute bread loaf butt><) (It’s fun) [After sharing treats, a bit tired] It’s not an easy job Having a puppy... (Staring...) Aigoox3 They’re overflowing with strength. I ambitiously brought this. The translator. But they don’t bark.. I can’t use this because they won’t bark! Bak Woon Gang! No... Woon Gang!
[Haengwoon exiting] She’s following dad.
(Dad?) (Dad?) [Haengwoon glued to dad’s hip] [Geongang exiting] (Give Daebak a treat) Only Daebak is coming to me. Let’s go! (Rustle)
[Daebak exiting] I don’t need anything. Everyone, go away. Everyone, go! (Then, bye) This camera is leaving, too. How can you really leave just
because I said it? - Give them some water.
- Geongang, drink it. Geongang, drink it. (No no) Oh, you aren’t going to? Okay.
[War of nerves with Solar and the puppies] Daebak~ Here, water. Daebak, water. (It’s not a treat) Haengwoonie~ Haengwoonie, water~ (Ignore) (Hurt) Who wants water... Puppy... Do you want water? (No no) (My way) (Sniff sniff) [Insignificant] We’re going to attempt the photo zone. Haengwoon~ Come here! Haengwoon, come here. (Don’t want to) [Running starts again] [Taking in Haengwoon] [Proof shot] Success~ I’m really tired. Wow, they’re really heavy. You said you wanted to meet
Bak Woon Gang, how was it? Today... I felt a lot of things. This really isn’t something easy. Is what I felt. They’re that gentle when they’re next to [their] dad. (Gentle) As expected, I only have you.
(Unnie, be strong) (Don’t go...) Ah, she was just passing by. - Look at them just sitting.
- How are they sitting like that? They do that when it’s with dad. [Dad magic] Should I sneak into it? Sit! [Puppies disperse] Geongang, sit! [Bak Woon Gang
assemble at the command of dad] (The only thing remaining are photos) 1, 2, 3. [One moment where she was friendly
with Bak Woon Gang.jpg] Today was fun And I think Daebak, Geongang,
and Haengwoon had fun, too So I’m very proud. Bye~ (Leaving quickly) [A sincere thank you to Colleague 1 and
father who made the time for this^’^] Is it warm? You have to clean it well, with tissues. It’s soft, so it can’t be done cleanly. Scrub harder.
