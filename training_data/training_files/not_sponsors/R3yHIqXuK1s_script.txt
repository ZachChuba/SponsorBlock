hey guys welcome back to my channel so from what I understand this is a song for the fans and it was produced by Nene okey so we love spending talented girl from Anderson oh so this was previewed during their online concert and I haven't seen it like personally haven't paid for the concert that we're actually supposed to come to Paris for during their war tour you know so yeah anyway this is called I'm the trend are no English captions unfortunately but let's just go ahead and say how can you not love this girls when was i recorded vote [Music] pretty recently right because like Susie's hair is short [Music] this is giving me dream though cuz like this is giving me girlfriend vibe [Music] oh so they have references yeah there are references from the past songs [Music] she says howdy cowboy oh my just hearing things this is a type of music video wish it's gonna make you fall in love with a group [Music] hey like Nene has been coming for me though very aggressively this is such a song for concert honestly like I would see it with the whole you know room of fat look at her I want to have her confidence [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's funny cause like it's so different from their past songs but it's awesome it has so many elements from their past songs like it's a very condensed version of everything that I've done is it just like sparkling water oh that was so sweet the end okay like as I said this whole thing just feels very much like it's a condensed version and I can mix version or like mashup let's put it like they like this it's a mash-up of like all of their past songs that are referencing the titles of those songs in this one which is so freaking cool because it's kind of like something about you know their journey so far in the industry and their give gifting this to the fence and that's why it's so meaningful almost I personally didn't know that woody and me could produce like this and I'm impressed honestly I also wonder of the music video was edited by one of the girls or not me I don't know because I've seen some adults doing this nowadays you know like there are editing their own music video when it comes to something like this this makes them look so approachable and like so soui which is quite the opposite from the image that they are usually putting out there during an official comeback they look very fierce they look really hot they look very like where is it powerful and stays you know and here they're really just giving us a different vibe of them and I love this I love this duality that they have I think well I'm like this was a sweet and cute song in music video so yeah thank you enjoyed forget to subscribe to much all I know is you in a next video bye bye
