but a throught you do things in their own time for their own reasons the nomadic horse riding warriors the Dothraki speak to two central questions in Game of Thrones what it means to be truly strong and why it's dangerous to underestimate those who are different from you at many points Game of Thrones is a story of cultural differences all you like from south of the wall the real noir groups clashed not just for territory and power but also for the dominance of their way of life while cultural differences between the Starks and the Lannisters may be more nuanced we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals the Dothraki are the group that draws our attention in the most extreme way to what difference looks like the Dothraki live across the Narrow Sea from Westeros on the continent of Essos roaming crass filled Plains on horseback to the Westerosi this group is the other as foreign as it gets so they're dismissed as inferior savages cough did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates these nomadic warriors speak their own language which is a real language by the way be it throat ribs louder you shouting it from the back of a horse and they don't even have words for many things Westeros e-values you shove us talk evil so excessive in dormitory Jakarta adore me may throne they have customs that Westerosi view is primitive and strange she has to read the whole horn yet we come to see that the characters who write the Dothraki off are making a big mistake pot of mud [ __ ] and twigs best these savages can do these are my people now you shouldn't call them savages while because Daenerys is open-minded enough to learn the Dothraki ways she's empowered by the Dothraki strength so through this group the show is making a larger point about the power we unlock if we accept that other cultures can teach us a thing or two now that the Dothraki have done the unthinkable and crossed the Narrow Sea the Lannisters have seen them deliver on their reputation as fearsome warriors I just sold the Dothraki fight they'll be turning master on me they'll beat any army I've ever seen looking ahead to Season eight the Dothraki pose a fierce problem for Cersei the White Walkers or whoever else stands in the way of Daenerys taking the Iron Throne the Dothraki are coming before we go on we want to talk about click the link in the description below to sign up now the Dothraki values can be summed up in one word strength the Dothraki follow only the strong other communities in the game of thrones world might respect honour bloodline or political game playing but this group is all about physical power and fighting prowess this isn't Westeros where men honor blood here the only honest strength the most distinguished death rocky where long braids as trophies of their victories when Dothraki defeated in combat they cut off their brains or the whole world consuming defeat this is a way of making a person's battle record visible and symbolizes that power in this group is not inherited but earned you next don't want to braid my hair you've no right to a braid you've won no victories yet that power is also not permanent while a king in Westeros can sit on the throne as he grows old and fat if a Dothraki call loses his strength he is no longer call they'll be fighting after Drogo dies well the wins I'd fight will be the new car you won't want any rivals at the start of the series most people across the sea from Essos don't consider these nomads a serious threat even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea Dothraki don't sail every child knows that they don't have discipline they don't have armor they don't have siege weapons but it's telling that King Robert Baratheon does fear them the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea we won't be able to stop them once a legendary warrior Robert sits on the Iron Throne because he was once the strongest man in the Seven Kingdoms so while he may not understand much about being a good king he knows what he's talking about when it comes to the battlefield if she has a son at the head of a Dothraki Army what then and Robert essentially predicts what does happen the wall come in Ned even if he's not around to see it and it's Daenerys who leads the Dothraki Army rather than her son or husband to explain the power of a Dothraki Targaryen Alliance Robert asks Cersei which is the bigger number five or one one army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose the Dothraki are a unified people ripe for a visionary leader to organize them behind a purpose and Robert understands that the Dothraki are uniquely powerful because it's not just that they don't fear battle they have a wholehearted passion for it killing on men wasn't war for them it was sport most armies arrive a cell swarms paid to fight who often refused to die or peasants called up from the fields and hovels how long would those army stand against the charge of a hundred thousand screamers howling for blood as we see in season seven the Lannisters formidable well-trained soldiers are no match for these mighty warriors music off-key that's bull a jewel fittingly Daenerys is journey with the Dothraki is about becoming strong herself do you keep using that usual for when the show begins were dropped with her into this clan totally ignorant of its ways the Dothraki seemed a barbaric obstacle she must endure or escape but Daenerys takes it on herself to understand this culture and through this she is empowered to harness her own strength transforming from victim to Khaleesi learning to talk like a queen not a queen a Khaleesi so long before she ever discovers that fiery Targaryen within her the empowered confident leader we come to know is born through channeling Dothraki strengths those rocky follow strength above all Khaleesi you'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong we might note too that the Dothraki braids stay central to her hairstyle long after season one in contrast to the loose free-flowing massive hair she starts with ultimately this closer is respect for strength takes precedence over everything even their deeply-held traditions well at first they reject the thought of a female leader is your divorce Asura Keisha eventually they do follow Daenerys because she proves her strength while most desert her after Khal Drogo's death a smaller contingent stay with her after she emerges from Drago's funeral pyre unscathed later when she's captured by the Dothraki she sent to join the dashka lean or Council of Crone's the group of former Khaleesi or wives of deceased calls who rule over the Dothraki only city yet again she overcomes the restraints of custom when she burns the calls and her superior strength wins the support of the Dothraki at large in addition to strength Daenerys a story with the Dothraki is about dealing with an other Daenerys is arrogant brother Viserys refuses to understand the group's culture with this it's a gift I had it made for you don't backing rags he spouts empty declarations that he's their King without showing any of the strength which is all the Dothraki respect I won the crown he promised me and insults them through threats to their Khaleesi the sister he still thinks he owns he bought you but he never paid for you tell him I want what was bargained for I'm taking you back all this eventually provokes his own death meanwhile as we've seen Daenerys becomes powerful as she takes care to understand the Dothraki ways but she also makes big mistakes in failing to respect their culture totally there's a dark side to the Dothraki strength as we see when they rape and pillage a village in season one Daenerys is appalled by this violence and puts a stop to it you have a gentle heart this is how it's always been I do not have a gentle heart sir because the Anna she called Drogo Aneesa bell City although not before a great damage was done as the witch Mirri Maz Duur later explains three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl this sequence of events may seem black-and-white as we applaud Daenerys as will to challenge and change inhumane practices but the show eventually uses this plot to reveal complex grey lessons about cultural difference for one thing the reason the Dothraki attacked that village is to obtain slaves to trade for ships to help Daenerys pursue the Iron Throne so she's complicit even though she didn't realize by pushing her husband to help her this is what she was asking for control gavage Amora as africa machine as a froakie bazooka shot I thought he didn't believe in money Gold to hire ships Princess ships to sail to Westeros moreover while she's right to protest violence she seems to take this pillaging incident as a unilateral sign that the Dothraki are primitive and not to be listened to she becomes more and more like her brother in obsessing about the iron throne my brother was a fool I know but she was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms and assuming she knows better even though she's still new to this world easy meeting my sort of fishing me often it's my addiction African hardest studies fishy knock on door see son Shekhar Drogo okay aha finally she ignores their warnings against blood magic hastily agreeing to a ritual to try to save Drogo's life this is blood-magic I am I tell you what is forbidden and this is a mistake that ends up costing her everything show me what I bought with my son's life colorful city little a drone manifest such as these many houses have an animal on their sigil that symbolically expresses their nature but the dothraki XANA Mille is an essential part of their way of life their whole identity as a people is centered on riding horses in fact the word Dothraki means riders if the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback really Dothraki boys learn when they're four years older their God is the great stallion and they call their future leader the stallion who will mount the world a stallion who mounts the world stallion the kyle of cows so the unite the people into a single khalasar when she's pregnant Daenerys has to eat a horses heart to empower her future son hope that wasn't Michaels the Dothraki actually eat horse flesh which they believe makes people strong horses are herd animals and the herd is often led by a stallion just as the Dothraki consist of groups called Calais ours led by a call the Dothraki long braids look like Mane's and the Dothraki embody a kind of wild beauty that horses have they also embody the qualities of power and hard work evoked by expressions like as strong as a horse eat like a horse or being a work horse Equus the word for the horse family comes from the ancient Greek word for quickness and the Dothraki are all about speed on the battlefield which is why they don't wear armor the Dothraki warriors are so comfortable on horseback that they even bring to mind centaurs the creatures in Greek mythology who were half man and half horse essentially the Dothraki are one with their horses the show drives this point home when in a bargain to save Drogo's life Daenerys agrees to let the witch killed robos horse not understanding the which is really planning to take her unborn baby to only death can pay for life this scene makes us feel the horror of the horses death and it feels as if killing the horse would inevitably kill Drogo - who lives you asked for life you paid for life this is not life when will he be as he was without his horse Drogo can't be Drogo nor a col nor even a Dothraki as he is no rider why don't you take a look at your trial then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone it's also significant that while the Dothraki are warriors the animal they honor is a non-violent herbivore that's primarily a functional means of transport this mirrors how the Dothraki don't really have a power lust or desire to rule and subjugate while they take slaves this is only done if they need to trade them for other resources Drogo doesn't understand the Targaryen obsession with the iron throne throne ducati it's only after he sees his beloved khaleesies life threatened that he decides to help defeat her enemies for the sake of their unborn son we can also see the Dothraki spiesse --fill tendencies in the way they forbid bloodshed and weapons in their City Vice doth rack don't let them see you carrying a sword and bias Dothraki you know the law the Dothraki don't have official colors but they are represented with earth tones especially Browns this reflects that these people are deeply connected to the land a traveler on a Dothraki sea will find few villages and no farms because the Dothraki view it is a sin to cut into their mother earth with plows and shovels the Dothraki are nomadic the earth itself is their home the Dothraki never stay still for long Game of Thrones author george RR martin has said that the Dothraki are partially inspired by real-life groups like the Huns the Mongols steppe tribes such as the Magyars and Native American Plains tribes the Dothraki city why is da frag city of the horselords is in the grassland region ironically named the Dothraki sea named not for its waters but for how freely its conquerors roam upon it this grass is one of their greatest resources the Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses grass is known for its hardiness in the face of the elements Gus can survive some of the harshest conditions on earth first and still flourish likewise the Dothraki are tenacious and refused to give up easily the Dothraki are afraid of water they fear any water their horses country so this is another way that they are bound to and completely dependent on the earth in season 3 we see how the Dothraki on Daenerys ship are terribly seasick as if they're hardwired to stay on land the first rocky you have a beam on a ship they followed me we might read this is showing how Daenerys challenges the Dothraki to grow beyond their set ways the Dothraki connection to earth may also make us think of their earthly knowledge they are defined by simple down-to-earth intelligence and traditions that are rigidly passed down sometimes this manifests as a simplistic ignorant view of the larger world not Cova said she sandy softly Vic I own but at other times their traditions hold a wisdom that's far more sophisticated than it seems just listen to Jorah describe this Dothraki prophecy they say and ghost grass with stalks as pages move the glow in the night murders all other grass the Dothraki believe the one day it will cover everything that's the way the world will end though it's in the guise of basic folklore this seems to predict the White Walkers the idea of a dead thing that threatens to overtake the living the Dothraki are also of the earth in that their natural and authentic these people have something wild about them as they act on instinct rather than finding logical solutions to conflict or repressing their hot-blooded emotions during the wedding scene like Daenerys we may be shocked when a fighter UPS resulting in a gruesome death yet the irony is that the Seven Kingdoms are no better if the city Falls these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape beheadings torture and sexual violence are run-of-the-mill in Westeros I was in King's Landing after the sack Khaleesi you know what I saw it's just that this devious behavior is obscured by genteel manners illusions and political facades which somehow make their brutality even more sinister the Dothraki primal behavior is out in the open the Dothraki think outsiders a ridiculous taking shame in the naked body they make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see and we might come to respect the Dothraki openness and honesty which others lack in the books the Dothraki consider it bad luck to touch the body of a slain person that they did not kill themselves and this reminds us of a fundamental tenet of the stark honor a man who passes the sentence should swing the sword so we can see that this culture too underlines the importance of taking responsibility and ownership for your own deeds through the Dothraki we start to think about the way cultural differences defined the larger game of throne story my mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot grim bearded stinking barbarians wrote the narrative data the moment we see how barriers and biases can stop us from getting to know people we might be able to learn from and one of the most fun parts of watching the show is seeing what happens when characters from different corners of its world do come into contact and change each other forever the Dothraki casually reject ideas that are foundational to Westeros society there is no word for thank you in Dothraki the frackie don't believe in money and these facts get us thinking how do you show gratitude if there's no language for it how do you exchange value without a standardized currency so the Dothraki teach us the importance of looking past appearances and appreciating each other's differences think of the origin of the word barbarian it came out of an ancient Greek term meaning babbler and was used to refer to anyone who didn't speak Greek so this words etymology reminds us of how what we call primitive is really just other outside our own culture and Game of Thrones is a story that values Outsiders above all so the lesson the Dothraki teach us is to be open to the unfamiliar and to continue to challenge ourselves to see others views in all their complexity we never know what secret strength this might unleash in us my brother used to say the only thing that does rescue you have to do things better than a boat only only thing that's quite good at killing the better man you don't want to miss this deal so check it out today
