my glasses oh thank you yeah heck heck did I look pretty I'm a pretty boy are you beautiful we're ready let's roll hey everybody hey guys welcome to another episode this time we're doing a very exciting car yes a very slow car because this is my car yes it is the Volkswagen Golf R 29 2019 yeah the 2019 Volkswagen Golf R so you've had this great long now about a week and a half you can yeah week and a half approximately I'm so excited I've never driven a golf of any sorts yeah well no yeah neither did I yeah before I got this and so great I got this and I am absolutely in love with it something you guys probably know about me by now I am a huge hot hatch fanatic my favorite car of all time is the focus RS which I know is overhyped to death but I love it and this one is another one that I really have been looking forward to driving yeah it is really really fun you can be such a lunatic in this I love it I love it has so understated - three two one rough start now start six there 60 yeah just--we're little bouncy ships were bad I kind of I kind of botched it that's all right that's still fun yeah poles I guess it's it's like an element of turbo lag yeah maybe in this valley once it really gets going in the turbo like gets to it it really pulls like it really pulls you back in your seat yeah when you're in the peak of that torque curve it feels really good like it it kind of ramps up to it it's not immediate but yeah which I kind of like it's like oh here it comes you know it's coming yeah it's definitely not an immediate burst of power like you get like in a Tesla example so with that let's talk about the design like I said I understand it understated yes on the outside it's understated but classy yeah I find the one thing that really stands out on this one are the gigantic rims also it has four exhaust pipe yeah it doesn't block on the pack which is kind of ridiculous but I like it all right like it looks great yeah they look sick it's just sporty enough to say that people who know what they're looking for will say oh that's a fast car right you can tell it's sporty when you look at the details so you see like the four exhaust pipes you see the R badging what you have sporty you see the front and like the black accents with the blue colors you can like get hints that this is a sporty car but to the untrained eye if this does kind of feel like a sleeper yeah in a way because it is kind of understated as far as hot hatches go I mean like the the Civic type-r and the for Focus RS and the Subaru WRX all look much more aggressive than this though the door obnoxious yeah this is the least aggressive hot hatch you can buy it's the most like grown-up adult hot hatch which I guess I'm projecting on myself by saying that I'm growing up in an adult yeh yeah sure no I totally agree with that though this one they're a lot more touches of luxury it's not quite so in-your-face like I'm a racer boy but it does sound good though yeah it is quick like this just because it's more grown-up doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's any less fun no it's still a hell of a lot of fun yeah man now let's talk about the the badge on the back what's special about that okay so the badge on the back is pretty cool I think normal Volkswagen badge except surprised it's not because when you punch it you push it and it falls open so like a handle thing and then you pull that to open it that's how you open the hat that's how you open the hatch but that's not the only cool trick it does it's like when you put it in reverse the badge just like pops out and then a camera just pops out out of nowhere I love it that is super in German it is like it needs to be in the middle it needs to be optimally placed but there's a badge there well let's just make the badge a robot it's kind of over-engineered yeah I love it I feel like but it's kind of cool right yeah I wouldn't have guessed that but it's cool to watch like when you're behind the car and you put it in reverse the things you do yeah it's like a little the camera sticks that's a little mini transformer yeah I think that is a very plush very nice interior it feels upscale for the price certainly more than its competitors yeah I feel certainly more than the Focus RS and the Type R and especially the WRX yeah which in my opinion has the worst interior of any of the hot hatches I just find that it's very outdated I think so this is very modern very up-to-date the thing I love the most about it is the pilot like just yes the digital display it feels like you're almost like a pilot you have everything right here it is really cool yes it is similar to out outies version a virtual cockpit yeah can't pronounce things I guess like the inside of this isn't overstated like the outside of the car it's it's very refined it's quiet everything is there's a little bit of gloss black around here which I'm really not a fan I'm not a fee I know I don't like that because you get your prints and some budgie little things on a difference really stand out yeah on the gloss black but most that's just kind of centered around here where you're gonna be doing most of your poking with your fingers but straight other than that you have like kind of cool like faux carbon-fiber accents like this because it looks like carbon fiber or da I'm sporty its sporty yeah but it's not like that really it's not the carbon fiber look that you always see it's a little bit different of a pattern which I appreciate it's like not translate hey I'm carbon fiber right I am a cool sport yeah hey I'm a cool sporty accent what also is cool is has these lights on the side of it yeah you can't really see in daytime but at night time they glow the whoo and you get them on the side of the doors you get them on the foot sills to that stuff so you have like these really really nice like blue accents that match at least with this color that matched the outside that's such a nice touch yeah I mean it's completely unnecessary but I love it but it's cool yeah there's a little bit of hard plastic but most of its soft touch which means there's not gonna be a lot of rattling which I love yeah I hate it when cars rattle yeah same everything feels pretty sturdy and pretty solid yeah you have decent usability with this too like the glove box what box is nice it's lined with fabrics or you know again not gonna rattle you've got SD card slots that's cool oh I didn't even know that yes that is cool actually a bunch of connectors in here that's pretty cool let's see this thing this thing is odd the center console you have to like really pull it yeah it's the probably because there's not a latch there it just it it's open and goes yeah I don't think so kind of cool though with the infotainment screen it's just pretty normal yeah really late it's a touchscreen which is cool pretty responsive it is just half and quit here it's fast oh one of the things I forgot to mention this has an amazing sound system oh yeah inside of this car it is so premium the speakers are by fender and interesting yeah then they're as in like the guitar and speaker manufacturer yes like amplifiers stuff yeah very first impressions very first impressions where's the clutch I'm wondering I'm just the friction point in my car is every manual car is always slightly different only slightly different they're all of them are always just like a little tiny bit different I like the shifts on this though yeah so far I enjoy it I'm just adjusting my seat here a little bit it's not the most precise I felt like in the Lotus yeah that had the most precise shifting I've ever felt in any car but this is like good it's good enough Eco mode comfort mode normal mode and race mode yeah and there's a custom mode which I presume you could make it like a softer steering and stuff we haven't messed with the custom modes because we're just gonna keep it in race right cuz it sounds so good I never took this thing off at race mode yeah I have never taken the thing off of race mode not even one time since getting it yeah at no point I mean you're buying a hot hatch just put it in the sportiest mode it has yeah it does have like bad fuel economy ish when you do that okay so we did that out of this this takes premium gas yeah which is potentially a con and you know which is more expensive and if you're eating it all the time it's gonna kill your fuel driving me I looked I looked at my fuel economy ratings and I've averaged about 19 mpg in this which isn't that great but that's because like I Drive it hard and that's just if you wanted to drive it like a normal person put it in the Eco mode and just commute to working back and be respectful of your car yes so if you are a respectable member of society on like myself and you put this into eco mode this actually gets pretty good mpg it gets 30 mpg city and 40 highway that's originally solvent that kills the the RS yeah like this is I would argue this is definitely more practical than the ARCA oh absolutely yeah absolutely the more practical choice so this car this car costs brand-new thirty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars compared to compared to rivals it's pretty competitively priced yeah they're all around the same racer they're all generally around that because the Ford Focus RS is about 42 which is base like this fully specked out 2018 limited edition yeah that one's about 42,000 yeah just a little more than this the Civic Type R is about 35 yeah right and the Subaru WRX is it's probably it's like I think it's up around 36 say yeah thirty six and seven I think it's yeah in the 36 or 37 range for a WRX it's really just personal pronoun alright honestly like do you want to be like the ultimate boy racer and make a statement then you want probably the iPod perfect Ibar yeah something they can do more or like offer a rally racing maybe probably maybe more the WRX if you want something that's like the fastest and the craziest of all of them was the greatest exhaust yeah you do the RS and if you want something that's more like daily drivable but still fun this one which is the nice thing about hot hatches is like they're really fun you can go out and almost have like a sports car experience and there are a lot of people who are gonna say oh it's not a real sports car it's like no of course it's not a real sports car but it's not the best possible hatchback you can buy out of the line it's it's the best possible like if you're limited on space well if you're limited on space limited on parking and you need something that is practical but you can also take out and just have like a fry it in hot hatches are definitely the way to get a good bang for your buck because you're less expensive than sports cars they're more practical than sports cars you're not gonna get as many tickets right they sound great they're fun I love I love hatchback I think they're my favorite kind of car I've converted I'm a big fan after driving this also wagons supply caches and wagons which we'll do eventually yeah we're practicality will always hot wagons hot wagons I forgot to mention the shifter is like in the shape of a golf ball oh because big as it's a golf which I like I think that's kind of a cool touch that's the extent of German humor and with that I've said I was rated all right yeah let's get into the ratings okay so first off its performance which pretty good it's pretty good yeah I mean arguably like if you're competent unlike us maybe in the automatic of 4.5 seconds they're 260 time I believe that you can get that in the automatic sure I think in this it's more like closer to 5 it's closer to 5 to 5 and a half seconds yeah still fun handling it's incredible the overdrive system on this is great could be a teensy bit faster I'd say probably gonna give us six on performance for me this car is it does exactly what it's built to do which is throw you around corners and a high rate of speed and let you have fun doing it and not be scared right I wish this person wasn't in front of me so I could prove it but I think I'm gonna give it yeah I'm gonna give it a six as well I'm gonna give it higher for fun factor than I will for perform the performance see yeah I think I'd probably agree with that once we get to that point yeah in terms of practicality surprisingly good yeah very calm you know you can fold the back seats down and have plenty of space to haul stuff like I Drive around with my bicycle and this yeah and just thrown in the back and it fits fine and cup holders and cup holders can't forget that I'm gonna give it a seven yeah on practicality it's like fits quite good I'm gonna give it a seven and a half all right I think it's excellent I mean it's got all the connectors you would ever need you've got all the music stuff apple carplay Android oh that's true does house backwards no I got that round it does have all that yeah then a fun factor where I think it's probably gonna score the highest on both of us because I think this is a blast yeah I'm gonna go to seven and a half yeah I don't think I'm I'm gonna go with a seven yeah on it next up is the cool factor which the thing it is probably gonna be pretty low yeah it's a cool car for the hot hatch people like hot hatch people know this car and they love it because it's a great car it's a great hatch but just looking at it it's a regular gold a regular gold this looks just like a completely average of regular golf which for somebody like me I like because I don't like having like a ton of attention you can fly under the radar on this yes you can drive fast and have a lot of fun in this and not attract much attention which for me is a plus oh yeah I would put the cool factor really high I don't know maybe uh I think it's cool I didn't everyone else's I do too it's just if you were I'm gonna go to four yeah people with the cell line up against other cars yeah I think you're right honestly I'm gonna go to four it's not that cool nice quality is next pretty good I think it's actually quite high yet value for the money like we said this has the best quality in both of our opinions of any of the hot hatches yeah it beats the competition for sure yeah so I'm gonna give it a six six yeah yeah I think I'd agree with you actually six German cars just have great interiors and then the last one is value which I think it's pretty good I think it's pretty reasonable yeah again like for the price forty thousand basically I think I have to go with a seven on value person I think it's a very good value for money yeah I think I'm gonna go even a little bit higher I'm gonna give it a seven point five all right I think this is a fantastic value I I would agree yeah it's definitely a fabulous value on this yeah and then with the power of math the total score is 38 that's pretty good out of 60 yeah and again I think that's largely due to the higher scores in both practicality and the cool stuff yeah like the performance I think this car strikes a good balance between those two yeah I do too it's it's a great balance between usability and fun yeah probably the best balance between that that we've driven I think so I think it's even better than the model three in that sense yeah which is why I got this over a model three so after driving this I'm really excited to drive an RS so we can put the two head-to-head finally and just see what the differences are we a little bit more fine you know the other ones probably gonna be a little bit more brutal so stick around I'm sure we will do that one fairly shortly as soon as we can get our hands on one yeah but and all the other hot hatches all the other hot hatches we gonna do every single one stick around thanks for watching see you guys [Music] a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
