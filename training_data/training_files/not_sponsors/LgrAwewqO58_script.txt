hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with cherry chocolate loaf that's right I am very proud of our banana
bread recipe which is why I adapted it for this amazing cherry chocolate look
and while cherries of course aren't anything like bananas this really did
work out extremely well and if you're wondering why I called it cherry
chocolate loaf instead of cherry chocolate bread I'm not sure for
whatever reason it just seemed like more of a loaf but anyway speaking of loafing
let's finish this intro and get started by prepping our cherries and hopefully
for this you're gonna find yourself a couple cups of fresh cherries although
if they're still not in season can use frozen for this but if are using
fresh will have to pit them which is super easy if have one of these
Pitters and if don't just Google pitting cherries there's all kinds of
very cool tricks for that but anyway if see one cherry pitted you've seen
them all so let me skip ahead to when I was done and like I said we're gonna
need about 2 cups of these and then besides the chairs we're gonna need to
mix up our dry ingredients which will include some all-purpose flour a little
bit of salt some baking powder and baking soda and raise your hand if you
incorrectly guess Cayenne I knew it but not today and as usual we'll go
ahead and give that a quick mix with a whisk to make sure everything is evenly
combined at which point we'll set that aside and
move on to our wet ingredients before those we'll start by creaming a stick of
butter with a little touch of sugar using a spatula and what we'll want to
do is smear and smash that until it's very light and creamy and this task is
8,000 times easier if your butter is nice and soft which for a change mine
was and speaking of easier yes of course can do this with an electric mixer
but doing it that way are not going to get your heart rate up unless of
course your tie gets caught in the attachment so I like to do this manually
and then what we'll do once our butter and sugar have been successfully cream
is go ahead and whisk in two eggs but definitely one at a time okay there's
nothing butter hates more than having liquid emulsified into it so if we added
both eggs at once the mixture would basically separate and it would take a
very long time for it to finally come together but if we get one emulsified in
first then it's a lot easier to whisk in the second one
and this will also be a lot easier with an electric mixer but an electric mixer
does not build character oh and a little tip room-temperature eggs will mix in
easier than cold eggs since cold eggs will make that butter stiffen up and
then what we'll do once both eggs have been incorporated and our mixture is
beautifully smooth and creamy and light we will completely rock that by adding
some yogurt and a little bit of vanilla extract and by record I don't mean
taste-wise those things are gonna taste good but I
mean wreck it visually okay can only emulsify a certain amount of liquid in a
stick of butter and two eggs is just about how much so when stir this and
it's gonna kind of look separated and sort of granular but do not be alarmed
looks to the contrary everything is fine and you'll see once all the ingredients
are added we're gonna have a gorgeous looking smooth batter and then what
we'll do once that set is go ahead and add our cherries after we chopped them
which I like to do by pulsing on and off in a food processor but if want you
can also do those on a cutting board with a knife although if do it in a
food processor do preserve all the juices but either way will work so you
pick I mean guys are after all the drew carey's of how to chop your
cherries but either way what want is something fairly coarse and then once
those are done we'll go had an Adam in along with about a half a cup of
coarsely chopped chocolate or if want dark chocolate chips are fine but I
think these hand-cut chunks and shards look a little nicer in the loaf and
that's it we'll give that a quick stir with our spatula before adding our dry
ingredients and it was right about here when I realize I'd forgotten to add my
chopped walnuts which was kind of surprising since they were like 18
inches away but these things will happen which is why whenever you're stirring
something I always try to remember what forgot so I stirred those in as well
and yes this does not look good but don't worry as horrible as that looks as
soon as we stir in our dry ingredients which is what we're doing next this is
all gonna come together into a beautifully smooth batter
as will see so we'll go ahead and add our flour mixture in and stir it in
with our spatula and as usual we will only mix this until the flour just
disappears and then we will stop because our batter will be done and would it
wreck it if stirred it longer than that
not really unless did it for a long time but it's more of a question of why
do steer something that doesn't need it and then what will do once we're
looking at a beautifully formed batter in our bowl let's go ahead and transfer
that into a lightly buttered loaf pan and as we do that we want to make sure
we're pushing that batter down into the corners with our spatula as well as of
course even out the top and that's it we'll go ahead and give that a little
shake and then the old habit app' before we transfer it into the center of
a 350 degree oven for about an hour or so or until it's nicely browned and
looks like this which definitely looks like it's done but we got to make sure
so we'll go ahead and poke a toothpick into the center and if it comes out
clean your loaf is done and minded and then what we'll do is let this sit in
the pan cooling for about 15 minutes before we very carefully remove it and
place it on a rack where we will let it cool completely before we slice it in
service and yes can actually let it cool all the way in the pan but not if
you're gonna do what I'm gonna do next and that would be to apply nice thin
icing to the top while this is still warm and to make this kind of icing all
have to do is take some powdered sugar and stir in enough milk until you
achieve something with a consistency of a thin pancake batter and then we'll go
ahead and drizzle and brush that over the top and the reason we want to do
this on a rack and not in the pan so that we get those super sexy drips going
down the side oh yeah it's a proven scientific fact
that when it comes to icing people love drips and can blame them I mean look
at that so we'll go ahead and glaze that as
shown and then once that's been iced like I said we'll let that cool all the
way down and by the time that loaf is room temp that icing will be dry to the
touch at which point it is ready to serve up so let me take a knife and
slice it in to see how we did and know what it looks like we did pretty
good and I don't know about but for me there are very few combinations that
go together better than cherry and chocolate which is just one of the
reasons I enjoyed this so much okay it's a child one of my all-time favorite
sweets were those cherry cordials that whole cherry and syrup covered in crispy
dark chocolate man I love those things and above and beyond the cherry and
chocolate I'm also a big fan of fruit nuts
and those walnuts I almost forgot and adduced the right amount of crunch with
everything being held together in a beautifully moist not too dense textured
loaf so I really did love everything about this and I should have known that
anything based off our banana bread recipe was bound to be amazing and I was
kind of thinking of branding this as a breakfast or brunch item but it would
definitely also work as a dessert and just to make sure I'm gonna have it both
ways but no matter when enjoy yours I really do hope give this a try
