the floor it's pretty important how far could you make it in rust without touching it could you keep up with others and make it to end game i set out to attempt my most ambitious challenge yet this would require a lot of determination to get anywhere but that was the point before we get started let me explain the challenge a bit more what can i not touch sand grass snow roads and basically any floor that was ground level what can i touch rocks protruding from the ground driftwood any deployed items such as sleeping bags or boxes player made structures like foundations any floors at monuments which were above or below ground level and the ocean as long as it was deep enough to swim no running along the shore if i touch the ground i have to kill and console [Music] i allowed myself three freebies for the entire wipe if i accidentally touched the floor [Music] i would be able to hop back onto my platform without dying i would have to use them very wisely i played an entire wipe this way 30 hours of footage and i streamed all stuff like this happen live before we anyways let's see how it went the hardest part about this is going to be getting off the beach because i'm going to have to wait until i get a spawn where there is uh firewood and then i can get to that i can make a building plan and i can build triangle foundations to a tree it's going to be pretty crazy guys so stay tuned okay oh cc that's the we're looking for because if we can get a spawn like next to that or like next to some rocks that lead to it we're good this was probably short-sighted but after countless terrible spawns i decided to use one of my freebies to get onto this driftwood as i just barely missed it at this point in the challenge i didn't expect it to last a week but that meant i only had two more freebies i gathered some wood and built my way over to get some more so this is gonna be our life you know we're gonna leave a little trail wherever we go [Music] then i built some trees to gather more [Music] for now wood was how i would be getting around so i would need a lot of it now the problem is every time i die like unless i can get a bag down in a little base it's going to be such a show to do this all again so i'm hoping we can stay alive dude i don't know about that i'm not gonna risk that okay here we go this node is big so i think i'm gonna build a forward operating base here although i'll need a bag first so at least like if i die it won't be completely reset and we'll just leave some wood in there in order to make a base i would need a sleeping bag so i set out to find some more cloth i'm risking it all for this handplane [Music] but yeah for like raiding people or even going their bases i'm gonna need to get a horse first so i'm gonna need to take care of my horse because that's going to be my key to monuments and and a lot of things [ __ ] if you guys see a hemp you let me know let's check what's in that box [Music] i didn't think about just how much wood it would take to get around but this is very expensive hopefully we can spot a hemp [Music] alright we'll get this base down and then we'll work on getting 60 cloth for two uh two sleeping bags and then we can just use those to get around using foundations was pricey so i decided to use sleeping bags to get around without durability the sleeping bags could be picked up and placed forever but i would need 60 cloth i built my base although not much this guaranteed that i would not have to start over on the beach again okay so this is going to be my little security stash as long as i have a building plant and some wood in here you know anytime i spawn back i won't have to be on the beach [Music] i had secured a base before nightfall that night i met someone hey man how you doing what's up eddie what what's up you don't have a microphone no no mike well uh you know you better be careful the floor is lava man better not touch it might hurt yourself oh [ __ ] dude what wait you're not dying i thought the floor was uh he did he did die damn i decided to put his body to use hey it was worth it we got a enough for a bone knife oh man i'm about to kill over yo eddie what's up you're back i just got done harvesting you man how you doing what hey what's up why are you looking at me like that is something weird why you flashing lights at me man oh i don't want to kill eddie but i need that eddie hey help help thanks eddie appreciate it man i'm gonna go uh put this away real quick hey eddie i'm about to be really sick man eddie i'm not doing too hot i don't feel too good eddie what what are you looking at me like that for you give me top you give me sloppy toppy yeah damn thanks eddie all right well i gotta go find some hemp i can't have your help though okay i can't help i can have you have you helping me out you know this is a solo journey now my goal was to get 60 cloth in order to make my sleeping bag strategy possible oh i see a hemp i think that's a habit oh there's another one damn [Applause] [Music] nice let's go depot there [Music] oh man there's hemp over there but i can't cross the road [Music] come on i want that help in order to cross the road i would need to build all the way around the monument in other words roads were a massive hindrance to my progress oh i should get that junk pile that might be good [Music] no it's not i gathered my first components and headed back home [Music] i could now travel freely without expending wood oh my god is this guy building a house over here hey what are you doing what's going on in here man oh let me in no dude stop closing it now there's no door what are you gonna do i'm sorry i'll put the door back okay now let's try this bag strap one thing i immediately noticed was that this bag strategy was very slow it would easily take me 10 minutes to traverse a single square although cheap this would not be sustainable if i wish to stay sane hopefully if someone attacks me i can just slap them down so that i don't lose them and i can just respawn and keep going from where i left off and the back grind is so much slower but i guess it's what we have to do if we can get a damn horse our problems will be over so i'm hoping the reason i'm going up here is i'm trying to get to the top of this hill so that i can look over the valley and maybe find a horse shortly after this discovery i ran into my first enemy okay guys guys hold on hold on guys please it's like minecraft when you're [ __ ] oh [ __ ] see i got the bags down those are the most important things so you know it is what it is and i doubt they're gonna take a whole lot of that because it's not like i had much [Music] oh you gotta be kidding me dude everything the hemp seeds even as soon as i find a horse though it's gonna be really nice i gotta build up my house and keep them safe though because i'm gonna need them yo is that a pool we gotta go check out the pool i built my way over to the pool it would be a vantage point to potentially spot a horse i also found some cloth nearby let's see if we can i don't think we can get that hemp sadly hey you hey can you come over here can you stand against that wall [Music] yeah like that thanks man you're doing god's work there was no horse in sight so i began the long trek home but i messed up oh [ __ ] i touched the floor [Music] hey what are you doing in here yeah you getting loot got a lot of loot in here man damn good [ __ ] eddie you're passing me isn't this where i died i recovered the loot and headed back home hey [Music] gotta give eddie a visit when we pass i decided to head over to the lighthouse to potentially get some materials but then i saw a geared player running towards me okay oh there's a geared guy over there i'm gonna hide behind this bush okay please man please i just have a spear can we can we be cool yeah we could be cool okay thanks man i know no no it's okay are you santa sir you're not supposed to realize that oh i didn't something i didn't say to who hey thanks chris just came early surprisingly he ended up being friendly anyways i headed to the lighthouse and built over i was able to build into deep enough water to swim meaning i could freely access the lighthouse and being completely above ground the lighthouse was within the rules to explore there wasn't a ton but it was something if we can like find a rock to stand on am i on the rock yeah here we go although only two squares from base getting their back was no easy task especially at night oh no my torch is about to snap oh [ __ ] dude this is a nightmare i can't even i don't know what i'm supposed to do i'm standing on this rock if i move i'm done for you could make another torch oh you're right i think i have the there we go okay let's attempt to go home by morning i was almost there but then i screwed up i bought oh [ __ ] damn it and as i was heading back oh i screwed up again everybody certified bra moment wait a minute there's the lighthouse i just said if i just kept walking we'll come back at least we know where boats are now hey i'm dying over here but this random spawn gave me an important discovery a nearby boat this was recorded before the addition of the fishing villages so randomly spawned boats would be a vital part of my strategy anyways i spawned back and started on the way home once again and i ran out of wood i didn't have any wood i needed to be more careful and you better not touch my stuff man luckily my body was just outside get away from there anyways i farm some more wood but then messed up again oh my god dude and then i met some characters hey what's up g bro i was standing here for like 20 seconds i'm not gonna hurt you you're dumbass took too long to see me oh where you gonna shoot me you're gonna shoot the guy in the kiddie pool i'm just trying to swim man come on guys look i'm just i'm just waiting in the in the kiddie pool you know i gotta do it dude dude i'm look at me look take this take the rock and the torch just take it from me i just want to swim in the kiddie pool that's it guys guys please i just want to swim anyways i was not able to get to my body because i only had enough wood to make one foundation and there was only one tree nearby if i didn't get this wood i would not have many options damn it okay you know what we're gonna have to see if we can get to this tree here we go no please don't farm that tree eddie that's my only tree come on help me out i only have one foundation to spare here oh no oh geez i would have to jump on eddie's head okay this is quite the dilemma hey eddie can you come here can you stand against the tree this would require a lot of skill and determination yeah just stay like that oh god oh god eddie eddie [Music] all right thanks i farmed the tree and recovered my body once again can we get a pog for that for the for the head hopping took my low grade and headed to the boat first i would need some food for the ride come on dude give me the i'm risking it all for this pumpkin i realized the time cutting discovered using a boat i could scour the beaches of the map in search of a horse covering far more land than i ever could on foot i gathered some fuel and components at sea and then refine the oil at the hardware i can probably do that then i can use this i headed back out and upgraded my boat but then i made a misstep oh [ __ ] i had left my boat running and touched the ground for a split second being my first day i was hesitant to use another one of my three freebies this early however dying here would cost upwards of two hours of work so it seemed worth it that being said i only had one left to use for the rest of the week is that a horse oh my god it's another pig there's like eight pigs here dude keep your eyes peeled for a horse i made it to literally the opposite end of the map when i finally found a horse and he was close to the beach too oh oh my god ladies and gentlemen we've done it two horses actually pick which one we want this was huge for me although not a fast horse he would solve many of my problems i then made a pit stop at the river to get my horse some lunch [Music] it was now time to make the long trek home this is gonna hopefully we don't die on the way home i collected all of the crates i found along the road on the way home i passed some clan bases and kept gathering components if i made it home this would be huge whatever we'll come back oh [ __ ] then i ran into some people oh come on i quickly got out of there and somehow left unscathed i think we made it away holy sh why didn't that guy shoot me you know what i think i should just recycle while i'm here i was nearly home when i decided to stop to recycle most of these components were useless to me it was the raw resources which they could be turned into that i needed while i was recycling i heard footsteps i'm just dipping i don't even care i did not want to risk dying but then i realized i left behind the metal fragments oh my god i left the metal [ __ ] dude i need the metal that's like the most important thing i headed back into battle i needed that medal then i saw that he had a bow so i got out of there it wasn't worth losing the horse over eventually i made it home the first order of business would be to build a horse base but then i heard footsteps i had new neighbors and these ones weren't friendly i needed to get this base down to protect my horse okay you know what i need to just hide for now i'm hoping he does not steal my horse he will have no idea how much damage that does to me hey guys can we maybe talk this out if we're going to be neighbors they saw me building and began camping outside i could only wait inside and hope they leave the horse they were not open for negotiation so i decided to fight here's my chance oh no he's helping his friend up [ __ ] no no no no no damn it [Music] god damn it i died once again and i had a five minute timer all i could do was sit on the beach and pray for my horse all right uh i spawned back and things seemed quiet so that's cool oh my dude what what are you doing he is still out here they were still camping the door dude can we just talk this out i don't even have that much loot you took my only bow i gotta i don't even have a spear anymore i've got a hammer i've got a key lock like dude please got me a break man i was straight up with them but they let their bullets do the talking after a long wait the door campers had left i checked on my horse come on horse please please please oh it's still there oh hell yeah i needed to make this horse base quick okay so this is where my horse will stay the base was ready for the horse i just needed to get him inside it's cramped but it will do but then i heard more footsteps they were back dude you guys are back already i don't think they know about the horse i think i hit him i waited a while and tried to go out but they were still there after another long wait the coast seemed like they're just having fun with me now playing around you what do what dude please please i'm begging you and then i heard a sound which haunts me to this day why are they picking on me i'm gonna get both no no no no no no please please no my horse they got the horse no dude that was like two hours of work no oh jeez as i mourned the loss of my horse the door campers came back i let them have me just do it just shoot me do it just do it man you gotta be kidding me can only go up from here everybody after about five hours i had made minimal progress i felt defeated but the fight was not over i was just getting started my second day started with some bear sightings yo what's that bear doing though he'd be kind of moonwalking sorry moon walking bear but you your time is up if i got two bears i would have fuel for the week oh [ __ ] i'm out of arrows you gotta be kidding me but i ran out of arrows and was one short of killing the first one he ran off there was another though so i made preparations to kill him i farmed some wood made some arrows and started on my way over oh you have to be [ __ ] kidding i shot 20 arrows into this bear and he did not die again how do i make this mistake twice it was some sort of glitch or maybe he was just a really strong bear but i headed inside to get more arrows and then headed back oh now he's moving yeah he's [ __ ] i killed the bear but now i needed to figure out how to get to him by the way i made this song if you want to hear more of my stuff my soundcloud is linked below so we can jump from that campfire to that rock from that rock to that rock and maybe we can like hit us oh and then the bear despawned just like that right in front of me i was not off to a strong start today you gotta be kidding me come on dude [ __ ] the one bear [ __ ] ran the other one we're 20 minutes in we can't even [ __ ] get a bear that sucks that really sucks i don't even get my arrows back i needed to get a horse which meant i needed a boat which meant i needed fuel so i set out in search of some oil [Music] barrels i found barrels but none of them with oil [Music] come on oil barrel nothing i headed home on my bridge of twig i came up with a new plan to acquire fuel swimming out into the ocean i got my flippers and diving mask and headed out to the beach as long as i stayed in deep enough water to swim i was good to go very quickly i realized i was going to freeze so i waited by the fire at lighthouse i even found an oil barrel there it wasn't much fuel but it was something i headed out in the morning there was a sandbar so i built the cross and then i headed out into the water in search of fuel i noticed a boat on the beach which i could steal i have eight fuel to make this work so i got the boat although this thing burned fuel fast hopefully one of these trash piles has a has some fuel on it i would need to find more fuel soon none of the nearby junk piles had any and sure enough the boat ran out in the middle of the ocean so i swam to the nearest barrel got the fuel and swam back to the boat i collected some more and then headed into the harbor to refine the crude oil trimming of the harbor floor was slightly above ground level so i was just barely able to reach the refinery i ran out of wood though if i could use the nearby recycler i would be able to get more i was also able to use the recycler from my boat i recycled the ladder into wood but then i spotted some more oil barrels it would not be easy to get to but it might be possible i docked my boat on the other side i was on a mission to get those damn barrels i think i can get on these tires i know i can stand on this border actually because it's technically not ground level i did it i refined all of the oil and set out to find a horse i had enough fuel to go for a long time now let's get the hell out of here so we got 300 fuel we better find a horse so i searched i had to stop at a river for some food and search some more and eventually i found a horse [Music] on the way home i encountered something which would pose a threat to the parameters of this challenge while attempting to ride my horse into the gas station i was kicked off forcing me to touch the ground this made me realize that there must be exceptions made where horses cannot go while the gas station is by no means a vital monument to my progression this issue would present itself elsewhere for example at the train yard in order to activate the keycard rooms i would need to access this building through this door and while riding a horse i would be kicked off this issue would present itself in countless other situations as well for that reason i decided that these instances would not count against me as they were necessary for progression i would simply get off the horse walk through the doorway and get back on it anyways back to the video i was innocently feeding my horse when i saw a player i want it oh oh [ __ ] and like that another two hours of work was gone we spent two hours venturing out we found a we found a boat we found a horse we almost did it but our attempt was not good enough but that's okay because sometimes you lose you can't win at all i stand at the foot of a giant at the man who tells me you can't play rust without not touching the floor what are you crazy you gotta be out of your mind i stand i stand at the giant's feet and i spit on them and i say i say suck my nuts you can call me a lot of things but a quitter is not one of them while this concludes part one of the series
