Earth is a complicated place. There is a lot of us that share this planet together. And it is sometimes difficult to understand who everybody is, and what everybody believes. To understand things a little better, let's shrink the entire world population down from 7.5 billion people, all the way down to just 100 people and keep our small, one hundred person society as similar to the real world as possible Dividing between gender, the one hundred person world would be equally divided between fifty men and fifty women. Most of these people would live in Asia, a total of 59 people compared to sixteen people living in Africa, ten living in Europe, eight in North America, only six in South America and just one, lonely person living in Australia and Oceania Nineteen of these people would be Chinese citizens, and another eighteen would be Indians There would be only 4 Americans, 3 Brazilians, 2 Russians, and one German. The other 53 people would be citizens of 187 other countries around the world Most of these people would be pretty young, with 9 people aged just between 0-4 years old 17 people would be aged between 5 and 14 years old, and 16 people would be aged between 15 and 24 years old
