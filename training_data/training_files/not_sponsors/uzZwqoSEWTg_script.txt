hi in this video I'm going to show you how I make my time-lapse photography let's go hi I'm Adam and welcome to first man photography before we get into with Squarespace so time-lapse photography is a really brilliant way of adding something to the story you're trying to tell it condenses a large period down into a very small amount of time to really move Lea story along and cram a lot in to that short clip it's a really effective way of doing transitions and it's just going to add a lot to your project whether you're doing video or even if you're just doing stills because having those moving pictures in your portfolio as a photographer it can really still add a lot of interest so I'm going to show you how I create my time lapses but you can pretty much do it with any camera these days and there's two ways of doing it you can either condense a video file down into a short amount of time or the way I prefer is to capture a series of stills and then stitch them together later on into a video clip most cameras these days will have a built in time-lapse mode your phone will have one as well and that just does the stitching for you and creates a video file at the end I prefer to do it manually because then you've got the full post-processing control over those image files and you can have the video looking exactly as you please you can't post processed video in the same way so you don't have as much control by doing the still images you also get the big 4k files or as big as you camera sense will allow it also means you can then zoom in on that time lapse as well adding that extra element of interest so what gear do we need well firstly obviously you're going to need a camera I normally use the 5d map for that I'm filming on right now but sometimes I will use my vlogging camera which is the 800 D of the t-seven I depending which way you look at it but the second thing you're gonna need is a tripod this one is on the gorilla pod here I've got the other one on the Manfrotto tripod or you can use something a little bit like this that you just swat your iPhone into as well small gorilla pod big gorilla pod really doesn't matter what tripod you're using if you do like me and you're gonna capture the single still images you're also going to need some kind of way of firing the camera and we call the device to do that an intervalometer this Canon 5d Mark 4 has that built in like a lot of the new Canon cameras otherwise you're going to need an intervalometer all that is is just a very cheap piece of gear that looks like that that you plug into the camera you can get them for all different types of camera at dslr's mirrorless that type of thing and then you just set the number of shots you want on here and this will fire the camera over a period of time for you very cheap I'll put a link down below to the one I use ok next it comes to actually shooting the time-lapse and you need to be in manual mode on your camera because you don't want the exposure changing throughout the shot the scenes gonna change and the light in the scene is going to change but your exposure needs to stay the same next we need to decide what intervals were going to have and that'll depend on what you're shooting and how long the total clip is that you're going to create I use the same recipe for every single time ups I do and I've put three second intervals in between the shots I shoot for 10 minutes that creates about 200 shots and then I'm working at 25 frames a second with my video so that's create an 8 second clip that might not seem like a lot but it's more than adequate for most of my video projects and then I'm ready to put the images into the computer and use Lightroom and Photoshop to post-processor so we're going to do that now let's get into the computer okay so here we are into Lightroom and I have all my images in the grid view here you actually only need to edit one image and then we synchronize the rest and this is the image that I've already edited for the sake of time on the tutorial but if you go into the develop module make all your normal changes and then you can just preview them with a little slash burn here and as you can see I've not made massive differences to that just increase the color a bit increase the shadows a bit to pull out some of that detail if your time lapse is going to be for a sunrise or a sunset you want to think about the fact that the the light's going to change quite a lot through the time lapse here as you can see I purposely underexposed the image because I know it's gonna get much brighter if we go back to the grid view we can see from the first thing to the second image it goes from being underexposed to pretty much being overexposed on that last image because I'm shooting straight at the Sun and if you look at the ones in the middle they're quite nicely exposed so you want to sort of aim for somewhere in the middle so you get that nice smooth natural feeling to your time-lapse as a Sun is rising or the Sun is setting so once we've developed our image and edited it you also need to crop it down to sixteen by nine and you just do that by hitting our put your crop in make sure you've got your composition right and then hit return and crop that down to sixteen by nine which is your video aspect ratio then just go back into the grid view select the first image scroll all the way down to the bottom hold shift down and select the last image then just click sync settings and it brings up this synchronised setting box you can pretty much select all of them for this and then just click synchronize and it will add that edit to all of the images and make it smooth and consistent throughout it takes a little while for the thumbnails to update but they are now synced so you can just go ahead and click control a because we don't want to we want to export these as JPEGs that don't want to be working with the raw file so I'm just gonna export the JPEGs that we're then gonna put into Photoshop so I'm just gonna right click and go to export and I just I do when I'm exporting them is make sure they have a sequential file number because when you're putting them into Photoshop it needs that to combine them so I've just got that a set up as a preset with my resolution I've got it there as a 4k resolution that lets me either put them straight into a 4k film or if I'm using 1080 which I do normally it then lets me zoom in on that time-lapse just adding that extra element of movement movements so just go ahead export them to JPEG choose where you're gonna do it I've already exported them so I'm not gonna go through that again it'll take probably about 20 minutes to explore them out 200 images and then once you've done that we can move into Photoshop so straight over into Photoshop and in order to get this to work you need to go into file and then click open select the folder where you've stored the jeep the JPEGs and then scroll down to the first one so for me that is haami Hill time oops 101 click on that and then click options and click image sequence and that just is telling Photoshop that the good all part of the same time apps it will come up with a frame rate - 25 frames per second as I said earlier click OK and then it opens up the time lapse for you if you go to window and click on timeline it will open the video timeline at the bottom you can then click Play here to start previewing it it has to render it first first that's a good way to preview it I don't bother though I just go straight into file and then go to export and click render video it comes up with this screen you can see the settings I'm using there make sure it's a 4k if that's what you want so it's a place to save it and then just click render and it'll take a couple of minutes to render that video out and that's pretty much it once you've done that you're ready to do something with that okay so that's created your time-lapse clip now you just need to do something interesting with it you could put it on its own or you probably want to add it to your story or your video as a whole to really add something to that I put together a little two-minute video for the end of this one that just gives you an example how you can mix it in to lots of different things put some good music to it and create a nice little interesting video to engage your audience so stick around to the end to see that but please do leave a comment down below and let me know what you think have you tried it have you had trouble with your time lapses put it down in the comments and we'll see what we can do to help you out please do subscribe to the channel as well if you haven't done this already hit that notification bell so you don't miss any of my videos also this video is first purchase stick around till the end for that video but I'm also going to be putting out the second video this week about hyper lapses slightly different to time lapses actually a lot easier so check out that short video they'll be coming out on Wednesday I'm Adam this is first man photography in the studio [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
