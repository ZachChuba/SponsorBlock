I'm gonna have to skip a lot like a lot okay there's a 15 second level it can't be that word you killed you can't I forgot that I have to like worry about live them no let me see what the rest of love looks like that's it that's all I gotta do is the easy super extra level whole time no I have lick my balls syndrome you gave note that is either the practice practice survival section or a dodge everything button hey it's me I'm journey oh I get such an easy level only the clear condition makes it kind of hard [Music] it's a bad start it was a that's called warming up like you think you can just come out of the gate on fire every time I don't have enough water in me I'm probably gonna start over again let's be real but uh you know I want to check out the level I've never seen it heard lots of great things about them lots of really exciting things about these have you guys can see my high score right now is for though that's for no skips for going for 100 with skips could be pretty easy [Music] ah you guys see me hit that but it didn't count I'm not playing a little trick that ever again I gotta lower my goal I can't lower my goal you see you unlock a cosmetic item for a hundred it's got to be a hundred my goal has to be 100 if I want to if I want to unlock everything in the game that was oh one bro wife and it all right time to really start one good practice this can't be a hard level this cannot be a hard level cuz I pick super expert [Music] working seconds just suspiciously low I got a I got at least look for the best [Music] that was an easy level for little babies tiny little babies play that 1 2 minutes and 52 seconds well hold on just because it's long doesn't mean it's hard it might be hard because it's long are you kidding me no what is that what I'm so bad dungeon with optional boss but that optional boss probably has three bro lives I see the three bro lives dude there there I didn't even see that oh my god I was so immersed in the experience I literally didn't even see the spike I did not see its concept that was warm-up now I understand the thing doesn't have anything to do with me I'll do my thing I feel like he had a perfect game going mr. level dude and then you throwing these total boobs no way they could exist in this reality oh my god but this level turns into gotta keep moving forward [Music] you've [ __ ] sharp-toothed ah [ __ ] where's my power up the fireball unfortunate fireball really trapped me here what I yelled was sigh but what was in my heart was uh my dick in balls Bowser but I couldn't get it all out because I was so afraid I can most certainly just go over eight oh that's nice a little unfortunate okay I gotta find that switch to rictus maybe it's just right here oh man hey I see the game plan okay free level free one up [Music] [Applause] [Music] chips but [Music] [Music] one more time [Music] that was a great great great great use of one of my life good good thing I tried that one more time I feel like I'm not properly motivated I feel like I have too many lives but I believe in a world four-minute level but I believe in a world where I can just you know beat levels I'm not picky enough no no I 18 live I couldn't do that trick I mean a level like this cannot be hard [Applause] [Music] [Music] talk about an easy game with easy levels [Music] god I hope there's a bunch of munchies and [ __ ] like this any other goal then I'll I'll get a bunch of lives all right fine oh he put something somewhere and just like that we're back on top we're back with as many lives as we started the run with we're in the green I see the word speedrunning that's it that's the only challenge are you kidding I know I'm not even that greatest shell jumps in Mario maker ones and they're weird in this game I got two lives and a dream one life I mean you don't really need more than one life to do it you know typo guru speedrun short and sweet triple jump trouble I know to do in the situation yeah ever see this game before damn I really couldn't have been on a worse level to show you guys this game I really could not have been on a less appealing stage when I last finished playing this game um Wow yeah I actually this is this is why I stopped playing the game gives social subtle be but honestly it's a beautiful game you are a car and you have a quest and you know there's a battery currency and you fall flows [ __ ] my favorite thing about the game whenever you fall it's slows [ __ ] that's really you didn't care about to hit a hottest jump of all time probably not Oh this game piggy just ball full of [ __ ] usually hot jump really is like the pinnacle of game though so much game like that green thing I want that I'm gonna need it a little it really sort of sucks [ __ ] like that [ __ ] thing I'm gonna need that oh this changes everything did you see that and time is open the biggest jump of all time I actually I'm stuck gonna take an image if I can make this I'm going back oh yes okay okay this is better look how much look how much runaway and working with to get speed okay this was a mistake no no I'm going back not my best attempt not gonna sit here in the pretend that that was my best attempt you'd I now understand exactly how to do the skip we were doing it all wrong before you had have never seen the skip done this way before I guarantee that I'm talking to me you blockhead [ __ ] and that's the main skit I mean I know I made it look really easy but I actually takes a lot of practice what do you mean this is the dumbest things ever watch [Music]
