friends at Monday comm find out how it can boost your team after this video this is what if and here's what would happen if there was no friction for one minute friction is what allows us to move and to slow down friction is how we pick things up and hold onto them to be totally honest there isn't much we could do without friction a world without friction would be unlivable but do you think you could function for one minute without it the reason why friction is so important to our world is because it affects everything that's in motion when any object is moving slipping or sliding in one direction friction is acting in the opposite direction so for example consider something as simple as walking your feet are pushing backward against the ground and the ground reacts by pushing forward on your foot allowing you to accelerate but it's a lot easier to walk on concrete than it is to walk on ice right that's because ice has a much lower coefficient of friction than concrete in other words ice is much smoother than concrete so it has less resistance causing your feet to slip and slide this same example can be applied to vehicles in fact car tires are designed with friction in mind to optimize your safety and to make sure that you can turn and stop without skidding in dry conditions having a tire that's completely smooth actually gives you better handling since there's more surface area to generate frictional forces but the reason why your car's tires probably have treads is to improve traction in wet conditions when you're driving in rain or snow even a thin layer of water between the road and your tire can cause you to lose control that's because there's less contact between the tire and the road so the forces of friction can't work their magic but tires with treads have grooves that divert the excess water so the rubber can connect with the road and you can drive safely of course there are plenty of other ways to test how friction works do some redecorating play a game of ice hockey or light a match fire works for friction yeah celebrate friction and be grateful it exists because you don't know what you've got until it's gone for one minute cut the fireworks matches don't work anymore and you can't use lighters in fact you can't pick anything up because your ability to grip and pick things up is due to friction anything you were holding on to the moment friction cease to exist would instantly fall to the ground or fly out of your hand if you were walking when friction disappeared your legs would still work but you wouldn't go anywhere but if you were in a moving vehicle you'd keep going going and going and going until you crashed into something your brakes are friction in fact for that one seemingly endless minute of chaos and destruction terminal velocity would cease to exist meaning that anything in motion would be a deadly projectile at least it wouldn't get ropeburn but that tree that penny that runaway train is actually the least of your worries because within just one minute of losing friction actually within an instant of losing friction the whole world would just become one big formless featureless blob considering that everything on earth is composed of atoms and particles and that all atoms and particles are held together by friction well what do you think you get when you take away friction nothing you lose everything instantly so if you've ever wondered why skidding cars and baseball slides look so cool well just be grateful for friction yeah it can make life hard sometimes but it beats losing literally everything on this planet so go on try it for yourself take a walk and feel the friction between your feet in the ground but you know there's good friction and then there's awkward friction like at the workplace with Monday calm you and your website right now and sign up for a free trial but don't go too far double back quickly for another episode of what if
