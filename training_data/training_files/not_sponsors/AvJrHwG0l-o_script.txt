welcome back everyone this week we're gonna learn how to make creme vicious worse so if you want to know but the origin of the vichyssoise wait is and why is it confused all the time with a very similar soup well keep watching and a four bit of history so what is the difference between the creme vicious was and the potage Parmentier both soups are exactly similar they're all based on leaked potato and cream except that one is served hot and one itself cold the first one that is serve what is called the potage Parmentier and why is it called like this because back in the 1700 there was one important person in France called antoine augustin parwati which was a pharmacist botanist agriculturist and he was claiming that the potato was a great source of nutrition and it should be used all across france and to solve the famine problem the malnutrition growing rampant in Paris at the time the king the church which was poisonous and it did not want that crazy idea to go forward but eventually through the years he managed to be given a small parcel Ventoux demonstrated his idea and some people tried to grow potatoes and everybody realized yes potatoes is actually useful you can eat it unfortunately the men died but as he died of course is legacy lived on and the potato was used in all kinds of preparation and of course in soups and one of the old soup the basic soup was leek and potato soup it was cold like this and it was renamed afterwards the potage Parmentier in remembrance of that men that made that whole potato story possible so that was the hot soup hey I've got some rice as you can see on the screen here I think in an old in 1800 in an old cookbook you can see already potage Parmentier so it's been around in France it was done in France I'm sure in England there was similar soup with different name but that was the creation of that warm soup but what about the vicious was okay so later on in 1900 came about that there was another soup also made with leeks and potato served cold and people said why is this in soup or is it an American soup because people say Nana this is an American invention so I done a bit of research and it so happened that a French chef called Louis dear he was working at the Ritz in New York in the 1900 was looking at making a cold so by inventing a cold soup and apparently you would have used this original Parmentier recipe added some onion into it some milk and cream and created a simile of that soup that you could serve cold ok and a lot of people are debating this idea and I've done some research for the name vichyssoise in all my historical records of food in France I have not find anything kovash this was so I believe that it is a story that actually makes sense and it is more than likely that that French chef in America created that new types of soup for the local market in America and it's been labeled and known and be very very famous in America rather than France it arrived in France later one and that for the history so if you wonder what is the difference between the two the pommel tea is served hot it does not contain onion and the vicious was is serve cold it's got an addition of milk and it's got onion in it that's the whole difference now in terms of the recipe we're going to try to make the actual vichyssoise recipe with the onions with the potato with the lick and I'm going to add my own personal touch and we'll see it looks like so get to your pants get ready and it starts cooking in order to make a creme vichyssoise you're going to need the following ingredients but 500 grams of potato juice about 1 pound and one pound of leeks I've got a bit of the green part and the white part uh-huh thinly sliced I'm going to use a little bit of chives I've got one medium sized onion about a cup which is about 250 ml of milk same for the cream and 50 grams of butter for the cookware we're going to use a large saucepan and you're going to need also to be using a stick blender and a save we're going to start straight on the stove in a large saucepan and we're going to start by melting all of the butter as soon as the butter is melted we're going to add the onions and the league so we're using a low heat for that recipe because we don't want to have any coloration that is very very important and we're going to have this vegetable to sweat unless we call that in in French so with a pre cook them in butter put them all in and blend well with all of the butter and you keep on the low heat and we're going to leave this to cook uncovered very gently for four to five minutes now after five minutes what we're gonna do one we're gonna move the leeks just to do a visual check in terms of temperature okay what we want is this a clean pan without any traces of run if you see some slight traces of run your heat is too high so you're gonna reduce your heat because that blend is gonna have to be cooking for further ten minutes at a very very low heat some onions take about 15 minutes to cook so same thing here I'm going to leave this in my pan for another ten minutes and then we're gonna add the potatoes after ten minutes I can show you again no coloration it is time to add all of the potato you're going to drain the water out and put all of the potatoes in and we're going to mix that with the leeks and onion next we're going to cover this with water so it's about two I think about three cups let me add a bit more no let's have a look almost four cups of water from that you don't want too much we just want a few centimeters above the potato we're gonna clean the side and we're going to bring this to a boil on a high heat as soon as your water has reached the boil we're going to turn the heat down to medium we're gonna add a tablespoon of rock salt as well as a bouquet garni and we're going to cook this uncovered on to medium heat for about thirty minutes now to make sure the potatoes are absolutely cooked after 30 minutes you can turn your head off your potatoes should be cooked so we're just going to remove the bouquet garni and we're going to use a stick blender and process the soup all right so stick blender is in and then mix everything once you're done processing you should get a nice smooth thick paste and this is the consistence you have got and the color and we need now to pass this soup through a sieve into another container so you can either use a bowl but for me I'm going to use a clean tan and pass the soup straight in so we can add the milk and the cream so the process is very simple I'm taking a clean pan I'm gonna take some soup pass it through and use a spoon to make sure I press down if you have any bits of potato and you really pass everything as much as you can through the sieve okay I'm done this is the end result you may wonder why are we passing the soup here because remember this is a soup made in the Ritz in New York it's a fine-dining establishment so of course this type of soup or not farmhouse soup with plenty of fiber in it pieces of potatoes you know clients will expect something really elegant really smooth this is why we want a product with just the taste the flavors and no chunks now of course this is a little bit too thick so this is where we're going to be adding all of the cream and do it into time we have the cream and half the milk and then mix well all right so I can add the rest now once you hear this is the color you get you get a nice smooth and a nice kind of whitish color you can taste your soup now and make sure you got enough salt you should have just enough but if it's not enough if it's not to your taste you can add a little bit of seasoning okay so once you've tasted we're going to put the heat on and bring that to the boil as soon as the mix boil you can turn the heat off again and we are done we usually bring this to the boil to sterilize the soup okay in the last step now is to have this soup to cool down so I'm going to transfer this into a glass bowl while filtering it one last time through a sieve and that's it we are done so as I said the last step consists of passing your soup again rusev and I'm using a glass container because glass does not have any taste to it if you use a metal container there is chances that your soup because of the cream and the dairy product you may have a light metal taste at the end after several hours so glass is really neutral so always use glass for this type of preparation with cream because cream has got tendency of reabsorbing any residual taste being from the container or even from your fridge so the step consists of passing this I'm going to leave this to cool down at room temperature and then cover it and put it in the fridge for several hours until it is totally fridge cold as soon as your creme vichyssoise is cold enough it really has to be really really cold it is time to serve now for me I'm doing something a little bit special for the serving which is something that is done in France with the vichyssoise it's to add a little bit of whipped cream and I've made here with an edition of chosen so I'm gonna use a good tablespoon of chives okay and I'm gonna blend this we've a freshly made whipped cream and I'm gonna use this and make canals so if you want more chives in it you can but it's pretty strong so what you want to do to beat the cream a bit more to reach that almost buttery consistency you see that's kind of very stiff so we can we can work it with a spoon and make canal and now for the service so very simple and we're going to use a deep plate I've got some shy of to decorate and I've got my cold soup on the side here and it's become very very creamy so you don't want to have too much and it is meant to be thick so you know what two spoons like me a little bit more and I'm gonna finish this off with a canal of whipped cream infused with chive now for the canal I'm gonna want to have something quite large something like this okay in the middle of the place and just for the coloring just having this little bit of shy upon him and it has to be very discreet you don't want to overdo it and it's all about the creaminess you remove this and voila here we have the creme vichyssoise and glassy to finish off I'm gonna try it I'm gonna try to go on the side of the of the plate you've got a little bit of whipped cream with the soup Wow really cold and with the flavor it's amazing at the flavor really of the potato and the leeks just with the salt they are really rich but on the real amplified by the milk and the cream mmm now I understand why this soup really has been reso well-received because if you're in the summer at the moment and you're looking for something fresh and we've really a silkiness to it that this vichyssoise is spot-on but that's it that completes the video recipe of the week and we've learned how to make a classic creme vicious was let's say now I don't eat cold soup very often but I have to say that when you go out of your comfort zone like this and you try something new it is so interesting I mean that soup even though you don't have any stock it is only vegetables and salt and water of course and cream but still it has an amazing taste it is full of flavor and it is really fresh and I really really would like you to try that recipe so as always if you have any question about that
