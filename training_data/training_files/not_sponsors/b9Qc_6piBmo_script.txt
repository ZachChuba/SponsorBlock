the planet and kara is up first she can choose any one of these presents to open but not one of these two golden gifts because those are for our special bonus round coming up later I'm gonna pick the green one okay I think you did there green for the planet this is a sale clock wallet so it's made from an actual sale cloth that's like the material that they use for like sailboat sails if they've been like discarded or whatever like they reuse them repurpose them into these wallets they're really cool because they float and they're super strong and it's very minimal and true if you like the swim wallet that's me alright Adam you are up next you can either steal that sailcloth wallet or you can choose a new gift I do like boating and and money and places a store or my daughter your boating money or by putting money lint a big yellow box down below don't clown pants yep classic clown piles yeah I guess that bozos in here it's a clown Oh a telescope don't brush it's a reusable straw I just draw metal straw that telescopes so save the turtles save the Turtles that's awesome and so that little pipe cleaner yes if it's to kind of like clean out the flavor our that or that whatever you drink does it whip open so you can it's also really cool about this when you put it back in screw this on it has this a little carabiner on here so you could hook it onto your backpack or onto your future there's something like I've read something like 8 billion straws maybe up to 8 billion straws in the ocean yeah with a beat with a beat so we can kind of reduce that number a little bit that'd be great alright so it's my turn I get to choose one of these products or I get to steal that recycled set wallet which I want to do yeah you know what I mean I like slim wallets and it helps the planet alright kara since I stole your gift you now get to choose to open a new one or two maybe Co Adams [Music] Underpants I am NOT a paper cup cup its ceramic it looks like it's made out of paper or cardboard or whatever those are it does and then the top is like a silicone top there's something inside that to the paper sleeve that's cute when I'm trying to save the plane I don't want to seem pretentious so I want to like blend in with the common man you get out you're not a paper cup you throw your reusable straw in there and everyone's like oh they start patting on the back and fetty's release also shout out to the product video that I made with Jamie a long time ago for that for that brother I don't know much but I love you yeah all right Danny you are up you get to open up a new gift or steal whatever you see cuz yeah you don't see the wallet so you can't feel it I'm gonna go with confetti Trash Can we haven't gotten a bonus ticket yet we haven't gotten a bonus ticket yet so maybe my trash can has it in there's no bonus gift yet but this is the ultimate claw ah so cool thing about this is not only is it reusable often a great alternative something like paper towels it's very simple but you can actually like you don't have to use any cleaners with it so you can have just spread some water on the cloth or on the surface and wipe the thing down and it really does an excellent job cleaning it's kind of like a microfiber cloth that's totally reusable it feels like it would be paper and like you just get rid of it but does it rip easy does it does not no it's very strong giving it that's awesome yeah it's great I love this thing well mat 19 and get your starter set for just $5 all right Kyle you're up all right well I like all those actually no I don't

bonus gift round but for now what else you got this is like a reusable saran wrap deal it's like a saran wrap replacement you can cover up your like sliced open avocados with that or you know like if you don't use all of the banana or whatever you just wrap it around there and save later little shower cap all right this helps the planet because instead of using more plastic for like saran wrap you're reusing something that's made of was a silicone sticky rubber some sort of sticky rubber trademark all right Sarah you are up I do need to clean my house more often and I think I throw away way too many paper towels I'm gonna take that from you it's great I love this thing [Music] you can use that to wipe off his tears all right Danny since you've been stolen from you get to open the new
