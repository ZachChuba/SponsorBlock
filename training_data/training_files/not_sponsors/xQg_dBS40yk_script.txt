okay we got cars coming rounds come on car you've got this you've got this yes this is so well done yes I cannot believe it welcome back everybody to tears the driver today we're gonna be driving down the a full three six one I think it is from Avery to swing down and then we're gonna be heading on or I can actually also pilot down here and then we're gonna be heading onwards and super charging at min men's Bri I think it is services so yeah that's gonna be our drive today should be pretty fun I'm thinking about doing data daily drives at the moment guys in my model 3 what do you think do you wanna see daily drives on this channel I'm gonna have to take it off there if you do hit the like definitely be doing daily uploads and daily drives or at least daily Tesla videos they might not all be about autopilot but it will all be about Tesla's now the reason I've chosen this route today is it actually has some of the biggest and the best / worst corners that we have around here now it gets very very tight there's some pretty much 90-degree bends followed by nearly some hair pins which is going to be quite interesting to see how the system works you can see it's already said that it's a 60 but the 60 sign is in fact over there it moved there about six months ago so it obviously still isn't picking up sides it isn't picking up speed signs etc etc but I've got to say IG this road looks really nice and the left yellow lanes or the lines are brand new I doubt they're gonna last very long though they already run out there but they are new so we're gonna do this at maximum speed so I'm gonna keep it at the speed limit which is 60 miles per hour I do apparently have something wrong with the car let's see what that is Oh my rear left actually my rear side the PSI on the rear sides are down so I'm not sure why that is but if they're not down much so it must just be maybe the right side were in the Sun and got a lot hotter so we've got a lorry coming I'm expecting a hard break here yet infer there it was but then it carried on nicely so that hard break although I could judge that it was gonna happen obviously didn't feel nice didn't feel natural and it didn't need to do it but better to be safe it really should slow down for this corner here it's not slowing down for it but it's still taking it very well and again I would hope it maybe slows down to 55 for these corners there we go now it's breaking down to 55 that was pretty good and here we go these are the corners that I was talking about these are insane corners the car needs to slow down don't forget I'm not touching anything right now and it is slowing yourself down so nicely well done Oreo that is on my cars called Oreo if you're new if you're new here my cars called Oreo look at how well that did I'm just gonna touch it again 45 miles an hour it's bored us down to okay still slowing us down there's no one behind me so we're all good here down to 39 or 35 okay this is obviously a bit slow normally I would go through here at 50 miles an hour just so you know this is quite capable at doing the 50 to 60 miles an hour down this road but that was really good okay coming up is the ultimate ultimate test if it can do this corner I have very very much faith that this will take us all the way to Swindon without me having to touch anything okay so it's never done this one nicely has done it before look at that breaking super-early Wow really going slow down to 35 down to 30 this is the difference though guys this is the change that we needed there's a car on the other side of the road okay 20 miles an hour is a little bit overkill okay it's it's doing it though like I'm completely hands-off completely just letting it do letting it do its thing I've changed the viewing angle a little bit so hopefully you can see this clearer I've now got a map screen on this as well so hopefully you can see this clearer and it just gives you a better view of what's going up ahead so that did incredibly well very very impressed it's not picking up these arrows on the road that are facing to us again here this is an attained insanely tight turn it's breaking nice and early it is breaking pretty hard I've got to say now you're also here that see here that the hedges has slightly overgrown okay we've got cars coming round come on car you've got this you've got this yes this is so well done yes I cannot believe it you actually did that corner and didn't terrify me this guy's is a huge improvement ignore the fact that we're going 30 ok I know that we're going a little bit too slow for these roads but this is making a massive difference and I'm not having to disengage from autopilot so far I could have closed my eyes and we would still be doing the same journey so again is speeding us up but it seems a little bit hesitant to get to full speed here which it should be because it it shouldn't go full speed around these corners did that really well and now it's starting to pick up to the 60 miles an hour full speed here that was good he even gave the lorry did you see that he gave the lorry extra space and move closer over to the left so this upper head is a pretty much blind hump that turns left you can see that lorry this is definitely going to freak the car out here it's not slowing down for it okay now it is and then it took the corner okay that wasn't the best that needed to slow down a little bit earlier I think there however we still go in on autopilot and this must be the best journey auto pilot has done so far the reason I actually don't autopilot this journey is because of the corners and that now seems to be pretty much fixed let's see if the PSI has gone up it was 37 Auto is still 37 this one's gone up because this was 37 as well so on straights like this there's no problem at all again so we're coming up to a 50 you can see that that 50 speed sign dead ahead and I'm just gonna see if it will slow down before the 50 at all is it going to has that been programmed no it definitely hasn't so I'm gonna have to pull it down myself see that is a shape that's something again that they could definitely implement with this new system just like the corners it just needs to slow itself down just before that it seeds the speed limit picking up the cones over there nicely again some really treacherous corners here which it's pretty confident at even at 50 miles an hour going a little bit sideways a little bit to the side you can see there it put some warning up as well so maybe it need to slow down to about 45 for those corners so far though very very impressed with how its dealt with some of the corners very nice okay let's see how quickly does it turn up no there we go there's the 16 so we click the 60 and that brings us up nicely I'm not actually following the sat-nav I don't know why it's asking me to go left down there I'm not actually going to go left that way so we're just going to keep on going straight will it affect this lorry because it's come around the corner no it doesn't seem to be again here we've got a pretty horrible hairpin this lorry just come around you can see how crazy it is hopefully it's breaking okay it's breaking pretty hard now down to 45 it should be slow enough for these corners or down to 40 there you go now it's taking these corners pretty nicely and I want to see how far I can go on this trick without touching anything well at least without taking over control obviously I'm having to touch every now and then okay so again we're going into this is a brand new 50 actually this never used to be a 50 so this will be interesting to see if this changes no as you can see this is definitely not changing so the speed camera or sorry that the camera in here is not picking up speed signs actively at all because this is still showing 60 even though this is definitely a 50 now it used to be a 60 but now it is a 50 so again we've got some pretty horrible corners here this is actually the Ebola drone just up here when they film the Grand Tour just over there and here I have a complaint with my brother in one of our first cars we had a Skoda Fabia and we have aquaplane that nearly went off there but luckily now our self-driving car is taking us very safely around so yeah this here next to the Science Museum is the Ebola drobe I have contacted to try and go on it to autopilot around it but sadly I haven't had any luck I haven't heard back from them yet but that's it over there on the right and as we come over here we're going down into Broughton there's sometimes cars parked on the left here and it does confuse autopilot but there's no cars parked there now which is good and again you can see we're coming into a 40 so I'd like it to start slowing down about now to be honest and kind of start bringing us in again this used to be 60 all the way down here so you can still see it still says that it's a 60 because this did use to be a 60 this is only very recently it's turned to a 40 is that car gonna cause any questions any concerns no the cars are not bothered by here which is good and as we come into roarton the lines kind of disappear but the cars sticking to the left-hand side and into a 30 somewhere there is okay actually it picked up the 30 earlier which was quite good okay so there are cars to not be parked on the side of the road here so I'm intrigued to see how well it does big lorry big lorry is the car gonna see it when it sees it but it didn't do anything to react to it which is nice and again here let's see what it does because you can see that it might try and squeeze past there there is a cone on the back of that car is it going to no it's not going to so I have to take control and go around myself that's a shame that's the first thing we've had to stop for this whole Drive and it was just whoa okay not sure why it was slamming on their back onto autopilot here and we came up with some traffic lights with a cone on it and what's the car gonna do it just needs to go straight on here and that's exactly what it did really well done and now we come out some other cones and two more traffic lights so let's see if the car will navigate itself around these traffic lights I'm assuming it's not going to interesting enough it's not picked up the cone on the back of the truck at all that would been quite cool actually to have seen it pick up the cone on the back of the truck no it's definitely not gonna go around these so we're gonna have to work it around ourselves but you can see here it's picking up the coast nicely it picked up the light as well really nicely there and over the roundabout just put autopilot back on so still for navigating onto the other side of the road and construction zones it's still not quite there yet but they are obviously big big areas that are gonna need a pretty massive update to get changed so we're going to be turning right here and we're going to be going up to I'm not sure what this base is called up here upper roarton let's call it upper roarton chiseled in of course it is chisel them okay so autopilot back on we've got a car run outside of the road so our car is breaking for it oh we've got another car coming which our cars breaking for and now it's starting to accelerate again so I didn't do anything there I let the car do all of that itself I'm going to keep it down to 20 I think just because I'm not sure if it's gonna be able to take this corner this corner is very very tight and you can see that there are little bollards and stuff on the edge actually did it nicely I'm going to keep it nice and slow though still doing well around these corners and we've got a fan coming how's it gonna react no problem at all that was really nice really really tight here is it gonna go round I'm gonna have to do it myself just because there was a cyclist there and I was a little bit worried that it was it was gonna slam on or try and go around him in a weird way whoa okay so this is a little roundabout that it's not going to be able to do so we'll do ourselves and now up here there are some really really hard corners again so we're pretty much doing the hardest corner route that I know around here and again I'm putting it up to the speed limit so we're going to go up to the fifty miles an hour and actually says it can go 60 but I thought this was a 50 up here let's see how it deals with these corners it's been a hot minute since I've been up here or way way too fast yeah definitely people have an autopilot up here because you can see that that went right over the lines there it didn't slow itself down like I was expecting to it's bringing yourself all the way up to 50 slowing itself down slightly slightly not loath though okay and what about here there we go that's nice that's breaking really nicely for this for this corner here so it is a really really tight corner it's going down to 25 like 25 again is a little bit overkill I'm not gonna lie but it did the corner and that that's all that really matters at this point it says for us to turn off left here but we're gonna keep on going and we're just gonna follow this road for a where wherever it seems to go we're pretty much driving around the Ebola dome here yeah it definitely is a 50 you can see the 50 sign there so again this isn't picking up the correct signs sadly showing that it's a 60 well this actually goes to a dead end this way back onto some more normal roads now with markings on both sides and hopefully this will be nice and easy for us for the rest of the journey again there are some pretty bad corners down here and I don't think many cars will have Auto piloted it so I'm intrigued to know if it slows down on its own will or not doesn't seem like it is whoa okay coming pretty quick around this corner actually did it really nicely though get it slowed us down correctly down to 43 and was able to do that no problems at all is it gonna pick up this cyclist no it is slamming slamming us on though I think it was maybe because of that guy the army guy there that got ours car if it was because of him that was very impressive it broke very very early on but I'm not a hundred percent sure it may also been because of the car coming around the corner and I think it just like breaks very hard because of that either way it slowed us down and kept us nice and safe around these corners at 50 is no problem at all and now we're gonna be coming in to chisel durn which is a little town Oh how's it gonna deal with this braking hard braking hard down to 42 very very well done car that was very nice even though we went down a hill it was a pretty bad hill as well to go down and we turned at the same time he did it really nicely okay so we're going into a 30 but mainly there's a really really tight corner here let's see how it deals with this it's still gonna go at it at 30 apparently slowing itself down now slowing itself down again no problems at all really tight corner correctly done this is the most impressive Drive yet I've got to say the only big thing I've noticed so far this Drive is slowing itself down for speeds signs and actually regulating itself due to speed signs and see if it picks up these people because they're just close on the roads nope didn't show them and also of course going around other cars oh actually and going on roads where the line in the middle disappears I want it to stay on the left-hand side please Tesla okay so we've got around about here the car full speed at the roundabout so it's not slowing down for the roundabout again that should be something that maybe it can start doing which is just slowing down and stopping for a roundabout or at least if it just starts slowing it all the way down that would be good enough okay back on here zebra crossings anything for zebra crossings yet no no zebra crossings being shown just yet keeping it 2:25 down at you now let's put it to 30 because of course we want it to slow itself down and it's keeping itself under 30 here 29 for this corner now up to 30 so this is quite interesting we've got some right-of-ways coming and I'm intrigued to see we should be fine actually going through these right-of-ways with no problems is it gonna pick them up is it gonna slow down is there gonna show anything different it's showing a rubbish bin so if it just showed a rubbish bin on the right hand side there for a split second and that seemed to be it showing that you can see it could see something in the middle of the road and again here we're coming to a t-junction and I would like it to start slowing us down as we get to it but it's obviously not gonna do that no definitely not so we'll have to slow it down ourselves and pick it back up again I don't know what to pilot just yet and there we go back onto water pilot so there we go guys that is some really really hard cornering some really treacherous areas and Oreo has done such a good job the autopilot software has had a huge upgrade recently and the slowing down four corners is the biggest part it really really is and it makes so much of it so much better I hope you enjoyed the let me know what you think down below in the comment section until next time thank you for watching don't forget drive safe
