so cool it's finally here look it's stopped at the red light has a red line I was kind of nervous okay the real trick is how the hell do we get the started so it says you just gently press the pedal or you use the gear stock so we'll see once it turns green okay so oh okay cool so I just tapped it down once and it started fun by itself that's crazy but at least some instructions it says it can only go to the speed limit which is 40 here oh so I have to do it every single song if it's a green light every light but every light even if it's a green light it's basically having you confirm it probably right yeah so I'm going really slow like right now there's a car right behind me because the speed limit is only 40 miles an hour so I'm pressing on the accelerator because a guy is probably gonna walk camiolo really slowly okay so you can only go as fast as the speed limit it only goes as fast as the speed limit and it looks like this is the first time we've actually done this we don't really know I'm like affirm it but it looks like you have to confirm mine every stoplight every stop sign even if it's a green light the car won't go past it and you still have to actually pull on the lever or I guess gently push the pedal so I'm gonna try that on the next one so that previous would actually shift it down and it started going huh so it's stuck on autopilot fine you have to freaking some so there is a stoplight coming up I assume a message will pop up because it has been on the other ones once it sees it there we go again something to celebrate her okay so I guess you still have to confirm it though right yeah you stopped to confirm it so it's just gonna read it's just gonna stop it's gonna slow down and stop on every single stoplight unless you confirm it unless you come free it's all like okay yeah again stopping for traffic control 550 so I'm actually gonna stop here because it is a red light you see the red light yeah yeah so red light and the car is stopping at 25 feet although there we go this is actually better than what I normally do because all of that Tesla's social testing it - okay so now I'm gonna house weird I swear they said if you gently push on the pedal I'm gonna have to reread that but I press on the pedal and I well so that was a little messy there they thought that yield was a stoplight because you stopping at 580 400 feet 300 feet okay it's recognizing that there's a car in front of us - I was gonna say on the previous slide she stops it doesn't touch the line and even when I'm driving I hit the line sometimes when I stop I think it didn't recognize that it got confused with that yield or like a caution maybe or one of those warning signs for the railroads yeah and so when that happens it starts slowing down yeah so right now I touched the shifter off to the races illegal I don't think we're doing a good job raising okay so it's a green light so I'm gonna do it one if you think about it like right there I was pretty far away and it was green right but if I confirmed it like okay I'm pretty far away of 600 500 I should confirm it right now but what if I'm approaching it and actually turns yellow that is it get played a little bit it's still a little far away I mean obvious is just the beta of it but but like you have to confirm like it starts down right there I'm pretty far away yeah like if it turns yellow right now and the people behind me luckily there's no one behind me right now but nope okay that's another thing I've been concerned about two intersections if you have a really far intersections of snow lines they might actually get that confusion and then if fading on the street - if it is you so like I'm two feet away it's a green light so I'm gonna confirm for what if there's cars in front of me where this traffic and things like that then what are we gonna do there it's kind of cool but it's a little a little on the raw side what man this is doing something that yeah not before I mean we didn't have this okay so red light right I am not touching it not breaking or anything letting it go 75 50 25 and it comes so it's pretty easy right want to dull T there I am impressed at how smooth it is when it slows down to that stop if you can see that there says autopilot unable to proceed please take over out of a green light so tap it and it started going on itself so pretty cool I have not actually steered although you can actually disable auto pilot and just use it in the steering and it should just have so I'm only on auto steer I mean I'm on cruise control right now so 600 500 400 all I'm doing a steering right now so I took it off of a little bit more of a jerky one okay so I stopped I confirmed and then now I can do that they seized another stoplight going I don't think the car will turn turn I'm not an auto pilot anyway I'm only on cruise control okay so it's a green light so if I do that it okay so basically it's just the accelerator this only confirms the accelerator still it's impressive that is pretty cool okay okay okay we buy yellow light this one it couldn't tell be around the corner so I actually saw the light a little later but it still recognizes it pretty deep out okay there we go confirm the stock we're off to the races
