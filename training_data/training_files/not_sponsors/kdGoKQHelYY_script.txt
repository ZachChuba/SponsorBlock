[2019 KBS Song festival live] Today's the song festival And we're planning to do a cool dance. With 38 dancers We'll all dance together. [Shining GFRIEND should shine bright]
We will shine bright I wore this earring because all the other members chose it. Which is why I'm wearing this. This was number 5. Number 5~ Number 5~ I have ocd. I'm obsessed with volumes. Everybody has their needs, right? For example This neck part Some prefer to have this part curled in and some wants the opposite. -That's me!
-That's me! -I'm completely the opposite.
-Completely the opposite really. When we see each other's hair, I'm like 'I want this part to be curled in' then she's like I like it curled out And then I tell Umji 'Hey I think this part should be curled out' I mean my hair is straight, right? But Umji needs to have wave in her hair. But I need this to be curled out, do you know what I'm saying? Right here. That's the difference. Well, Umji might be right. This is why my head looks big. I know that but I just can't give up on it. I think you like your hair done like a triangle kimbap Triangle kimbap?! -The way you like your hair is like a triangle kimbap, this part should be big and this part should be small
-No! Hey then you like your hair done like a webfoot octopus! [Triangle kimbap VS webfoot octopus]
I agree! No, isn't your hair more like a bullet? Like this? -It's a little like a triangle kimbap, a bit long..
-I'll go with the bullet! A bullet is much better. bullet style. Sowon always does her hair like this. Like a headphone. Headphone style. Not today. -Today it's calm and pretty.
-calm? [Sowon was surprised because she thought that it meant that she has no volume in her hair]
-No no I mean it's straightened prettily.
-I think I can just put some more volume here. No! You don't have to! You don't have to! -It's pretty.
-Hey everyone can I eat this? This is always my daily routine. [Finally she got more volumes in her hair.^^] With persuasion.. -I like it.
-Really slightly. Yeah really slightly, okay. [Jinsal: Really slightly]
-Okay?
-Okay. No, no, that was my greed. Really slightly! Really! Like you're making sushi, like you're slicing sashimi! Okay~ Okay okay. This much is too much Okay, okay. Okay, okay! I love it. Today I am not going to be too greedy.
