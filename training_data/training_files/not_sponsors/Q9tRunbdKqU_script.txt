hey friends welcome back to the channel today is a very exciting day because my ear pods Pro have just arrived and my original air pods are probably the third most valuable piece of tech that I own in my life the first one being my camera there helped me start my youtube channel and the second being my Kindle that has allowed me to read hundreds of books over the last few years video on that link in description but yeah airports are probably third place and so as soon as I heard about the airport's Pro I didn't even read anything about them I literally went on the Apple website and added them to my cart so let's unbox them and we'll try them out and see if they're worth the 250 dollars I suspect they probably will be designed by Apple in California but manufactured in China probably whoa oh look at that so this is what the original thing was and this is the new one the new one is a little bit bigger look at that engraved with my name I don't know if this is even gonna be visible in the light but hey immediately this case it does feel a little bit more flimsy than the other one so this is what they look like on the inside we've got my doula engraving at the front you'll see it says Ali Abdul don't if you notice and that we take them out and so compared to the originals we've got the new one here and we've got the old one there some new ones are a little bit smaller but a little bit more bulky let's actually try these out whoa the noise cancelling on these the noise cancelling is pretty sick like it completely drowns out like there's definitely a hum in the room I think from the fridge putting these in oh wow oh this feels really nice oh man these might just become any favorite pair of headphones so by comparing it to these ones so this one feels a little bit more flimsy the original air pods of what always felt a little bit flimsy in my ear and it was always very pleasantly surprised when they never fell out but these new ones there's just so much noise cancellation this is amazing alright I'm gonna play some tunes listening to an audiobook let's try and play some music now so it's gone to my Spotify this is my FY to playlist FY to is foundation year - it's the second year of being a doctor so I have different players for each of my different years of medical school and beyond anyway let's play remember the name [Music] I can't decide how I feel about these because immediately when I listen to them it feels like the noise cancellation is somewhat affecting the music transmission it feels a little bit more tinny than what I'm used to hearing let's compare them to the normal air pods okay so the audio quality is fairly similar for to my untrained non audiophile well that sounds weird audio file to my untrained non audiophile ears the audio quality sounds kind of similar to the original air pods but actually I think it sounds very slightly more tinny than the original airports because of the noise cancellation feature that's introduced in these in terms of the look and the fit like this is just a default earbud comes with a charging cable and it comes with more like different sized buds for your ears but I think these ones fit my ears pretty well and so this is what it looks like if I show you the side profile of my face which I'm never a fan of because I think my nose looks really big on the side profile but you know that's just an aside this is what they look like and yeah they feel very very compact they feel very nice I would be totally comfortable to like play squash maybe or how well I go to the gym with these but given that this isn't a that because I'm sure I'll appreciate the noise cancellation so I'll try this out want to go to the gym and see what how it fares in like a more sort of noise intense environment but yeah at the moment I am very much liking how these how these sound and how they cancel noise and I guess yeah objectively if you've got the original air pods then I'm not really sure there's gonna be much point in upgrading unless you've really valued the noise cancellation or unless you just love these so much like I said at the start these are the third most valuable piece of tech that I own and the main reason for that is just because they massively reduced the friction to to listening to podcast and listening to audiobooks on audible not even a sponsored video law there is massively reduce the friction for all those things which means that even when I'm doing something simple like washing the dishes or hanging the clothes up and putting out the trash it's so easy to just whack out my air pods and shove them in my ear and listen to something and that means that overall I've ended up listening to so many more podcasts and so many more audiobooks then I would have if I had to get out my proper headphones or even know where they are cuz I used them soufri√®re so infrequently or if I had to get out like a pair of wide headphones so yeah the main value at the airport is in the friction reduction and now in the noise reduction of the airport's pro so yeah I don't know they're pretty cool I'm gonna start sporting these and then people will see that I'm really cool because I've got the airport's Pro and I suppose that's a big reason why a lot of people are gonna be buying it is it worth $250 okay so the normal airports you can buy for a hundred fifty nine pounds and that I think is totally worth it like I would absolutely spend a hundred fifty nine pounds on these airports in a heartbeat for the original air pods but then is it worth spending an extra hundred pounds for the extra noise cancellation and slightly reduce sound quality in my non expert opinion maybe that'll change at the moment I think probably not unless you really value that noise cancellation maybe if you love listening to your ear pods in the car hopefully when you're not driving maybe when you're a passenger and you just don't want to engage with other people in the car then it might be worth paying that extra hundred pounds for the noise cancellation but otherwise given that for me the main purpose is audiobooks and podcasts I'm not sure like objectively like hundred fifty pounds is a lot for a pair of your earphones but I think these are totally worth it and I think two hundred fifty is probably a little bit excessive for these airports Pro but hey I guess that's why the airport's Pro you know the iPad pro is excessively expensive the iPhone 11 Pro is excessively expensive compared to the normal version and I quite like this new naming convention that Apple is doing and that the pro product are clearly the more expensive more legit ones whereas I think back in the day the MacBook Pro was like the default choice for little laptops these days that should be the MacBook Air and only pros need a MacBook Pro but anyway Remley video done this was an unboxing and impressions of the airport other things are in the box this thing yeah I'll do a proper review about these but I just wanted to get this out because everyone's doing it thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video buh-bye you
