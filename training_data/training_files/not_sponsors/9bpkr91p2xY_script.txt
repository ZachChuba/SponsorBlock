okay Before we jump into the mind of Jake Paul which is going to be a roller coaster and plane crash so pretty much every other disaster you could thank them so good luck but before $35 go to join honeycomb slashing all right you guys now YouTube is is that you oh my god it's been so long but uh we got good news guys we're coming back we love you make the heart yeah make all right you'll obvious because we love you we're good oh shut it off [ __ ] [Music] everyone was like Jake you shouldn't be doing this like you're gonna kill yourself yeah something I never ever thought I would see on my own is three messages I'm Jake Paul I never thought I'd see that on my phone this was not the plan at all today we were gonna film something completely different and then I started having a text conversation with Jay Paul basically earlier I was talking to him [Music] I'm nervous I've never talked damn I mean I've texted him and like tweeted him I've never heard his real voice cuz I feel like it's not gonna be like like I feel like he's gonna be like hey who I'm nervous okay alright should we listen to this before we get into everything okay here we go sure dude um I I know it like I'm putting a lot of like trust into you and I think it's like someone can you know do this and have it be fair it's you and I want to be like as truthful as possible obviously and like just be just be super really kind of just like clear things off my chest that I haven't said before and I know like a lot of people were saying like yo like Shane why are you doing this like don't give him a platform and and so on and so forth and so like I know you're gonna get criticism for this tonight I mean I don't even think I have to warn you but people hate me like literally hate me and I don't it's like this is gonna hurt you then and like I don't want to do it like I don't want to say I told you so like I told you people would be pissed but but yes like and there's anything we can do to avoid your getting hurt we should do it and and we should just be as honest as possible about everything and and yeah man I'm just like I trust you I trust you [Music] I just got the chills that was crazy right yeah that was weird so he literally warns me not to do right he was languages I guess I should break down what happened in what's going on so about maybe two months ago I tweeted the ups and downs of Jay Paul's life in persona is something I would love to see from the inside that would be really interesting I want to know it what's his life like what is team ten is his house even real is it a set we should get this address tattooed on us this is relationship really is the drama all fake what is that because I literally don't know so clearly I am you know too mature to be watching Jenkins no I don't know anything and Jake also seems clearly eager to do this with shame because he simply responded book saying I'm down so when I tweeted that I would be interested in doing it the backlash I thought was crazy Shane Dawson has just announced his new documentary series and it'll circle around none other than Jake Paul hey guess what people are not happy about it no no no no no I am NOT watching Jake Paul crazier than anything I've ever gotten crazier than when I was gonna work with Geoffrey star or Tana mojo or any other controversial person on the internet this was like Shane if you do this we will unsubscribe we don't want to be a part of this I literally will stop watching Shane Dawson if he's gonna try to sit here and make me feel bad for Jake Hall he's a bad person he's done bad things he's a liar so obviously I was um huh a little scared and a little bit full that I tweeted it because I didn't know the extent of it I thought he was just cringing you know like with this [ __ ] you know yeah but that's all I know they might be Logan I didn't know they were different so I basically reached out to him and I was like hey if we do a series together I want to really be honest about it and investigate you and the situation before I even meet him I want to go down the rabbit hole I want to talk to people who know him you know he's a horrible piece of [ __ ] who had falling outs with him yeah he just I don't know how to explain that one I want to talk to a psychologist and see like if he is a sociopath because that word was like all over a time line and ironically enough I was going to do a series about the sociopaths before this even happened so I kind of feel like the universe is like here you go so I want you guys to know I'm aware I'm aware that this might be a bad idea I'm like shaking sorry whoa I'm really nervous because I've never done I'm sorry I'm really nervous I've never done anything like this I guess Tana comes kind of like this but I've never like like I am a fixer you know what I mean I'm like way too nice way too forgiving way too oil and I don't want to do that this time I want this time to like actually sit down in a room with him and be like this is why people don't like you this is what you did that was bad I want you to tell me why you did it be honest about it and change your life and [ __ ] stop that's what I want to do right if anybody I feel like the reason he's saying yes to this might just be because he knows it's gonna get views right so could he be doing this series with me just to get views could he be doing this series with me because he actually wants to change and wants to be honest talking about everything he's done guys I apologize or is he a sociopath and I'm literally like walking into the Lions Den that's gonna cause I'm not good I don't know I have merch fans when I go back let's take ball we're like what would even happen if it was ready if he plays one woman that evening for you what would that mean for you from whatever it about sociopaths it's somebody who doesn't have a sense of morality they don't know what good or bad is they don't know when to stop they enjoy manipulating people [ __ ] with people and hurting people they think they're better than everybody and everybody is just a pawn in their chess game it's really dark I don't know much about that but that sounds pretty like is it insane like it's very very scary there are what most people call sociopaths they get into therapy and they learn from the therapist and then they take that and use it to victimize the next wave of people they come into so I'm gonna do this with me I hope that you listen I get it okay I should be doing this I shouldn't be getting Jay Paul platform I shouldn't be like doing series with a possible sociopath but I also want to do [ __ ] on my channel that I find interesting and the fall of Jake Paul and the darkness of his world is something that I am fascinated by and that's why I want to do this it's a you trying to justify this like every video could be me sitting down in a bed with somebody crying about their childhood I wish that's my favorite thing to do this I don't think is going to be bad I think this is going to get uncomfortable all right [Music] okay they don't get better you're just training them to get better at what they do bad okay so the plan was for me to research Jake a lot and then go into you know therapist or psychologist office and really talk to them about like what a sociopath the therapist I want to talk to is somebody I've met before today we're gonna talk about sleep paralysis borderline personality disorder she doesn't even know that this is what the video is she thought it was just gonna be a video that's SEO paths she doesn't know that Jake Paul is involved when I asked her like hey can we do a video about youtubers being sociopaths she literally said to me there's a new like oh my god we all go a little mad sometimes this was a horrible lapse of judgment how crazy can you go with these videos what are you doing I've been wanting to do some type of video about the idea that youtubers have to have some kind of personality disorder or something right to do what we do putting ourselves on camera all the time [Music] you're showing a couple lines I got my favorite sauce honey mustard yeah so open on camera all the time that's what sucks boasts about it having conventions with our name in it like there has to be something and I want to know like the psychology of a youtuber even for me like why do I want to get so deep with people and talk to people and like try to help them fix them why do I want to cry with them why like what is that I'm sure that that's a disorder what do you think I mean you're new to the YouTube world like you you think to be a youtuber you have to have like something I think like 90% of people are at least in narcissist videos about yourself weekly and I think that's the majority of youtubers stop asking for a freaking attention at myself God why was I so in knowing laughter wait are we going to cue countoff yes we're gonna go to the t-ten house should i not even tell her that it's Jay Paul it's almost like I want her to lay down exactly what it is then at the end of it password right because she may already know who knows when the moment is right the sociopath will strike [Music] thank you honestly okay so this is the perfect because your channel is about talking about drama controversies new this kind of just like going through situations and events very like thoroughly the video is just complete and utter trash and Jake just continues to keep on getting lower and lower and lower yeah so I asked you to help me with the shake Paul thing cuz I don't know anything and there's so much to keep up with as well okay so I know the name cuz it's funny and it's like a meme like what is it is it his friends is it no in 2016 he bought a house for $17,000 a month or rented it and that was where he started team ten and I'm not sure if they were friends is it all think is it real are people paid to be there it's so strange to be there like yeah for a spot in town a lot of people have said people are just there to basically get popular people that they make money people lets it go into other things modeling acting Estabrooks hearing I take far she is a dancer are you a professional dancer - yeah yeah it's something which is pretty much what makes sense it really would you don't just get to do videos with Amanda Cerny King badge flex with Drake on Instagram just randomly you got to pay for that well I remember hearing and I might be wrong but I remember hearing that Jake's ex-girlfriend Elissa Jake was like I'm gonna help you be a model let's be in a relationship you're modeling your ear will do better because you're in team ten and then his new girlfriend I think is a model so it's like was she just like an out-of-work model I wanted to be a model I want to be an actress I wanted to be in that like realm of everyone in Hollywood and now there's a new girl what's her name that girl honey honey Maloof she's like into the dead now she's a singer she's a music video but like that I'm like what is it wit how none of them were originally youtubers they're all from different sectors so they're all there are the actors all that models this is Hollywood a lot you get fake relationships people who are together to have a brand let me tell you about views people love couples Erica made a YouTube channel in one day it's 200,000 subscribers Jake thank you so much like I couldn't do this without you it would make gonna survive it for example with mojo Jay Paul if all the things worth as bad as Alice has said about t10 when she got fired for supposedly cheating then why did she not break out of him before why is she not leave if it was just so on going same with my teenage twins Jake Jake who was apparently bullying them why did they not leave what before they they have a platform their popularity maybe wouldn't have been as big as Tintin and that goes into the conspiracy of maybe that paint be there Wow having somebody pay to be your fake friend that's like the next level like ads and that's where the first controversy sort of began because he kicked out his girlfriend and accused her of cheating you told everyone that I cheated so it didn't so he didn't look like a dick that he kicked me out I don't know I obviously she ended up dating face banks he seemed to never leave ELISA viola alone after accusing of cheesier control list of either originally exposed Jake Paul of taking 20% of everyone's earnings which was massive I would do anything for him that's why I signed a contract for 20% of my life for five years everyone didn't know that there was also rules about strictness and bullying and going on a 1710 house if you're not up by 10 a.m. filming then like you get fined $50 no alcohol at the house every single guest that you had over had to be approved Fred Jake the time everyone thought that it was a lot a nice cottage family and that's how I kind of see it in the vlogs and but at least the violin came out and said no this is not what's going on if anything people don't like joking Tintin at the end of the day you can't just say I'm sorry to take everything back I'm hurt still and you've heard a lot of people her getting kicked out I do remember like a video or something of her in a house and she was upset she said Jake kicked me out and all her stuff was in like trash bags or something um Jake's kicking me out he didn't want to wait for me to get my apartment which I'm getting in a couple days so he threw all my stuff downstairs and put a lock on the door I thought that was your fake I didn't really look into it was that real it was real he's clearly got a harsh side to him but it leads on to he never got over it and he eventually accused face backs of assaulting his assistant and they released a video of where the assistant they picked up a bruise mark on the net meg was assaulted by a man he like put his arm out like this and I looked up at him and I realized immediately that it was thanks I didn't really know whether or not it was him at first because he has a girlfriend and he was making out with another girl this like video isn't meant to like retaliate or target anyone that ended up all to be fake for this to have happening nobody other than people 210 said it happened that should just that should just tell you I think I've heard Jake say like oh I didn't know it was fake but a lot of people think I don't know he orchestrated this and how random and just crazy of a coincidence they were happy for not only and team tend to be at the same club with me making out with girls when ELISA is Jay Paul's ex-girlfriend in that place perfectly perfectly in your guys's story in the way you guys would want everybody to see this [ __ ] go down and I brutally assaulted your assistant I didn't even [ __ ] know this person was a part of team 10 you believe this the way they're telling it you're brainwashed I want nothing to do with you Jake even came out and said I think about a month later you know the whole situation that we should be handling these situations in person and not talking over social media and this is where these funds began to fall out of love with then you stop losing thousand subscribers at that point that never happened on a show but I do also remember like Jay Paul was on a podcast and he was about to hit ten million subscribers and I think that's right when people found out the controversy was fake how do you have that level of certainty where you're like I'm gonna put this in a video and [ __ ] exact supposes guys so like and then he started losing them did you see that yeah I think as you going back under now oh no you know they'll take it back and like the first started going down while he's live on the podcast I was like we why are they going down no no no don't go back it was crazy first youtuber ever hit that million twice so you think that's the moment that made a handle from cringy to life hated yeah Jake Papa Scott that guy is like so drama without man Jake Paul stole post Malone's address he recorded the outside of his house YouTube is in a crazy place right now I was never bothered by anything that Jake Paul is doing but when you cross the line of like you're doing something wrong that's actively hurting other people's it's not good yeah yes doesn't look that is a big deal I mean faking and assault it's yeah Wisco to sue face banks meantime phase Bank says that the videos make him out to sound like a monster it's Fox News I'm pursuing this legally both on the side of Jake Paul Erica Casa del Meg I can tell you that I'm not too sure what happened I think it got dropped after Jake apologized so that started the downfall yeah there was events of where they Jake Paul jumped on a van a media van of a news company I wouldn't crawl up there I just wouldn't do it I want to do the interview here controversy and not was walk clinic night the mainstream media stopped covering a jake full as neighbors though say that he's been filming dangerous stunts and he's putting people in danger while the neighbors are complaining they're very upset [Music] know why that was things coming out Karen that people coming out from his high school say Jake pulled booted me in high school whoa dumping people's book bags in the trash Jake quote Hill rode his bike over my friend's car when he got mad also eventually after that I came out Jake was bullying members of team 10 yeah we know did any of them come out and talk about it yeah the Martinez twins said they left team Ted because they're being bullied and harassed every day Jake Paul was racist towards them he called them be nurse or something damn must be this tall for the visa oh I see oh man and he dragged me down the stairs he was laughing the whole time I was crying that's been a no-no oh is this Spain no no see this is kind of something which is really weird because why would these people she's come up quick team ten and say hey he bullied I said when he was in that he took 20 percent of our revenue why if they were so upset about that why would they stay in a team but it's just so long why would they stay another six months a year she made a video it was like her video was that she came out like told the truth don't you think in that video she would have mentioned that I was abusive if she really wanted to get everything off her chest now all the sudden she wants to make that up and bring that up I'm just trying to be the bigger person she's out there like roasting [Music] Wow well if if I was going for that if I had a friend that was bullying me at a YouTube occurred I please why would I not cuz I got my clock on try cookies yeah two grades okay I'll bring it up I'm basically signing is my boy yep officials here you may be signing his life away but he's gonna have millions eventually a lot more people began to leave 1008 big actions recently met through to 1910 Jake Paul's best friend chance quit teen turn what the hell is going on team 10 is like falling apart okay Jake so you everything began just to kind of slip away from Jake when you look at everyday bro most the members in that to chill out members of season a more interesting he kind of lost yeah it was like a self implosion you and I were on the same team I'm did follow that's right I feel like Fame they've got to his head a little bit maybe lost his mind slightly I'm not too sure honestly neither of you are poppin enough for me to put your name in the thumbnail I'm just gonna be real honest but since then he kind of went out the radar until the cat's-eye the desi Commodores game of fighting for the big punch to end this do you think the suicide forest video even though it wasn't his the way that went down and the press and like the fact that everybody was mad at Logan recently as you know came under fire for posting an alarming video showing the body of a person who took their own life did we just find a dead person in a suicide forest hanging this has been the hardest time of my life I've never been hated by the whole world and like Logan lost a bunch of business Google preferred dropped you from their service it was really the worst thing I think that's ever happened on YouTube the opposite that made Jake be like oh my god like it's no controversies worth like the press isn't worth it oh my god I need to not do anything controversial oh my god like I have what his reaction to the suicide forest video was with the forest thing it does seem that Logan has gone away within an essence and I feel like they've seen that and I think they know right now if they've survived that they can survive anything so this series isn't about Logan I don't want to make it about him because he's not here to defend himself to something but yeah I will say there is an overarching overarching thing about Jake Paul possibly being a sociopath there is some kind of personality disorder that makes him think it's okay to do all this sappy [Applause] the suicide forest thing to me is like next next level because even when you talk about like Jake you know I've seen videos supposed to leave him like like spitting on people or like hitting or pushing members doing really crazy things in videos which is awful and I want to talk to him about that but like I wonder if even he would say like the suicide forest things next level and like am I not human to do that I do believe that Jake does think that I don't think he's a totally awful person I think he's somebody that has reached his level of Fame and he doesn't want to lose it I think the whole thing with being popular for a lot of people on YouTube and for especially a lot of newer craze you need to remove morals because food webs that become so saturated there are sad things if you don't have popularity from four years ago and you're on a thousand subscribers now he's writing to a million subs in a year you've got to do something crazy that's happened so many times with them yeah I mean it is something that's scary it's even a bigger picture topic which is what I want to ask is like are is there a bunch of youtubers who might be sociopaths Psychopaths or have an issue because like I've even seen in the news like there was this guy who wanted to be famous on YouTube so he had his wife shoot yeah I almost feel like maybe talking about this stuff might help the audience realize like oh I shouldn't be supporting having allergic reaction [Music] it hurts bro like literally my face is burnt do you have the reflexes like somebody post a video called like I just blew up my neighbor's car it's tempting but maybe I'll click on it does it be click on it that shows that person make more no no you won't you know I didn't think he was gonna do it cuz I'm surprised that jake or Logan isn't dead I can't rule out like dying um I'm gonna die I'm gonna die because the [ __ ] that they've done when you came on fires in prison [ __ ] like and basically if you have acetone fire yeah oh god it's already in flames you know it's always gonna keep the house guys and I'm trying to stay people that mean you we see that face value of thing that's crazy that's absolutely crazy but today it's just another day in their life for nuts I can't really come around that alright I'm about to do something really stupid if I die in front of some low gangsters I really can't I can't imagine waking up every morning with the king what am I going to do today that gets me 10 million views what am I going to want them how I gonna push accept you know what we're not able to pause the pause let's go the Secret Service is our house right now this is not a joke what does this mean though it means that you're being great blog material well going into my interview with him I want to make sure I hit every point because I don't want people to feel like you know he manipulated me and we missed something what do you think is like the main thing people are going to want him to respond to or talk about and like not [ __ ] about like what do you think a successful interview would be is it all fake this is his personality not what it is in real life because it's something I've wondered I'm just living in the real world and you're living in a planet a lot of people exaggerate personalities on YouTube and I want to know how exaggerated it is with Jake cuz for all we know he could be a completely different person acted over ice gum is Jack Paul on YouTube different to Jay Paul in real life and that's really what I person wanna know and I think a lot of other people want to know that because there has been a lot of controversy but the the real controversy to me is is he who we says he is and that's that sociopath question because yeah if he is genuinely a sociopath like a lot of people think then Jake Paul is a character and it's a mess and like yeah the real person none of us have seen which is look one of the scariest things ever so I was watching a few of his overviews for the first time earlier and he seemed so different and this is why the question of easy sociopath I really not sure because in it he seemed to be caring not just about himself but about it was weird things he was carrying about towards his his chi spoke about she's trucking it he kept talking about just in general what a lot of things he cared about you seem nice he seemed genuinely happy that's what real emotions when I watched I thought this is a real person super excited because later we're going to Halloween Hornet it's like one of the biggest haunted houses and I want you guys to laugh with me I want you guys to be sad with me I want you to like come along with my life so we're almost at the book signing and I'm getting kinda nervous I'm gonna be meeting people what no one comes 2010 was fully formed he was big on YouTube completely different so this is like the question of where is it real comes in and I don't think it is purely based on them because they're going to be so different in a year period maybe before I need to be controversial to get big to get big on this platform to take a take it my fans I need to do something big I need to change the game and he was probably like I need to be like my brother yeah because his brother that's been doing controversial things for a long time people seem to not realize that this is what it seems to be with Jake and never-ending follow his brother okay tell nobody get the most look about that counts last shot more link in description guys clap yourself someone hotter smarts of the game it's always seem to be they've been chasing each other constantly I've always wondered is it her so that she's competing with each other like can I compete with my friends in sports your views the coin went down bro oh yeah yours were down to four the other day all what happened or is it a case of genuine emotional distress and anger of each other that they're not once more popular than the other stuff Wow with your ex-girlfriend again our relationship in my eyes is bipolar I'm always trying to be the best brother and and support him and support him Logan on the other hand is the opposite he is always wanting to kick me or punch me or push me down so that he can always be one up it has been since really we were kids throwing up like through high school you go and make videos with my ex-girlfriend like you need to stop dude like it's not cool as a brother like I would never do that to you I don't think any brother would do that then I know of this deep this is like I this is really hard for me because all I want to do is make something with a happy ending it's like all I ever want to do and I know going into this that's probably not I think if I was to give odds on a happy ending I'd say like Henderson if people see this with Jake and they see he isn't eeriness are people gonna want that cuz if I was 10 and I found out my favorite make my hero like the guy I look up to and the person expired to be was fake I'd be I feel bit betrayed and honestly and because you see somebody who you love is fake I nobody likes fakeness oh my god so it's like and literally is a lose-lose if he apologizes and is honest and talks about everything and like is like I'm gonna change then his current audiences will be mad if he doesn't do that then the rest of the internet would still hate him YouTube such a weird thing and I don't get it sometimes people aren't open for change is there anybody I should interview first like from his past and that would be honestly I think Nick Crompton Nick Compton would be perfect because he no he's no Jake from start to finish he knows he left because he didn't like the way I was going so maybe there are things we don't know about the daddies things we don't know about but big things and he knows all about the controversy there's so much fat because he was with team ten till the whole time he was the manager it was a charge of the business so he'll know contracts he'll know in that time because it's something which no I was spoken about no one's not as these people and I think Nick would be the perfect guy to ask and he's literally the only one who I know and his number I have oh my god okay I guess I'll reach out to Nick Crompton oh my god I feel like this is gonna get darker than I'm expecting and I Oh hey Alyssa what's up time to see which brother you know better which brother has the higher IQ are you serious this is my advice when someone dies it's gonna be okay oh you need a ride home so what is next what can we look forward to from you um there's a lot going on Wow I can't believe this person exists it's weird okay well I'll uh I'll keep you posted Oh speak to you I this is gonna be a nightmare yeah [Music] like Tana calm for instance with you you felt such remorse you were like oh my god people are outside this is terrible I feel terrible I'm gonna find a way to reimburse people someone who fit this would be like you know whatever [ __ ] them that'd be their full mentality
