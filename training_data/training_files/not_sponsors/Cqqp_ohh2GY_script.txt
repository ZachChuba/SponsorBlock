hundred five hundred to get started today Rage Against the Machine made headlines in 2012 when it came out that US politician Paul Ryan was a fan of the band Ryan was publicly lambasted for this including by rages own guitarist Tom Morello this is of course because Ryan's entire political career has seen him support the very machines that Morello and company are raging against but despite the fact that rages far left politics are written clearly all over their music Ryan isn't the only case of someone with disparate views supporting the band Nigel Farage another right-wing politician used rage against the machines name as inspiration for his podcast and I'm sure there's countless more people who listen to rage daily without fully appreciating their politics so why does this happen it's a phenomenon that can be explained by one of the most pervasive thoughts in all of communications theory let's take a closer look in 1964 canadian theorist Marshall McLuhan released his seminal work understanding media the extensions of man that book put forth one of his most radical ideas the medium is the message which is to say the way a message is delivered is more important than the message itself when McLuhan talked about the medium he was talking about the technologies through which culture was dispersed newspapers television radio and nowadays things like YouTube but I think if we broaden our definition of medium we can start to appreciate why this applies to Rage Against the Machine the medium through which rage dispersed their message isn't just music it's a very particular brand of music that sound comes from rage against the machines diverse influences before Rage Tom Morello was playing in lockup a funk metal band while Zack de la Rocha was fronting a hardcore band called inside out the pair had different opinions when it came to music de la Rocha preferred punk hip hop and even jazz to metal and Morello wasn't well versed in rap at all but what they did share was their radical political ideologies both of them sat far on the left wing both were very politically active so they decided to form a band together and brought in the last two pieces of the puzzle on the suggestion of a former bandmate Morello brought in Tim Commerford to play bass as a bassist Comerford was influenced by both the radical energy of Sid Vicious and the cerebral music of Geddy Lee meanwhile drummer Brad Wilk was influenced by the thunderous rock gods of old like Keith Moon or John Bonham all these different influences came together to three one a conic incendiary sam musically rage was built from the rhythm section out loud powerful drums jammed with a funk groove that's stuck in the audience's heads and got them moving on top Morello screeching guitar paired with the dissonant sounds of the rebellion that de la rocha wrapped this rap metal sound is the personification of angry resistance just listen to bomb track the opening to rage against the machines debut a dramatic build-up explodes into a punchy lick perfect at getting the audience angry and in this sense the medium of rages music does match part of the message rages lyrics tell a message of getting up being loud and being defiant listen to the chorus of Township rebellion where de la rocha condemns silence [Music] and this is part of the beauty of rage against the machines approach there's a universality to their lyrics everyone has some machine they want to rage against whether it's their job their government or the broader systems around them who among us hasn't wanted to stand up and shout you I won't do what you tell me but that universality is also where rages medium fails their message a lot of protest music is protesting generic power structures or protesting for the sake of protesting the audience can apply their own specific struggles to the broader messaging in the music but that's not what Rage our rage have a very specific political agenda reflected in many of their songs take the power back sings about how Eurocentrism and the American school system has marginalized people of color in modern America freedom isn't just about the concept of freedom widely it's about Leonard Peltier an activist jailed for his actions as part of the American Indian Movement their sophomore album evil empire features a number of songs sympathizing with the zapatista army of national liberation of radical militant group in Mexico but all of these nuanced messages take a backseat to the medium through which they're delivered the message that people take from Rage Against the Machine is you should be angry and why shouldn't they take that message de la rocha even says anger is a gift on freedom the issue is that people choose what to direct their anger at everyone has their own personal causes and rage against the machines music can be the soundtrack to everyone's own struggle rage aid this with the use of vague and themming phrases when de la Rocha sings to testify people will testify to whatever they want even though the bridge of that song is a powerful depiction of Western imperialism Tom Morales unique guitar style is part of rage against the machines package of delivery to whenever people think of Rage they think of his guitar techniques playing with feedback and distortion and thinking of new ways to create unique sounds out of the guitar in the case of bulls on parade people often lose the messages of cutting military spending to fund social services in favor of a cool guitar soul but all this begs the question is this necessarily a bad thing Tom Morello doesn't think so moralo has stated that his music is part of the goal of Rage Against the Machine he told MTV that part of what rage did was seduce people with the music and then exposed them to a different political message now McLuhan would say that the message is completely irrelevant in this regard but myrrh aloes approach does seem to have some reason behind it however it's true efficacy remains to be seen after all Rage Against the Machine have sold millions of copies worldwide but we don't see millions of people rising up in a socialist revolution of course this doesn't necessarily mean that anyone not rising up is listening to Rage Against the Machine wrong part of rages message is encoded deep in their music and everyone understands that much the very tone of the music encourages you to be active to get angry to rage but next time you crank up your speakers and pull out the rage it might be worth taking a minute to look at the systems around you and ask yourself what machine am i raging against Rage Against the Machine were an incredibly well-read band in case their lyrics aren't enough to convince you of that they actually released a recommended reading list on their website in 1999 it's a broad list encompassing children's literature political philosophy literary fiction and everything in between if you want to that link will give you a great deal and show support for my channel [Music]
