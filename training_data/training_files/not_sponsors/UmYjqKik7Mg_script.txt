footstep audio in Call of Duty warzone has been a hot topic since the game released with many players complaining that they simply can't hear enemies approaching them and requesting changes to be made and there's all sorts of tips and tricks out there on YouTube and social media claiming that if you use this or that sound setting or change something on your PC or console you will never miss a footstep again my personal experience though with footsteps in warzone is that they are incredibly inconsistent sometimes I feel like they're perfectly adequate and allow me to detect range and position of enemies based on sound quite effectively but other times I've been playing trios or quads having a great time and then an entire squad rolls up on us at 50 miles per hour without making a peep as if they were kids sneaking downstairs to unwrap presents on Christmas morning but it's obvious that there is something to this though everyone talks about it there's no smoke without fire and there's no way that every squad ever in every match of warzone is constantly activating dead silence it's just not possible so I jumped into a solo match with a friend had sass an enemy we met up on the map away from the other enemies and all the war and we did some testing what we discovered was quite interesting indeed so watch this clip I'm in a building hadzas outside and I asked him to run up to me so turn your volume up watch and listen do you think this is OK in that situation my friend was inaudible to me until he was about maybe like eight to ten meters away and this is a scenario where there isn't a great deal of background noise going on there's no crates humming no airstrikes or gunfire it's almost as good as it will get in that position in war zone so let's do it again about the same so how about full sprinting speed then what does that sound like audible from slightly further away but is that enough though I think that if someone was sprinting towards a building like that I should hear them coming from much further away and that is the case in other battle rail games like apex and Polk G this is where we discovered something really interesting though what if the window wasn't there is the warzone sound engine calculating that into the equation well the answer is yes and you can hear the footsteps from much further away when the window is smashed check this out there's a big difference there so we can assume that the sound engine is dampening and sometimes removing sounds to players who were blocked by geometry sprinting with the window open can be heard from much further away - and here's another example this time in a different building a bit bigger but I'm going to stand roughly central in the house and Hans is at the tree there and I instruct him to run without sprinting up to the wall of the house did you hear any footsteps then well if you listen very carefully there's maybe one or two footsteps right at the end when he just about gets to the wall it is super hard to hear that so we'll try again but this time sprinting much easier to hear that time but keep in mind that there is none of the typical ambient noise going on in this location of the map if there was some gunfire in the distance or an announcement or just a teammate walking next to you I'd bet that that would be incredibly hard to hear and most people wouldn't notice it the surface that you run on to makes a big difference in this example pads will first run without sprinting up to the door and open it so you can hear that from a little further away and then sprinting you can hear it from quite far away too albeit still quiet how about in a bigger structure with metal around and an open door just running normal speed quite obvious that one but when you close the door huge difference listen very hard to hear that one and again imagine that you're moving to you probably will be and you could have teammates nearby and other sounds in the distance obscuring those sounds enemy footsteps is simply too quiet at the moment if I stand back a bit though and close the door hands is practically inaudible until he's at the door and this is him sprinting to the door in this clip really one of the first things that you hear there is the door opening and by that point it's too late you're done for even when you in direct line of sight of someone though on a concrete road I think that the distance that you can hear players at is simply too short here - surely I should hear this player way before I do even with the background noise of the by station and the quad bike engine so what can we take away from this and what feedback would I give well I would say that at the moment in the current build of the game if you're inside a building and want the best opportunity to hear enemies running up to you smash all of the windows and open some doors it will allow you to hear enemy footsteps from further away and they will be slightly louder also on the flipside if you're attacking a building or flanking an enemy you have to pay attention to what surfaces you're running on and the routes that you're taking to get on top of an enemy without them hearing get dirt and grass is the quietest concrete after that and metal is the loudest wrapping up then in terms of feedback my opinion is that enemy footstep sounds are not loud enough across the board if you consider the context that this isn't real life this is a competitive PvP video game I think that players should be allowed to use audio cues to know sooner if enemy players or squads are getting closer to their position so I would increase the range at which enemy footsteps can be heard and also increase the volume of their footsteps I would also tone down the amount of sound dampening that's in warzone - I know that in real life sound does work like that but in a battle royale game I don't think that those rules should apply so heavily and I believe that after testing this for a few hours dampening is one of the key factors as to why people feel like there are no footsteps in the game why they miss footsteps and why they get jumped by enemy squads running at them seemingly without making a noise and if you think about it with an average engagement of two squads how many small walls or buildings or obstacles are between those two squads before they get line-of-sight on each other and begin a firefight there's probably so many things for those footsteps to trace through - by the time they get to your ears they're so quiet and drowned out by background noise that you don't hear them and I searched I think the implementation of that mechanic in warzone at the moment is way too harsh and I do believe that the majority of players would benefit from louder enemy footsteps the game would feel fairer and people wouldn't feel as frustrated when they lose a battle because at least they've had a chance to hear their enemy better in the first place informing the player with audio as much as possible is really important in a competitive game like this and finally I thought that I should ask this question too and play devil's advocate here for a second are the quieter footsteps by design are they intentionally quiet when running and sprinting to allow players to jump in and surprise other squads quickly maybe if that's true do I like that mechanic not at all I think it's the wrong decision for a battle rail game and in general I believe that the audio design in warzone could be a lot better not just for footsteps but other noises too like gunshots and explosions that sound very close to you at times but are in fact quite far away and also let me say that I've tried every audio setting in the game during this testing all of them are pretty bad in my opinion for footsteps but what I found is that home theater is definitely the most consistent one that works best for me might not work best for you and your setup for give it a try see how it sounds and with that said that is all for today guys do let me know your the next one
