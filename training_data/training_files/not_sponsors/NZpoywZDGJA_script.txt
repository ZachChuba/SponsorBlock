hey guys welcome back to my channel so not gonna lie I feel like this is the most excited I've ever been for a g'friend compact like ever since I saw the pictures and the teaser video for this one I was like okay this is a done deal this is going to be holy like their best music video like the Proteus music video like when I saw the teaser I was like this is sophisticated this is probably their most sophisticated and glamorous concept yet it definitely feels to me that they're trying to like shift towards a more like a different concept not that they are shifting and changing the whole type concept like the core concept but like this time around the imagery that I got in the vibe that I got from the teaser and they give everything just that felt completely different and when I saw this is a video for this I was like this is giving me something from Girl's Day because of the skirts you know meets blood sweat and tears of BTS meets what is it biblical references with the Apple and the tree or whatever I don't know this is what I gathered from the teaser you know so I am so freaking excited to see what is going to be happening it's a long missing video it's like four minutes so it's a little bit longer than most of the music videos out there so with that being said this is cool Apple I have the captions on there just go ahead whoo this is going to be stunning like I can already tell the production value of this music video is going to be off the roof so the yep pull the tree of temptation or whatever okay okay okay okay hmm isn't it like a Disney Princess that did that as well oh yeah yeah oh yeah can you feel like that the danger oh yeah the skirts just it's just reminding me a lot of this something easy today that's so cool this picture stunning oh they look like goddesses this is not even funny how gorgeous [Music] Wow that's I'm the one supposed to say that good are the butterfly the butterfly [Music] this is giving me major fairytale vibe the glass beads let's go and see you no no no no no no no they need to stop doing this [Music] my [Music] who the hell of this girl [Music] what [Music] I don't know those girls wow that's gorgeous like the sinister vibe I like uh yeah they're out for blood I don't know those girls you gotta be kidding me [Music] she's gonna like dancing like a snake you're like trying to seduce you Wow oh my god okay a lot just happen like a lot I feel like I need a few minutes to kind of really assess whatever was on screen right now because I don't I feel like I don't know them I was expecting something majorly different but I had like high expectations you know that just tops everything they took my expectations they crumbled it and they say you want expectations I'm gonna give you more than that that was incredible like I knew like I said at the beginning I knew kind of like this would be their best music video but this just goes beyond that went beyond my expectations it's kind of like you can feel the danger right off the bat you know during the first lines I was like oh look there's something you know but for them to go with such a big twist at the end with such like a dark image and like a dark or is it the usual concept it I'm I have no worries like this was so surprising I could not imagine them going this far into the concept and going this dog honestly there was something very very very sinister about the dog you know outfit like yeah I just want to talk about the Wardrobe real quick in the makeup because holy crap they make the whole concept come together in my opinion the music is stunning absolutely the the major etc stunning but I feel like if the Wardrobe the makeup did not convey saying five and feeling it wouldn't have been the same you know impact and them the impact was that the makeup is terrific like especially okay they look gorgeous during the first portion of the music video which gave more of like you know this pure and like innocent vibe you know with the colors and the more white art first and then there was a shift that's for sure into a more like sinister and dog concept so what I gathered from the music video it gives me like major fairytale vibe there's definitely this you know apple and like tram temptation biblical there are friends I suppose but then he gave me or so was it the the the fairy tale did what is it was her name like it Snow White there you go snow white with a witch with the wizard or so like the witch has this you know this whatever that's called for the box where she was supposed to have the heart of Snow White you know that give me that I mean that bit the Apple right so right after her being the Apple she went into like a I don't know sleep or whatever and starting from there it went downhill like you can definitely feel like are different portions of the music video it's kind of like taking you through the whole story chapter by chapter it's absolute genius in my opinion yesterday is off the roof honestly that this music is probably one of the best like this is a trend that I have you know noticed Noah days with most of the groups is instead of coming back with a very very summery song like sunny summer for instance like they did last year it wasn't last year I can't I can't remember bully a lot of groups know where dates are coming back during the summer time with a with a twist like they come back with the really really dark concept like you know I didn't Sookie did and not that I'm complaining because I adore dark concept like this one and this is definitely different from anything that I have shown before and I love whenever an artist is you know marking and you step into their carrier and it shows growth in my opinion I love it I feel like with g'friend is kind of like repetitive that I say that they have amazing vocals so you know just just know that I love their voices and that they did an incredible job here one thing that I want to note as well is how Angie just shown so much in here like she just has this confidence that I didn't see prior in all of their music videos I don't know I just like seeing people finding their confidence and it shows on screen like this I freaking love this this is this is growing again I love it but yeah but I'm like this is probably one of the best music order of the year I don't know about the song to be honest like I have been definitely more focused on the music video at this point and I feel like this is the type of music video that is going to be ripped apart by fads and trying to you know find theories and everything I don't know me like this this whole thing just there's a lot don't I know it that is it for me you enjoyed forget so after much out and I we see in a next video bye bye
