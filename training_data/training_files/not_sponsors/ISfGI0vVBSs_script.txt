audible.com/asap or texts there at then - 500 500 as humans were often drawn to beautiful works of art we literally pay money to walk around in giant buildings full of stolen stuff just because this stuff is pretty but what I find especially wonderful about humanity is how drawn we are two things that are absolutely terrible whether it's horrible films like the room building up such a cult classic status that we still have mass showings of it today cheesy so bad it's good songs like Chocolate Rain and what does the Fox say becoming mimetic over the years or our epic quest to excavate and play a series of unschooled Atari games that were mass buried for being too bad to sell we as a species have been continually fascinated with terrible art some of this is just because we love getting outraged about things and I made an entire video talking about how this applies to Rebecca Black's Friday but there comes a point where something is just the right level of terrible that we stopped fully hating it and develop a weird appreciative respect for it that's part of the reason possibly the most famous modern-day fanfiction of all time is one of the best worst things that one could possibly read how did this one weird story lead to a rabbit hole of identity theft daxing and fraud well it's a long story today I want to look at the success and infamy of a little story called my immortal and the mystery surrounding who wrote it and why my immortal is a fanfiction ostensibly based on Harry Potter that first graced the internet in 2006 it was published by a writer going by the username xxx bloody wrists 666 xxx who also went by the name Tara Gillette be almost definitely a pseudonym it's attracted hundreds of live readings a fan-made web series and swathes of fan art it centers around a 17 year old Satanist goth girl named and I [ __ ] you not have any darkness dimensional Raven way who goes to Hogwarts interestingly enough in all of the my immortal verse all of the main characters have become Satanists as well so Harry now goes by vampire Hermione now go by Bloody Mary and Tom Riddle now goes by Satan and also Tom Bombadil the actual plot of the story is baffling and pretty much non-existent it mostly just centers around a bunch of mostly unrelated things happening - ebony she goes to a good Charlotte concert with Draco some of her professors get shot by blade she gets a gun from Voldemort don't do anything with it and at one point travels back in time with Marty McFly to seduce teenage Voldemort the story doesn't really have an ending either in 2007 44 chapters in Terry Zaleski leaves an author's note saying she's taking a short break and plans to update the story more in the future so far she never has more interesting than the actual plot itself are just the mundane details of how the story itself is written it's constantly being interrupted with notes from the author adding random observations and commentary about the story whenever she sees fit the dialogue is incoherent in frankly a hilarious way the story itself is written with Clemson spelling errors with evany repeatedly being referred to as enemy eggy and my favorite Thai evany and then Tara started typing her own name in Emma Dee's place and then just stopped halfway through the beautiful incoherence of it all is just difficult to describe without showing you an actual example so let me share a passage of this with you abracadabra he yell at stephen lupin pointing his whoom I took my gun and shot Snape and Lupin a gazillion times and they both started screaming and the camera broke suddenly dumb bleed or ran in Ebony has been revealed that someone has know he shouted looking at Snape and Lupin and then he waved his wand and suddenly hargrett ran outside on his broom and said everyone We Need to Talk what do you know Hagrid you're just a little Hogwarts student I may be a Hogwarts student her at positing early but I am also a Satanist almost everything about it is iconic in a way that most bad fanfiction pieces won't ever be the typos the dialogue the story and the narrator voice all work together to create a big picture that's just beautifully terrible just as interesting as the actual narrative of my immortal itself is the meta story contained within the author's notes which are little sections before after and sometimes during the story where Terra shares her thoughts and observations with us most often she uses these author's notes to argue with reviewers who are flaming aka leaving bad reviews on the story she also repeatedly thanks her best friend Raiden who helped her write and edit the story and even bases an original character on her as the story continues a conflict with Raven arises in the author's notes Tara addresses her directly accusing her of having stolen her sweater and having refused to give it back throughout numerous chapters she expresses her frustration with her ex friend Raven and even kills off the character she's based on her although she later brings the character back after the two seemingly reconcile with no mention of her supposed death notably after Raven stops editing the story it's even more poorly written and incoherent than it was before it's not a really clear whether Tara and Raven fully make up but these small insights into the personal lives of Tara and Raven are just as fascinating as the story itself indeed our interest in Tara as a person is part of what has kept up this cultural fascination with my immortal throughout the years it's a bad fanfiction yes but it's a bad fanfiction half the length of a NaNoWriMo novel that was updated chapter by chapter over the course of just under a year whoever wrote it had to be extremely dedicated so who did write this story who is Tara Gillette's be really was this a super serious fanfiction written in earnest by a teenage God or was this a work of satire written by a visionary who was before their time the mystery of who wrote the story has stumped the internet for almost 15 years and today I'd like to take you onto a journey into the weird rabbit hole that is my immortal so first things first what do we know about Tara Tara - loves me in the actual context of the story revealed only a small amount of information about her personal life through the author's notes a lot of people speculate that Tara lived in Dubai because of one of the last things she says before she stops updating the fanfic where she tells her readers she's leaving Dubya most people take this as a misspelling of Dubai since there isn't really any other way to interpret Dubya as a physical place you can leave if Tara is a real person who's representing herself 100% seriously this raises some questions notably she would regularly mention how much she loved shopping at Hot Topic and would often mention having shopped there but there are no hot topics in Dubai which means if Dubya is indeed dubai she's either fabulously wealthy or wasn't representing certain aspects of herself completely accurately besides where she supposedly comes from Tara claims to be a goth a Satanist and a die-hard My Chemical Romance fan whatever else we learn about her tends to come from the fact that she's friends with Raven in real life Raven herself had a fan fiction account frequently referenced by Tara by the name bloody tears 6x6 and had written a couple short chapters of her own fanfiction called I'm not okay with a very similar promise the grammar was better than Tara's which tracks of Raven was the one editing her story but it's similarly out of character and nonsensical and is once again based on a goth girl going to Hogwarts both of these accounts were run over the course of a little under a year and regularly referenced each other in their stories unfortunately neither the original fan fictions of Raven nor Tara are still up although they have both been reposted but we do know that Raven provided she existed was the real-life friend of Tara's and that the two had a tumultuous relationship we also know that internet searches for the actual name Tara Gillette's B don't pull up a real person people have been trying to track down Tara for years and there have been no records to indicate that there is an actual human being named Tara Gillette's be out there based on that information and on the fact that where she claims to come from doesn't make any sense it's fair to conclude that Tara Gillespie is to some extent a persona given that she likely isn't actually named Tara Jo lesbi and that a number of things she says about herself aren't entirely true that begs the question up to what extent - Tara write this seriously it's possible that she created a fake last name for herself out of concerns about internet security and simply wrote about saturated version of her axle life for example at one point she talks about how she's going on vacation to Transylvania with her family and that she got to see the castle where Dracula was filmed except that the castle where Dracula was filmed is actually in California not in Transylvania it's possible that these exaggerations are more of an idealized online persona of a real person than an actual troll though I know when I was a preteen curating an online life I would use some real details but make up certain bits of information about myself to both protect my identity and seem cooler like I would use my real first name but also claim I got to meet some celebrities that I'd never met or that I was psychic it was pretty normal behavior for preteens on the internet especially pre-2010 it's possible that the inconsistent detail about Tara's life and the fact that that name has never been tied to a real person even after all those years has more to do with thought than anything else there's been one piece of evidence that seems to suggest this theory and it's an online profile called Tara and Raven acid baths depicting two goth girls called Tara and Raven who are friends which seems almost exactly like what we're looking for so did these two girls write my immortal well let's see Tara and Raven acid baths are two Goths from New Haven Connecticut who used to post pictures on MySpace and videos on YouTube back in 2009 two years after my immortal stopped updating not all of the YouTube videos are still up but the ones that do feature the two of them singing along to emo songs talking about death and how much they hate perhaps and making music videos and looking at their account I mean that's that right to goth teenagers named Tara and Raven who love good Charlotte and hate preps sure there's no mention of Harry Potter or having written the fanfiction and they're from Connecticut instead of Dubai but it's still uncanny given that these seem to be obviously the people who wrote my immortal people figured there were a couple of possibilities here either this is the Tara and Raven who wrote my immortal and they're being 100% serious about their coffee personas or this is still the people who wrote my immortal but they're not being serious this is them making fun of the coffee nuts and this channel as well as my mortal is all an elaborate parody made by the two girls eventually in 2009 the two of them stopped uploading only responding to a couple of straight comments they didn't respond to any comments about Harry Potter and my immortal mostly just talking about music and being goth in 2012 an accountant named Tara Rowe who appears to be the Tara from the videos uploaded a video of herself dressed in a decidedly non goth way and covering little talks by of monsters and men with a handwritten note saying the song is dedicated to Raven she's not featured in the video and the subject matter of the song which is usually understood to be about someone dealing with the loss of their partner made a lot of commenters worried about whether Raven was alright Tara never uploaded anything else onto the channel what were responded to come and sleeving people fairly worried about her and for another two years this was all we knew about the fate of Tara and Raven finally in 2012 the pair uploaded another video with from 2008 in the title the video depicts Raven and Tara singing My Bloody Valentine by Good Charlotte according to the video description the two had uploaded the video years earlier in 2008 but had made a private so they wanted to share a blast from the past with their subscribers there was no mention of the cover Terra had me for rayvin or again of my immortal they continued to upload a couple of other obviously old videos labeled from 2008 suggesting they'd been at the goth game for a while the only piece of new content uploaded from the channel was a very short video titled guess who's back featuring in now adult Raven and an off-screen Tara screaming about how good charlotte had just released a new album the video in particular doesn't look very serious and you can easily tell Raven is trying not to laugh throughout it the description is still in character mentioning that Tara was on break at work and Raven had some good news for her so are these the Tara and Raven or is this just a really weird coincidence well according to journalist Ethan Cheil it's the latter after the two started posting their old videos on YouTube chill contacted the pair curious to know whether they work they said they were and whether they really had written my immortal shields article explains that Raven and Tara were actually two sisters named Sarah and Rachel who started making the video since no teenagers as a joke according to Sarah who plays Raven a far superior name to Sarah the two of them had gone through a sort of goth phase when they were younger and now found the whole mole goth thing very funny they made the videos to troll other Moll Goths by making things that were over-the-top and obviously fake the two also claimed that they did not write my immortal indeed when they chose the names Raven and Tara Sarah claimed that they had never heard the story and simply chose them because they thought the contrast between Raven the acid bath princess of the darkness that Tara was extremely funny which to their credit it is the article debunking the theory that the pair wrote my immortal gained quite a bit of traction but it didn't completely stop the theories that Sarah and Rachel were in some way connected to my immortal I mean two Goths who hate preps and love good Charlotte and are specifically called Raven and Tara is a pretty big coincidence at the very least if they didn't write the story it kind of seems like they were at least trying to make people think they did on one hand I think it certainly is a little weird of a coincidence especially because they claim to have never heard of my immortal before on the other hand even though it's certainly a weird coincidence the names Raven and Tara you sound pretty similar to the names Rachel and Sarah and it's not implausible that at the height of manga culture there would be multiple parodies of the same culture in addition if they had indeed written my immortal or wanted people to think they had it would be weird not to mention anything explicitly my immortal adjacent in the dozens of videos they made I have trouble believing they'd be too embarrassed to admit they've written the story but not too embarrassed about literally everything else on the channel so I think overall even though the name coincidence is a little suspect it's reasonable to assume that the two of them work particularly connected with the story what I think is much more interesting than these two acid bath queens is another iconic goth was it clean too having written the story and this one involves a canceled manuscript a torn apart family and a website wide controversy welcome to the harrowing tale of rose Christo on August 2nd 2017 a tumblr user noticed that a fiction press account with a similar username to Tara's old fanfiction account had after many years updated fiction crafts is kind of like fanfiction.net sister site only four original stories instead of fanfiction the account was called xxx bloody black tears six six six xxx and it says the user joined in 2006 which is consistent with Tara's old fan fiction account one thing to note is that you can change your username on fiction prescient fanfiction any time you want and that this isn't the exact username that Tarun used but still it's suspect the first update from the fan fiction account was a little hello from Tara who says her old fanfiction account was hacked that she's been trying to get access to it for the past few years to no avail and finally she points to the accounts age as proof of its veracity she tells people that the love they have for my immortal has warmed her heart and thanks them for keeping it alive for so long after this update was released people started to question whether this really was Tara talking and if it was why here and why now to finally update the world as to how she was doing some people even speculated that she was lenny Saren the author of a new fantasy book called handbook for mortals Saren had recently stirred up a lot of controversy mostly because no one had ever heard of her new book and yet somehow it skyrocketed to the top of the bestsellers list in under a day as it turns out it was a terrible book and she just bought up copies of it bulk to get it on the bestseller list people compared her book to my immortal and noticing a number of similarities between her work and the fanfiction after the laning serum speculation begun the fiction press owner updated her profile once again to clarify that she was not Lani saram and that she was not on any social media except for tumblr of course as soon as she mentioned she was on tumblr the entire website went wild like what the author of my immortal has been on our website the whole time and none of us know who it is people immediately went scouring through the tags trying to find any evidence of anyone who would claim to write the story people were sharing posts like oh my god are we finally gonna figure out who wrote it they were going wild the only way they could have gone wilder is if the author updated her profile again and she did this was the longest update yet where she explained a number of things about her access to the account she noted that the account was registered a few days after the initial fan fiction account right before Tara's birthday because she never posted anything on the fiction press account people never made any effort to hack it even though her fan fiction account had been hacked by two people she and Raven had been fighting with she also said she had abundance of her identity that she would be willing to share with the fan fiction CEO if anyone had any way to get him to contact with him although she doubted it she said she felt an angry knee-jerk reaction to anyone speculating she might be landing Saren because she felt disgusted that lady's fake review had taken the place of an important book about police violence and wanted to defend herself against the accusation that she was Lenny hence why she updated the profile again finally she added a nod to Undine from undertale being her wife which kind of felt a little out of place given everything else she had written I mean girls same but what well having all this brand new information about the author of my immortals identity after a literal decade of having nothing made people absolutely hog wild and people especially tumblr users went on a mad dash to find the author's identity and thanks to that little clue about Undine one particular account popped up this Twitter account Rose crystal one shared a tumblr account of the same name where she regularly posted about online writing and her life on her Twitter posted before the fiction press update was this screenshot where she took a picture of herself logged in under the appropriate username bloody black tears 666 was found what was weird about this was LaRose claims she had taken the screenshots to save the image in case of hardware failure and she decided that a public Twitter page would be the best way to do it that's certainly weird and almost kind of suggested that for whatever reason she wanted to be found this would certainly explain the weird show undyne it would help identify her after people found the Twitter screenshot they scoured her blog for mentions of my immortal and found a couple times that say March where she had passively claims to have written it although it didn't garner any attention at the time and she didn't provide any proof once people found the blog on Matt's Rose confessed saying she was indeed Tara Gillette via the writer of my immortal she expressed how impressed she was with people for being able to figure out she was the writer saying she hadn't expected people to find her blog so quickly before mentioning there was something in the works between her and a publisher with regards to the story so she couldn't say too much yet particularly interesting was the claim that she was outed against her will as the author since again it certainly seemed like she had wanted to be found after the secret had finally been revealed people went crazy people wanted to know for so long who had written my mortal and now finally we had answers she seemed like a relatively well-adjusted person who was finally willing to discuss having written it and people couldn't wait to learn more about her as the month went on Rose revealed more and more information about herself for one Rose had been a writer for quite a while and had self-published some why a fantasy novels back in 2012 by all accounts they were pretty good and some reviews that were left years before the my immortal debacle indicated mostly positive things about them she also claims to be a Native American lesbian who was 15 when she wrote my immortal according to Rose she had been in love with Raven and had exaggerated certain aspects of herself such as her love for My Chemical Romance to make Raven Lake her more because the story had caused such a rift between her and Raven she had wanted to forget about it for quite a while but soon came to appreciate it for what it was and to life she was finally coming forward and talking about it she also claimed she was writing a memoir that would be published soon called under the same stars the search for my brother and the true story of my immortal where she would talk more about her motivations for writing my mortal apparently her publisher had extensively vetted her to prove she'd written it including proof that she had an old flash drive with the first 11 chapters on it and her old email address apparently Rose and her brother had become separated a long time ago in the foster care system after a lifetime of severe abuse so Rose had taken to her computer to write most absurd piece of fiction possible in an attempt to gain online notoriety so that she could gain a platform to find her brother the specifics of what she claimed to experience are a bit too heavy for this video but suffice it to say roses claims of why she and her brother were separated stemmed from having a horrible home life finally she mentioned that she had specific court records proving that this was the case which she'd showed to her publisher as part of the vetting process naturally this made a lot of people very suspicious first Tara pretended to like MCR to appease Raven and now the whole thing was made up why would someone write a bad fanfiction in order to find their brother in foster care especially since no attempts were made on Tara's part to publicly find her brother once the story had gained popularity why would she claim she didn't want to be found while making her identity so obvious who even made that host of a her fiction press account and why was it discovered at exactly the right moment why did she just coincidentally happen to update it exactly as her book was starting to come out are we seriously meant to believe that the author of my immortal wasn't a fan of my Chemical Romance the whole story just didn't really add up and a couple people on tumblr were starting to be suspicious that Rose wasn't exactly who she said she was at the same time Tara had a lot of defenders probably because her story sounded very sympathetic you had people defending her by claiming it was morally abhorrent to doubt the story of a Native American lesbian who had gone through so much horrible stuff especially because according to her she didn't want to be found in the first place despite this backlash these claims continued to gain popularity and Rosa's story was reported by many mainstream news outlets who showed previews of her upcoming memoir until a report from an unlikely source on September 23rd on a forum called Huey farms which was discussing this reveal with much derision and skepticism someone boosted claiming to be rose Christos Brooklyn according to this brother rose was lying about significant details in her life for one neither of them were in foster care and significant portions of roses fact story were invented to make her seem more sympathetic he also claimed that the family had zero indigenous ancestry and that rose was a white woman lying about her identity a forum moderator messaged him for proof that he was her brother which he apparently provided verifying him to answer any further questions about their identity he also shared her private information including her full name and an extremely detailed history of their family where he discussed the fact that they did come from a broken home including an extremely ugly custody battle that did lead to the two of them being separated although he also noted that he had tried multiple times to contact her and that she had refused the short less graphic version is that Rose had gone on to live with her grandmother and her brother stayed at home with her mother who was a terrible person the two haven't spoken in a long time another member ended up finding the full extent of her private information including her name and voter registration information that confirmed she was white I'm not going to post it here but this taken in concert with her brothers testimony provided sufficient proof for the forum that she wasn't who she said she was her brother also added that he wasn't sure whether or not she was the actual author of my immortal but noted that she did used to go by the nicknames Terry and Terra as a teen and that she had an appreciation for bad fanfiction after this broke out a lot of people turned on Rose feeling betrayed that she wasn't who she said she was and that she was lying about her ethnicity some people were still suspicious of her so-called brother though especially because his testimony came from a form that has a history of harassing people and sharing their private information meaning people might have had a vested interest in making things up about her to troll her and make her look bad but pretty much all doubt was removed after Rose posted a series of vague tweets directed towards her brother on Twitter explicitly referencing many of the events that her brother discussed in the Kiwi farms post and saying that she missed him and wanted to contact him many of the things she mentioned in her tweets directly discussed the family situation her brother had mentioned suggesting the one he had said was true shortly after she posted her tweets she announced on tumblr that her publishers had cancelled the memoir apparently the same court documents I mentioned earlier that rose had sent the publishers to prove her identity had been forged and her publishers caught wind and dropped the book according to Rose she had forged a bit of information in them to protect her own identity but the basic information within the documents was still more or less true regardless of this claim her publishers dropped the book she also mentioned in the post that she now had proof that her brother was safe lending more credence to the fact that her brother was telling the truth shortly after he made that post she deleted both her Tumblr and her Twitter account as of when this video was written she hasn't been heard from since her brother has occasionally posted on the related thread noting that she hasn't contacted him either and has more or less disappeared from the Internet the actual family situation here is a really sad one and it seems like nobody involved is in the right from posting people's private information online to lying about them to sell books it's a really sad and complicated situation for everyone involved and it's hard to imagine that such a large and upsetting controversy grew just from claimed authorship to a fanfiction interestingly the claim that Rose wrote money immoral is actually one of the more plausible things that she claimed to do she seems to have provided her publisher with at least some evidence that she wrote it and her brother seems to think it's possible that she did then again almost everything else was lied about and the only real evidence that we as the audience have is a fiction press account made around the same time as Terra's fan fiction account so did she write it we don't really have any definitive proof either way all we really know about the situation is that it's a really sad one and that hopefully all parties involved are able to get the help that they need that being said personally I don't think she did the story she told about why she wrote the fanfiction that is to locate her brother obviously wasn't true as she knew where her brother was all along she also didn't seem to make any claims as to having written it before March of that year which is when her memoir was being developed her claims that first Raven was a real person who she was trying to impress by pretending to like My Chemical Romance which were later followed my claims that she just made the whole thing up and it was all trolling just don't really make any sense is it possible that she wrote it yes and right now it's kind of the only reliable lead that we have but it's unlikely so where does this leave us at the end of the day despite these bizarre claims we don't really have any concrete information as to who wrote my immortal and my personal opinion is that if the author hasn't come forward after 13 years they've probably never will that being said I feel pretty confident in my belief that whoever wrote it wasn't ultimately serious and that they wrote it to me purposefully bad it is possible that they wrote the first few chapters in earnest and after seeing the response the story received they took it in a ridiculous direction but even then I'm not sure I believe it was ever legitimate I think some of it is just that its level of badness is so carefully curated simple words are frequently misspelled well things like pentagram are spelled perfectly Tom Riddle Dean typo does Tom Bombadil is too perfect to have happened by accident and paragraphs like this so clearly parody many common aspects of bad fanfiction to me this is so clearly a parody of when authors are trying way too hard to find a synonym for said every sentence because some teacher told them not to use said I also think its nature is almost a parody of some of the worst aspects of fan fiction culture is why it resonated with so many people to the extent that so long after it was released we still want to know who the author was many of us who spent a lot of our adolescence reading and writing fanfiction know a lot of the tropes the story called upon and many of us have written less extreme versions of it ourselves I remember laughing so hard when I saw evany first refer to herself as tiny in the story like she obviously started writing Terra and it's clear and he is supposed to be a cooler stand-in for herself and that's like half the fanfiction I read as a teenager and at least three-quarters of the fanfiction site wrote part of what I love about this story is that while people make fun of it they love it too it's not like things like Rebecca Black's Friday where almost all of the mainstream responses we saw - it was abject anger and toxicity the fact that people love this fan fiction in all its badness enough to make live-action adaptations of it and draw fan out of it is I think a testimony to how well this terrible story was able to connect with people much like we love bad movies like the room there's a communal feeling and appreciating stuff like this together and wondering just how serious its creators were in sharing content about it and laughing I also think there's a less wholesome reason as to why stuff like this has remained popular for as long as it has as much as it hits all of those relatability markers for people who liked to read and write fanfiction it also hits those same markers for people who like to make fun of it particularly for people who like to make fun of teenage girls in fandom the story being about a teenage girl who is only interested in pairing herself up with the characters and Viegas vapid as possible definitely serves as a kind of validation for people who don't like young women in fandom and this story kind of serves as an example of everything negative about these stories not to mention when you read these stories that are obviously terrible there's a little bit of superiority you get to feel as a result of that I'm so glad I don't write like that I'm so glad I'm a connoisseur of literature but I also think if the only reason it was popular was that people hated it we wouldn't have seen the response we did see to the reveal that this most recent claim of authorship was likely fake people were really happy when they found out the author of my immortal was a well-adjusted person who was still into writing and were really sad when they found out that wasn't true I think a lot of us want the author to succeed because a lot of us see ourselves in this otherwise goofy story about vampires and my Chemical Romance wherever the writer of this story is now I hope they're doing well and that if they do ever choose to reveal themselves it's of their own volition stay kind and stay gothic a lot of times when I do ed or text Sara's ed to 500 500 ok let's go to credits [Music] on top of a special thank you to all my patrons I would like to especially thank Mohit for joining my $20 plus patreon tier also I
