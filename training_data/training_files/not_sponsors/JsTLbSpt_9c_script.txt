what's your least favorite thing about smartphones that need to feel glued to them constantly paying for screen repairs over and over finding someone promising on tinder and then getting ghosted well if you ask me one of the most annoying things about them is the knotch trend that has proliferated ever since the launch of the iPhone 10 but as we explained in this video the notch wasn't just a design decision meant to be intentionally infuriating the point of it is to house components that can't be embedded inside the screen most notably the front-facing camera but the good news is that we may be getting rid of the knotch for good very soon thanks in large part to the advent of under screen cameras manufacturers like Xiaomi and Oppo are already getting the ball rolling on all screen phones without gimmicks like sliding or motorized selfie cameras and that means that other phone makers probably aren't too far behind so how exactly did they pull this off I mean hidden cameras are nothing new but it's not often that you see them behind an actual working screen so here's how it works your phone's display assuming that you've got a mid-range to high-end model is made up of a layer of OLED pixels that can generate their own light sandwiched between two layers the cathode and the anode that act as electrical terminals that provide a voltage that allows the screen to you know work now it's entirely possible to make the cathode and anode out of transparent materials meaning that you are essentially creating a see-through screen so in a phone with an under screen camera only a small part of the display is actually made to be transparent the area that's hiding the lens so during normal operation that area will function just like the rest of your screen but when you activate that selfie cam the OLED pixels turn off allowing light to go straight through the display and into the camera lens additionally the screen above the camera is made with a special kind of glass that isn't as reflective as what normally covers the display to cut down on glare and Distortion pretty cool right well although this technology definitely has the potential to make all of our phones look a lot sleeker it's still rather new meaning that there are some kinks to be worked out so at this time it's still possible to faintly see the camera behind the screen and the transparent layers and the low reflectivity glass mean that the display also won't look quite as good above the camera when you're not trying to take a photo furthermore there's the small matter of the actual image quality of the pictures that you snap I mean it's certainly a remarkable party trick to be able to bury the camera behind the screen but early reports indicate that the photos don't look as nice as they do on traditional selfie cams that aren't covered up by anything and this makes sense given that the last time I got a good look at a transparent OLED display it clearly pardon the pun didn't allow all of the light through with that said if you're sick of having a notch on your phone the trade-off might be well worth it for you especially if you don't actually take a ton of selfies now at the time of making this video there was no definitive timetable for when phones with under screen cameras would be on the market but all signs point to them coming in the near future as opposed to years down the line so be on the lookout for the long-awaited no compromises all screen phone and then hopefully the tech industry can move on to tackle yet another global crisis like still having to rent cable boxes for some reason speaking of crises if your us section so thanks for watching guys like dislike check out our other videos and leave a comment if you have the suggestion for a future fast as possible that you'd love to see also oh yeah check out the LTTE merch store LTT store calm we have cool shirts and hoodies like some ones I'm wearing oh yeah subscribe
