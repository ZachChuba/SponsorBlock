hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian for today's video we have a them as much appreciation as we can secondly our collaboration is with Manju Rosie on YouTube but more on that later the Scramble for Africa was very appropriately named it was a hectic scramble by the European powers for the vast riches of the lands of Africa if you think about any other colonial movement in history you recognize that it takes an immense amount of time and resources for a nation to settle or conquer another land but in Africa's something entirely new occurred a colonial race using modern medicine weapons and infrastructure the entire continent was nearly swallowed in just 30 years at an unprecedented speed for this reason the very word imperialism becomes obsolete this was new imperialism a rapid paced jingoism that dominated diplomacy between 1881 and 1915 because of the rapid pace the way in which territories and orders were conceded and assigned disregarded the numerous ethno-linguistic divisions of the continent in such a way that would have a profoundly negative effect an effect that can still be observed today but before we can assess the scramble of 1881 we first need to examine both the geography and demography of Africa before the era of widespread European contact in the north of Africa we can find the largest desert in the world the Sahara which divides Africa's so much so that transit is nearly impossible the northern coast of Africa has a more temperate climate and is connected by way of the Mediterranean Sea to Europe and the Near East the most prominent pre scramble nation in the north where the man looks and the Corsair states the North lacked precious resources but the economic value of the region would increase with the discovery of oil and the creation of the Suez Canal as we move south past the Sahara we can find the Niger River around which several states developed most notably the songhai empire the Canaan Borneo Empire and the once affluent Mali Empire this area derived its economic power from trade particularly in gold salt and slaves 2,000 miles southeast is the Congo River which sustained the Congo Kingdom this region which encompassed the expanse of Congo rainforest is one of the richest in the world this along with the river helped the Congo kingdom develop rapidly gold timber diamonds and illicit ivory remain a lucrative business in this region today across the rainforest is the Christian Empire of Ethiopia development it would be one of just two African nations to survive the Scramble gold can be found in the mountainous environment of East Africa which made it in a central trading area below the equator are vast temperate grasslands that contrast sharply with the tropical regions of the north similarly as with the two previous regions their reserves of gold diamonds of copper and ivory furthermore the location of the southern tip of Africa proved to be highly strategic as before the Suez Canal was created all ships needed to pass around the Cape of Good Hope to reach Asia with all of this said one would think that those native to Africa would be able to easily compete with those living in Europe but the few navigable rivers large deserts and dense rainforests acted as virtually insurmountable barriers to communication and the exchange of knowledge in almost all parts of Africa on top of this the spread of malaria for mosquitoes and the dangerous tsetse fly which targeted livestock would stunt the growth of many civilizations of sub-saharan Africa this is how Africa existed up until the late 1400s when the European Age of Exploration was beginning in 1483 the Portuguese explorer Diogo cão sailed up the Congo River and made formal contact with the Congo kingdom the two nations from that point had a close relationship the portuguese introduced the Congolese to christianity and writing while the Congolese provided a valuable source of trading materials and slaves in 1570 Portugal would also establish a colony in Angola and later begin settling in eastern Africa such as in Mozambique by 1600 the plantations of America were so numerous that a cheap source of labour was required to solve this many European merchants began purchasing slaves from the West Africans and importing them to America proving the institution of the Atlantic slave trade in 1652 the Dutch established a colony on the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and in 1784 the British as well as the French had formed colonies in Gambia and Senegal and later Sierra Leone growth in the Dutch and Portuguese colonies were slowed in in many ways fruitless as inward expansion was simply too expensive so the interior of Africa remained almost entirely unknown by the end of the Napoleonic Wars the British had seized the entirety of the Cape Colony from the Dutch because of this the Dutch settlers called the borås would move further inward away from the coast now we're going to start jumping forward a little bit France invaded Algeria over economic disputes the Zulu Kingdom was born and likewise the Orange Free State who were the emigrating Dutch settlers I mentioned it before as the Europeans now had footholds on almost all of Africa's coastal lands the desire to explore the unknown began to grow so explorers set out to map the constant there were three notable European explorers at the time first we have Pierre de brazza who explored from 1872 to 1905 he was an Italian working for France and we become the namesake of Brazzaville the capital of the French Congo after thoroughly exploring the region the second major explorer was Henry Morton Stanley who explored from 1871 to 1886 he was a Welshman working for king leopold ii of belgium who claimed what would become the Congo Free State and maps the great lakes of Africa from which the Nile flows that at the time was a really big deal lastly we have David Livingstone who explored from 1845 to 1872 a Scottish missionary he endeavoured to convert the majority of the interior of Africa and find the source of the Nile unfortunately for him he failed to accomplish both of these goals in 1867 diamonds were discovered in the British Cape Colony and this indicated the potential profitability of investment in Africa the construction of the Suez Canal in 1869 proved to be one of the most ambitious engineering projects ever attempted in many ways the creation of the Suez was the beginning of new imperialism this was because after Egypt encountered economic difficulties from their many industrial projects the Egyptian king was forced to sell all of his shares in the French Suez Canal Company to the British who were the main benefactors of the canal as it allowed them to reach India many living in the region weren't too fond of the Suez Canal and Egyptian economy being dominated by the British so widespread revolts would begin to take place and the British would therefore intervene this intervention led to the British takeover of Egypt events in Egypt and South Africa alerted European public to the vast untapped riches of Africa with the seizure of Egypt by the British other nations frantically tried to seize as much land as they could even if it was available in many ways the Scramble for Africa was viewed by competition who could claim the most land the native Africans were viewed as uncivilized and would not have any say in their sovereignty the Berlin Conference of 1884 laid the guidelines for the partitioning of Africa as time went on Europeans would continue to settle annex and conquer using new weapons and new technology the French would seeds Madagascar most of the Sahara and some parts of West Africa including most of the Niger River the British as mentioned claimed Egypt Kenya and the large swath of South Africa the Germans would be given Cameroon and part of East Africa king leopold ii of belgium was granted the entirety of the congo basin for himself as personal property the congo would see some of the worst treatment of africans out of any European colony with millions dying from forced labour Italy took sections of the Horn of Africa and northern Africa but failed in their invasion of Ethiopia with Ethiopia being the last standing African Kingdom a sentiment of a united pan-african movement began by 1915 the scramble was over but two interesting questions are now posed first what would Africa be like if the scramble never happened to answer that question go over to Mom's Rosie's Channel where he'll be answering that very question the link is in the description second what was life like under European Abul in the scramble to know more on that join us next time for our video on life under imperial rule in Africa thank you for watching I'd like to thank my general staff on patreon Kevin bedroom Jim Taba Dimitri still ermine Jeff Ann Tolec Patrick Reardon Joe Crispin Emmanuel Kang Adam ski Derek Bello and everyone else listed on screen I'd also like to thank those working on the armchair history team researcher and writer Alexander Blake and my graphic artist hair - boss for making this video possible thanks again and I'll see you next time
