all right welcome back to another episode of Minecraft but all loot drops are randomized really really split apart right now where are you like this I had a negative 3200 pot oh yeah that's two thousand blocks away from me 32 47 that's where currently I'm I have a few pillagers looking at a guy just stalking me they just have their crossbows pointed at me it's very ominous dude very very that sense that doesn't sound like very friendly of them I put down a bunch of so to recount them trucks still gotta figure out where the Frick dude we got the the the stuff the blaze rods yeah yeah I see I think you really clarified it there we gotta figure out where the Frick dude dude stuff yeah we have no blaze rod so we can't get to the and then if once we once we a blaze rods we will have everything that we need including bad omen I have bad omen now I just thought I'd do it just thought that I would do it thought you'd do it mmm-hmm everywhere so okay so I I was told last stream in the end of it I should look for what's up you find diamonds I did finally I've been looking for so long well not not so long this episode it's almost immediately this episode but in the alright is it gonna be what we need all right let's see what we got get our hopes up so Jessica said oh hey it's a jungle temple what if it is actually a frickin majest in a jungle temple oh my goodness it drops nothing oh really oh diamond silk touch would have probably been a good good call to have well let's see what the jungle temple holds in store for us okay wait you found a jungle though this is the greatest thing ever situation you know how in a jungle temple you like you step on the trap tripwire and it like shoots an arrow at you oh is it did not shooting arrows it tried to pie me dude it's a pie you put it shot a pumpkin pie at me that's kind of great actually alright what's in the it's shot another I got a grey shelter box dude I mean that's the sort of 3200 mm so I need to go this way and so this is parallel and going there okay so this way and that way all right we got over here dude Rob I'm good at things what we got in this another grace shulker box and have we broken sticky pistons before stinky pistons stinky pistons yeah dude no I don't think we have I don't think we've done sticky pistons we like need to be better about the different types of buttons all the millions of tears you're not wrong create that slab cutter thing what is the the stone cutter yeah um no but that the stone cutter 100 just to make different types of stuff to then break cuz the stone cutter won't yield new things unless you the randomizer recipe thing going on well I mean I was just thinking like you know you we have we find an ax site we put an - site into it and we dodge stairs and all that stuff right no I thought that I have any idea where andesite is and the site is gonna be difficult considering that oh I found a parrot that was one of the things so I was told just a few other things that are like above ground parrots sunflowers and pandas that I should try to find this episode the parrot gives us magenta wool okay which then gives us a gin spruce which we definitely encountered before yeah we've done all that that's not useful and we've definitely done the trip wire guys that's just string on the ground string on the grain string on the ground oh boy so pandas could be somewhere in a jungle oh god oh so you said I just came from having an Electra - not having one so that definitely made that hurt my feet that definitely oh did you jump wait where did you get oh okay I'm with you I had a moment where I was like how did you get an electro how did you lose your light right I said it was that was another that was the point I don't have my trap I just I found it when I go in and get one that help that would be cool dude I think that's a great idea I'm surprised it took you this long to come up with it I'm getting something okay the I I've found a problem with the client yes it's it's help help don't know my knee I'm just I'm just panicking it's fine didn't everything's okay mmm there's a there's a boat that can't be voted alright I got voted off the island so we're 2,000 negative okay so I'm still just just trucking along I meet up with you if not I'm still moving so oh good good well I didn't want to stand still dude I gotta I gotta find what drops the blaze rods which we okay so we have verified though it isn't chokers so we're not like we're not out of luck yes so we know that at least it exists in somewhere that we can find but we know it's not chokers because ye was worth looking just to be sure about that otherwise we literally could have just it would have been the worst luck ever but we gotta running around ever that's a pretty anti-climatic series yeah where it's like well I guess that's just how that is have a good night mm-hmm so that's what would be well I have found major Hills okay and I'm kinda like I guess what direction you said you're moving what direction are you moving is moving in the south southeast direction okay south southeast and I think that means I'm we're kind of moving towards each other do we do you feel like we need more enderpearls I'm seeing some real calm no I got AIDS and you have eight yeah right so pretty good on enderpearls 'ok i don't think that'll be a problem we do have we don't read sand I think we have but yes we definitely have oh I just hit a big ol Mesa yeah there were a lot of mesas and a lot of deserts and a lot of Isis and savannas yeah yeah I don't know there were a lot of mesas we took us a while to find it well there were quite a few once we found the first one we just had to get out of the savanna desert loop that we were in that was like this weird time warp now I'm in quite a significant jungle this thing is not stopping brow and hots this jungle just won't stop can't stop won't stop mm-hmm and what are we looking for up top again that you were saying Kanda sunflower those are a couple things that we haven't run into yet apparently so yeah if we run into any of those um I don't know if there were any other things that that people were saying she was looking at Reid yeah Peretz I just I just got the parrots we'd already got no Frick I forgot I didn't have an Electra again I'm like I'll just float across this gap stop risking your leg this is gonna be real problematic that's gonna really really mess me up I mean again I'm just saying we could get we could get you if we if we go get one okay I have no idea how in this the yeah Auto jump go away Auto jump would actually be well no not Auto jump but like the walking up one block that would be very useful in this jungle the good walking would be useful Auto jump is never useful no never the thing you're looking for all right well I've I've made it to the edge of the jungle and successfully found no pandas I might be heading right back in the direction we came now that I look at I am now heading I'm still heading southeast mostly what what's the chords you got going on I've got negative three thousands 2700 negative 3027 I'm at hey I think sunflowers which we haven't hit before so that's pretty okay that's freaking that's it oh my god you got it all right and there are a lot of songs we never running the sunflowers until now well don't they only spawn and like specific like literally their own biome ah yeah I mean it is it's it's oh yeah sunflower Plains it is its own biome I got a freaking blaze rod dad nice oh my goodness give me all the sunflowers give me a mom oh there's so many there's so many blaze rods dude so many holy crap dude Atlee at least there it sounds like there's multiple there too oh yeah oh this is imagine if you had found it like and it was the you know you found like a mini biome that has one and then when I was out of a barn break land yeah also even the fact that like we frickin we've gone through this far without ever running into any holy crap yeah to do flowers it was sudden flowers I mean it makes sense oh my god orangish like there's a it makes sense okay that's a reach but holy crits like so simple just straight up above the ground Dubrow oh my god I feel like maybe just just for the sake of um you know since there are more people watching you who might have not caught the previous episodes just everyone's caught up this is a day to pack for minecraft that jumbles all of the block drops everything is all wacky so yeah every everything that you drop or everything that you break or demonetized or an alive it drops not what it usually does it could be anything from the game including the loop tables that spawn and chests and stuff this is why we're so that was Valley we found we found some end table or some end chests and that was nice but we you know the goal is to obviously get to the inner dragon and if we get weak frit we do we got it now we can do it okay so we need to just run into another oh you know we might need more Perls because we got to find the note so it's 12 max required for the portal frame if it's completely empty usually a few were filled in we have to find this strong I know it usually doesn't take more than like two or three to find it usually before but okay because they generally don't break most of the time they just drop so throw me your chords alright so I am I try to if you give me yours we can kind of work towards each other oh I guess yeah I mean I was like I need to go to the sunflower biome but I am negative 40 170 2750 out so we're kind of on the right yeah it's basically east-west yeah I'm just heading east and your head and West all right we should get linked up in no time dude you could use your Electra wouldn't it be nice if I had an electric firework we never did find anything that dropped fireworks uh that's fireworks no everything drops fireworks make make sense then then that makes perfect sense on why we never encountered that but the crafting recipes well you can randomize them are not randomized in this series yet the blocks that you need you can make what you want randomize crafting that okay this this one alone is broken my head now that I'm gonna make a shovel oh I just started to double I have random looting and random crafting simultaneously let me tell you your head risk your head just wants to explode dude yeah just what do you what are you even doing with your life basically it's like the problem is in this you can at least kind of make it you can make a notepad document that I then will override and delete it you don't write right yeah like oh you found a good block okay well this is how you got it in random crafting plus random loot drops you don't know what is valuable like you don't you don't know if you if you get like before you have access to a crafting table you get a bunch of random blocks or like I don't know if these are useful so you don't track all of them and then you finally unlock crafting and then all of a sudden it's like by the way you can craft a diamond sword out of the dirt that you had and you're like I don't know how I got dirt how did I get dirt and you're ruined yeah yeah yeah it's Alice that's I mean that's it's a lot oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I love stumbling across just diamond blocks on the ground because snow has melted it's always good you know just some ranges oh just 19 blocks of diamond just chillin on the ground no big deal no big deal what's your x coordinate right now 3600 okay cool we are 300 blocks away from each other that means we're getting closer it's an accurate statement I like you when you're accurate hey you know hey I'm in a jungle that's a good sign yeah go that's a good sign cuz that's where I'm at what's yours equal yes I guess we don't need to kill a panda which is also nice 27:20 okay yeah we don't need to be banned from China but always ideal I don't know a lot of people are getting banned from China recently yeah I mean you know someone there there was a whole thing where one of the streamers you know said something and they were like oh my god you're here you i won oh my gosh probably I'm at 3,400 2,700 that's I'm 34 50 2,700 okay let me just probably like 60 blocks away yeah sounds about right I'm on a tree looking out at things you know said that 3450 27 30 27 29 all right I'm at 27 21 Oh 34 31 34 31 okay I should be on you yeah there you are stay still hey hey bro you got it we could do it we do it we freakin did it we frickin we just we just yay all right so let's see the other thing is though we we still have not run into and we own soul sand from anything I can't remember I mean have we gotten soul sand I don't know I don't know I don't think so I'm pretty sure I don't have any soul sand in here nope all right things can't be with you in the pit okay there you go and I don't think we're planning on enchanting don't eat the lapiz I have a lot of spare blaze rod so I don't think that can issue at all you got as am becoming on you do right nice all right well I'm just giving you an opportunity here before we set sail do you want to catch up on anything we're sure people sure will be or you can craft those and I'll be right back sure thing all right well in the meantime I'll catch up on notifications as well zine interacts with the shanton stuff we get Holly GT

seen yeah I'm talking like you know I thought you were just talking in general terms just just saying your mom's adorable I didn't know I mean I I know people who have quite terrible moms and it's but it's true so it's not a guarantee unfortunately all right that's a bummer I'm just getting up high to a vantage point so I can see where this thing goes [Music] all right alrights forage our way up and see what direction I don't think this is foraging I mean we could be adventuring but I don't think that's foraging all right here we go it's going over there that way all right that's is it gonna break that's always a good sign one of when number one breaks dang I could have more ender pearls right it's so it's so easy to get the cod bro it's so have more Underpants so easy to get the cod of duty dude the cod of duty or we could I mean if we really wanted to go all out we could freakin distance formula this thing oh wow I've done it before right you do the full triangulation yeah I've done it before and I messed up the math Oh haven't done it you've tried it before I've done it before and I messed up the math so I think that's tried it not done it no I've done it before and I messed up the math like we're cutting the loop all right Tarczewski I think we can move further away do you see maybe that's why I'm like we need more interposes because I'm like eh I've moved 100 blocks try it again sort of guy it could very well be that the thing is in the jungle but odds are that it's further odds are that it's further old spawn pill world hey isn't it three I think it's just as if you keep venturing keep going new ones I just don't know what the density is okay but we should say before we stronghold that we would like to say thanks to our response oh yes we would like to do that that is a good good thing we'd like to do so why don't why don't you do that for us well our sponsor is M super hosting they have provided the server upon which we've been playing this

goats dude it's true okay we clambered our way back up after oh hey so Neos think after the 5x so a gif dude that's pretty dope thanks mate thank you for doing fallen Kingdom cuz that was pretty dope travel in silence sorry I just just saying a word okay hey this is a big jungle here's a good here's a good launching spot yeah I'm gonna do a it would be great if we had an electrode be a really good launching spot great I'm more than me I'm above are you are you way high possibly my why is 102 I'm at 94 oh yeah you're only like 8 hired you're low you're super low down alright here we go it's still very much off in the same direction okay oh there you are I see you know yeah just slightly above me you're so low yeah dude now you know how it feels wow wow I you just say wow to the self rose yeah yeah wow he just like I mean you know suicide my words like hours okay excuse me that word is not allowed yeah you're just pseudo coud my monetization on you - yeah yeah there you go have I told you that I very consistently I have stardew valley stuff going up and the stardew valley with h-bomb just every time like I haven't had a mind to monetize every time but every time I start doing valley ones they're like this is evil contest look at this farming and this cute character creation this is not for kids are you guys like cursing a lot no no what happened that makes no sense at all dude monetization stuff ever made any star to valley vegan although I don't know if there's anything else other than vegans so they're not promoting veganism you're promoting pescetarian tsuyoku of animals yeah the sodoku I don't think I can't do this parkour for kid wow you took out the block that I was gonna jump whatever rock whatever my shovel is too good it destroys too many blocks and makes it hard oh man that's the hardest life I've ever heard someone live right now dude sometimes this guy just when he tells me about what he has to deal with oh I can't even imagine the pain I mean III did just feel like I don't really know how to drive again as of like an hour ago so yeah that's so healthy so what's up there like can you clarify a little bit or is it you know I mean no I mean I just I finally got a manual trans I finally got a manual transmission car which I've been meaning to do for quite some time just go I got a little beater so that I can learn it probably yeah make much smoke come out of the clutch and and not have to feel too terribly about it I feel like with you though I mean like a little beater is like oh you know I just got it I just got a small porch not a big one my god dude would you like to know the price of my new car it was 69 thousand dollars it's a pretty decent car for a lot of people yeah but it's not like it's not like a little Porsche okay I don't know maybe you get a little used Porsche alright alright it's still going in the same direction we are we're headed off in this way and it dropped cool alright there we go cool you know I had to I'm not I'm not saying that the car will fit by any means but if we're talking about if say if a gold car for me is a Carrera GT that's that's the price of like a wheel on it and that's so right is it's like you know there's a we have different scales of cars which is fine and you know that's just congratulations you but it was just like I just got a small car and I'm like I don't know if or all it could be just like you know just just that that low model Porsche or you know it's just it's just a I mean it's only it's only a Lexus IS or you know I feel tall I feel like it's better to cause smoked we met from the clutch pedal on a $16,000 car versus a a car that resells now for very high six figures so yeah I think that's a good plan I think that's a great plan and I mean I in my opinion like it's not as prevalent but and it's getting west so obviously but still it's it's never a bad thing to know how to drive a manual cuz yeah I mean if you're in an emergency situation you don't have an automatic but you need to get somewhere then you know and that's all you got then you want to need to be able to move hey I'll have you know I made it from the dealership back home without stalling it or causing anyone to honk at me so I consider that a success I mean III doubt you're doing that badly like I had I learned how to drive a manual on a 1988 Nissan Sentra and it was like I'm pretty sure like my the only thing my dad upgraded on or that was like door handles like it was bare minimum as you could possibly door handles had door handles not upgraded door handle oh just the fact that there were any at all was the upgrade there it was you know the now they'd call it a fleet vehicle they had nothing on it but it that vehicle taught my brother my sister and I all out of Drive manuals so I think you'll be fine you know no I think I'll be okay it's just yet modern clutches can take more even than right it's not a hydraulic clutch I think that those are worse like not positive but I think so we still got weird misdirection it seems to be turning a little to the right oh no phantom forgot about those did you did you pick up the thing I did okay I have it like I even unlocked some recipes but yet no it's it's for me it's mostly just the getting smooth especially with the down shifts sure I mean the down is where all the fun is right yeah if I can figure out how to Rev match I'll be great yeah it's not that hard it's good it's nice when you're you know and your paddle shifting car can does it for you I mean I'm over here going you know what our gears so hey I'm about to start a rage by bringing people who are following us sorry buds just passing through don't mind us enjoy good luck have fun storming the castle all right you want me to do a throw go for it yeah a little bit yeah all right yeah okay and I've even a path here how nice you know the path ended what is the rate bargain to stay forever forever no okay speak of the devil it's gone now we haven't run into any more sunflowers so that's a good sign at least that we weren't just getting super unlucky they are rare I think it's a pretty rare biome dang I don't know how much of all there was a there was a minecraft Monday bingo where one of the things was find a sunflower and so I'm just thinking like man I would have lost that bingo game if we were playing here so did were you in minecraft Monday where you randomly assigned a partner no no yeah I mean they tried to kind of balance him so of you as techno blade were like I'm gonna also partner up with Vic star I mean they were then they were kind of like oh there we go that's progress I was like where did it go it's on the tree um it's and the tree then then they kind of like they were like maybe way me we won't do that you know yeah other what they're like two weeks where they just let they didn't fix that and they just got this like everyone got destroyed why can't they pick this up I think it's still oh it's glitchy rude dude it's glitchy rude it's on an invisible Aki Oh No well well now it's probably just gone oh no no it's really even the creeper didn't fix it even the creeper he didn't fix it are you kidding me look where I ended up though nice oh my got it I built up to it in the sky I love gay rights from the site jump you know frickin Frick dude alright have we do we have it are we good yeah yeah we're good wait do we do we know what phantoms dropped no I don't think never kill I think we did actually but I just wanted a I think we did nothing from that one okay well anyway it doesn't really matter so which direction was that um it was this I I'll throw another yeah okay and it was that way okay good that was not at least on the eye of ender did it did you get it back yeah we're good so 15 we're fine okie-dokie this nighttime jungle situation seems to be if only we had easy access to beds regularly um I do not actually have a sheep right there I have wood I don't know wait oh oh it's behind us way whoa broke alright well this is the first time in a while I haven't had a stronghold that was uh underwater and easy to spot oh I know dude I lived a life of privilege for the last few series alright let's do let's throw it again I guess back here it's right over this water pool it's right over this water pool alright should I throw another and just make sure it goes down yep I guess alright I do let me go maybe we should hear no no no no I'm gonna dig outside the water like right over here okay just don't want water like following us down you know alright I'm glad to permission to end you denied okay cool so you now have the water that's just following what I'm digging thank you now it's good it's gone I blocked it what do you want from me I there was still the REM remaining water and it was just I really very much not worried about mom we don't happen to have torches do we I can see fine okay mister gamma hax gamma hax oh yeah at 55 I guess is probably all are down we go I throw one more why would I mean if you wanted I guess just in case it was like neuroses it isn't super low though we did go a little to the side mmm wait do I have oh I have torches ah that's a smart game you and your story is just so clogged that I totally lose I'm at 28 it's it that seem a little low does seem a little low cuz I'm not seeing oh I hear skeleton over all right I've got a ravine only time we diverge so I'm trying to alright it's it's sort of back behind where I was mining here you alright can't can't do any more though cuz now we're down to 12 in case the portal is completely empty we need these twelve your love on my left it's how many mushrooms water on the left so many mushrooms where is this thing doesn't seem like we'd be we'd easily go under it though I mean I guess it's possible but yeah it doesn't seem likely why are you like this I have found nothing nice we might need to go find more ender pearls Wow ah found it lava oh this is ridiculous great uh hey fire alright so well that's working out well other than the not finding it though I'd say we're dead on uh-huh fire and gay game though find well once again if you would be interested while we're searching around aimlessly for this in catching up with your peeps for a moment you're more that won't do that alrighty hey Daruma Oni Cage thank you for three months Queen rebel thank you for doing two sub gifts much appreciated uh wait is this Oh found it everything we have found it out where okay I see you mine to me I'm old trust me I'm mining to you I spy yeah that gives uh bottles Oh enchanting dude look all right now to locate the portal okay let me see you do it how many bottles have been chanting can I get and this is a village oh this is a pillager it's a pillager stronghold chest thing that's what it is that's what what is it that every single stronghold ever has ravines intersecting with it and is all goofy and makes you worried that it's not that it didn't render right and so every single why little did not render properly though I you know I mean I feel like I've been in strongholds where I couldn't find it for ages really happen but that one race to the end one where we couldn't find it at her like approximately 18 years yeah that was a real unfortunate situation that I did not enjoy that one that one the issue was that it spawned in what looked like it was the end of the stronghold structure and in fact it was not it was not this where we dug in yeah I'm just saying if I guess that's just a dead end are you smarter down here but apparently not much no silverfish I guess that can be anywhere through here real nice dead ends there the only the beautiful list of dead ends for us there's so many dead ends what is this strolled every stronghold ever drives me bonkers I got right to where you were there's definitely nothing over there hey ha you found it no why do you do these things not because I put a walked off a bunch of silverfish and was outsmarted I'm with my cunning use of doors let's briefly impress it more in here oh hello I found another wing oh you did nice oh yeah there we go now what if the what if it's just completely separated from the rest holy cow oh here we go this looks more like it found a finish found it yay yay okay that was not trying to hit you I was trying to hit the you're just just about to kill me it's fine Bing bong bong all right is there anything we need to do like oh oh let's totally make beds with the hole that I just threw out Plus do you have I have some wool and I have wood that just seems smart so that we don't like you know spawn cherry from here yeah yeah you know that was that was the thought there was maybe nice have to do you might have a what night you do have wait till nighttime we could just time said night if we want to skip some time I need three wood for a bow yeah well I wasn't like I was thinking share the bed but you know time time said night cool alright that'll just make it easier good night sweetheart well it's time to sleep doo doo doo doo doo alrighty can I get rid of that totem into the offhand oh I never got to apply flame well it might if I do this will it not attack oh wait I have an idea I can do that right now yeah if you put on the inner dragon head it doesn't realize that you're not an Ender Dragon nice I've got a plan guys I've got a plan normally we didn't have access to the dragon head prior to the dragon all right I've been saving this enchant for so long it finally got it flame bow boys flame bow hey you know what I'm gonna I'm going to put on braking on mine good good yeah yeah put a broken that's that's a funny you don't want to break you don't want to break huh so here's hoping I don't fall down to my death I'm gonna throw a nineteen blocks of diamonds right nineteen block don't forget don't forget you need blocks to block up to things not gonna throw away nineteen blocks of diamonds I'm gonna not do that that's are all the blocks that I have but we can't well we don't know if we could get a solid block I'm making I'm making solid block oh I guess there's an oh that's true we don't know what they'll make if you make solid blocks of iron iron blocks yeah I'm literally making blocking writers I've six wool 19 blocks of diamonds let's just hope our aim is pretty good with the bows yep cuz you don't want to go all the way up and then get shot and yeah oh my ender chest has lots of stuff in it dude mine is Oh some stuff that isn't terribly useful alright we yeah it seemed useful to time eight check it check it I got wheat with hay bales we're ready alright yeah we out here let's do it I'm just glad I remembered so that you know if it's Rick bro I need water I need a water that's some bad that is I mean I have something I have my bucket but we haven't seen any fountains I don't think there was definitely water up here okay or somewhere there is water somewhere true true water I here's dude I hear water I hear that I water I hear that red water that red hot water no I hear literally water oh do you actually yes okay that's lava though that's not necessary that's the bad water so why are you live letting it just cascade in that's it there you go listen there I mean I do hear water I do - okay good lavas the bad water is this water hmm seems to be up because I can't hear it if I go down that's that's my deductive reasoning it's so loud right here it's like I'm next to it that's that's the bad water that's what I ran into I'm using on my blog I just blocked the water with wool definitely see I found water I found water we're at oh nice I do see it now you you can you can follow you can follow the water mm-hmm cool all right that'll do it there we go junk throw out yep get rid of those red mushrooms I do have a lot of wood in case we need to build up though so yeah I have and a very an eclectic a collection of things at this point okay well in case we do a Henry do that I'm gonna store some wood in here I guess and build with diamond blocks sounds good I mean I'll put some diamonds in case we need to respawn so we can make some they've been pretty good pretty quick oh that's good point good point is trying to just trying to you know it's not only we go the acacia route and just use my acacia wood to make case your doors but works too in case you didn't think about it alright are you ready yeah well that was a quick oh oh all right good thing we could jump off that what does it do nothing okay even so touch it does is if not nothing that's good I mean in stone wouldn't do different anyway would it no it's it's the it's the resultant block not the original yeah okay well welcome nice shot you missed don't worry about it I missed again what the heck what the hell you if you would stop missing got it Shh oh come on that was on what so where's the dragon it's an interesting question and what I'm kind of concerned about [Music] where's the dragon not let's not worry too much uh what it's fine everything's fine maybe the dragon spawned is a vegetable wait this has never happened ever before oh wait there's no there's no fountain there's no dragon hang on let me just zip around a little bit see if I can find it in the corner or something no but is there's no one there's no fountain well I mean the fountain only shows up when it dies right No the fountain is just empty and then the portal fills in when the dragon remember the dragon flies on to the fountain then attaches to it as right we what do we just we're playing completely vanilla yeah minecraft that's a bug there's my home here we just found a no ender dragon bug in Minecraft that's an even bigger like random thing than the randomization itself what the heck dude I want to regenerate this seed in you know in like a single player world and I want to see if this is like no no I'll did that's for my own research but I want to see if it's like reproducible I mean I could try and spawn an ender dragon if we want to fight it behave with no fountain to attach to I really don't we could summon left to summon there's fun for it is there a spawning know what this is honestly this is a bigger accomplishment like we have accomplished much on this day I mean is that really an accomplishment I think it is playing this game I mean I have been playing this game for over nine years and I have never seen this yeah we'll wait somebody else could do this right now that'll go to the end and and see is there a way to fetch the world seed yeah you just type slash seed okay yeah now that we can do that without people like being like hey what you're looking for is over here okay yeah there's a seed everybody do you want me to do summon or no um I mean we might as well I'm curious what happens if you summon it with it with no fountain for it to attach to assuming this is I mean you know it doesn't seem like it's a complicated command but it doesn't work okay that's I I knew that one was 117 or one seven so I wasn't sure whether or not oh god it's a mess the new summoned perch stuff with everything in JSON you know it's just I don't know /summon Ender Dragon do do do hey hi hello that worked just boss watch it just fly into oblivion and like not know where the oh just it's just attempted to shoot at me so that's good but we're just gonna have to do bows I think because we can't actually like I'm a leader I'm a boss bar yeah moment well it must have a certain amount of health true makes sense looking for its fountain got it nice dude well yeah we're gonna have no idea how much health it has ow careful you get hit then it'll take damage and I wonder if if like spawning an end portal in creative mode less people are gonna be doing to test the seed does anything different if we had to like enter it via the legitimate portal I don't know but there is only one end here there's no different end so I don't know weed those shots someone said that they did it and there was an ender dragon this is bizarre I wonder how it happened I wonder what circumstance now what out-out oh yeah the purple stuff dude wait is it less landing its landing it's so much it's just like here's where you go we're just gonna have to hope that this isn't an invincible ender dragon yeah that's that's also a thought I I really like with your sabai yeah she went like two blocks up it's like oh wait is there actually a fountain underground it could be that there's the fountain on the ground yeah but the dragon straight-up didn't spawn so I feel like there just isn't one how would it have decided right there's where to land though it must know hey like that's where it was supposed to spawn a fountain and it just didn't here it goes again why all right he get a dragon that appears to be quite confused now it dropped a minecart chest here's how you get me yeah go ahead and take all the levels wait what where I don't even see the levels I got 21 levels that's not very many levels okay well that's all that he dropped you dropped one orbit well we're stuck here ya know uh the this is this is our life now here in the end we're stuck on it and it didn't spawn a gateway to go anywhere else so no okay but I suppose this is the end that's huh all right um I guess that's where we wrap up the series yeah that's why they say I mean you know what it's where we it's where we go so guys thanks for watching our random craft playthrough it's been a little strange having everything I guess spectator having everything be so odd yeah there's a whole lot of
