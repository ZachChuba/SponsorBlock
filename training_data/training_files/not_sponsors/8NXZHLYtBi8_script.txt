today using the link in the video description this year as far as I knew coming into this Intel wasn't supposed to have any new CPU products on display and yet there's the commemorative like 40 year anniversary of the original 8086 CPU that we're gonna actually we found one here on the floor we're gonna go check that out later that thing launched also they're giving away 8086 of them just freaking crazy maybe we'll link the details to that down below and then we swung by the ROG booth again and this was not here yesterday so they're calling this our roadie Dominic's Dominus Dominus 16 phase ROG concept motherboard with some kind of classified CPU in it and I have gone out of my way to ask all of the Asus people here as little as possible because as soon as they tell me anything about this I'm gonna be like honorbound to not say anything because Intel is being extremely tight-lipped about what's going on in here and I have seen some pretty dumb SH not the word I'm looking for but some pretty unlikely speculation about what exactly is going on here so first of all let's bring up so they're letting us run Cinebench this is this is freaking awesome they're letting us run Cinebench so we've got a score from last time 6,000 points we can't bring up CPU said but we're allowed to run Cinebench so let's see if we can count how many cool old crap ok it's going to be pretty hard for us to count how many course it has which pretty much tells me everything that I need to know because a lot of people wouldn't recognize this socket but I've actually been working on a 6 video editors one CPU project for a while so I've got a Seuss's dual LGA 36 47 socket WS see bored and it's got a socket that looks an awful lot like that now we know Intel isn't launching any new CPU architectures right now so we can speculate that this is probably based on the same socket and a similar CPU to the 28 core max chips that I've been running for that project we also know that because there's six memory slots it is either triple channel which would be a total blast from the past or it is six channel memory which again would suggest that this is going to be very similar to Intel's server grade xeon platform now i was a little bit critical of xeon w because as far as we could tell it's basically a core i9 with ECC memory tacked on to it for a few hundred extra dollars and intel didn't seem like they were going to be supporting the high the very high-end workstation with these server only chips is something like that going to happen well based on that the bottom third or so of this board seems to be recycled from the sage i would say that could happen and based on their their concept grade 16 phase power delivery system up here i would say that they are probably going to allow overclocking which is incredibly exciting okay so the one thing that they'll tell us about this other than that it's 16 phase and that it's running some kind of classified cpu is that this power delivery setup up here check this out you got to 24 pins in there's one over there there's one down here and then i can't actually find them all but it would appear as though there are yeah here they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 a combination of for 8 pins and 2 6 pins that appear to be designed to power the CPU socket alone over here there's no vrm this is just more heatsink with more fans 6 and this thing should provide up to 2,000 watts of power like 20 100 watts or something like that okay so to put that in context the 18 core extreme edition core i-9 can suck back about 500 watts underwater or about a thousand under liquid nitrogen so I wouldn't be surprised if they were building this thing for liquid nitrogen which might tell us that if this is a 28 core CPU we were to overclock it to I don't know let's say four point something high five gigahertz who knows it could pull as much as a thousand watts of power that it's like that's like thread Ripper what thread Ripper and here it is where the one and only dur a Tower is that how you pronounce it dictator no I'm just kidding Viktor power has got an 8080 6k running on I don't know some kind of motherboard it's covered in like automotive shop cloth and a liquid nitrogen pod anyway the point is they've got it running at 7.1 gigahertz at the moment and we've got a shot of CPU Z up here which will tell us a totally unrealistic speed that you might get it running at if you're basically him and nobody else it also tells us it's six fours twelve threads so basically an 8700 K and unfortunately that's pretty much all there is to it from his testing he figures it's about as good as a good 80 700 k not like super special bins or anything like that and you do get a special badge in CPU said it says 40th anniversary but other than that this is mostly meant to be a commemorative skew and any rumors about soldered IHS or anything like that seem to have been exaggerated so I guess that's pretty much it for random Intel CPU launches we free at the link in the video description so don't miss any of our Computex 2018 coverage guys we will see you at the next booth wool wool oh we're gonna give them more gonna make them sick Dennis
