welcome back to new rockstars I'm Eric vos here with my buddy and fellow star wars obsessive Danny Paquette ski hey guys star wars episode 9 the rise of Skywalker just released a final trailer that made us feel every emotion all at once oh yeah we are what a mess and after breaking down the trailer shot-by-shot we realized most of our curiosities were coming from just two seconds of trailer footage no not Threepio yanking his own brains out or Rey facing Mecca Palpatine or whatever form is in there no this shot Rey and kylo in a white tinted room their lightsabers shattering a statue kylo has his broken mask fused back together Rey is holding a mysterious dagger and there are even more clues that keep popping up in the shot the harder you look at it yeah Danny and I are convinced that these 58 or so frames shed more light on the still very secretive plot of the rise of Skywalker more than any other footage JJ Abrams has been willing to show us we are gonna dive back into the trailer in this episode of explain whatever warning in case we speculate too accurately on what might actually be in this movie's plot and thanks to privacy comm for sponsoring this episode if you go to privacy calm slash to new rock stars you can get $5 today to use on any purchase online for free ok this setting is unlike any other location we've seen in the rise of Skywalker footage or any location we've seen in the force awakens or the last Jedi it contains the lined and dotted lighting patterns that we've seen on the Death Star and the second Death Star in the original trilogy yeah the truth is always in the fixtures and we have gotten confirmation from the good folks that the Star Wars show at Lucasfilm that this location is quote kylos Vader's shrine now the thing that they shatter has one large piece that stays intact as it falls you can see the curved edge of the charred Vader mask that kylo was revealed to possess in the force awakens but question our Rey and kylo intentionally collaborating to code destroy this shrine or are they dueling in their blades swing out of control and accidentally caused this collateral damage yeah notice to the far right of the frame there's a bunch of debris on the ground from some other mess that was happening so they're either going down the line to deliberately break each item down like they're tearing down a wall in Extreme Makeover Home Edition move that bot or their fight is kind of like Grenada and big little lies smashing their husbands boys the biggest detail is the dagger that Rey holds Erick speculated in his breakdown that this could be the dagger of mortis from the Star Wars animated series but what is that thing exactly okay yeah the dagger of mortis was introduced in the mortis trilogy of Star Wars the Clone Wars obi-wan Anakin and ahsoka tano encountered three cosmic beings with godlike powers named the Father the Son and the daughter now the Sun represents the dark side of the force the daughter represents the light side of the force the father keeps him in balance but he seeks the prophecy a chosen one Anakin Skywalker to maintain the balance after he's gone but Anakin refuses the daughter takes w-wanted to the altar of mortis to retrieve the dagger the only thing that can kill the son ultimately the son uses a dagger to attack the father who kills the daughter by accident the father stabbed himself with a dagger all three beings in the bed many believe this is what tipped the cosmic scales into chaos allowing later on the Emperor and Vader to take over in Revenge of the Sith but that is a lot of lore from the animated series that live-action movie goers will be expected to understand yeah two words for you Darth wall but you know you are right it's all canon but it's a big jump from the animated to live-action worlds and that's why I think if raised dagger is revealed to be the dagger mortise the backstory of the father daughter and son might only be implied in the thematic way like there are definitely parallels there with Rey as the daughter kylo as the son and maybe Luke as the father trying to maintain the balance damn I mean that's deep I did not expect the animated series to matter this much I think I need to take a little bit of time to notice okay you do that Danny get five dollars off your first purchase now okay I'm back and I've put some thought on how this could relate to what Ray and kylo are doing together first where are they based on the evidence we've seen this Vader shrine is likely some room or vault in the ruins of the second Death Star that kylo established and we know that these ruins are not located on Endor they're located on a new oceanic moon called kev beer according to the Disney Star Tours right yeah and based on trailer footage it doesn't seem my gray will be alone in her exploration of these ruins spin appears on that trench wall as well and if you look even more closely at that room behind them that looks like Chewbacca's BOE caster and bandolier on the shelf why would Chewie part ways with those like did he offer them to Rey to help her is he in the other room taking a dump I I had a bad feeling about this so it seems like part of the movie will feature the main characters venturing to catch beer to explore the ruins of the second Death Star and while their race stumbles into kylo Ren and the shrine they to be assembled inside these ruins they shatter a number of artifacts that kylo had collected like Vader's Burt mask but also artifacts that Palpatine spirit might have possessed according to the Star Wars lore past dark figures like darth nihilus and momen possessed objects and since Sidious was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis the wise it is possible that Sidious knows all kinds of unnatural ways to circumvent death one of the haunted objects could be this dagger which may or may not be connected to the dagger of mortis perhaps the dagger when tampered with awakens the spirit of Palpatine triggering his rise in a long-forgotten element of his infamous contingency plan operation cinder that's the plan from the shattered Empire books in Battlefront 2 in which Palpatine left behind pre-recorded orders to devastate various planets in the event of his death the old-school Star Destroyers hidden under the ice rising in trailer footage each featuring a new super cannon they could all be part of that operation and it all could have started right here inside kylos weird mancave what is your theory for what is going on in this seat comment down below with your thoughts and thank you for joining me Danny it's nice to have someone who loves Star Wars as much as I do to tag-team these weird explanations with having a boss and thanks for keeping track of all the animated
