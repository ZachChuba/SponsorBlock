hey everybody guess what time it is it's Polyphonic o'clock AKA time for the fourth polyphonic Q&A blump blump blump um blah but um but um ya know it's time for the it's time for the fourth QA before we get started I just want to to watch with your free 30 days alright let's let's get cracking right off the bat I'm gonna hit about half of the questions in one go am I gonna do a video on X I don't know I really don't know I just do my videos as they come to me I have scripts that I sit on for months other times I just wake up with an idea and write a video so there's really no plan to this stuff I do videos on what I feel like making a video on this doesn't mean you shouldn't request stuff to me but at the end of the day even I don't know what video I'm gonna do next until I do it so that answers some of those questions now let's hit some quick ones right off the bat I'm gonna see how many of these I can hammer out in a few seconds favorite instrument Hammond b3 organ last concert I went to shaky graves favorite new artist Haley Hendrix what's my favorite Nirvana songs uh Frances Farmer will have a revenge on Seattle what recent album has impressed me the most room 25 by no-name was incredible favorite Led Zeppelin song no quarter and favorite part of a song is the break from the middle of fool in the rain where it cuts back in and yeah favorite Beach Boys song I feel flows what's my name Noah do I play any instruments yeah bass guitar piano and harmonica none of them particularly well Beatles influenced big favorite album by them probably Abbey Road maybe revolver favorite Steely Dan album Royal scam alright I think that that's a pretty good quickfire so I want to get into a bit of discussion on nebula in case you didn't see nebula is a new streaming service that we launched with a bunch of creators we're trying to fight the the toxic negative atmosphere that is YouTube right now with our own platform that's curated by us that isn't ads supported and and that really just gives us a place to play around experiment and do weird stuff and you guys have had some questions about nebula so I'm gonna answer them as best I can oh yeah and if you want to go to this awesome site you can go to watch nebula comm slash polyphonic all my videos are there with no sponsors no ads no blocking nothing so yet go go give it a try there was a seven day free trial you can at least give it a shot one of the biggest questions I was asked was will the rest of my led zeppelin's epic series be uploaded on YouTube no it will not those are nebula originals I made them for nebula I wouldn't have made them if it weren't for nebula so that's that's where they're gonna stay and it's just five bucks for a month or you can do a 7-day free trial if you don't want to check it out that's completely fine too like I'm not gonna force your hand but it would help me a lot and yeah so yeah those videos aren't gonna be on YouTube they're just there for there for my nebula fam if you can only afford to back patreon or sign up for nebula which one helps me more I mean it's an interesting question patreon more money goes directly to me but patreon I'm also at the whims of a platform nebula I personally have some say in how this stuff goes it's created literally by us by creators so right now I would say if you wanna if you really want to help me go give nebula a shot I want to I think we could do something with this and I really want to try will nebula be able to protect me from copyright strikes I've gotten a few questions about nebula and copyright so basically nebula is a safe harbor under the DMCA and the big difference is that nebula is going to presume that the Creator is operating under fair use that's not something that YouTube does unlike YouTube nebula has no relationships with copyright holders outside of their creators and no real incentive to offer any service to copyright complaints beyond those required by federal law so that provides a level of safety and a level of presumption that YouTube doesn't apply where my videos are fair use I use small pieces of a wider hole I use them for transformative purposes these all fit within laws in various different countries have versions of fair use so nebula is gonna presume that me and other creators are actually using that and if someone wants to challenge that they can but we're starting off from a point of assuming we're fair use which is far more than YouTube gives YouTube automatically any use of any copyrighted work that gets flagged is assumed to be not fair use and it's a real messed up system Jack Smith asks will nebula lead to collaborations with other creators that's the hope I really hoped to do some weird different stuff and some stuff outside of the music realm too that's one of the things I really like about nebula I think it's gonna encourage experimentation collaboration and just getting weird with other creators which is is is something that I've wanted to do for a long time and I haven't fully had the means or platform to do so on a common question is right now the nebula app is iOS only but Android is coming we have no venture funding we're developing this stuff as we go also PayPal integration is coming up some people have asked that - and am i planning on releasing all my videos on YouTube and people have also asked about kind of the relationship of which videos I'm releasing on YouTube which ones I'm releasing on nebula I'm gonna be releasing regular weekly videos on YouTube that's not gonna change but I'm gonna be doing nebula originals that are gonna be specific to nebula some of them will be kind of outside of my format some of them will be more ambitious stuff that I need some more funding or some help with um yes so there's gonna be some nebula originals coming I have a bunch of ideas in the chamber that I need to figure out how to execute on Joe Reich said that I mentioned some of my videos were demonetized or straight-up blocked he asked which ones those are so usually when they are blocked I trimmed songs down and re-upload them so there's countless videos where I've trimmed clip clips and clips of songs down but for exam my beetles love I no matter how small the sound clips no matter how transformative the piece pretty much anything got flagged and auto blocked and so that video actually has big snippets missing from the audio if you watch but on nebula it's completely intact my Jack white my first Jack white video is blocked in some countries it's not blocked on nebula you can watch it from wherever you want but going forward I'm gonna upload the first version of something I make on nebula so a lot of the time you'll see stuff with kind of longer song clips I'll let the music breathe a little more whereas on YouTube a lot of the time I just need to cut things shorter to the point where it's actually absurd some of the stuff that I can't do I think that's about it for the nebula questions thanks for asking and thanks you guys nebulas rollout was really bigger than we expected um it's already doing really well and your guys support is a big reason for that and I'm really excited to see what nebula has to offer so please just just give it a shot um really that's all I can ask if you don't want it that's fine too but really it means a lot to me so now let's go on to some some questions about stuff um where to start fun fact the the order I'm actually answering these questions and probably isn't the order that they're gonna appear in the video cuz I am gonna edit the sound around so who knows what are my biggest dreams for this platform or in life as a whole um I want to keep making cool videos and keep pushing myself eventually I kind of want to start to branch out to some more documentary work I have a documentary series that I've had in mind for years that I really want to make so hopefully I'll be able to get a chance to see that into fruition sometime and for life in general I want to keep making cool stuff about music I want to be a parent sometime that's that's a high aspiration for me I want to retire young enough to drop off them happen live at a cottage and that's that's basically those are those are the dreams how do i balance facts and opinions carefully and the second half of that quest kinda gets to get to that what's my academic background I'm trained in journalism so that's really where everything I do comes from it comes from a journalistic background so I try to be objective with my facts but I also I do have opinions and I try to make it pretty clear when things are my opinions even though I think it's kind of implied a lot of the time but ya know it's just it it's a careful balancing act but it kind of comes naturally I think to me I don't put that much thought into it it just it feels right that kind of goes into a few other questions did I study music or anything related to cultural sciences or ethnology I did some music studies in my undergrad and I I've always toyed with the idea of doing a master's in musicology but that seems like a lot of work yes so and and then I minored in English Lit which also helps with a lot of this stuff uhm did I ever want to work in radio yeah I absolutely did I love radio I'd still love to work in radio I've had a podcast I've had I've worked in radio a little bit in my undergrad I did a news show on the campus radio station and one of my courses also air shows on the campus radio station so yeah I'd I really liked radio a lot what made me develop my animation style combination of a couple things mostly just feeling stuff out putting my best spin on stuff I saw from creators like nerd writer or Captain Christian and then I also this is so so my my graphic design background is making forum signatures on hockey forums shout-out to the VHL so you know that's where a lot of my kind of graphic design background comes from and I've transposed that into video editing when did I first realize music is the topic I want to study in depth pretty young I growing up as a kid I actually wanted to be a sports journalist um but then the Leafs were really really bad when I was in high school and I developed an interest in music so that kind of shifted me towards towards music and music journalism honestly like like ninth grade maybe is probably when I first realized I wanted to do music journalism and it's kind of stuck with me since what do I think of Bill I just think he's awesome and weird I really wish that I had that the creative chops that he does and the comedic chops that he does doing a polyphonic video on him maybe but I think part of the charm of Bill Wirtz is that he just defies explanation and definition and I think when you try to boil it down in the way that polyphonic does I think you might I just I just don't think it'll play well but maybe who knows do I read music related books um sometimes I'll often read snippets of books on google books or things like that and and I do have I do have a few books on Bob Dylan and on the Beatles and stuff but generally my sources tend to be from interviews I watch and listen to a lot of interviews from artists and read a lot of articles in like music magazines so it tends to be more magazine stuff than book stuff but every now and then I'll pull stuff from books um please explain why I hate Bryan Adams know what do I say to people who don't respect comedy or novelty music I say listen to Tim Minchin and listen to Flight of the Conchords I think comedy music is awesome and I think making music funny is a really difficult task and I think it's a shame that people kind of overlook how brilliant it can be when you meld comedy and music together don't go to my channel says that I enjoy reading but can I suggest some comics that everyone should check out that's actually that's why it's funny you should ask that because I think everyone should check out saga and I'm starting a podcast about it so me and Jonathan from make stuff both love saga so we've started a podcast where we're reading through saga issue by issue it's called horns and wings stuff is on the screen for where you can go check it out it is either live now or coming live soon so so saga is probably my favorite thing ever written so that's one and then also if you want more comics Jeff Lemire read more Jeff Lemire everybody read sweet-tooth read ascender read Essex County of course um the underwater welder uh just every everything Jeff Lemire touches is solid solid gold and I love it Oh black hammer - oh my god black hammer is so good yeah Jeff Lemire I I stand Jeff Lemire my favorite YouTube channels okay so in in the music realm Volks Geist middle 812 tone all these guys are just just absolutely awesome so go check them out outside of the music realm I'm a giant contra points fan I think she's awesome um I like Steve dangle a lot he makes hockey videos nerd writer was always a big influence on me I've watched a lot of crash courses also I got to give a shout-out to the plain bagel my buddy Richard he does awesome videos on Finance so so so check him out to do I think artists intend the things that critics like myself rave about such as metaphorical meanings or complex key changes I really don't know I think sometimes they do I think often it comes naturally but I don't think that that I don't think that cheapens the analysis in any way I think that that's part of the fun is kind of speculating on whether this was done on purpose or not and I think there was there's a lot of subconscious stuff going on and I think to go back to some of my favorite youtubers I think when you look at stuff like what twelve-tone does where he looks at these popular songs through a theory lens you see that whether these people knew it or not they had something intuitive that would make this song sound good and they might not have even known that the theory behind it but by looking at the theory we can understand what it was that they were intuiting do I ever plan on setting up a polyphonic discord there is a polyphonic discord available to my patrons but as of right now I'm opening it up to the public so you can go there don't be a dick talk about music um yeah it's for my patrons there's still gonna be a specific private channel but but yeah hopefully it can turn into a bit of a place to talk about music what are my top five Dylan albums in no particular order blonde on blonde bringing it all back home desire blood on the tracks and I want to say time out of mind I really do yeah probably time out of mind what video editing software do I use Adobe Premiere and some After Effects do I use specific third-party plugins no I have never used a third-party plug-in in my editing the first band that I that really like to really got me into music growing up I listened to a lot of blue rodeo great big sea tragically hip stuff like that but the first bands that I've really discovered on my own and got into where my brother and I got really into Billy Talent and then some 41 I love some 41 the first album I probably bought myself would have probably been a half hour of power by sum 41 and then I also got really into the Red Hot Chili Peppers they were another big band that made me super into music do I know her appreciate foreign artists not not nearly enough um I like Jacques Brel a lot Browns really cool and not foreign to me but I mean foreign is also just a completely relative term but a French language band that I like his car quoi - um what's my favorite music genre good music and who are my favorite bands in that genre good bands are there any artists I hate so much that I would never cover on this channel no maybe ah you like jazz yeah it's a b-movie it's a meme uh in my fan of musical theater yeah I'm not like a big musical theater nerd but I like musical theater some of my favorites I like Phantom of the Opera I saw it in London's West End and it blew my mind seeing it live Hades town is incredible I've always loved Aeneas Mitchell's album and now that it's a musical it's really cool too obviously Jesus Christ Superstar the Lion King musical oh my god if you get a chance to see the Lion King musical it is it's one of the coolest things you will ever see why is rock died off in popularity so I think there's a couple of reasons for this but I think what it really boils down to is rockgut kind of stale and I think the reason rock got stale is that for a long time like most of the people making rock were middle-class white dudes now before you go yelling at me in the comments yes there were exceptions and no I don't have a problem with middle-class white dudes I am one it's just when an entire genre is made up of people of similar backgrounds it's bound to get homogeneous and that's why as middle aid has said I think some of the most interesting stuff in rock right now is happening through women and and I think you can add people of color to that um the other side is I think Rock died off for the same reason jazz died off which is that it just got amalgamated into everything everything draws from rock now from time to time just as rock and everything else drew from jazz so I think that that's in short part of the reason Rock died off and also just I don't know music comes in Em's and flows people people like things differently why did why does anything die off why do we exist what is time uh who's my favorite drummer guitar rhythm and lead bassist and keyboardist um so my favorite drummer is probably Stevie Wonder my favorite rhythm guitar is probably Hendrix his rhythm guitar playing is incredible my favorite lead guitar if I can't pick Hendrix again might be mark and AH Fleur my favorite bassist there's a whole lot I like a lot of bassists but today I'm feeling Charles Mingus and keyboardist John Paul Jones his his keyboard work is severely overlooked I love John Paul Jones am i from Texas no I'm from Ottawa Miranda asks what it meant in my video on trans people when I said it was a personal topic for me I I have some people in my life that are trans that I care and love about very much and I think it's one of the most important issues of our day so so that's why it's a personal topic for me and she also asked if I could do a video on to pimp a butterfly I did it was the first video I ever made that second I ever released and I hate it now but I wanna I definitely want to redo it or do do some more Kendricks someday vinyl collection yeah here's a picture pick from that what you will it's not my whole collection it's the ones that are in this cabinet my opinion on the yesterday movie I I think it's fun do I think it undermines the Beatles influence on history I really don't care that much I think it's a fun movie if you can suspend disbelief who do we gripe to at YouTube about their crazy ideas of fair use I have no idea my channel and and try it out learn something new and on that I think that's that about it for the Q&A this week thank you all so much for your support thanks for your questions I'll do another one of these sometimes there are they're always fun so yeah bye you
