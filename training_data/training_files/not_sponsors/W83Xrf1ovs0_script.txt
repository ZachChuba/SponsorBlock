[Music] last time on dragon ball z the fusion dance has saved us the battle between goku and frieza culminated in the strongest fusion yet gogeta with planet namek saved and frieza defeated the z fighters return to earth in peace vegeta and napa head to earth in search for the dragon balls once more however a new challenge is ahead will fusion be enough to take on the threat android fusion what if goku and vegeta learn fusion early after returning to earth the z fighters reunite with their friends and family at capsule corp the celebrations are short-lived when vegeta and napa arrive the earthlings are nervous as they get into fighting stances but goku simply smiles at them he asked vegeta if he came for a rematch the prince responded that kakron knew exactly what he was there they both had felt the power of super saiyan within them as they fused goku said that yeah their hair changed and now he wants to figure out how to do it on his own in exchange for helping him figure it out vegeta promises not to bring any more harm to earth napa comes up from behind goku picking him up and telling him that he wants to turn into a super saiyan as well goku chuckles he offers his hand down to the begrudging vegeta who accepts it for the next few months goku trains vigorously with vegeta in order to unlock super saiyan without fusion both nappa and vegeta were allowed to stay at capsule court napa tried to join in the sparring but he was unable to keep up with goku and vegeta's intense training sessions sensing his frustration dr briefs and his wife suggested to not by that one day he should try a new hobby so he could try to relax bulma's mother asked if napa would like to join her in watering her garden napa rejects that first of course but he changes his mind when she gives them some fresh baked cookies napa thinks that he wouldn't have liked menial labor but over time he started to enjoy it along with spending time with the married couple one year of peace passed by during this time goku and vegeta were both able to unlock super saiyan through their extreme sparring after they had transformed vegeta live triumphantly as he stared down at goku challenging him to a fight goku agrees but not now he needed to head back home or chichi would kill him so they settled on fighting each other the following day but that rematch wouldn't come as the next day the z fighters congregate as the familiar key approaches earth frieza he had survived not only that but there was another powerful key signature napa gulped and vegeta grit as his teeth it must be king cold vegeta yells at napa to put away the water and the plants as they both fly off towards the key signature the z fighters the saiyans and even bulma arrive at the wasteland where frieza's ship landed as mecca frieza and king cold come out of the ship with their soldiers goku vegeta and the dragon team are there to greet them the z fighters stand before the spaceship as a platoon of frieza soldiers line up in front of the spacecraft they salute both king colt and the mechanized frieza exiting the ship goku steps up and asks frieza what he's doing on earth the alien chuckles explaining that he intends on having his revenge once and for all making them all suffer before destroying this back water planet frieza transforms back down into a second form confusing goku and the others he says that he should thank them for teaching them something important back on namek that teamwork is sometimes required to get the job done frieza asks king cole to get in the position as he claps his hands together in the light it has been years since he danced in public with his little boy which causes everyone especially frieza to wins and cringe everyone watches the gnaw as the two tyrants fuse into one cresa due to frieza witnessing the various fusions on namek he researched the frieza force database for every scrap of information regarding the dance that fuses two beings together after finding out about the metamorians and using the resources of the frieza force to gather more intel frieza was able to teach himself and his father the fusion dance krisa's power was immense and he challenges the two saiyans to fuse the saiyans claim they don't need to vegeta and kakura chuckle goku extend his arm telling vegeta to take the lead and he gladly takes him up on the offer turning into a super saiyan and rushing in vegeta increase a clash the battle was intense and vegeta got a little worried it was more difficult than he expected he wasn't really used to super saiyan quite yet kariza finds an opening and grabs vegeta's leg with his tail throwing him into a nearby rock formation krisa chuckles before saying that it had been an exciting exercise but it's time to take things seriously krisa transforms into his final form engulfed in a brilliant purple light goku realizes the horror of just how powerful kriza has become and he immediately powers up into super saiyan so both he and vegeta launched at the tyrant even with the two super saiyans assaulting him with flurries of punches and kicks krizza was simply dodging and blocking they got him quite a few times he wasn't exactly out of their range but he was more powerful than ever before goku tries to fire a kamehameha kriza but the evildoer is able to right through the beam and smashes goku against the floor frieza grabs both saiyans heads with his feet as he spins in the air before throwing them towards a mountain goku and vegeta are left winded goku pleads with vegeta the fusing may be their only shot vegeta refuses yelling out that he'd sooner die then fuse again kriza floated towards the bloodied unbeaten saiyans what drops down from super saiyan he laughed saying that not even these pathetic monkeys with golden hair could do anything against the overwhelming power of the cold clan he turned around pointing a death beam towards the terrified z fighters asking goku how many he should kill aiming for krillin he smiles and fires the death beam but before he reaches krillin a mysterious hooded figure appears in front of the blast smacking it away everyone is shocked at the certain reveal of a new fighter especially kriza did this man just reflect his attack kriza asks his own known man if he had a reason to be here surely he doesn't think he can stop him the hooded figure takes out his sword and without skipping a beat declares stop you i'm here to kill you frieza chuckles and lunges towards the man however the hooded figure dodges out of the way and with a flick of his finger got his sword out slicing clean through kriza the fusion ended right then and there both frieza and king colt cut in half the man begins to gather energy right on his chest screaming out burning the colts were defeated vegeta with both his body and pride hurt stands over the remains of them he had gotten the satisfaction of being stronger than his termentor but he didn't feel fulfilled he clenched his fist and looked over at kakarot he was next but as the two stared each other down the mysterious being from earlier appeared between the two he was wearing a robe with a hood but they could tell that he had scars on his face and purple hair they asked who the hell he was and he simply said that he needed to talk to them vegeta and goku looked at each other recognizes that the man had a double voice like that of a fusion they didn't trust them on his wrist he wore a strange band with a capsule corp logo the man explained that a few years from now a pair of androids will attack androids with abilities similar to theirs created by the evil doctor jero of the former red ribbon army these androids killed the z fighters and raised the planet no one survives he theorized that if vegeta had been willing to fuse with goku again then perhaps he would have won but goku died before they could the androids have a strange mechanism that works as a fusion or absorption he wasn't sure how it worked but they were incredibly powerful it was their task to train before then neither of the saiyans believed him so he proved his worth by transforming into a super saiyan they couldn't believe it another saiyan this fusion was able to defeat kriza without transforming yet even he couldn't defeat these androids vegeta acted as if he didn't care but both him and goku were excited the man gave medicine to goku telling him to take it as soon as possible without saying a word the mysterious cloaked man flies off for the next three years the heroes began to train in order to get stronger however vegeta refused to work with goku and further refined their fusion he left to be on his own napa went with him but eventually returned to capsule corp once he realized that he couldn't keep up with the prince the day arrived for the androids to attack bulma welcomed them with a little baby trunks whom they all did not know the name of and thus were extremely surprised even goku to see that vegeta had a kid but that's not the only surprise bulma brought with her she also had a new technology to show off arm bats that she dubbed metamore rings in theory they would allow anyone of any race and size to fuse together they were still imperfect so they could only last half as long as a regular fusion but it was easier to use goku thanked her giving a pair to krillin to take care of gohan looks around and notices that piccolo seems to be missing their conversation is cut short a blast sounds soft in a nearby city as the androids have arrived the z fighters break into pairs and scatter across the city in search for the machines yamcha and tien look for the androids together when 19 and 20 find and recognize them they clash in the middle of the city the humans weren't able to keep up and admitted that they hated to have to do this but they revealed that through their training together they had also been practicing the fusion dance they fused their might into tiensha and begin their fight against android 19. goku and krillin arrive very impressed by the battle dr gero android 20 recognizes them he instantly goes in for goku giro is impressed by goku's strength as it seems higher than his previous data projections the two fights continue and tiensha defeats android 19 with a wolf fang volleyball fist breaking the android in two however a large amount of his energy had been absorbed jiro grieves that his android was defeated but this was merely a ploy with goku's guard down he strikes grabbing goku by the neck smashing him down and absorbing his key giro revealed something terrifying he unbuttoned his shirt and revealed the machinations on his chest his eyes flashed as a computer chip and energy reactor from android 19's body came flying towards him was this the fusion inspired ability that the mysterious man warned them about jerome's hair spiked up and his muscle mass increased his skin even turned pale he had transformed into super android 20. giro charged towards tiensha supergiro was relentless in his assault grabbing him by the leg and smashing him against the ground stealing every bit of his energy his last move was to pierce right through the fusion defeating him he threw him down to the ground as it diffused the two were unconscious and curly went over to them to help them giving them sensu beats goku clenched his fist and damned the world there was nothing he could do he could only try to hold off the doctor the other warriors eventually arrive napa vegeta and gohan helping out but even they aren't enough to battle against super giraud without much of a choice goku tells vegeta to fuse with him but the prince refuses until he starts to realize that this is becoming the future that the mysterious being warned them about he looked around and saw the earthlings the feet on the ground he cursed that loud and said that fine he was going to fuse with him the two get into their stances dancing towards each other and fusing once more into gogeta as giro is about to land the final finishing blow on napa gogeta approaches the doctor asking if he's ever felt fear before before he can answer though gogeta locks his hand with jarose crushing it destroying the absorption mechanism the battle was nothing for gogeta he was having a lot of fun but as he transformed into a super saiyan for the final attack he felt something he clenched his chest and all his friends wondered what was going on he reverted back to his base form and screamed down in pain as he fell to the ground it was the heart virus goku never took the medicine super giro took this chance to hold out his arm and grabbed onto gogeta absorbing whatever energy he could afraid that he'd be defeated this is power he has never felt before it's incredible he starts to laugh manically he doesn't know what's happening but he'd be a fool not to take advantage of the situation he thanks gogeta for all this energy it was finally over he begins to create an energy sphere from his chest calling it the ss deadly bomber but before he can fire it a beam burst right through him it was piccolo before the androids appeared pickle had gone to the lookout to meet kami piccolo agreed that if these androids had the ability to fuse then they would be the greatest threat known to earth kami agreed to fuse with piccolo recognizing the strength of this sort of technique and thus the namekian with no name was reborn despite not fusing with nail piccolo still had a huge additional set of training over the past three years with not only goku and gohan but also defused z fighters such as tiensha thanks to this the lack of nail isn't much of a problem and piccolo is able to help gogeta as the special beam cannon destroyed his other arm piccolo is ready to finish off jerome when suddenly the saiyan from the future from three years earlier arrives but he looks around in confusion none of these are the androids that he knew juro once again takes advantage of the situation by firing a giant keyblast against the ground the smoke and dust leave everyone blinded unable to read his key giro disappears krillin squirts out gogeta while the rest of the z fighters fly off in search of giroud including the future saiyan the little gohan asks who exactly he is the future saiyan can't answer the question and when questioned about what happens to gohan in the future his eyes widen a little but he becomes quiet again gohan is confused and a little worried about who this man could be they track down super giroud to his lab when the awakened 17 and 18 appear jira warns them that they confuse and that their fusions are stronger than ever before a teen looks at her brother and upon hearing the sounds of the z fighters blasting down saying that whatever she doesn't care either way she just wants this to be over with the twins disappear onto one another their eyes glowing as they combine into one being the door to the lap burst open as the future android screams this is what he wanted to stop the fusion this fusion was what killed everyone he powered up into a super saiyan charging his key as his cloak flies off his face revealing a man with purple and black hair along with scars piccolo recognized that he looked rather familiar burning the massive blast strikes the androids and the lab is destroyed but before the blast reached him jerod's huge body grabbed onto android 16's capsule protecting it with his body nothing of the lab remained only a bright light emitting from the twins the future warrior could do nothing but stare in disbelief the newly born fusion whipped its hair back smirking this new super android would mean the end of earth thank you so much for watching guys i
