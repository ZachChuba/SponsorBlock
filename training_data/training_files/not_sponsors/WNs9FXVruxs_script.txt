kindest most generous man i know juan strickler el rubio my brother whose party is this i don't know but it's gonna be sick a lot gets written about you on the internet they talk about cocaine turf wars missing journalists but you know what they never say how big your heart is you're beautiful you're a humanitarian and you throw the best parties in the world so from all of us we thank you stop it i said oh come on i said no speeches now you're embarrassing me huh but thank you my brother well maybe more like my half brother right hey he's got a lot of hits from the 2000s yeah all right who's ready the [ __ ] party i give you kinder music let's go [ __ ] lord [Applause] this is it look okay game face yo you yo i'll holler at you what's up not a slipper huh all right bye your mass now that the djs are playing and job is done you get real bloody messy huh stick around as long as you like party will go forever and when you are ready perhaps you can sneak past guards near where you come in you're out yes good times but for you party is over if a guard sees you from now on you will get more than finger wagging you understand and remember they will have cameras too now based on satellite images the compound is on south side of the island this is likely place he is keeping mini madrazo's files we do our reconnaissance we come back to saab to make a plan of attack but let us not get ahead of ourselves first things first it looks like there is a security checkpoint ahead you must get through without being seen or the guards will drag you back to the party by your delicate parts remember your weapons are back on the plane don't even think about punching one of these guys we must not blow our cover if they see you surrender play dumb and hope they don't gut you like my uncle vlad preparing fish [Music] it is not only guards you must be looking out for capitan cctv will be everywhere do not let the cameras get a look at you okay looks like you made it past the checkpoint good work epithel now from here you have many possible routes to the compound the roads on the east side of the island are quieter not so many buildings this is the long way around but the safe way or you go direct and stay on your tippy toes yes of course you can also go off-road if your party clothes are suitable for jungle survival the choice is yours at last the plan is underway we are on site out of mr rubio's thumbs free to explore oh there is much to see here i think these satellite images leave many unanswered questions i will be in touch if you are somewhere of interest to me do not forget i have your location i have maps blueprints satellite images but i cannot see you and i cannot see guards although i can't guess where they will be stationed you are in the driving seat capitan you must trust your own judgments i will help where i can okay you should be able to see the compound now take a good look that's where the files must be but based on my information there is also a security checkpoint ahead of you yes well now is not the time for full frontal capital we must be clever so we use their cctv against them wait there okay next step if i am reading satellite images correctly there is communications tower near your current position if i am right it should be visible it will be the highest point on the island if there is anywhere we can hack cctv and use it to see inside the compound it is there i have sent you the coordinates for where i think it is [Music] so i will need signals box to get patched in have a look around for it [Music] okay let's have a look uh the cameras may be new but the system is old wires and circuits can be done to give me access you must connect the wires from the left to the right you need to reach the target voltage number in the middle perfect i have the camera feed in front of me now i have uploaded app to your phone for you to see too okay this must be inside the compound looks like mr rubio you know there is old russian proverb do not trust german with panther [Music] show him what a big [ __ ] man this is a lesson to us all i think if our friend had known the russian proverb we would not be cap food now yes [Music] here we go we have business to attend to have a look through different cameras we must find probable location of files it will be somewhere highly secure i will look through from here basement reinforced walls this is promising look around on the camera and bingo military grade safe with a dead drop cylinder this must be it we will need the security code you cannot rely on finding it open like this so we know location of files but we still must find out how to get to basement keep looking through camera feeds you have found some gold i will mark its location ah here art excellent for money laundering i will mark location this looks like mr rubio's office and there an elevator it does not go up so we know it must take him down to the vault but look again fingerprint scanner we will have to find way to bypass this there will be more to see on the other camera feeds but we have the essentials you can leave when you are ready aha cash marking location now [Music] okay position logged nothing location [Music] that's on your planning screen now you see that keypad on the door this must be a way into the compound if you can find the code a guard will have it somewhere too risky to check now you must look when you're here for the operation itself the spikes on the wall are broken maybe with a rope you could climb through [Music] a guard truck perhaps you can drive into compound but you would need to be disguised as one of them location noted [Music] very good we think we know where the files are kept this is the vital information but there will be much more to learn entrances and exits to find tools equipment and of course the really important things cash valuables contraband at the minimum i suggest you look at the north dock before you leave this is the one you passed on the way to the party i suspect there will be much to learn there just do not let the guard see you the less trouble we cause the better so [Music] so foreign you are at the northern dock yes send me photograph i need to see the water in the dark side then i can make estimates for use as a possible infiltration point photograph received this would make good infiltration point but as i suspected we would need to acquire smaller vessel my submarine is many things capitan but small is not one of them i am looking again at this picture capitan do you see the boat on the water that is classic cartel transport craft but what have they been transporting don't worry this is a rhetorical question look around the warehouses nearby we can make note of any stashes we find and swing by to collect them when we come for mini madrazo's files did you find anything it will be in secure area cash drugs or well cash or drugs mr rubio is not merely cocaine manufacturer he has sidelined in potent strain of herbal remedies follow your nose capitan [Music] as i suspected all packaged up and ready to steal if you find your way back here during the operation you will be able to get into this up no problem and if we find the right tools nearby you can do it silently perfect there is no need to take them now we note down the location come back for them when we are here for the main operation and use them to quietly break into any lockups we find this way we do not carry any extra weight and we do not leave a loose end for mr rubio to follow so capitan you see the value of extra reconnaissance yes there may be other infiltration points to find on the island other tools other resources other stashes to raid there is much to discover in paradise yes the longer you spend investigating now the more options you have anything you find just send me a photograph when you are finished on the island get back to the airstrip talk to the pilot he will get you home but don't worry this party will be going on for a long time you can return to ireland whenever you wish remember you are not a pack mule there is only so much you can carry you want more bring friends [Music] hmm aside from the compound the island has only a few built up areas the airstrip the main dock in the center and the smaller dock to the north then of course there are the fields for mr rubio's crop and the call for the party all of these will have things to learn things too long but complete reconnaissance does not finish here look through the quiet areas these occluded spots these two will hold vital intelligence ah you are at the airstrip before you go one more thing could make a very big difference take a look at control tower and send me a photograph i need a close-up look at it yes yes yes this tower provides main coordinates of their defenses you disable this when you are here for main operation and we have some interesting options maybe we can bring in reinforcements i have some contacts who would be interested i think you know habitant this party was the perfect opportunity for this kind of operation the guards must find drunk millionaires and celebrities wandering around all over the place the perfect cover okay that's the last essential piece of information whenever you're ready capitan talk to the pilot and head for home and of course come back here for partying or peeping around whenever you wish yes a tour manager's job is never done so [Music] all right ready to go enrique right this way leaving are we yeah no problem i told you i was being a good boy practically sober straight balanced the ups and downs in perfect alignment yeah it's a proper razor back there but we are off ski not even going back for one more tune now not even a little one let's go then no more boogies no afters no watching the sun come up over the ocean in the one place on the planet we can guarantee the marching powder won't run out duh [ __ ] it you know what i'm staying keys i don't care if i don't have a ride home dave will find a way this thing ain't over yet let's have some [Music] [Music] you don't have to be a government or a corporation back to yes very promising for now the essential information is and don't forget you have open ticket back to the island perhaps there is more to find or perhaps you wish to listen to kind of music huh i do not blame you we have time [Applause] ah you
