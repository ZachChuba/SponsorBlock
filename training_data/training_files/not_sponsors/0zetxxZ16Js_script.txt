their first two months for just 99 cents it's no secret that an albums recording location can have a big impact on its sound that's why so many studios have become legendary over the years and names like Muscle Shoals the record plant and of course Abbey Road have been etched into musics collective unconscious but for every great album recorded in an iconic studio there's an equally great album recorded somewhere offbeat from country houses to castles music is full of unorthodox recording locations let's take a closer look at three locations that helped make music history in 1967 Rick Danko was the bassist for Bob Dylan's backing band a year earlier Dylan had cancelled the tour and become a recluse in Woodstock New York after a motorcycle accident that nearly claimed his life Danko found a house to rent in the nearby hamlet of West Saugerties New York where his bandmate Robbie Robertson had a place in February 1967 Danko moved into the house with fellow band mates Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel the group known then as the Hawks nicknamed the house of big pink after its pink society living in big pink they started doing some studio recording in Bob Dylan's home but soon the recordings moved to the basement of big pink in this time the Hawks and Dylan were working on informal material just having fun recording a few new Dylan songs and a ton of covers and traditional pieces many of these recordings would be released years later in an album called the basement tapes you can hear the relaxing fun vibes of these recordings on a song like million dollar and big with a wheel gorged turtle in front of us with his checks on boards that he cheats in a chunk cheese in the cash that won't be there then that bag during this period former drummer levon Helm rejoined the Hawks and they decide to rename themselves taking up the moniker of the band with this new name they started to record original material written by Manuel and Robertson as well as a few other pieces penned by Dylan this material became the band's debut album which they named after the house that birthed it music from big pink the back cover of the album even featured a description of the house a pink house seated in the Sun of overlook mountain in West Saugerties New York big paint bore this music and these songs along its way it's the first witness of this album that's been thought and composed right there inside its walls music from big pink was a roaring success and featured what may be the band's best known song to date the wait [Music] load up a few years later across the Atlantic Led Zeppelin found their own house to make music history in in 1970 the band set up camp in heed Lagrange a former poorhouse and heed Lee England Zeppelin weren't the first nor were they the last to set up in heed Lagrange acts like bad company Fleetwood Mac and Genesis all used it as a rehearsal space the house didn't have many advantages it was rundown and cold but it had one thing going for it nobody around had ever filed noise complaints for bands practicing not wanting to get interrupted in the middle of their workflow and having to move after noise complaints Zeppelin realized this will be the perfect place for them to had to in a 2010 interview with mojo Page explained why the band wanted to go to heed Lee Grange the reason we went there in the first place was to have a live-in situation where you're writing and really living the music we'd never really had that experience before as a group the band wrote and recorded large parts of Led Zeppelin 3 there and loved it enough to go back on their next three studio albums some of their most famous songs have he'd lead ranged ties black dog was named after a dog that they found hanging around the Grange during recording and Robert Plant wrote almost all the lyrics of stairway to heaven in the Grange but it's not just the stories you can actually hear he'd legrange in one of Zeppelin's most iconic songs the echoing thunderous drums of wind the levee breaks come thanks to the old poorhouses architecture the band set up John Bonham's drum kit in a giant three-story hall in the building that had a staircase going up it they stuck the microphone at the top of the stairs and the result was one of the most famous drum sounds in rock history [Music] Zeppelin would go on to use a number of other unorthodox recording places including clear well Castle a gothic mansion in Gloucestershire built in 1727 clear well Castle was used as a rehearsal space for a number of bands throughout the 70s deep purple recorded two albums there storm bringer and burn while Peter Frampton recorded his 1975 self-titled album there but perhaps the most important visit to clear well Castle came in 1973 that's when Black Sabbath set up camp in the castle returning to England after a series of writing sessions in California came up empty the castle was a perfect venue to reignite Black Sabbath's creative flame it was full of dark corners medieval armor and creepy atmosphere that matched Black Sabbath's metal sound the band even had a run-in with a ghost in the castle as Tony Iommi recalled to the Birmingham Mail he said that himself geezer butler and Ozzy Osbourne were walking down the hallway when they saw a cloaked figure coming toward them it turned into a room and they followed to investigate only to have nobody there the band leaned into this creepiness recording in Dungeons and armories to conjure up a new sound it's in one of these dungeons that Tony Iommi wrote the guitar riff that the band credited with saving their careers Sabbath bloody Sabbath [Music] that song set the tone for their next album and became the title track vaulting Black Sabbath back into success and it never would have happened were it not for clear well these are just a few of the locations that have helped shape music history but their impact is indisputable there's dozens more buildings that have continued to influence music in the year since and new ones that are having their impact each passing year but those stories are for another time I want to thank so go now and get the tools you need to meet your personal goals [Music] [Music] you
