believe me when I say I've seen a lot of stupid products from ones that obviously can't live up to their lofty claims to ones that are just playing bad ideas to begin with and most of the time I don't even bother trying this stuff out but when a company with as much clout as razor brings a new headset to market one that claims to vibrate your head with intelligent haptic technology well there's just no way that I cannot try it but here's the most surprising thing of all these might somehow even at $200 be worth a fair shake [Music] Mack Weldon wants you to be more off at the link below when razors nari ultimate headset arrived I was pretty skeptical actually I was skeptical before it arrived I mean first I disagreed with their premise that sound is just as important to sight when you're in game it is possible to play csgo without sound it is not possible to play without a monitor then I mean I wasn't sure that I even wanted a rumble pack strapped to my head and besides I mean technically speaking don't all headphones vibrate isn't that just how speakers work okay so the difference here is that on top of having regular 50 millimeter dynamic drivers which do in fact vibrate to make sound the nari Ultimates are also outfitted with a pair one in each cup of l5 haptic drivers from low felt who you may remember from such memorable products as the baselet wearable subwoofer like speakers the haptic drivers articulate according to the signal coming over the speaker cable but unlike speakers which move a diaphragm to create sound energy these use actuators that move back and forth turning electrical energy into mechanical energy okay that's pretty similar but it's like bigger so yes it is kind of like a rumble pack on your head but it's a very different kind of Rumble than what you get from a controller so unlike a controller Rumble which has only very coarse control like that the developer actually has to specifically program into their game like though you crash into a wall the nari ultimates implementation requires no software support at all and responds in real time over a frequency range of 20 to 200 Hertz which actually conveniently overlaps with the headphone drivers own frequency response so in other words the headphones are not relying on the haptic drivers for the users low frequency sensation they're just augmenting it with them so how does it sound or feel well depending on the application these can actually have a surprisingly impactful part in the punch positive effect that is similar to the sensation of standing near a kick drum or next to a large floorstanding speaker at a concert and feeling the air move over you in time with the music as you listen obviously it doesn't move over you but the point is you can feel it so we tested the nari Ultimates with games music and movies and the main takeaway for those of you who won't make it any further into the video than this is that if the content has consistent low tones explosions gunfire pounding bass these will make the content more engrossing and immersive so you can actually use Razer synapse software to not just toggle the haptics which Razer is branding as hyper sense on and off but also adjust the intensity through a nine step range in shooter games which are probably the best use of these puppies so far James had high percents cranked up to 10 loving every second of it as for me I preferred more in the range of eight but I still had it cranked up pretty high and it's honestly it's really cool weapons feel more physical like more powerful and more immediate explosions feel way more epic and like I didn't like I put them on and I was like yeah my head's vibrating but I didn't realize how much cooler it was until I switched the haptics off and heard how utterly neutered the games so without it like it was like kind of sad similarly hyper sense adds a lot of impact to action scenes and movies or just about any movie trailer warbled there were however lots of times during our testing when hyper sense was either ineffectual or downright distracting it adds almost nothing for example to Starcraft 2 where battles are more intermittent and not all of the unit's make noises that have low tones and in movies or YouTube videos it can end up registering false positives while men are talking this is a regular drill and then the other two are impacts ok this is compensating or first sounds like footsteps resulting in just kind of an annoying muddy rumble as for music I never thought I'd hear myself say this about a razer audio product sarcasm detected but music is the experience that is the least consistent across the board for the nari Ultimates if you're into classical the haptics are seldom used if at all and then with metal the low tones are often so complex and intermittent that hyper sense is distracting and then even with genres where it definitely enhances things like hip-hop and electronic music the effect can vary so much between songs that within a single playlist you'll probably find yourself wanting to go back to synapse to tweak the knobs far more often than you'd like an opportunity that you'll only have by the way if you happen to be using them on a PC because while your profile is saved on device and while Denari alternates with their 2.4 gigahertz dongle and included combo cable do work both wirelessly and with a wire PC PlayStation Nintendo switch and more you can only adjust high percents using the desktop software so you're gonna have to set it and forget it something that's easy to deal with if you just play games but less easy to deal with if you expect to use your nari Ultimates for listening to music or listening to music while you play games while you're out and about with your phone for example so we think most console or mobile gamers will end up having to choose between setting high percents lower and having a more subtle effect than they'd like or setting it too high and sometimes having to deal with too stronger in effect and this is a problem that could have been easily avoided if they had just put a high percents control wheel right on the device but they didn't which is a total drag for console gamers and ashamed because otherwise the industrial design and controls are pretty good so the nari Ultimates use a self-adjusting suspension style design with big swiveling air cups that are comfortable over long periods the plush leather Eddie or Christians are infused with this cooling gel that's supposed to keep them cool and they have cutouts to make them more comfortable to wear with glasses though in our experience each of these features only kind of works the mic which is flexible and retracting to the ear cup is serviceable but not fantastic though I am a fan of the helpful yet non intrusive red light that indicates it's been muted which brings us to the onboard buttons so you can mute the mic with a button on the back of the ear cup where you will also find wheels for volume as well as game versus voice level adjustment you'll find a handy slot to keep the dongle and a micro USB port really you guys that's pretty weak especially since using high percents and Razer chroma RGB can train the battery in about eight to ten hours and making matters worse it takes quite a while to charge up enough that the vibrating feature can be activated again for $200 a fast charging USB type-c port that lets me spend more time using these wireless headphones as wireless headphones doesn't seem unreasonable so are they worth the money well it's complicated for the right person the high percent haptic feedback which I was certain was going to be a silly stupid gimmick that no one could possibly want is absolutely worth the extra 50 bucks over the noreen on ultimate which are the same headset but without high percents as for whether the regular naari is worth a hundred and fifty dollars well that's a little tougher because you can get much better sound for the same price and probably with better less plasticky overall build quality so that makes it really hard for me to recommend these but then there are also an utterly unique gaming experience that is worth trying for yourself something that can't be said about a lot of these kind of feature gaming peripherals so good work Razer I guess is there someone in your their day a little bit smarter than they started so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or even consider checking out where to
