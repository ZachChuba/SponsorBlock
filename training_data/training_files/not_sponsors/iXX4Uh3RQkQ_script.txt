now it's hardly a secret that I like the razorblade there 2018 model addressed almost every previous problem except the price at 2400 US dollars it is darn expensive but what if you could save a buck by cutting but some razor humor there some of the bells and whistles well razor had the same idea this is the base version of the razor blade a slightly lower powered slightly thicker model with a significant price cut but has this made the blade more accessible or just worse well you guys are smart kids who read the title before you click a video so I guess you already know the answer just like you already knew this tempered glass panels check it out today at the link below [Music] compared to the advanced version of the blade the most obvious change is the thickness but in return we ditch the proprietary power connector and we get Gigabit Ethernet and that's on top of the blades already very solid i/o and I'm happy to say that the base version has actually kept Thunderbolt 3 support but the extra thickness does take away some of the sex appeal and while the overall look and feel is still pretty good the bottom feels a lot more plasticky and cheap cpu performance also stays solid though thanks to a six core Core i7 processor and the addition of 2 terabytes of spinning storage on top of the 240 gig boot SSD means that you'll be able to bring a massive game library with you on the go and there's even more good news for years razor blades were known for sounding like an f1 car mating with a leaf blower and although the basic blade does get a bit louder than the advanced model it is much better than the older rounded versions so far so good until now the real sacrifice that was made for the base blade was in the graphics department the reduction to a gtx 1060 max-q leaves some gaming performance to be desired now it's quite a competent 1080p gaming experience and in a vacuum this machine would be getting a stellar review but the issue is that other computer makers exists a Seuss's zephyrus leaves the basic blade in the dust with its gtx 1070 max-q and this thing isn't even an outlier making matters worse the extra FPS wouldn't even help us much because the basic is only available with a 1080p 60 Hertz display which is a real bummer if they at least offered maybe for like $100 more or something a 120 Hertz or a 144 Hertz screen option they could make a real play for eSports gamers with this machine titles like overwatch and League of Legends with easily run at that framerate on a 10 60 max queue so once again the Zephyrus whoops the bass blades but with a 144 Hertz display on top of its better specs and then adding insult to injury the webcam on those efforts also pounds the blade basic another thing that got a considerable downgrade from the advance queue so that means that the blade basic is now a tough sell for performance enthusiasts eSports players and for Game streamers that's rough but the thing is that while the Zephyrus does punt the baseplate out of the park when it comes to gaming like have you ever looked at this thing it has its own issues if you try to use it as a lap top like on your lap it just doesn't work between the flappy doodle thing at the bottom and the keyboard being so close to you there is absolutely no way to get comfortable and while the miniscule trackpad crammed over on the right here is more usable than you might expect the blades is one of the best on the market it's large accurate and really my go-to example for how track pads should be done on a Windows machine too bad I can't say the same about the keyboard so while the basic blade wins for gaming on the go I'm really disappointed that they didn't manage to keep the same key switches as the advanced model trading them for a considerably mushy or alternative they're bad enough that if you can find a desk it's safe to say that typing and gaming would be more enjoyable on the Zephyrus at least until the battery dies so one of the greatest strengths of the new 2018 blade is its massive battery but hold on a moment remember how the base blade got a 2 terabyte hard drive why isn't this available on the much more expensive advanced blade well you don't save enough space for something like that magically and when we did open up the base blade we were greeted with well the man behind the curtain so to speak there it is so we have swapped out the 80 our battery in the advanced for a 65 watt hour in order to make room for this hard drive on a more positive note at least the upgrade ability is solid in here with both our MDOT to drive and our ddr4 sodium's easily accessible along with their Wi-Fi card if you're into that sort of thing so we've talked a lot about the zephyrus in this video almost as much as the base blade and that's because in many ways it is the clearly better laptop if you're looking to do a fair bit of gaming the better display and graphics card make those efforts the easy choice but what about the folks who only occasionally game well for you guys honestly I don't think I can really recommend the basic blade either not in a world where the Dell XPS 15 exists for the same price it does cost you a substantial graphics downgrade to a dt x 1050 TI but the much better screen keyboard general build quality and massive 97 watt hour battery make it superior in pretty much every other scenario with the advanced version of the razor blade 2018 we loved razors no compromises approach it's a great gaming machine but it's also a usable day-to-day then with the basic what we realized was that once razor started making compromises while still commanding a relatively high price tag they open themselves up to competition from all sides making this machine still good like just to be very clear it's still good it's just harder to recommend check out blue apron at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you just liked this video you can hit
