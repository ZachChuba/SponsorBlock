Carrie Bradshaw samples and reviews this guy wouldn't necessarily be the most obvious target for the obsessions of a sensitive intellectual woman come on everybody wonders what happens after you die I'm too busy wondering who's dinging my car in a garage sex in the cities choice of central love object mr. big says something about the show and it's times after all this is what we're first told about him in the pilot you see that guy he's the next Donald Trump except he's younger and much better-looking the appeal of mr. big apparently has a lot to do with how rich and successful he is he's a big man about town and maybe this isn't a surprise in a show that so sexualizes expensive Footwear Sex in the City linked female empowerment with conspicuous consumption and mr. big was the big prize the symbol of making it in the Big Apple so here's our take on the deeper cultural symbolism of Kerry's inability to quit big and who the man actually was inside I couldn't help but wonder was it mr. big was it New York or was it me if you're new here be sure to subscribe and hit the bell to get notified about all of our new videos so who is this Trump like crossword puzzle this big New York man and why did sex in the city choose him he is such a great guy I mean I don't know anybody any cooler than mr. mr. big is first and foremost an unattainable enigma we don't learn his name until the last episode and we never find out what his job is so like Carrie we're encouraged to buy into this aura of mystery aren't you afraid that the sheer force of it all will just pull you back into all that big stuff again no he's not Niagara Falls isn't if you step back the finance guy who doesn't share any of her major interests is not an intuitive choice of mate for Carrie I started reading your column after we met you did well yeah thank you as a fashion loving writer you might think she'd be impressed by someone with more cultural capital than Capital capital the big character might remind us of scarlett o'hara's romantic fixation in Gone with the Wind Ashley Wilkes [Music] at the onset of the Civil War - this southern belle Ashley is the symbol of a genteel Old South that she feels has been lost or Gone with the Wind Scarlett finally realizes her love for Ashley was an illusion the pursuit of something intangible that can't be possessed while for Carrie the spell of mr. big and what he represents is never fully broken you know he walks on his perfect apartment with the perfect suits me it's just perfect perfect perfect perfect and I'm the girl who farts it was mr. big major tycoon major dreamboat and majorly out of my league what exactly does big represent to Carrie then the most convincing explanation for why she sees him as so perfect is that he's exceptionally rich you want to go to the Caribbean next week sure pack my jet ski no I'm serious we could both use a vacation he can agree to buy her the perfect penthouse or write a cheque to erase her money troubles like it's nothing and the little touches she finds charming are the behaviors of a rich man I can't believe you actually got out of the car and got balloons I didn't rob did big was inspired by one of the real-life paramours of Candace Bushnell who created the character of Carrie as a stand-in for herself in her columns big is thought to be based on Ron colotti a former publisher of GQ known for a high-flying lifestyle and affairs with a number of beautiful women Bushnell said the big name was born because quote he was one of those New York guys with a big personality you just noticed him as soon as he walks in the room I called him mr. big because he was like a big man on campus Carrie's idolization of big combined with her lust for expensive shoes signals at this show is kind of an ode to materialism her idealistic sounding search for true love is tied to a deep desire for wealth and luxury thus when it comes down to it mr. big is a materialist Hannah see he embodies whatever it is Kerry is trying to feel via all the shoe shopping I spent $40,000 on shoes and he enables the consumer in her I got it while canceling out her terrible financial state before him I'm worse missing money is a huge part of what Manhattan is it's a city that revolves around wealth and status and carries love for big is so tied to New York City that you could say he's an expression of the spirit of New York as she sees it you can't leave New York you're the Chrysler Building he was like the city itself cold infuriating and exhausting I'm in a New York state of mind Carrie and mr. big run into each other constantly why is it in a city of ten million men you always see the one you don't want and never see the one you owe and this is a New York fantasy that hoped that in a city of so many millions you'll just happen to bump into the one you're thinking about the big she loves is the New York she loves fancy suave and expensive I kissed Aidan goodbye kicked the mud off my boots and had a New York steak with my New York ex [Music] Carrie describes big as a crossword puzzle men in their 40s are like the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle tricky complicated and you're never really sure you've got the right answer and for years we watched as she attempted to decode the mystery of mr. big is he a jerk is he just not that into her or is he really the love of her life who needs time to overcome emotional damage let's take some time to look at sex in the city from the perspective of mr. big what's striking when Yuri watch the first season is that while Carrie is quick to paint bigs reluctance to commit as a moral failing the simple truth seems to be that he's just not immediately sure about her I had gone so far out on a limb with my feelings that I didn't realize I was standing out there alone when she shows up drunk at his apartment to confront him for being embarrassed of her like I'm only a particular fragment of the kind of person you think that you should be dating we can sort of see Carrie through his eyes when he says but I've only gotten to know a particular fragment although I'm beginning to know more she quickly justifies her unhinged seeming behavior no this is not me this is me reacting to your perception of me meanwhile she's the first to admit that she hasn't even really been acting like herself with him which means she hasn't given him the chance to fully know the real her he should see me around him I'm not like me I'm like together Carrie so early on it's not hard to see why big has his doubts about Carrie she leaps to overreacting over small things when they have only just started dating Jesus I'm trying to watch this flight just fine when she makes a huge deal about farting in front of him well I think it's over I should never have farted and then frets because they don't have sex for a few nights if farted you're human I don't want him to know that she reveals an extreme level of insecurity festering underneath her cool exterior Jesus Carrie that's it I've heard enough about the fart it's not the fart she has a tendency to escalate suddenly to a scary level of rage what was that all about the other night that was me having a meltdown she's quick to publicly embarrass him well let's see there's me Julia oh and let's not forget International Melyssa I'm not doing this at one party he brings her too she lights up a cigarette inside the woman's apartment is piss when she's told not to smoke inside well don't be okay I'm not being a [ __ ] I'm just being myself a little bit and then ends up kissing and going home with Jeremiah the performance artist we can only imagine how livid she'd be if big did the same thing I figured everything before I love you just doesn't count when Carrie meets big he's a 40-something divorcee living a luxurious Manhattan life who set in his ways and not looking for any upset to his lifestyle there is a very good reason that big is gun shy he's scarred by a failed marriage well why did you get married that is so sweet and then I was a fool in divorce court these two are coming from very different places carrie has made it to her 30s without ever truly being in love I get it you've never been in love and this pure romantic is waiting for a perfect all-consuming passion I am someone who is looking for love can't live without each other love mr. big has felt that kind of love and seen it fall apart have you ever been in love Carrie seems charmed and intrigued by this statement but she doesn't understand that his romantic past might have an effect on him my mother doesn't need to meet another girlfriend oh but post big after she's been damaged by heartbreak herself my freak the frightening woman whose fear ate her sanity she acts the same way with Aidan needing to take things slow and being reluctant to commit the irony is Aidan's acting exactly the way I wish big would have behaved and I'm behaving just like big what big keeps telling Carrie is that he needs time to know how did she was my girlfriend when I'm sure oh look I happen to do things on my time frame it was just something I've got to do in my own time and Carrie refuses to give him that my friend Carrie oh you show up at church after I asked you not to what are you trying to do test me Harry also establishes a pattern from the very start of telling big one thing and meaning or expecting another she first describes herself as I'm sort of a sexual an ecologist Harry's way of introducing herself makes it sound like she's some kind of wild erotic adventurer you mean like not someone who's looking to be quickly tied down into a committed relationship from there Kari continues a pattern of projecting something false and then reacting violently when she doesn't get what she secretly wants I can't believe it he's seen other women true we had never discussed exclusivity before big tells Carrie about his engagement to Natasha Carrie puts on a casual front saying she's just interested in friendship friends talk about their relationships so go ahead friend tell me about the girl then she tries to force him into a dismissive narrative about his new relationship maybe we should make a pact we don't talk about our relationships until they get really serious or something when he responds by being truthful with her we're engaged I wanted you to hear it from me she again resorts to publicly shaming him help me and making a scene that casts herself as the victim of course she's going to be upset but we can imagine this tendency to have a hidden agenda and then suddenly escalate to an aggressive outburst is one reason big shuts off he certainly is a poor communicator but so is she what do I want from you [Music] nothing I don't want anything from you another pattern we see in their communication is that Kari pushes him for a verbal commitment or a step forward in their relationship and big doesn't grant it yet Kari nonetheless interprets his nonverbal behavior as an affirmative answer when she asks him if he wants to be monogamous don't you want to stand still with me he's sort of smiles and puts his arm around her and she takes that as a yes when Kari tells him that she does want to get married someday he again doesn't really answer directly when he does respond verbally he's usually non-committal offering her a joke I'm afraid we don't want the same things things like okay or something along the lines of a maybe then maybe this is for real [Music] before distracting her with a kiss in all these moments he doesn't say what Carrie wants him to even when that would be easier sorry Carrie mr. big actor Chris Noth said quote he never tried to pretend he was anything other than what he was it was Carrie who tried to pretend he was something he wasn't which is why I'm never getting married again throughout the series Carrie misinterprets bigs behavior and generally sees what she expects to see I didn't read the signs you were unavailable and very clear about that this sexual analyst has a lot of generalizations ready about men the very first episode is about her quest to have sex like a man which in her view means being selfish and unattached to the person you're sleeping with right now I'm researching an article about women who have sex like men you know they have sex and then afterwards they feel nothing every time mr. big does something that isn't what she wants she's ready to pounce on him accusingly saying essentially that she knew he was going to disappoint her because he's a man the epitome of men isn't about us this is about what no this isn't about work this is about us getting closer and you getting so freaked out now you have to put an ocean between us Sarah Jessica Parker's seductive performance of Carrie does a lot to obscure how subjective her interpretation of events really is I think it's very clear from this book that when it comes to me you do not have good judgment what is Carrie's problem well I actually had some you know commitment issues but if you read some of the original columns by Candace Bushnell the character is self-destructive side comes through more clearly in the cold hard pros in light of all this the fact that big continues to want to be with Carrie and keeps returning to her despite the drama shows that he feels something very strong for her talking about Oz ice - sure in the episode secret sex Carrie die sex why her friend Mike won't publicly acknowledge Libby a woman he adores in private she was one of the only women he'd ever met who he felt he could just be with so what's the problem look she's not beautiful and we don't have a lot in common and she realizes that she's that embarrassing girl for big it won't introduce me to your friends you bring me back to that restaurant where men take women they don't want to be seen with at the end of the episode big dismisses her concerns I think Fung wahs is the best Chinese food in the city so that's why we went there the guy we met in the street I couldn't remember his name but it does seem like Carrie was on to something the way Mike talks about Libby sounds just like what big might be thinking about Carrie but she's warm and unpretentious and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life what are you afraid of what other people are gonna think look all I know is that she's not the right woman for me in the larger sense the most plausible reading of what's happening in the first two seasons is that big is falling for Carrie but a lot more slowly man she falls for him in part because she's not his ideal woman he has a certain image in his head of the kind of partner he should have on his arm and probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women exactly there's something wrong with that and that's why he goes on to marry Natasha you know she's shiny hairs styles section Vera Wang and I'm you know the sex column they run next to ads for penile implants this woman looks the part but can't make him happy everything in my apartment is now beige beige is [ __ ] I thought you wanted beige and it seems that big rushed into things with Natasha partly because he didn't want to face the Messier deeper intimacy that Carrie demanded of him why was it it just got so hard and she's later on bakes brief affair with the celebrity shows us that part of him can't resist chasing the most beautiful woman in the room and thus affirming his status she's an actress she's not an actress she's a movie star this superficiality repeatedly leaves him burn she can reach me but I could never get her before and after his infatuations with these model esque trophy women big keeps coming back to Carrie gradually admitting to himself that she's the one who makes him happy after a while you just want to be with the woman thanks you laugh know what I mean Bushnell didn't end up with her big and she's said that in real life Carrie wouldn't end up with big either but the TV show and the movie franchise felt a Hollywood ending was needed I don't see why they couldn't make it work this ending was not without controversy I just always thought that you two would end up together they were never supposed to be together if she was gonna wind up with anybody it was eight show creator Darren star has said that quote the show ultimately betrayed what it was about which was that women don't ultimately find happiness her marriage not that they can't but the show initially was going off-script from the romantic comedies that had come before it at the end it became a conventional romantic comedy the show itself vacillates back and forth on the question of whether big is Carrie soulmate or her addiction did I ever really love big or was I addicted to the pain the exquisite pain of wanting someone so unattainable he's almost an archetypal rendition of that unavailable bad boy you couldn't have except that in the end Carrie does get to have him as easy as it is to criticize Carrie for not shutting the door on big one true thing that comes through is that these two have a real chemistry and a natural rapport who do you think it is Princess Grace of Monaco she's dead so you can understand my surprise they're cute together Wow shouldn't this be at a museum and when he has heart surgery and she cares for him it's easy for them to imagine growing old together so I guess this is what we'd be like in our seventies huh no sex and board games seriously kid you and me the early bird special they just both have a lot of emotional complications to work out before they can get to that end destination you said you loved me and why does it hurt so there's a line in the novel Lake Success quote Manhattan was not just for the winners but the winners of winners and there is a degree to which getting big for carry is about winning in the finale when he perfectly gives himself over to her the look in her eyes is on some level victory it took me a really long time to get here I'm here it's saying finally I won she's convinced this man who's a cynic about love to perform the fairytale romance she's winning the big man to prove that she too is a
