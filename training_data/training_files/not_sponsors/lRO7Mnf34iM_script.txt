leagues is a seasonal game mode focused around general account progression this is the second league and it's called the goblin oh oh wait my bad apparently it was renamed to trailblazer in this league everyone starts as a fresh ironman account which means you have to earn everything yourself trading is not allowed the concept of the trailblazer league is that everyone starts with only mistalin and karamja unlocked there's hundreds of tasks to complete ranging from easy to master tier awarding different amounts of points and after reaching certain thresholds you get to unlock more and more areas there's seven regions to pick from however you can only unlock up to three extra regions beyond the starting two so it's important to pick wisely because once you pick you're stuck with it and you can't undo it along with unlocking regions at certain thresholds you also unlock powerful game-changing relics i'm recording this intro the day before the league starts so the relics and the task list aren't known at the moment but we do know the first tier of relics and that there's gonna be six tiers to unlock each tier has a category rather than being mixed so you don't feel forced to either pick a skilling or a combat route like the last league the default xp multiplier for this league is five times xp rates but there's also passive effects each time you unlock a relic which increase your xp multiplier as well as drop rate of items from monsters and just like with the regions when you pick a relic you can't undo it you only get one relic from each tier i'll link the wiki page about trailblazer league in the description so check it out if you want really in-depth info about all the specific rules and unlocks how you rank at the end of the league is based on your points percentile and i've decided just like in the twisted league i want to go for the dragon cup which means i need to be in the top one percent of players in terms of points when the league ends more simple way to put it my goal is going to be to get as many points as i can for those of you new to my channel i've been playing ultimate iron man for a year and a half and iron man mode in general for about three years so i can at least pretend like i know what i'm doing but if it's anything like the last league no one knows what they're doing or what the best options are and even by the end of the league there's still a good chance no one will truly know what was the best choice i want you to keep in mind this series isn't going to be focused on trying to be super efficient because that's definitely not my play style this is meant to just show my daily progress and the shenanigans i get up to i feel like that's what the average player does well i mean if the average player played like 12 hours a day point being though is that i hope this series is relatable and i hope you can enjoy the league vicariously through these vlogs especially if you're not playing the league yourself to be honest i haven't really done any research about trailblazer i haven't watched the developer live stream q and a's i haven't really watched any videos about it so we're just pretty much going to be winging it i don't know i just want to have fun and maybe make some friends along the way and with that said i'll see you tomorrow when we log into the league or for you in a few seconds rise and grind gamers trailblazer league has started i guess we have a little tutorial to go through first here oh we got 10 points just for opening this menu wait are we unlocking karamja now confirm we've had a long time to decide which first relic to pick and i think i'm gonna go with endless harvest that seems like it's best for my play style it's like the most afk one with this relic resources you get from fishing woodcutting and mining are multiplied by two and they're all immediately deposited into the bank if you don't want them to go to the bank you just put bank fillers in the bank production master makes training production skills immediate so when you're like smelting or fletching cleaning herbs cooking crafting etc it just immediately completes your full inventory and gives you the full xp as well which is nice if you're like a really active player but you know like i said for me i like more of an afk-ish play style so i'm not going to pick that one and skilling prodigy it boosts all your non-combats by plus 12 which is good if you're only playing the league for like a couple weeks but if you're like me and planning to play for the long term this won't really do much once you get your skills to like level 87 anyways which with eventual 16 times xp rates probably won't take too long to get so we're gonna go and unlock the endless harvest relic confirm and the passive effect from this first tier of relics is unlimited run so that's gonna be really really nice for a lot of things especially like god words that's gonna be insane like if i do end up doing sarah okay we can end the tutorial and we can now play the game and that was task two apparently uh so it saved the f keys i was gonna say i'm gonna go like set up the f keys but it saved all them we should also go talk to the combat tutors over here because if we talk to the range one we're gonna toggle the ammo pickup so that when we pick up ammo off the ground it automatically gets equipped if we have it equipped already so automatically equip it and then we can do the same thing with the magic tutor toggle runes to equip when i pick up which means it puts them in the room pouch automatically dude the world's actually just insanely laggy like i keep freezing every few tiles it's insane there's so many people online here let's uh scroll down here look they're all almost full like pretty much 2k people on every league world it's actually insane man um oh we get the veteran worlds so the veteran worlds i think are if you place like mithril or addy or above or something in the last league i'm not quite sure how it works exactly but we got dragon in the last league so we could access any world yeah now it can be with all the other losers dude i don't know what the hell this thing is what am i looking at here i play you i am by the way for anyone who doesn't get the joke i don't know what to do i feel so overwhelmed like i just been standing here for so long and everyone else is just like out here gaining xp and doing stuff okay we're gonna look at the task list and pick out tasks and start doing them achieve your first level up we can do that okay pickpocket decision was ten points and it was the lumbee task okay level two thieving that's another task oh no are we gonna play the task game again where every time i say task in the league you take a shot please don't do that i wanna actually have viewers achieve your first level five ten points this is crazy how fast the theme level is going up it's like every couple pickpockets is just another level okay there's also a task to open 28 coin pouches at once uh there we go as we're running around and exploring and doing stuff in the early game here i'm probably not going to want stuff to automatically go into the bank so we're going to set bank fillers just press fill all and this way when we're woodcutting or fishing or whatever stuff won't automatically go into the bank and it'll stay in our inventory and we can chop trees and burn the logs and fish and cook food and we can have a fun time so we don't have to worry about waiting to train combat because there is no zea in the league so there's no winter toad which means we don't have to stay low hit points so we can just start trading combat right away but before we train combat we're going to come over here to the iron man tutor and claim the iron man armor it's like free iron armor essentially and with unlimited run we don't have to worry about how much we weigh and how fast the run drains i didn't look at the whole task list because there's so many tasks but surely there has to be a task for killing a goblin in the goblin league i guess we'll go and do a very iconic quest we'll go and do the cook's assistant so you all know what we have to do hey it's my content okay cook i brought you your stuff that you didn't ask me to get in the first place oh did we get bonus xp for that oh oh we did wow so instead of 300 xp we got five times so we got 1500 cooking xp and that was a task to get our first level 10. i guess agility and hit points don't count because you start with those uh i should pick production master dude this is taking forever hey how's it going fred do you have a quest for me you know what that's actually crazy what are the odds i just happen to have 20 balls of wool already on me okay we give him the wool and we get some crafting xp and the question itself apparently was the task and nine crafting we are zooming wow just bearing some bones with the task guess they got tasked for everything oh yeah i forgot we get double resources so we just got two logs for chopping one tree burning a log also yeah that's a task too and maybe cooking a chicken possibly not cooking a chicken but burning food is the task okay oh so cooking five pieces of food is a task okay just getting a little bit of food and then we're gonna head over to the stronghold of security a little trick to get up north fast on a new account if you haven't done before count check will teleport you to the stronghold of security only once though and then never again we don't need to get any more food right i have no teleport out either so if i die i die i was hoping there'd be a lot more people here so like other people could take the aggro of the monsters in here but i guess not the first chest what do we get 2k and here we get 3k and then over here we get 5k so up to 10k gp in total i'm a bit skeptical about going through here because these monsters are really high level but i see a bunch of other noobs going through it so it must not be that bad and the final room we get to pick the boots and of course i'm not a psychopath so i'm going to pick the colorful ones and we can grab our chips and dip now is there a task for equipping them oh there is nice oh look at all the noobs here trying to thieve the t stall all right there we go 10 thieving well 100 total level steal from the stall oh it's all happening man brock easy task as well i did see a task that said turn a log into a plank this may be a waste of money in the early game but whatever dude we got tasks done and the rock task too oh boy i thought i was in the main game for a second i thought there were like all these bots over here okay this could be a bit tricky gosh this game mode's so nostalgic mine copper ore was a task let's try to get some tin here too oh no i should have brought the food oh no we're good okay 15 mining and this guy's been going at it at these two rocks here i'm just gonna ask him may i please mine one iron for the task i'm just gonna start mining let's see if he takes it no he's no sit the down is that not a task oh now you sound like a dumb ass level 20 mining first level 20. all right let's see what we can find here in the sword shop i'm actually really surprised i thought that addie swords would be sold all the way out but no we could buy it for 2k gp i think it's worth it right well we're just going to buy anyways it'd be a steel sword for now too we can't buy the scimitars in alkara because that's part of the desert area and we don't have access to that area okay let's go do the daddy's home mini quest and get a little head start on construction oh that was a pretty big hit to the cash stack we got 4k left though oh wait actually we have 3k left just coming up here to grab my spade in my knife no don't take it marlo my boy daddy's home after 18 years from the store with milk and cigarettes all right daddy's home is complete we got the poh for free which was a task in itself and out of that we got 20 construction and we got a little crate here that gives us a few supplies so i'm pretty sure the default poh is actually in brimhaven not in remington because remington's in asgarnia and we don't have asgardia unlocked i guess since we're here we should do the rock museum for the hunter and slayer levels okay i think we finished everything here yeah okay so we got 5k xp for each of them because of the five times multiplier and it puts us at 20 slayer and 20 hunter the dig site quest as well as bone voyager auto completed so we have to find the ruby necklace here which is 1 out of 51 and that way we can unlock the excite pendants hey we just got the clean necklace that was pretty fast alright so we use the necklace on one of these guys over here and he gives us the knowledge on how to enchant ruby necklaces once we get 49 magic we'll probably come back here a little while in the future to finish up all the museum stuff ooh someone made a purple fire we're going to home teleport now because there's some tasks that we have to do around lumbridge so we'll get those done okay that was 10 points just to do home teleport all right we're going to upgrade the bronze axe to steel x and there's a task to chop logs with a steel axe and of course there's a lot of competition there we go and there's the task to smelt a bronze bar okay here's the first median level task 50 points for getting our first level 30 and we can chop willow trees well apparently there's a task to chop a hundred willow logs for a medium task but it might be a little bit difficult over here there's a lot of people around we'll do it later it's kind of weird i feel like i'm just sort of like aimlessly wandering around just doing random stuff like i said the goal is going to be get as many points as possible i guess the sooner we unlock the next relic the better so we're just trying to get as many points as possible right now look at all the people doing agility dude that's insane um i guess that's why you start with 10 agility because this course requires 10 agility so we'll just stay here for a little bit and there's also a task to get a mark of grace oh completed rooftop course that was 10 points in itself and the lumpy easy task oh wait that was two different tasks one was just rooftop course the other was specifically the drainer course and mark of grace obtained we'll come back here once we have a higher xp multiplier i've been editing the last few clips together and i went to a completely random spot to afk just wherever i ended up and uh we just got 40 woodcutting and that was also a 50 point task i would assume burning an oak logs probably a task as well yeah 10 points clutching arrow shafts 10 more points okay i just want to see what happens if we try to leave the area oh yeah i guess that would explain it okay let's try to catch a shrimp without dying to the dark wizard there's no way the dark wizard would aggro me over like all these other people here oh i was confused for a second i was like wait where's the shrimp at cause i have to cook it for a task i was gonna like cooking on one of the fires but then i remembered i have that relic and i did take out the big fillers i'm gonna be a trendy hipster and instead cook the shrimps on the fireplace over here and nice cook a shrimp hey we've got 250 total level i was 10 points no way it's is that c engineer scout zone gosh i'm so shy i'm too scared to say hi yeah you know we just out here catching simps is there a task to cook an anchovy i could easily look it up but it's more fun just finding out what the task and what isn't okay i guess not wait i don't remember getting that so i guess when you would cut it just automatically puts the nest that you get into the bank there's a task to enter drainer manor so i figured may as well do ernst the chicken while we're here there's no requirements for it and there's the 10 points just for going in oh do we have to compete to get the oil can smell you later quest is done huge reward from that not even a league task i was just looking at the wiki now and it tells you like if you unlock certain areas then the quest will be completed and i was actually thinking about gang framnic so that quest would have gone auto completed anyways it only took like three minutes to do but just know for the future i should look at these trailblazer notes before i do any quests dude i literally cannot chop willow tree the second i walk up to a tree so we need 40 points for the next relic and chopping a hundred willow logs will give us 50 points and luckily it's like chopping 50 logs since we get double the logs so once we finish chopping these hundred logs we can pick our next relic there we go chop a hundred willow logs there's 50 more points and i guess this has to update maybe or something okay yeah there we go we can unlock a new relic okay tier two so first thing no matter what once we pick this relic our xp multiplier will go from five times to eight times and then here's the three relics we have to choose from first relic choice is fairies flight which gives you a fairy mushroom that gives you unlimited teleports to any fairy ring or spirit tree in areas that you have unlocked this one seems very pointless because i'll most likely get both of those in the poh eventually and either way it's not hard to get to fairy ringer spirit tree anyways second relic eternal jeweler gives you all these different pieces of jewelry which have unlimited teleports on them and with the master scroll book and these other things too you'll get unlimited teleports on those as well and like for example the master scroll but can hold like the key master teleports for serb the zolandra teleports for zora so this one's a pretty good option and then we also have last recall this rolex worded kind of weird but the way i understand it is that wherever you just teleport from you could teleport straight back there immediately using the crystal memories that you get from it it doesn't work for instances though so i believe god wars is instanced so it wouldn't work for god wars they could still like teleport to the god wars dungeon if you just teleport out there it'll be really nice for like serb for example to teleport straight back to serb or dk's especially going directly back to dks and resupplying you could just like kill a couple resupply go straight back that'll actually be really really nice for that um and then take like runecrafting for example if you're doing like nature room crafting or iranian room crafting you can just teleport straight out to the bank and then use the crystal of memories to teleport straight back to the altar another thing to think about is that these first two relics don't really exactly add anything new like the jewelry one would be nice for like the early to mid game but once we get to the late game like especially if i'm unlocking framnic i'll have most of these teleports in the poh anyways plus we have unlimited run it just seems to me like last recall is the best relic for the long term and for the late game and you know i plan to play the league for like the whole entire time okay while i was standing around editing these last couple clips we got the quiz master random it is so tempting to pick the 1k but we're going to go with the mystery box and nice okay i've been standing around long enough deciding which relic to pick we are going to go with last recall okay select and confirm oh that's cool all right there we go we got the crystal of memories and we got the eight times xp multiplier now this probably won't help us very much in the early game because there's really not many teleports we could even do but once we get to the mid game and start like actually unlocking teleports and especially late game that's gonna be super super nice but for now it's just gonna chill on the bank i bet we can unlock the second area on day one as well we got 21 tasks that we have to do so the relics go by points to unlock them but the areas go by number of tasks apparently there's also a task that says burn 100 willow logs so we just chopped them now let's go burn them all oh wait we have to get 30 fire making first okay we'll get 30 fire making with the oak logs and then we'll burn all the willow logs okay this should be the last log 100 willow logs burn medium task 50 points let's keep it going there's a task to restore five prayer points so we'll kill some like chickens or something get five prayer and then restore all the prayer at an altar okay barrier the bone there's level five prayer gotta drain down to zero restore and there we go wow thieving people seems a lot faster than just leaving the t-stalls because you could do it so much more frequently it's just constant xp drops i don't know why i'm doing it i just feel like doing it i'm sorry this video is like so all over the place it's just i don't know i'm just exploring and having fun okay task to cook food on the cook's range okay let's enter xanaris here 10 more points as you can see lost city is auto complete for everyone and also fairy tale part one and two which means we can just immediately use the fairy ring and using the fairy ring is oh oh we got the fairing task just by entering xander's never mind anyways that was a really fast way to get to barack slash edgeville okay what are we doing up here i don't know what i'm doing oh we should do a romeo and juliet i checked the wiki this time this is not auto complete by any area so let's go do that wait how do i wait why do i have two draymond staffs did i start with these i know you start with one dream and stuff that they give you i don't i don't know how i got a second one apparently red berries have a two minute respawn timer so i have to like wait for these to grow because other people keep on picking them but looks like we just got a few i don't want to burn the red berry pie for when we do knight sword because i'll most likely be unlocking asgardia later on oh oh there's a task to pet the stray dog i'm definitely not doing it just because of the task i'm doing it because i'm a good person now praise me wait that's the the perk the relic that gives you the the unlimited fairy rings and mushrooms why are people picking that okay quest is done five quest points and ten league points i noticed we're all so close to our first level 50 skill so let's knock that out there we go 50 woodcutting and that was a medium task 50 points dude that home teleport animation and this league is so cool we're going to head over to draenor though because i just saw there was a task to complete 30 laps there so we're going to go do that also just notice that because we teleported we can teleport straight back to that place i was by the trees over there if i really wanted to i'm still going to buy a chronicle and drainer because that's still going to be useful okay diengo chronicles 300 and then teleport cards are 150 each if you don't know the chronicle allows us to teleport to the champions guild which is pretty close to barack and there is 30 laps and that is 50 points for that i have no idea what to do next my go-to thing is just like afk woodcutting while i figure out what to do there's a few things that require iron bars so we're gonna go mine a bunch of ore and train smithing because we can't do the night sword quest right now because we don't have asgardia unlocked it's like every single mining spot even for like these lowest tier ores there's always a bunch of people in every world see this is why i'm thinking i just teleport from the fairy ring so what's the point of that fairy ring teleport relic if i can just use this to get back to the fairy ring 15 smithing but the question is can we successfully make this iron into bars we need at least one um for the bank chest on fossil island so nice okay oh there's a task too cool we got both them oh it's so perfect just like all of you hey we just got combat level 10 which is 10 points i'm currently just trying to get a rope i know there's easier ways to get it but i just happen to be near the muggers and it's like a one out three drop and there it is now we can build everything on fossil island oh cleaning this grimy guam that i got also apparently it was 10 points bone voyage is auto completed and traveled the fossil island task is complete we're gonna go build all the stuff in the museum camp over here first the most important thing being the bank chest oh i have a genius idea so i can home teleport and it's going to save this spot on the crystal of memories and we could teleport straight back here okay so let's try this out uh teleport back and then it should take us right back there right that's so sweet okay it says we only need level five construction to build the fossil cleaning station right here and that posted 21 construction now we can build the bank chest okay there we go now we're set oh that was a task two build a bank on fossil island hey i have a good one why did the mudkip fall into the well he didn't see that well okay last thing built in the museum camp we got everything built now and we got up to 39 construction from building all this stuff as well beyond the amount of xp i was expecting hey why can't you pet this dog you can only examine it wait i was looking at areas i just clicked on karamja there's an option to teleport can you just teleport there anytime you want huh is that like the lodestone system in rs3 is there like no limit amount of times you could teleport or something uh so we get taken over here i guess there's like a a way stone for each area so if i try to teleport again there's no time limit or anything you can do as much as you want that could actually make this crystal quite beneficial in the early game it'd be very easy to set spots okay so our poh by default is set to here and there's a task to enter the poh okay i thought there was at least maybe it was complete somehow but there is a task to build a room in here uh it costs 1k gp and i'm so poor all right we'll spend the cash stack on this room which we're just going to destroy anyways we need to like find a way to start making money whoa there's a lot of people here in the ham hideout uh we just have to pickpocket want them to get a task done here we go yeah it's easy task i may as well stay here to get like a few things like maybe the rusty swords for the arty diary it's really not worth doing clues right now because once we get the double drop rate modifier and then the triple drop rate modifier that affects clues as well and there's also a relic which i'll probably be picking that also affects clues so it's really not worth the time like stressing about clues at the moment but i'll just keep in the bank for the future i've got a very high iq idea right here i'm gonna teleport home and then save this spot on the crystal and then we just keep on teleporting straight back into the ham hideout is that links ocarina wait no there's no way he'd have dragon cup never mind so if we get knocked out or locked in jail we just teleport straight back to the spot right oh wait what oh does it like lose the memory after you do it once so you have to like teleport again to recharge the memory is that how it works oh we got a steel pickaxe that's an upgrade to the bronze pick that we had before interesting so the home teleport does still have the 30 minute timer but the way stone teleports are unlimited i got a strength potion from a dr jekyll random event and i was looking on the list and apparently there's a task to just drink a string potion there's a task to do 50 total laps of rooftop courses and we've done 30 laps so far from the drainer one so we'll do 20 laps on the rock course okay hopefully this should complete the task yeah 50 laps for 50 points we are four tasks or no it has to update three tasks away from unlocking the next area and reach our first level 60 in a skill 60 wood cutting it's a hundred points that's the first hard task we've done now oh we're getting so close though okay let's unlock this mushroom tree so we'll have it permanently unlocked for the future i wanted to mine the iron ores here but i don't want to like just take some random guys spot there's only one person here though surprisingly so maybe we can find the world oh they did just add like 16 more worlds like an hour ago so hopefully that should help you can see it's a little bit more dispersed than it was before not every world's completely full wow what a name wait oh that was a task just mine in order with the steel pick i didn't even know that i was going for the task that's mine 50 iron ore oh there it is that's the task done mine 50 i forgot i had the double perk so that was like twice as fast as i was expecting wait was that the last task does it just have to update oh we can unlock the new area i've had many weeks to think about all the different areas and the pros and cons and i want to get kanderin and asgarnia for sure i'm thinking framnic for the third but i was stuck for a while between picking kanderin or asgarnia for the first pick of area um i think i'm gonna go with kanderin so we'll just choose to unlock it and i think the quest points should go up to kanderin confirm oh it's so cool that's a cool animation and we got the mysteries done from that as well 70 quest points now the nicest part about it though monkey malice one and two are completed so i guess we can just go into here go to areas and take the way stone over there right let's see where it takes us to i'm curious oh nice that's a pretty good spot right here in arty oh there's that chest upstairs over here i don't know if i have the theme level for it but there's a chest upstairs where we can get nature runes from i think it's this one yo we're so rich now so we're about 1k points to the next relic and then 79 tasks for the next area so there's a very good chance we'll end up getting the relic before the area okay we got a few nature runes here um we should probably work on the already easy diary because that'd be really good to get done for the cape itself and the cape has some teleports on it too oh we have to sell silk to the silk trader but i think we have to wait 30 minutes after we steal the silk so we should do that first oh stealing a chocolate slice was an easy task here and then cake was a easy already task when you get a pet they're insured automatically in the league and they carry over league to league which is probably like one of the only things that carries over i don't have any pets on the league though as you can see oh that was a already task and that was just a league task too dude this is gonna be sick just mining vernessen slash pure essence and just have it go straight to the bank these things don't ever deplete right you just afk here forever same thing with fishing crowd ones too these kinds of spots are gonna be like so nice spots that don't move or don't deplete or whatever all right to know i only have one rusty sword for you please don't break it thank you wow looks like we really got a packed fishing trawler today i'm glad you could just leave with one person even though i'm not gonna like actually do it i don't think you have to do it right you just have to go out then you could just like teleport out or leave or whatever oh cool yeah it's the already task done there's no point doing fishing trailer now because once we have the times three relic that'll make it three times faster to finish the anglers outfit okay really dumb random thing i'm just killing men right now we just hit 500 total level i have no idea what i'm doing i just do the most random things when i'm like looking up what to do next any xp gain is better than no xp gained okay it should have been 30 minutes now nice okay selton for 60 gp and as the last task in the rd area let's go collect that reward oh we get the xp lamp 2 for uh levels over 30. hey hey how's it going i didn't even have any regular cape that i was wearing before so now we can get the already cloaked one and can we just get back if we destroy it oh no we can't reclaim it uh we're gonna use it on i mean really like none of the skills will end up being difficult to train anyways so i guess we'll just put on construction 20k xp wow and of course we get unlimited teleports to the candor and monastery okay let's go do waterfall quest visit the tree gnome village easy task i'll let that guy go first and get ready for the 12. all right let me just follow him up over here oh no okay we're good hey that could be me any second though and we made it out safely and we can pick these runes back up okay let's see the massive xp drop right here oh 51 attack 50 strength oh it's so good dude oh comet level 25 gave us 10 points as well oh it's so good 38 combat kanderin automatically completes grand tree but it does not automatically complete fight arena so i guess we should do this one next hey that means we can equip that adamant sword now that our attack level's so high and that was a task as well equipping weapons 50 points this guy's flinching the bouncer because they have a rune axe i'm just gonna be flinching too so i'm glad we could actually flinch i wasn't sure if there'd be like a way to flinch or not i know you're supposed to safe spot then by using like magic or range or something but if you can't tell i don't have much money right now i can't really afford to buy any runes but seeing this guy so persistent and not giving up on killing that bouncer you know it gives me hope it's really getting me inspired then you got that guy with the sapphire who's going to finish the quest in like three minutes wait the guy just teleport out and now this ogre's aggroed on me even though it's not my ogre it's supposed to be the bouncer i'm fighting what they want to be ogre it's all ogre now dude the freaking dog just do you spawn oh my god i've been here for like at least 10 minutes flinching oh now the dog is going to come back out all right let's let's make some money or something okay we just did hazel colt quest and we got 2k gp from that and some deben xp too all right you could probably buy some runes with this okay we did one more quest we did cheap herder which gave us 3.1 k gp okay now we have enough money so let's go to the rock and buy some runes all right we'll buy a staff of fire and i think equipping an elemental staff is an easy task well the cash deck is down to 174 gp but at least we should have enough magic spells to get through this quest i can't even cast fighter strike yet i have level one magic and there's level 13 now we can cast fire strike so yeah i mean i did waste 10 minutes before that's the whole point of me playing this league it's all like one big learning experience we just learn as we go and enjoy the journey because if you just focus on going for one end destination as fast as possible when you finally get there you'll look back and wonder where all the time went okay fight arena is done we got all this xp that ends us with 57 attack and some thievin levels 2. we got gp right yeah we got 1k gp wait was that task i can't even tell what to task and what's not task because these point things they're so delayed maybe these quests are tasks i have no idea hey oh man can we like not do the party thing i've had i've had a really long day today okay all right okay there we go we got a quest done task xp runes etc okay just did the tower of life quest and we get some xp that's a leak task and we get access to creature creation which is what we'll eventually be doing for our secondaries for herblore okay next quest we're gonna do is sea slug sea slug is done 57k fishing xp from that and 10 points there's also a diary task to like fish on the fishing platform so just getting that done okay i think we should really wrap it up for this video because it's getting late i should probably start editing because i want to try making daily videos i just realized this video ended up being like really really long so i'm sorry about that i'll try to condense it in the future i was trying to condense it as much as i could today but i don't know maybe i'm just having too much fun i'm just so excited i want to show everything that i'm doing i really hope you enjoyed watching because i've been having a lot of fun playing i guess today was more so focused on like questing and skilling versus trying to rush points as fast as possible because i plan to play for the full two months or at least just until i get burnt hopefully as long as possible so i'm really not in a rush for anything i'm just enjoying the game mode i feel like i'm the tortoise and the tortoise and the hair story i guess we'll be wrapping up today with 658 total level we got 1150 points in total uh tomorrow we should be unlocking the second relic and maybe area maybe not we'll see i just feel so overwhelmed like there's so much to do all right but yeah i'll be afk the rest of night while i edit and eat and stuff i'm gonna start the next video like right away though so yeah if you're new notification gamers but yeah that's going to do it for this video so thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed and i hope you have a great day and i will see you again tomorrow
