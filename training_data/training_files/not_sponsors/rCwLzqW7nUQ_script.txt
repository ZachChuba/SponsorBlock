[Music] i'm starting today off with a huge milestone that i've been working on for a long time i managed to get 79 wood cutting right alongside 80 fletching i can now make one of the most iconic ranged weapons in the entire game it'll be my best in slot until 70 and i'll probably still use it after that on top of that it feels so satisfying to get something like this done so much flax spun i've fletched so many bows dude it's gonna take five millennia to get this tree down but when it's down let's make a magic short bow here we go ladies and gentlemen we are selecting the option of the magic short bow there we go we got the unstrung jam that puppy right on there taking it out of my ass a little bit put it on there that's a magic short bow baby i'm looking good dude i'm looking good i don't know why i'm not wearing green dehyde but uh you get it you get it i'll go change as you can see we have one of the most ferocious monsters in the game we're going to test out the spec god damn that felt good i am so happy i'm able to do that whenever i want these magic trees are so goddamn obnoxious today's episode is brought to you by nordvpn all right let me level with you here there's a lot of ways to use a vpn you can use it as a layer of security when you're googling big boob naked or whatever you do at 1am you can juke out your isp so they don't think about throttling you or you could do what i do and access content on sites only available in other countries the other day i wanted to watch citizen kane a classic but get this only canada has the privilege to watch it on netflix can you fathom that during this crisis they want to deprive us of quality films that's awfully inconsiderate canada but guess what i don't have to move there to watch citizen kane i can just say i'm connecting from canada clear my cash and enjoy my goddamn movie yeah i've got a few tricks up my sleeve assert your dominance over other countries by using code jimmy or going to nordvpn.com jimmy to get 70 off a three-year plan plus a month free that's all i've got enjoy the episode first things first 70 attack all i need now is 85 slayer and i can go get a whip secondly i just put together my first crystal key which means i can open that chest and taverly and get a dragon stone i can cut that and make a cool jewelry guy ideally i would make a glory but i think that's 80 crafting uh i don't have that that's a lot of levels to get just realize there's a kk slider in the top right i do wacky things on stream i need to i need to settle down god damn it my oak tree died since i can't make a glory i'm going to make the next best thing which is a ring of wealth i wear a ring of wealth i get more key drops more key drops means more dragon stones more dragon stones means uh more incentive to get 80 crafting and get a glory it all intertwines a lot of productivity going on here hey well i have it now so let's uh let's go make a ring of welt baby gonna enchant it real quick and that ladies and gentlemen is a ring of wealth i'm going to be a rich man a rich and powerful man i'm a good guy and we're going to put this to use oh my [ __ ] god oh my [ __ ] god dude oh my god i got dragon flake legs dude that was on my [ __ ] second kill that's so sick yeah that's right um streamer youtuber favoritism very real thing i got dragon plate legs on my second iron dragon kill of the task which i'm really grateful for because this task on my account is terrible not to mention if you had dragon plate legs in 2006 you were a god you were a walking legend people bowed down to you so you know start doing that when you see me on top of that i got a runite limb drop which means i can make a rune crossbow this was the greatest task of all time yeah i thought i was recording when i made this thing but uh i have it now i'm the owner hey look i have a new pet too look at that that's funny oh i've been waiting to get a hard clue scroll i can finally open one of course i get a magic short bow all right all right that was a slap in the face but i got an enchanted hat so at least i could look like an idiot uh whenever i want i don't know if it's out yet but i'm just never gonna wear it it's gonna collect dust in the bank but hey look at me it's been a long grind we got 50 runecrafting and now we've got 63 smithing big thanks to everyone who tuned in to all the streams i did uh while mining all of this we can drink a cool dwarven stout like the the tier 2 dwarven style whatever it is and get to 65 and we can now do devious minds this quest came out on december 19 2005 kind of notorious because it's extremely short it's got crazy requirements and this quest really doesn't do anything for anyone i would not be surprised if this quest was the least completed quest in the entire game but that's not how we roll baby we're about released we're doing it this is like the sarah diamond version of the oh okay as i'm talking about how cool he looks the bat goes over him thank you it looks like the sarah diamond version of the other chaos robes they should put this in the game he said the monks are facing new threats he needs a special weapon that special weapon is a mithril two-handed sword combined with a bowstring to make a bow sword we've got to head over to our boy doric and use his anvil it's like a really cool anvil i'm pretty sure i haven't been here since i was free to play all right let's sip this thing and put that there grinding and there we go attach a string we got a bow sword it won't let me wield it though i just get this it's a bow with a sword am i supposed to use this it's not it's not a bow it's not a sword it's it's both what am i supposed to do here when do i hold it do i shoot arrows from it do i slash people i have a [ __ ] few here's your weapon of mass destruction sir can you teach me how to use it it's a foreign design maybe yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] you wonder if you could do me one final favor wait this sounds familiar that was a reference line that was good it was a good he just gave me this sketchy orb he wants me to put it in a large roon pouch which i have here then we have to go do something in the abyss to it i have no idea what this is going to do i have no idea what i'm holding but you know me i'm just doing this i'm just a good guy i don't ask questions i just do things for people this always looks so scary basically what we're doing is using the law alter as a secret passageway into intrana so we're gonna go in here ah look at look at us since the altar is on in toronto we just leave this and here we are hey monks i have a skull on my head please ignore it i do not kill people i promise and i use this right on here oh cut scene baby what's going on what is that sack of potatoes or something what was he holding holy [ __ ] it's a ninja he just murdered that man and he just sniped that man yup there he goes down for the count he stole a relic adventure you must find the full and put that teleport beacon on the altar uh yeah about that uh what are you trying to say i did it uh i thought it was from one of you people what do you mean you people the monks did yeah so i just [ __ ] up i don't know what i did i don't know who that ninja guy was uh but he came out he killed a bunch of people in a church very uh questionable thing to do in the first place uh this is how i feel okay i just got back over here and uh this monk is dead he appears to have been killed by powerful magic i'm gonna go ahead and take a wild guess that this is not the guy i talked to earlier i feel like i should start asking a lot more questions before i do favors for people every time i'm in this area i do something i'm not supposed to do i'm a walking hazard in this area god the tension when i walked in this building is unbelievable i'm letting the high priest know that i found a dead guy where i talk to the mysterious monk he's a little concerned he wants me to go talk to certification in falador yeah he uh he already knows about the situation he's got a lot of intel everywhere he goes they're investigating the design of this weapon that i made from scratch i think i can just kind of tell them what i did but uh there we go that's devious minds and that is where that story ends this storyline was not continued in old school runescape there is a citation that says modmark stated that devious minds had the shortest development time of any quest released since runescape classic another situation where a developer left before it was complete which is a damn shame because it looked like they were going to implement a bow sword into the game hopefully they'll revisit the storyline and we can start shooting and slicing at the same time it'll be badass we have officially completed all 29 quests that were released in 2005. so ladies and gentlemen welcome to 2006 the feeling of going on to a new year never gets old there's a ton of 2005 content i have not gotten to yet like barrows and fire cape all that we'll go revisit it but for now i've got my eye on quest number 100 but yep here we are january 10 2006 quest number 96 the hand in the sand we're in yanil we're gonna go over to bird's house over here and see what's going on right off the bat he's telling me he is certain he's about to lose his job apparently he's found a hand in the sand it's like the it's like the name of the quest he found it in his little sand pit over there he hasn't told the authorities about this yet because they're all hammered all the time and he doesn't see a point luckily for him dealing with alcoholics is our specialty not an issue we'll report this cut off hand ourselves check out this expertise this is how much i know i'm gonna buy a beer beforehand because i know for a fact that this captain's not gonna talk to me until i get him hammered he's already hammered but he needs to function he needs to be able to conversate i have some more beer for you that's that's how i'm starting it you give the beer he takes a huge gulp just what i needed yeah i know i'm just waving a hand in this face who's is this have you seen his hand he's blaming the wizards go interrogate one of them pointy hat [ __ ] oh apparently he dropped the hand in his beer it's a beer-soaked hand now i'm glad i'm carrying this in my in my backpack you wave the hand at the wizard there's just beer sprinkling everywhere on the floor i'm just waving a a human hand around i don't think my guy's ever picked up a social cue or understood what's acceptable just kind of does its thing i like them you hand it over do you have any input as to the matter at hand dude why what's that sound that's kind of hot i like that little clocks okay god damn okay down a year neal in the magic gill bird pipe down man i know how you feel about to lose your job but you gotta be a man we gon find out whose hands in the sand jim i just want this [ __ ] to pay off but now a dead guy gonna

i'm going to the wizard i'ma kick his ass i'll get sandy's confession i'll get the truth while i teach him a lesson i made this drink it's just a little potion take it with food that [ __ ] is potent when he takes this he cannot tell a lie can't wait for him to say that he's been sleeping with a guy never mind went back to first work slipped it in his teeth took a slurp how the hell did he not see yo sandy yelled at him like his parents that's right [ __ ] to tell me why you killed clarence um have fun in prison sandy and don't drop the soap trying to frame my boy bird depriving him of hope by release buddy you remember that name i heard his body parts all over the game wait what what did you just uh you gotta start looking for you hit his body parts of his arms they're everywhere man oh my god [Music] well i don't know what all that was about but uh i could buy runes up here now i was supposed to be able to buy these forever ago thank god january 23rd 2006 quest number 97 and nakris lament you know in all my time playing this game i've never actually died from thirst but it still freaks me out every time i'm i'm over here like i feel like i'm gonna die of thirst no matter how many water skins i have on me speaking of which i'm pretty sure i forgot to bring them i don't know it just it freaks me out dude i feel like i'm always gonna die somehow all right i'm south of the bandit camp should be a dude here lazeem lesem lazim l it's my boy l this guy used to be a great sculptor and then he had some sort of incident so he can't hold a chisel anymore therefore he cannot sculpt anymore and we happen to stumble upon him as he needs assistance not only are we going to sculpt for him we're going to gather the rocks for him too there's a little quarry over here it's got sandstone limestone all the rocks that you could dream of chiseling and hitting with a sharp needle stick first things first 32 grams of sandstone dude i just mined for so long getting 32 grams exactly i was [ __ ] mining granite the whole time i didn't even look somebody help me okay there's sandstone the rocks are just so similar in color how could i have known i mean i guess i could have you know just hovered my mouse over to see that it was granite but he still okay he's got that he's alking did he just alk my [ __ ] did he just alk my sandstone okay he made the base of the statue oh wow i can't believe i had that in my backpack that is huge all right i just finished the body and now i have to pick what head i want on the statue can i make a statue of me i think it should be my head are you mad no i made a camel head let me have a look at that head okay said he'd make the statue head look like me what dude i'm so confused what just happened i'm so lost okay i made the statue look like him hey look at that and it's uh [ __ ] gone oh and we're falling too why not okay so this guy apparently made me build and sculpt a statue so that it would fall into this why couldn't we just push giant [ __ ] boulders on it or something i'd put so much detail into it okay all right here's the logic behind the whole uh statue thing there's doors all around this floor instead of keys to get into them you need the limbs and the limbs of the statue fit the sizes of the doors somehow i don't know how this guy knew that we're gonna get the limbs from the statue and uh go open doors okay so this quest had a ton of lore in it so i'm gonna do my best to explain what happened because it was really hard to follow so we go into the first cut scene at the first door this is inakra she just finished building this temple for her lord i'm assuming that's zamerak she's a uh majorat god these [ __ ] words are so hard to pronounce all of them every single word in this game pretty much around this temple we're getting the backstory about why this place exists there's these little letters around the corners of the room they um i don't know what they're spelling ow my head i'm pretty sure i'd bash my head on the door every time i try to open one black and white once again faded film they're the knights of uh the avarakians avarakians i don't know i don't know what that means uh she is showing them that she has completed desert treasure f for avaraka apparently we need to pay our respects that's a gamer reference arg yeah so those knights tried to stop in acro and she was like nah it's i'm gonna keep doing this yeah i just gave myself the third concussion in 15 minutes camel god guy at uh act thon nicos this camel guy is on the side of zeroes and inakra is a zamarak person camel guy was like you'll join us right and she's like of course and then she's like you know i'm presuming she was just kidding oopsies and here we have her uh casting some spells on bones and she's made a level one skeleton saying it's gonna make a good weapon and now it's bones again it's not gonna make a good weapon at all and that's that's that one now we've got all the letters we're gonna go in the center room right here and place all the letters where they belong i went upstairs there were puzzles up here i didn't bring any soft clay so i had to go back to get that i shot some fire at this frozen fountain and unfroze it now it's a normal fountain there was this warrior guy over here who's stuck in place he's been here for centuries his family's dead but his biggest complaint is that he's hungry so we gave him a cake and now he's feeling a little more optimistic about things i cleaned a damn chimney i set some uh braziers on fire over here a little dark light in the mood i spent like 20 minutes and realized i needed to make another mold thing that was in the shape of a camel's head so i could make a camut i shoved it into this thing got another concussion yeah this is an acra uh betraying and ice barrage uh oh hey el what are you doing up here i went upstairs and there was a bone guard i cast that one spell that uh dead things hate and he was immediately free from his curse i guess i did him a favor i got downstairs and whoa another big [ __ ] standing as still as a [ __ ] statue i kind of [ __ ] around in the room a little bit started picking up rocks as it turns out the way to get past this part was to impress him with our defensive abilities and what i mean by that is i needed to pray melee but here's the goofy part i didn't charge my prayer at all so i left the temple for the third time and went and charged my prayer i came back let him try to beat the [ __ ] out of me three times and he failed and he was like that is awesome so i repaired this wall behind him a knocker was like no what did you uh do that for bone guy was uh free and uh whoa it's camel guy he's got human sandals though was kind of thrown off so that wall i just built got [ __ ] blown to smithereens glad i did that anakras said that this camel's gonna pay and then they both turned into their majorat skeleton forms skeleton battle i'll be waiting for you in the north okay so yeah that happened uh they're planning their fight and i stood there got my scroll wondering uh what the hell just happened i got 62 crafting and apparently there's gonna be two skeletons fighting in the north if anyone wants to go and catch that bout there we have it all right february 7th 2006 quest number 98 cabin fever this one's actually a great quest we get to be a pirate going down a little bar over here we're going to talk to bill teach he said he needs a pirate to help him solve his problems i'd love to be a pirate i'm saying a lot of pirate terms to this guy he's heading down to mostly harmless it's a great pirate hangout but yeah he's running into trouble on his way there another group of pirates keeps trying to sink his ship and he's by himself his whole crew deserted him that's messed up but i'm thinking me and him sail and we take on all the pirates every single one i've got a huge sword i've got dragon plate legs now they're in a goddamn pirate in this world that can stand a chance against me we just set sail and the other pirates have already found us hence the hole that's in the ship now they're just shooting at us they're blowing holes everywhere they broke our cannon things are not looking good so far it doesn't look like it's flooding anything actually maybe it's not a problem oh another hole perfect so before we patch the holes up i need to get across to their ship and take out their cannon god damn i look heroic up here look at this look at look at me look at me go check out this move it's gonna be really hot i'm gonna indiana jones across whoa good evening i think i'm pretty close to a defense level i might just train here this is multitasking at its finest i'm gonna blow it up while hitting this guy maximum efficiency baby hey you like that don't you kabloom kabam i blew up their cannon they have no way of firing at us now in reality here we can just set sail and leave but that wouldn't be fun at all we're gonna kill him and and steal from him and and then we'll leave it's gonna patch these holes up real quick oh my god it's perfect we're good to go before we sink these bastards we're putting a little salt in the wound we're gonna steal their money plundering baby that's my middle name by plunder release they call me i'm gonna train while i wait for their plunder to respawn i'm gonna take this guy out he looks important slightly more red than everybody else eye patch baby that's right now we're the real deal that's so disrespectful kill a pirate take his eye patch and that's 63 defense by the way they're gonna know my name across the seven or six seas another eye patch jesus christ oh they're gonna hate this fire yeah girl this is what life's all about right here this is for the boys back okay home shot three do i need to keep going yeah one more why not yeah they're sunk now uh i'll take your word for it man we made it to mostly harmless i'm getting a lecture about not uh speaking pirates very politically incorrect apparently he's given me a book oh i can learn how to be a pirate from it or at least talk proper like one thank you so much dude god i just can't get over how good i look and uh there we go 7k smithing 7k crafting and 7k agility xp that is not bad i am not complaining oh in 10k why not on to quest number 99 february 27 2006 fairy tale part 1 growing pains this is the first part of the true fairy saga after lost city which also means i'm getting close to finally unlocking fairy rings i'm so excited to be able to use those things we're starting off by talking to martin over here by release you look familiar didn't i catch you going through my pockets no what the hell's your problem why would you say that i guess there's some issues going on with the plants and the way they're growing around runescape there's something something going on something fishy we're gonna run around this game a little bit and consult other farmers and see if they have any idea what's going on of why these plants aren't producing enough crops it's amazing that this entire world survived without farming for so so long they discovered it last year now there's a big problem going on with it already jeez what would this world do without a guy like me be dead everyone would be dead frizzy is blaming the lack of crops on the river levels elston is blaming the insects that's uh that's his take thanks alston heskel's having an existential crisis about this whole thing acknowledging that adventurers dig up her patch and plant their own trees here oh my god you're an adventurer they're all adventures jesus christ yeah we all look the same to you yeah okay heskel we see you now we see a loud and clear [ __ ] it'd be a shame if i dug up some of your tweets from 2012 you'd hate that treznor here is blaming the seasons being mixed up the seasons apparently forgot which order they're supposed to come in uh this guy's a [ __ ] idiot faith here's keeping a third eye open saying that it's fairies doing all of these things that the gardeners have said the fairies control everything natural from weather to seasons uh my guy clearly thinks she's a loony bin but we'll go report everything we've learned to martin essentially telling him that everyone has no idea what the hell's going on and we've made zero progress martin's actually a big fan of the whole fairy idea so we're gonna go to xanaris and uh see if they'd know anything perhaps i just stumbled across rip it the frog he's just standing out here with the frogs not saying a damn word not doing anything this is the most interesting man i've ever met good luck out there rip it make me proud here we are we're gonna talk to the fairy godfather the fairy queen's supposed to be around here but she's not it's this guy the fairy queen is sick right now there was this thing that came down called a tangle root started causing a ruckus ruining all the farming things the fairy queen went to kill it something went wrong and now she's sick and now the fairy godfather's here filling in he also warned me not to cause trouble for the folks here while i'm around i just gave him a question mark found fairy enough she's taking care of the fairy queen there she is looking real sad you must be a mighty healer uh no a great druid no a shaman no a surgeon no a doctor medic nurse no no and no i'm a mighty adventurer a [ __ ] you a mighty adventurer no i heard you but [ __ ] you oh fairy enough decided to let us help anyway we need to go find a guy named zandar horfire apparently he studies magic illness which is what the fairy queen has right now so we're gonna go find that guy and see if he knows literally anything ah this place is pretty all these dark wizards what are you guys up to hey you attacked my brethren and i i don't recall that ever i guess i have to go talk to a guy named malignant mortifer he's that sketch ball with those elemental wizards outside of falador down here like remington port ceremony you'll know him you'll know him when you see him apparently he's fought a tangle root in the past and knows all about him hey look here he is so this guy knows how to beat up a tangle foot he's fought one before and killed it i'm just filling him in on the situation telling about how the xanarist fairy queen person is basically sick right now and uh if we want his help we need to go to the drainer manor he wants us to take the skull from the grave in the backyard i guess that's what we're gonna do my god a champion wow now this is a hero doomwizard28 well i love you doomwizard just say it back what the [ __ ] man i'm so sad that i'm gonna do a shameless plug for all my social media to get uh love and affection from all of you i can't believe i'm about to do this dude maybe that is my character's uh catch phrase and i just [ __ ] on rat catchers for it i mean this is definitely more acceptable context for that sentence if we want to kill the tangle foot we gotta get a pair of enchanted secateurs we need to make them with white berries mort meyer pear and a mort meyer stem we have to take it to the nature spirit and ask him to perform the ceremony of phasma phasmatus natura a lot of big words a lot of scary words a lot of craziness going on let's just uh go do it i already had some white berries in the bank i just got the more meyer stem oh my god finally it took forever to get a pair all right we got everything it's our boy the nature spirit he's gonna do this little ceremony hey this is cool wow you're a good guy thank you all right we got enchanted seconders it's a weird word secateurs all right let's uh let's go kill a tanglefoot i've made the descent i'm ready for battle gatekeeper you are a terrifying looking [ __ ] let me through look at his hands dude oh my god okay we're in it this place is disgusting baby tangle foot these are just already just spawning babies these walls make me uncomfortable what the [ __ ] am i looking ill like actually makes me uncomfortable okay where are you come here i'm killing you so you can leave forever you're a gross thing god this battle's so epic dude i'm gonna go get a drink one second i'll be right back i got some cranberry juice god i love cranberries is this done yet are we done [ __ ] just kill him oh my god oh my god queen seconders i just keep these give her the green ones all right godfather i uh took care of business gave him an offer he couldn't refuse you know like the movie now that we have these things back he says that the fairy queen's gonna be good again and we finish the quest but you know it's it's just part one this is only part one so i'm assuming she's not gonna be as good as we think she's gonna be my tune in but ladies and gentlemen this just means that we have arrived to quest number 100. the next time i see you we will be taking on recipe for disaster [Music] you
