[Music] what you're seeing here has been recorded that directly in game and on the live servers worlds with blue skies daytime stones environmental light in changed hemispheric effects and more this isn't an Unreal Engine mock-up demo this is a live gameplay and whether it isn't an official update so there now what's the deal here roller form user or darker wanted to get a feel for what tenuous atmospheric roads will actually be like when they release early next year in the odyssey update with that goal in mind ease set about the task of drayton of these environments hidden game and we've got right here is footage that whole duck captured from his results now for those of you who might not be aware old duck is pretty handy when it comes to graphics mods for elite its previous and ongoing work the elite amazingly realistic immersion mod allows users to change a number of things in game including that changing the blackness of space improve in at the darkness of shadows disable in old cockpit lights remove in space now and much more it's handy modern that a lot of people like to use and one which really can improve the experience of the game overall in principle then days and nothing going on here that gets into modifying the game's code or anything like that and said it'll works by changing that the shaders something that in concept is similar to the shader injectors like switch effects and every shade but that's not to under set lists at all because obviously this is very complex to achieve Oh duck uses a 3d of me go Toa to achieve all of this that's available it has a link in the video description if you want to find out more so go and beyond to just graphic Halldor nadir injectors the concept here was extended to changing lighting on planetary surfaces to give more fade they like filled great in a blue sky changing the ship controllers to whites and a few other things as well I think you can all done likely agree that result look very good indeed now this modern can be used in gamer technically it isn't breaking frontiers terms of surface and it functions in the same manner as other already widely used graphical injectors so it really shouldn't cause any issues either technically or legally when Talent the mod isn't available for public use although all duck is considering it but that said there are a few minor issues and concerns that may potentially prevent a public release not least of which is that it's possibly a little too close to what frontier planning with Odyssey and it's it might cause some issues there now as a proof-of-concept I think that this works extremely well in highlights why atmospheric worlds could work I think it also goes a long way to highlight in the appealed of having access to worlds that look a little more like home it's not hard to imagine how variations on this theme would improve the experience of exploring planetary surfaces but don't get me wrong here I realized that I'm not touching on gameplay or a planetary atmospheric flight mechanics both of those are entirely different subjects and the very important ones at that but here I'm focusing a purely on the visuals interestingly our auto confirms that this model works perfectly and fully in VR without any issues whatsoever with although I said to do keep in mind that it's important to understand this mode doesn't physically create an atmospheric world just by changing a few shaders instead what it does is create the illusion of an atmospheric world and it actually does this in a very convincing way the mod can be extended to offering different types of effects for example here we can see a nighttime appearance alternatively is also possible to generate different color skies the effects can also be extended all the way up into space given the game a very different field indeed back on the surface of planets so all turkey is still looking to the future and potential additions one thought is the idea of the sky getting progressively darker as the Sun says is a concept which old duck fills is something that can be achieved although it would like the because sky color gradients that are typically associated with sunsets or something that he may add in the future now whether or not this ultimately makes it out into the hands of the public we're just going to have to wait and see but what's very nice here and what I'm really pleased to see is just how world the color changes on planets actually work it's something I'm looking forward to seeing the real twin or the sea finally lands next year so awesome work old duck and thanks for sharing as a wiser thanks for watching I guess you guys goes next time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
