[Music] all right listen up i've had something on my mind for a long time and i need to go through with it i want to roll up to jed and take him for everything he's got i could go research for a hundred hours on flicking things and get jad done with green dehyde and a magic short bow but what kind of 2006 experience is that no one had tile markings or flicking methods back then camping in there for 100 hours trying to get it at a low combat no one knew how to do that i'm gonna confront jad like a man and for that i need base 70 stats i've been training melee a lot recently i have 70s all around and the last thing i need is range range training in this era was terrible i mean it probably wasn't as bad as i'm making it out to be but people were able to buy their [ __ ] arrows and bolts and [ __ ] i've got to make them from scratch so one of the best ways to train range is going to be through the dorgashun crossbow which is available after death of the dorgason it's seven quests away we've got things to do so let's get after it and get our fire cape this episode of by release is brought to you by display if there's one thing in this world i despise it's posters made of paper those are dead trees ladies and gentlemen disc plates are made of metal magnet mounted baby see this plate is a part of the forest garden project for every disc plate sold a tree gets planted in tanzania so far they've restored 746 acres of forest in africa that's pretty cool those displays are the only reason that i fool anyone into thinking my apartment looks good on stream they're incredibly easy to put up with the magnet system they have they're really easy to change around if you want i've got a cool poster of my hometown i've got two of my favorite movies i also have sleepers cartoon drawing of me which you can also get there's so much art to choose from it's insane we have a lot of plans with this plate in the future we're gonna get some really cool runescape related stuff out so click the link below we've got a pretty good sale going for the next five days get it while you can but thanks again to displayed for all that they do and for sponsoring today's video hope you guys enjoy march 22nd 2006 quest 101 innate of marquis it's been over 30 quests since we've helped out this crew of misfits i'm going to take a wild guess they need us to do literally everything for them while they sit back and stare at cave walls twiddling their thumbs last time we helped these dummies we brought them a bunch of weapons but it turned out we actually just let a super evil vampire overlord to them and got some of them killed now velyaf here wants me to find a suitable area for them to relocate he mentioned berg the rot to the south so i guess we're going there yeah this also reminds me before i take on the fight caves i want to get barrows and this is the long disgusting route i have to take every trip ectofunctus bank at canifis run underground take this boat and then run the rest of the way it's gonna be a nightmare trips are gonna be hell okay what are we working with jesus christ already getting a pile of [ __ ] thrown at my face yup this is this is the place they all love it here everyone's as happy as can be i forgot to bring literally everything be right back this guy is extremely hesitant to let me in this whole town is just on edge 24 7 because they're down the street from meyer ditch meyer ditch is a town that's ran by [ __ ] vampires who keep humans and use them as food and sources for blood they do terrible things in meyer ditch you don't want to go there these guys are avoiding it like the plague even though clearly it struck in here a long time ago he's rambling on about blood sucking and how i want to steal their food i'm gonna prove that i'm a good guy by putting food in this chest yeah i put a lobster in here i did not sprinkle cyanide on it no why would you why would you say that now that i've proved my trustworthiness with one singular lobster he said that the inn over there would be a good place for us to hide let's assess the damage i'm gonna take them here and they're gonna be like if you hated us just let us know you don't have to help us oh god there's really no other place i have to clean all of this up hold on a second hear me out what if this merky group just didn't have their hq in [ __ ] mauritania where they could be infiltrated by vampires at any second just put it anywhere outside mauritania in varrock somewhere in the woods near varak i don't know would that be too logical am i making way too much sense there you don't make a base behind enemy lines it's not good another thing while i'm bitching about everything why did not at least one of them come with me to prepare their hideout i can count on one hand the amount of times i'll ever come down here they're gonna spend like a year four years five even i don't know am i doing this as a favor what am i doing why am i

yes thank you you know i hope you enjoy this hideout i made for you um [ __ ] yourself all right we got stuff to do april 3rd 2006 quest 102 assaults bane this is a very trippy quest it's like a psychedelic journey this lady lana is sitting outside of a weird abyss a crack in the earth that goes right down to hell yeah what's this big hall about she's asking me if i've seen her son tona she hasn't seen her own son in 25 years so she has no idea what he looks like i think your son's fine after 25 years i've got bad news for you he's probably dead i'm not really sure what clues has led her to this rift connecting it to her lost son from 25 years ago but i'm gonna go investigate because i'm a good ass guy and don't you forget it why should i tolna be trapped in such a wretched place well there we go the mystery's been solved but i guess that means we'd have to do something about it i wish it was like why should i john be trapped in this wretched place i'm like nope it's john not not tallner wrong kid quest complete so i guess this entire rift has different stages in it each task is symbolic of some sort of shitty thing going on in in this kid's brain there's monsters down here we gotta pick the right weapon out and just start wiping out the monsters once our rage level hits max then we move on to the next room because we've conquered anger i remember loving this because you just hit fat numbers on these things instead of 45 i'll check back in when i'm maxed out in my pissed off level oh my god oh i'm too angry i'm too angry whoa what the [ __ ] what just happened oh i just hit a 200 sit down now we're in a flashback of when toner ran away i'm tired of your pathetic outlook that's pretty deep for this kid he looks like he's four years old see kids don't run away

that kid doing see you later idiot i remember this one this is the worst one the confusion room there's five monsters and four of them aren't real like i just hit that thing and it didn't do any damage because it's not a real [ __ ] thing so i have to find the real one kill it and then that gets rid of one of the doors and i have to find another one that's actually real it's just a process of elimination it takes so long it feels like i've been in here for seven hours straight down to these two [ __ ] please oh thank god oh wait there's three doors i'm actually not done dude thank god i've done nothing wrong shut up kid what's the point no one will ever help me i wish last room the room of hopelessness these dudes are crawling around you've got to kill them three times each they just

make matters worse the next quest was a two for one on april 10 2006 rag and bone man and rag and bone man 2 both released on the same day it's known as one of the most tedious quests in the whole

bones fresh off a corpse dump them in vinegar and then finally use the pot boiler to do some sort of polishing thing with it i don't know it's just a very tedious process so as i was getting ready to
