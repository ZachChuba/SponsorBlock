I've always wanted to try baking, for real! Isn't that a rice cake? What is that~? It looks like a paw tho LOL Oh, but this doesn't look tasty... (Denial mode) Those are usually the tasty ones~ (Kimbap* this time?) 
Hey!!!😲
* Korean Sushi Roll What's wrong?😲 You need to evenly spread the rice before you roll it up~ (My way all the way!!!) 
I like my kimbap thick!!😤 (Umm?) This kimbap is not out of form right? (Hey there..?) Hey are you okay?😂 I don't want Yerim's... Uh... Yerim's kimbap....😥 (What is this)

The dough is all finished! We can't try it now, can we...? Do you wanna try? (Has done dough Mukbang)
I've tried it once! (Tiny bit) (Me too) (....😶) (At the age of curiosity) (Maybe not eat it uncooked)
Like, I'd rather eat it cooked...? Q. Do you cook, Nayeon? (Firm) Not really😶 Hahaha😄 (Not a friend with cooking)
Actually, we both don't cook much! Yep! I don't!! (Momo's good at it)
Our dear member, Momo cooks for us often! (Yeri was gonna go over to try)
You were gonna come over~ to our place! Exactly~ (These cookies are for Momo...💗)
Imma give these to Momo! Woah~ She'll like it! She will really love it!!☺️☺️ Cuz you wanna eat her food?↗ (Give & Take) (Yeri knows how things go)
So, It's like bait for the food! This is well-known as a bribe ☺ (First time baking cookies...)
But I don't get how to do this... I think we are supposed to make it big TBH, for me, it gotta be tasty no matter what Same! I like tastier ones even if it's ugly What shape is that? Are you done with it? LOL A bit thick! Oh~ Ok, I'm gonna make it thick, too! (Already) It's so fun! Right? I really wanted to try baking!🥰 Oh! I like it!

Did you see this~? A teddy bear~? (Teddy bear? A rice cake?) (Salty time starts)
Hey.. Isn't that a rice cake? (What is this shape? (2 ponts) ) You are good...🤭 (Nayeon's enjoying shaping)
My signature cookie☺ I'm making a flower! (Yeri's focused 😗) Does it look like one..? Hehehe Looks like an octopus!!! Oh, an octopus? 🤣🤣 (What is this shape? (Difficult) (5 points) ) (!!) Oh, but it's like.. Jeju*..?
*An island in Korea; Jeju Island - Oh! I felt it, too!!
- (Actually) I made it thinking about Dol hareubang*!
* A rock statue famous in Jeju Island (Finally time for putting them in an oven🤗) Which one do you wanna put? Um...Heart💗 (Yeri's first pick)
Dol hareubang! This? Would this be baked? It would!😚 (I thought good looking ones taste better...😬) Oh, but this doesn't look tasty... (Mines tasty for sure)
Those are usually the tasty ones! (Can't imagine how the cookies would taste like)
I'm quite excited to see how these would look like after baked 😂😂 - Baking's so much fun to do for the first time in a while
- Right? Let's bake these all after this! Okie! (Baking...) (The next cooking show is?)
I want to have that by itself! (Avocado Lover, Lovelyerim💚)
Only avocado..? Isn't it greasy? (Bits of dried seaweed...😶)
HuHuhuhHuh?!?? - I screwed it😭
- It's alright~ (I got into trouble)
How is this alright... The entire thing is cut like this!! Is it not ok? (Trying to make it up)
Look at this... I'm always like this...😥 Oh... This is worse than I thought... When I was in elementary school, I bought headphones after thinking about it for DAYS Right after I bought it... - Did you lose them?
- NOPE I accidentally cut the wire with scissors while opening them...✂ (👀!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) - For real?!!!!!!
- Yep - Did you cut your hand?
- I cut my headphones wire not my hand (Hand❌) (Wire⭕ )
Oh, the wire..? I heard it as a hand, so I freaked out!!! WIRE, not hand (The second cooking show)
Today, we are making a grown-up's kimbap You can put whichever ingredient you want in the kimbap! So, it's a grown-up's kimbap! Q. Please tell us Nayeon's kimbap plan! I'm gonna make two types~ Momo, our member, likes a tuna kimbap without cucumber!💚 Oh?! Same for me💚 (I HATE CUCUMBER)
Oh... Cucumber...? (I HATE CUCUMBER)
I don't like cucumbers...😫 (Oh, you too?)
For real? - I sincerely dislike cucumbers
- Actually, I don't like them either! I don't like pickled radish, burdock roots... I don't like them, but it's alright in a kimbap So, what kimbap are you making today, Nayeon? (For Momo) A tuna kimbap without cucumber! and my favorite, Buldak* kimchi kimbap!❤
* Spicy chicken I like avocados~ I'm an avocado obsess, right? (Avocado lovers)
She likes avocado, too! Can I borrow your avocado? (I don't have enough for me)
I don't think I have enough to lend then?LOL Lend it to me~~ (Yeri prepared)
Avocado & brisket kimbap! Since I really like meats as well! That's true~ (Haven't made kimbap in a while...)
Oh, but I haven't made kimbap in 3 years! I've made it quite recent! Mr. manager! Q. How does Nayeon's kimbap taste like? (👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻) You've never tried it before! LOL🤣🤣🤣 (The one tried it) (???)
I think only one of you tried it before! 😂 (Yeri and Nayeon really into making kimbap)
Aren't you supposed to put the rice only on the half for kimbap? Oh, you can put it on the entire seaweed Hey!!! Why? (That's not how you make kimbap)
That's too thick!! (Spread the rice evenly) You should spread them all over... I like my kimbap thick!😤 (Cuz I'm a grown-up!) Did Momo like burdock roots..? - (A grown-up) doesn't like burdock roots!
- Really...? (Why don't you just eat Chungmu kimbap* then...)
I don't eat kimbaps with burdock root and pickled radish
* Kimbap with rice and seasoned squid (Only Yerim's favorite ingredients)
Is this the right way? 😁 I will just wing it! But you are right! You need to wing cooking! (Nayeon's kimbap looks quite perfect)
Spread the sesame oil once! (Rough Yeri kimbap with much effort)
Is it too much...? (Have a glance) - I don't want Yerim's...
- WHY!!! I put all the tasty things in just for you! (Meaning: Look at it close)
Please take an insert shot of Yerim's😭! (Meaning: She knows it)
Don't take it yet😭🤣🤣 (If she did that on purpose, she lives for the audience)
What is it? Is it for the audience? Or is this your real self? LOL You can't say this is my real self! (That was too much🥺)
This is the result of my favorite ingredients! (She invented a multiple flavor kimbap)
I think the flavor will change every bit (One real kimbap is done, too)
Ok, I will put one here! I need to make a lot! (Nayeon's the oldest)
TWICE has a lot of members! Ah, I realized it here! (Found self-confidence from watching Yeri)
I think I'm at least better than you! - (Messing it up)
- I think I'm more talented at this than you ~🖐 (Excuse me)
I can just roll it like this! (Grown-ups eat it like this)
You don't need to cut kimbaps, it's good to eat it like this (Firm) Nope I want to eat the cut ones LOL (She doesn't give up)
It looks good to me! With the sesame oil on~ I bet you gonna love mine the best I'm excited! (Even if it's not pretty, she's excited)
It feels different from baking... (We have nothing to fear together)
I'm so excited! It's really fun to cook together with you~😉😉 I think Momo would like my kimbap for no reason! I think she would say, "Yum~ It's good!" I think I'm really good at this...☺☺ (Have a glance) (Have a glance)
(She is good...) I mean... It's not out of form, right? 😂😂 Hey, you not out of form, yeah? (R U OK?)
Oh! You are not, right? - It's out of form!!!😂😂
- No, it's not!! It's still alive😫😫 (Trying to talk to a kimbap)
You are alive, right...? It is alive...😢😢 Yours is out of form... It said it's alive~😁 Do you know the song? Kimbap by The Jadu? Ofc! (Kimbap/ The Jadu)
Please~ roll it well~🎵 (Kneading)
Please knead it well~🎵 Just like the kimbap out of form...🎵🎵 (AjaeRim* knows)
*Ajea(Old man in Korean) + Yerim (🎵Humming🎵) BBiAMiaMiaMiaaa~🎵 Q. Have you traveled together? We haven't... We are always busy! It's really rare to have a break at the same time as Yerim... (They promised to go somewhere)
But we planned to go somewhere~? So, we should! I'm already... - telling you everything I want to do~
- Really? What do you wanna do? I've mentioned a cooking show! Getting a driver's license! I've also mentioned doing a makeup! (It was a Yeri's Challenge in real life)
You are trying things you are bad at...? LOL NO! Why would I...🙄 (Yum..?) Do you want some cheese? (Have this first) I finally realized how to roll a kimbap into perfect shape! (Yeri's tip on making a kimbap!) You shouldn't have the rice thick☺️ I told you 😂 I had some hard times...😚 It shouldn't be thick! You should make it thin~ with some empty spaces You need to make a bit of rice thin and put it at the end of the seaweed! Did you do it like this, Nayeon? (It works with sesame oil as well)
I did it with sesame oil! 😮That's a thing...? Let's stop it here! (This should be enough)
We can have this time short and simple~ (I'm enjoying it~)
Why? Make more for me!!😕 Cuz! I don't have... people to... give it to... (Yeri's kimbap is already well-known among Yeri's friends)
Momo eats anything! I need to finish it up...if I have leftovers...😥 (Ok, just make more)
How about tuna kimchi~? Should I do one tuna kimchi kimbap~? Yep! (She's really good at controlling Yeri👍🏻👍🏻)
Then, we can eat them! Imma make one more! (Endless love for avocado💚)
Do you want some avocado in tuna kimchi kimbap? Wait, avocado in tuna kimchi😒😒...? Yeah! I think it'll be good!! Or tuna + kimchi + avocado + mozzarella cheese..? (Summing it up)
Mozzarella cheese without avocado..! Ah~ (Cookies are done✨)
I will take the cookies out since they are all done~ I'm so excited!!🥰 - I'm expecting much!
- WOW!!!!!!!!!! Gosh! (How would the cookies taste like?)
Oh? Should we bake it more? We need to check it...
