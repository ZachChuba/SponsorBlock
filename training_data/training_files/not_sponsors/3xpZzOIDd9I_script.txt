Sup, you Beautiful bastards, hope you're having a fantastic Monday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it, and the first thing we're gonna talk about today and an intro to a story I never Expected we have Eminem and Andrea Russett in the news together. Never could've really predicted that pairing but this has to do with something that happened over the weekend at Bonnaroo reportedly during a set Eminem used some sound effect that some fans thought resembled gunshots It happened three separate times during his performance and so in the wake of so many mass shootings Whether it be at a school or like at a concert like we saw in Vegas There are many fans that were panicked Angry some actually left the concert one fan tweeting, "Being at a festival slash concert in these current times brings new concerns and fears. Had to leave @Eminem set after third gunshot at Bonnaroo 'cause panic was setting in my section front pit extremely realistic and scary would have been good to have a warning before show Hashtag irresponsible. And as far as what these people were actually hearing here are two examples from two different songs One of the reasons this story blew up and as fast as it did is that Andrea Russett who has over seven point eight million Twitter followers was in attendance and was upset saying and now deleted tweets I hate to be the one to say it but being someone who suffers from very mild PTSD It was extremely irresponsible and distasteful to end songs with a shotgun sound effect I had grown up loving eminem and his music but I was extremely triggered to the point of Tears adding to hear a gunshot sound effect and seeing the entire crowd dropped to the Floor out of instinct is not funny cute or amusing. This is the sad reality that we are living This is not funny or even something to be joked about in addition to her There were also others that were upset and on the other side you had people that were defending eminem people arguing that eminem has had These sounds in his sets for years But people didn't complain then he was saying those making a big deal about this are just trying to get attention and as far as any input from Eminem's team right now his team is saying that those aren't actually even gunshot sounds a spokesperson for eminem say contrary to inaccurate reports eminem does not use gunshot sound effects during his live show the effect used by eminem and has said At Bonnaroo was a pyrotechnic concussion, which creates a loud boom He has used this effect as have hundreds of other artists in his live show for over ten years Including previous us festival dates in 2018 without complaint and I will say to me when I look at that video It looks like they're telling the truth because you see a flash from onstage and then that sound as right now it appears that Eminem will be keeping things the same and not making changes and personally, I do not think that Eminem does need to change anything. That's my personal take away and I'll pass a question off to you because we're all different people here What are your thoughts on this we live in a different time? So things should be done differently or include some sort of warning or no The songs are the songs and the performance is the performance and then let's knock out some quicky news first up We had IHOP the International House of Pancakes changing their name to IHOB favor a little bit of been teasing this name change Saying hey, can you guess what the B stands for I was personally in the camp up Oh, it probably means breakfast, but it turns out it's Burgers International House of burgers And for those people that are worried that I have will no longer serve pancakes because apparently those people exist The company said they will continue selling them and actually in the midst of the massive internet reaction The company said that the change is just temporary. It really made me go from thinking This was one of the most idiotic moves a company has made since Netflix had that whole Qwikster situation So now just really appreciating what a smart marketing move This is they knew this was going to get massive media attention massive online attention All the regular players would chime in including Wendy's going for the throat and they capitalized on what we've seen time and time again But with real situations for millions and millions and millions of dollars of free promotion for a thing I didn't even know they had burgers. It's genius granted. I will still not eat there I'm gonna eat food in an establishment that I know that it's gonna be bad for me I'm gonna go to Roscoe's we get the chicken and waffles. I'll eat it I'm gonna get into a food coma I don't have to actively think about the poor life choices I make but for now We're all and this is just a tip of my cab over to you I have initially thought the move was pretty stupid But I be wrong then we had ABC apologizing for something that didn't involve one of their people comparing someone to looking like an ape instead this time it involved Priyanka Chopra and Her show Quantico the show threw itself into this very polarizing controversial political situation between Hindus and Muslims India and Pakistan and the episode people were angry about was called the blood of Romeo portrayed Indians as terrorists looking to attack New York and blaming Pakistan as far as Chopra's involvement We see her discover a Hindu symbol on a suspect following the episode. There were a ton of people angry at Chopra Who is Indian saying if she was betraying her people and Hinduism with Chopra It's a massive deal because she is extremely well-liked in India. She's one of the country's highest paid actresses He's also the first Bollywood actress to land a leading in a prime-time American television show in addition to the general anger There were also many of the thought it was unfair that Indians and Hindus could be portrayed this way But in the past former showrunner Josh saffron said that he would never feature a Muslim terrorist on the show He had some fans angry saying well Why would you then feature a Hindu terrorist rather than a Muslim terrorist it both are negative via people saying it's ridiculous that one group Can't be portrayed as something but definitely everyone else that that's fair game But since the initial backlash the outrage it does appear that things have settled down since ABC Chopra and executives have apologized ABC even taking a step in front of Chopra to defend her putting out that Chopra didn't make the show nor does she direct or write it adding that they inadvertently and regrettably stepped into a complex political issue and the network ended up pulling the episode before it could air in India So there was that From that I want to share some stuff I loved today and today in awesome brought to you by Squarespace whether you need a domain slash Phil and when you love it enter offer code Phil for 10% off your first purchase. The first bit of Awesome really shouldn't be that surprising so much E3 awesome I'm gonna link to pretty much all of the announcements down below but some of the standouts to me an announcement for Halo Infinite got a trailer and first looks at fallout 76 which I Am a little skeptical but I am still excited We got some Kingdom Hearts 3 that's gonna come out January 29th 2019 excited about Dying Light 2 We got a badass trailer for cyberpunk 2077 Elder Scrolls 6 was announced as far as indie game seems solitude looks really interesting But of course, like I said there there's a ton more that I didn't even include here there There's a bunch more going to be announced and also, of course remember even though this segment is called today an awesome well When it comes to things announced at E3 Just just understand that some of it some would argue A lot of it will not live up to the hype that you see today We got a trailer for kidding starring Jim Carrey. We also had Queer Eye's Fab 5 sharing the 10 best tips from season 1 and if you want to see the full versions of Everything I just share the secret link of the day anything at all links as always are in the description down below Then in really that happened news we appropriately go to Florida turns out an office of the inspector general Investigation found that in February of 2016 the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services stopped accessing the FBI's National instant criminal background check system And if you're unfamiliar with the N ICS it's the system that allows States and firearms retailers to check the criminal and mental health history of applicants it Flags people that have been in jail or convicted of a drug offense in the past year or undocumented immigrants or Involuntarily committed or deemed to have a mental defect by a court or dishonorably discharged and in Florida The system is specifically used a background check concealed carry applicants for any out-of-state offenses and as far as the reason why oh, You're gonna love this according to the investigation the reason for this is that the employee that was Responsible for these checks forgot her login information and that employee was Lisa Wild and the investigation found that she waited 40 days before reporting the issue to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement And even then when she did report the issue She used a public email instead directly contacting someone for assistance And even then the email had to be forwarded to the correct person who then informed her that she was using the wrong username And even after that she still reported having issues which one employee at the FDLE said he could have fixed over the phone but unfortunately She didn't follow up and she also didn't answer when the FDLE employee called her and it wasn't until March of 2017 were another employee questioned why the department had not received any notice of denial and that is what ultimately led to this situation Being discovered according to an interview with investigators Wilde said I dropped the ball. I know I did that I should have been doing it and I did but also saying in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times that she was overwhelmed with a number of applications and under pressure to approve background checks quickly also saying that she was given this Oversight when she was working in the mailroom saying quote I didn't understand why I was put in charge of it and from that ridiculous part let's let's talk about the numbers what actually happened during this period of time we report early during this period there were 268,000 applications that were approved 6470 were denied, but it was for reasons like incomplete application or they were ineligible but according to the Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam There are only 365 that actually required background checks and did not receive them But then after the report they were performed in 291 permits were revoked and I will say it to me It does feel like the Department of Agriculture is trying to minimize this situation. Aaron Keller who's a spokesperson for the department pointed out that it was one employee noting that they have terminated that employee and then adding that the Database is used for quote non Criminal disqualifying offenses during this time all applications had undergone criminal background checks for two other databases Of course, you still have people saying no, this is still a massive deal you're talking about a background check system that yes is supposed to see if someone is a criminal but also and of course this is Very relevant to the debate around guns in Florida people. Who were Involuntarily committed or deemed to have a mental defect by a court and then when that background check system was put back into play you had to revoke 291 still understandable why this is a massive deal to a lot of people and of course like with all the stories I'd love to know your thoughts on this and then let's talk about something that could greatly impact the entire Internet And first off it would be a disservice if I didn't mention of course today June 11 we`re seeing the official repeal of major net neutrality provisions going into effect we of course have talked about that situation Multiple times in the past. There still is a fight taking place There was of course a resolution against the appeal that passed through the Senate but it is very unlikely to get through the house even There it's very unlikely that Donald Trump would sign it most likely he would veto it You also have more than 20 states and DC suing the FCC over This other states have passed new laws Others are trying to pass new laws it there is a continued fight there, and down below I'll link to battle for the net and other resources so you can kind of stay in the know while this takes place But today we need to talk about the EU To talk about what's happening now and in the next two weeks, we need to first jump back to 2016 there We saw the former EU digital commissioner proposing new copyright reform and the ended up being known as the EU CD the EU copyright directive and supporters of the EUCD so that the changes were supposed to update European copyright laws for the digital age and since then the EUCD made its way through different committees subcommittees Other fun places and then it went to the legal Affairs Committee where MEP Axel Voss was tasked with finding Compromises across the amendments that EU member states submitted after that it would then be ratified as a final version and then Parliament would vote On it, and as far as why we're talking about this today The Legal Affairs Committee will be voting June 20th on a final version to be presented to the European Parliament That's a massive deal because once it's out of committee, it is extremely hard to have further amendments added. The thing I want to point out here Is that the EU CD is massive and and we do not have enough time to cover the entire thing But we can talk about a few of the more controversial parts and we'll start with one of the smaller points of debate Which is article 3 article 3 is a change to how data mining works in the EU right now data mining is pretty much Banned in the EU but article 3 would open it up here you have groups upset because they say it does not go far enough That the proposed changes will only allow research institutions to mine for the purposes of scientific research here critics say that this will effectively stop Innovation large-scale AI's require input from users all over to train them So this would effectively stop that because of the restrictions independent researchers journalists hobbyists would also be banned from data mining adding that this denies EU startups a level playing field because essentially if you're not an established Institution like a university you don't get to do what they do then We have article 11 what is being called the link text this provision would restrict both businesses and individuals who publish news snippets essentially anyone using snippets of journalistic online content must first get a license from the publisher and that new right for publishers would apply for 20 years after publication and this would target automatic link previews at social networks generate when users share links by example when you're on Twitter or Facebook You link out to something it often shows the headline a thumbnail picture may be a little short piece of the content additionally It's likely this would affect news aggregators media monitoring services fact-checking services And I suppose a goal here is that it would protect traditional press revenues by forcing people to go to the sites rather than hearing About the articles via third parties or just short pieces and if an online source like Google fails to get the license the copyright holder can force Google to remove the link and the European digital Commission says that they Want to mostly target links on Google Facebook Twitter and Pinterest also an important and interesting note here is a law like this already exists in Germany and Spain and it has failed in both in Germany many are saying it is Likely that it was going to die in court whereas with the Spanish law according to the EU research service It has clearly had a negative impact on visibility and access to information in Spain and the EFF says it's a defacto Attack on hyperlinks not a lot of people are going to click a link without a preview of what they're clicking Limitations on snippets are essentially a limitation on linking it's also believed by some groups that this will encourage fake news this because propaganda department's likely won't charge for snippets because it's all about Getting to as many people as possible Whereas reputable sources likely will additionally article 11 is also in conflict with the Berne Convention that being an international treaty The guarantees are right to quote news articles and create press summaries But from that, let's talk about article 13 which is being called the upload filter here Internet platforms hosting large amounts of user uploaded content must monitor user behavior and filter their contributions to identify and prevent copyright infringement This is supposed to protect the music industry industry believes and Lobby that the revenue Google shares with them from running ads on videos Containing their content amounts to too little compared to payments from subscription services like Spotify calling this the value cap So the question becomes, okay, well what does this actually look like? Well in Youtube's case music copyright holders can demand that once you has a sample of their music They must have a system to flag anything uploaded automatically and that the copyrighted material is never Re-upload and YouTube already has a system that is similar to this, but they want it to be bigger faster more Responsive as well as automatically take those videos down. It's also not just the music industry that's affected platforms like Instagram will also be subject to this as these rules extend to photos and videos here a copyright holder can inform Instagram to keep An eye out for their copyrighted photos and Instagram will automatically need to take it down if it's re-uploaded. One of the arguments Against article 13 is they're calling this a start-up killer and that's because it place a huge costs on very small companies to have massive Systems in place to monitor what's being uploaded super closely and Google even caution against such rules back in a blog post from 2016 It's also believed that this would have unintended consequences for sites like Wikipedia They would need to have these filters in place at massive cost even though Wikipedia only accepts freely licensed uploads and one of the final Things with article 13 is it would likely be in violation of existing EU law specifically the e-commerce directive which forbid general monitoring obligations something that the European Parliament Research Service says article 13 would establish and unfortunately, that is not the end Of the concerns a EUCD is often vaguely worded and there are fears that common aspects of internet culture may be affected unintentionally. For example reaction gifts would likely be classified as copyright infringement under the EUCD Additionally most memes would also die for the same reason since they often included copyrighted material This could also hit fan fictions as well as lib dubs Which is essentially all of Musically. Another huge issue is because of the way the EUCD is written right now It doesn't include exceptions for things like fair use. So - - - parody and criticism content could be struck down if the copyright holder wanted It to be as of right now it is hard not to feel like that is also maybe the intent culture committee MEP Sylvie Gilardi has tried proposing that exceptions be put In place to allow digital use of quotations or extracts of works this with an user-generated content for purposes such as criticism review Entertainment, illustration, caricature parody or pastiche as of right now. It doesn't seem our proposals have gotten very far But even then let's say the exception gets put into place There are still concerns that monitoring software conforming to the upload filter can't properly tell what's infringe material And what is something like parody or criticism I mean not to completely crap all over YouTube But look at the system they have in place and how often you see some of your favorite creators going up got dinged again So it essentially take an already annoying somewhat destructive system and then potentially make it catastrophic and so ultimately that is All right now and like I said on June 20th that is when it will be voted on today's video I just covered three articles some of the concerns there But I'll link to the full document down below additionally if you live in the EU and any of this is concerning to you I will link you down below to save your internet EU there They make it incredibly easy to tweet email or call your MEP and of course I will say while any action is a good action some of the most Effective action you can take is a call for now that is where this story ends and we wait personally I am of the mindset of this needs massive reform or just needs to be shut down and something started from scratch I mean it's easy to think of this situation as okay, that's a that's a European Union problem But it's also a worldwide problem when you consider that everyone is kind of international these days YouTube Facebook Instagram Twitter They're not just American companies. We live in an international age This is a big deal for a lot of people with that said of course This is the Philip DeFranco show whether it be the last story the first one anything in between I'd love to know your thoughts and those comments down below.
