hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the whole plum tart that's right i tried to make a tart out of whole plums but what ended up making was one of the worst pastries of my entire career this really was an absolute disaster and i cannot stress enough how truly horrible this was which is why of course i'm going to show what happened in excruciating detail so with that let's go ahead and get started and one of the things that makes this tale so tragic is that i was actually using plums we picked ourselves from our very own plum trees oh yeah chef John's got fruit and I picked him and I washed him and I put him in a basket with a towel and I looked at them thinking man is this tower going to be good and the first thing I did was go ahead and caramelize a whole bunch of sugar in this skillet since I decide to use the same technique as a Tartar Tan where create a dry caramel in the bottom of a pan and then place chunks of apple on top and then pastry and then bake it and flip it over and it is amazing and we've actually done a video for that and it came out pretty good and all we do here is cook the sugar over medium high heat until it eventually all melts and turns into this beautiful deep rich caramel color at which point we pull it off the heat and very very very carefully placed on our fruit which I'm doing dimple side down because as you'll see once this is flipped over I'm going to go ahead and remove the pits with a couple spoons after this is cooked and if ever work with something similar have to be super super careful alright that sugar is insanely hot and will get a third-degree maybe even fourth degree burns but anyway I went ahead and placed my whole plums in and I was thinking man those fit in nicely this is really gonna come out great so I set that aside and moved on to roll in and cut in some pastry and traditionally for something like this we'd use a puff pastry which is sort of what I was using okay I kind of did a quick and dirty version of pol Hollywood's rough puff pastry and I went ahead and roll that out to just under a quarter inch thick before taking my good old trusty pizza wheel and cutting in a circle just about the same size as my pan and once that was said I went ahead and place it over my whole plums it kind of pressed and nestled that down at which point I decided to take the tip of a knife and poke a bunch of holes through that dough so that there would be somewhere for all that to escape alright I knew these plums were gonna give off a lot of moisture and moisture in and of an equal steam and steam needs somewhere to go and as I finished poking this I was thinking that looks really cool man is this gonna be fantastic so I was feeling pretty good as I went ahead and transfer that into the center of a 425 degree oven for about 30 minutes or so or until I thought that pastry was cooked and it looked like this and yes I could tell right away that it was pretty juicy under there so I decided to let it sit cool for about 10 minutes before trying to turn it over and of course anytime we take a pan out of the oven that has a handle we always put a towel over it so we don't forget and burn ourselves but anyway like I said I'll let that sit there for about ten minutes at which point before turning it over since I knew there was going to be a lot of liquid I decided to drain a little bit out first into this ramekin so when I flip this over it would not be so messy and to my surprise it really wasn't as much as I thought so I went ahead grabbed a big plate and I put on a rubber glove to protect myself from any mold and juices although since I drained it I knew there wasn't going to be that much so I went ahead and flipped it over and as it turns out there were lots of juices which were now on the table and also pulled up on my plate making my pastry soggy so thinking quickly I used my bench scraper to transfer those back into the pan since that pan is could probably see still had a good amount of caramel in it and I placed that on the stove over medium heat and then carefully added the rest of the juices from the plate and at this point I was thinking this just might still work all right what I'll do is reduce these juices which will dissolve that caramel in the pan and then once it becomes CERP like I'll just simply pour it back over my tart so that was my plan which I thought was a good plan and then what I did while I was waiting for that to reduce was used a couple spoons to pull the pits out of my plums which I actually thought worked pretty good okay have to pit these at some point and a lot of times when try to pit these raw can kind of crush and tear the fruit apart so part of my experiment here was could we roast the fruit hole and then remove the pits once these were nice and soft and actually that part of the experiment worked out pretty well as I thought the plums were looking pretty good after I completed this down and by now those cooking liquids had reduced nicely and I was looking at a beautiful plum caramel syrup which I very carefully and slowly and seductively poured over the top and I figured once it's cooled completely that stuff would get nice and thick and sticky and shiny and other than maybe a little too much of a surplus I would be enjoying an incredible world class fruit tart so let it cool I did I waited hours and hours and hours before I went ahead and finely sliced in and I really did think it was looking spectacular spectacular ly red and I went ahead and plated that up and I topped that with some sweet and sour cream and a little bit of lemon zest and I grabbed a fork and went in for a bite with by the way the highest of hopes all right always have to visualize and expect success with all things in life but especially in the kitchen but that my friends was one of the worst things I've ever tasted in my life all right when caramelize sugar in the pan like we did in that first step it takes out more of a bittersweet flavor which apparently works really well with chunks of apple but not so much with whole plums and that little bit of natural bitterness from the skin was really accentuated and made this almost inedible and also plums have so much water in them that even after reducing those juices the pastry was still totally and utterly soggy and extremely unpleasant to eat okay imagine wet toast spread with a very bitter unpleasant flavor jam that's what I made so as I said in the intro just an absolute disaster and a culinary tragedy on almost every level and you're probably wondering then why are still eating it well mostly out of stubbornness but also a little bit of obstinance but anyway that's it how not to make a whole plum tart the tartare tan technique definitely does not work for this or if it does I don't know how to do it so please believe me when I say I really hope don't give this a try soon and please don't follow the links below for the ingredient amounts because there's not going to be any nor will there be a printable written recipe and much more info as usual but anyway stay tuned for an actual usable recipe soon and is always enjoy
