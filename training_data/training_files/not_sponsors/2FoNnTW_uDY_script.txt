hello my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to Sahara by dreamcatcher I might also react to black and white I think there's a dance practice for that because one of you insomnia is on my last dreamcatcher video recommended me that one and since I'm already watching dreamcatcher why not do two in one today's video is sponsored by my friend honest I'm just kidding it's not sponsored but it's a collaboration my very close friend honest also has a kpop react channel so it's linked can i link channels up there I'm not sure it's definitely in the description though he's showing me some girl groups that he really likes and songs that he really likes and I'm showing him some boy groups that I really like so he recommended me to watch Sahara his favorite members are GU and you young and learned her name I've known honest for five years I teach real life I didn't realize that him doing him so long we met in LA in film school he's an actor and this is a little bit of back information about me but I first discovered kpop through my friend sunny in 2014 and in 2015 I moved to LA and I stopped listening to kpop because I was so immersed in the American culture that I was like kpop never heard of her honest meanwhile was already into kpop and then I moved back to Germany and I got in contact with my friend sunny again properly and she reintroduced me to kpop so no no me Anna's on kpop it's just it's a weird relationship we never could quite figure it out but now he has a channel and I have a channel so if you haven't watched any of his videos but you're a girl groups then definitely go check out his channel by the way if you subscribe to me because of my other dream catcher video or you recommended me songs or you commented on that one you left a leg he watched it you liked it any of those things thank you very much that video got way more views than I expected and insomnia I think you are called you are so nice Wow you literally spell out for me exactly what I need to do to understand the storylines in the video and to like understand dreamcatcher and twist and start standing them and I think I might this is the make or break song if I don't like it it's a self-made me music video they made this video I hope I have the right version here I'm not sure I think there is no official music video for this song it's a special clip self-made MV I will definitely get to the music videos of dreamcatcher in the chronological order starting with fly high because I know that's a prequel but I'm still trying to figure out how I'm gonna do that because there's a lot of videos and I can't watch three videos in one of my videos because it would be 40 minutes long so I'm still trying to figure out how I'm gonna do that the best way so that's coming just not quite yet I'm still trying to figure it out but in the meantime I'm watching Sahara and maybe black and white before I get you'll see my face at some point during the week so let's let's watch the horror I like it already cuz it's partially my name but then again that was one of those stupid bully names that I was called so I don't know why I like it I shouldn't like it again I don't know what to expect over this it's a self-made music video so I'm not expecting it to be like a movie but maybe I want to know what self-made means so that means they filmed it no budget at all so no budget okay [Music] my union is so cute whoa sorry oh my god who is that in the middle her waist okay um I won't stop again her waist is a little scary so just like a parody [Music] that is so funny [Music]  you okay we're here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so it's like they're taking the lyrics literally when they can oh my god that's funny [Music] [Music] while she is so pretty [Music] [Music] she's like huh [Music] that looks weird [Music] that's funny [Music] this is so cute [Music] can they fall no I thought I was throwing [Music] she's so pretty [Music] [Music] but you stirring the lights in that one [Music] [Music] okay all right I mean there's not much technical I can say about that um it's just it's really fun it's it's really cool that the company allows this video to even be uploaded like as like a music video oh you Eunice the love of my life I didn't even say anything so yeah honest favorite members are to you and you Hyun and say this is so funny [Music] I think that could actually be like a really good thing to do in the actual music video oh it kind of feels like they're saying my name well the song is good by the way I didn't really pay attention too much because I was just having fun but I like the song I also didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics but oh my god you yawn is honestly my favorite there's no question about it anymore I still want to know who did the lights of this like who's switching the lights but on and off certain other person in there I can't see anyone and this is the best thing ever nobody has a fixed path she falls and gets dragged son okay since this wasn't really a music video that I can say anything technical to I think we can definitely do black and white which also is in the music video so this is more just me reacting than being a filmmaker I guess [Music] or like the song [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just want to pause for one second so I know who's who that's Xian that's Tommy that's that's you yarn I don't even know the names of the other two I know gu and then gah [Music] well the song is so [Music] it's not jazz what is this follow me [Music] it's very fun I like this song a lot the choreo is nice too we're really good dancers as son is so good that's you [Music] that's guy yo I think is her name I like the song a lot [Music] unlike the choreo - it's very cool [Music] nice [Music] [Music] the pretty NSYNC to [Music] nice that's so cool [Music] this looks like a fun dance like not too exhausting but just like you can just feel it [Music] nice I can't even do it [Music] nice so that was black and white I really like that song a lot it's not what I expected from dreamcatcher I thought all of their music was more like EDM dubstep ish but that one was kind of more funk I'm trying to figure out what their genre of that is I know it and I like it but I'm not saying it jazz it's not is it funk I don't know what it is but I like it a lot they're really good dancers they're really in sync can someone tell me are GU and you young like I feel like they're always doing stuff together like they start the song off and then in deja vu I know they're like the twos that are fighting at the throne and then here in this choreo there I think it's GU in the front and you yawn behind her doing the arm stuff like there I feel like they're always doing something together is that like a thing or am I just imagining things I don't know yeah that's all for this video I didn't really say a lot of filmmaking things because that was me you really wasn't much to say there was a lot of fun I like I like both songs I really like Yui on a lot she's so cute I'm deaf I'm very excited to check out more of their videos like their proper music videos and also hear more of their music thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or maybe you saw something that you didn't before I definitely did again half of this video it was a collab with my friend honest his channel is gonna be in the description box below make sure to go on his channel and subscribe and watch his side of the collab video I'm not sure which group he's checking out because we're kind of filming these all randomly and then just uploading whichever one but it's gonna be a good group I recommend good groups and good songs to him so if you want to see his reaction make sure to go watch that I hope you found this enjoyable just me reacting even if there was no filmmaking knowledge involved I didn't know that these videos I mean I knew what the dance practice but I didn't know the first video wouldn't be like a proper music video thank you for watching bye I feel like I did like a little kid thing yeah thank you for watching bye mmm why can't I say bye honestly this is pissing me off I'm not even trying to be funny or trying to make that a thing I'm literally just awkward saying bye I can't do anything about it it's just how it is [Music]
