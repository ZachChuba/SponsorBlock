today is the day we are finally finishing the 100,000 ish dollar six editors one CPU machine it's been a freaking long time coming so we won't make you guys wait that's all looking peachy any longer now this should work and it should show up over here to hear this use code LTT at the link below to save 15% [Music] at this point those of you who have been keeping up with the $100,000 PC saga have probably seen this machine put together and then torn apart again four or five times so it's safe to say that we've already dry fitted everything and we know it all pretty much works together so just like the last video in this series we've stuck with the god tier ty n s 70 100 px motherboard yes it's a little ugly because aesthetics and RGB aren't exactly top priorities for server manufacturers yet give it time but it's got it where it counts because the thing just works speaking of working the original CPUs that Intel supplied for this build are of course no longer working I dropped one of them and we weren't able to source a matching retail Xeon 8180 platinum replacement without spending nearly ten thousand US dollars remember guys you need to use two of the exact same model in most dual socket systems so we turned to eBay and obtained a pair of Q s or qualification sample 81 ATS for less than half of what we'd have spent for a single retail one now Q s chips aren't perfect but unlike engineering samples which may be less reliable or have significantly lower clock speeds q s chips are the ones that are sent out to OEMs just before a particular model launches for their final validation and testing what that means is that in many instances they are practically speaking or even literally exactly the same as a retail chip save for the labeling on the integrated heat spreader so we are hoping that these should work perfectly for our little experiment especially with an ek Annihilator CPU block keeping each one of them cool man those are industrial looking for our RAM we stuck with the 384 gigs of ECC ddr4 memory running an ace six channel configuration that our friends from Kingston sent over almost a year ago so this is going to give us about 60 gigs of memory for each of our six virtualized 8k video editing workstations with a little bit of leftover RAM for our hypervisor now our GPUs are of course the same six nvidia titan v12 gig HBM two cards that we've been working with since earlier in the project each one of our virtual editing stations is going to get one of these fully dedicated to it now because we're using GPU pass-through as far as our editor is concerned it's like that card is installed directly into their own computer now for this video we've done something special with our cards each one of them was outfitted with one of these beautiful acetal slash nickel EK water blocks and then made it to a custom six GPU terminal which might give you guys some of those sweet nostalgia feels from all the way back in seven gamers one cpu massive thanks to EK by the way for going out of their way to make this thing happen because dang this looks awesome now to dissipate the up to 2,000 watts of heat that our CPUs and GPUs will kick out under full load and remember that without overclocking we settled on a full complement of EK water blocks is ultra thick class radiators we've got quad 140 millimeter units for both the top and the bottom as well as a triple fan model on the front now we did have a bit of trouble mounting our 140 millimeter knocked to a fence as the clearances are just slightly off with these radiators but thanks to some space under the top panel we made it work now even with this configuration we're not a hundred percent sure that we've got enough cooling capacity problem is we kind of had to roll with it since case labs the company that makes this monster chassis excuse me I misspoke I should have said made this monster chassis because they went out of business while we were working on this project so we really can't get any more parts for it not that I think there would have been anywhere to mount them because I think we've managed to build one of the few machines in existence that truly needs a case of this magnitude to find out why let's have a look at the crown jewel of our build this PCI Express expansion daughterboard courtesy of one stop systems so this bad boy or girl whatever it is is gonna allow us to take the bottom PCIe 16x lot on our motherboard and then break it out into eight more slots for a total capacity of up to fourteen expansion cards take that Mac Pro what this gives us is to individually hot pluggable USB ports for each of our editing machines and a Mellanox 100 Gigabit Ethernet card to pull all that juicy 8k footage off of our main editing server which is also equipped with one of Mellanox is high-speed network cards now we're only able to run our cards at 40 gigabit because we don't have a 100 gigabit network switch or enough PCI Express bandwidth anyway but that should still be plenty for six 8k raw streams so the thing is here that the daughter board wasn't necessary per se it's just that without it we would have had to use a bunch of USB hubs and assign each USB device individually to our editors meaning that any changes would require reconfiguration and unread and a reboot of the virtual machine so yeah it's mostly a creature comfort but I think it's super cool because it means that for all intents and purposes our editors might as well be sitting at a completely normal computer now mounting this thing was a bit hard to watch not because Jake doesn't know his way around a dremel or anything but it's more just that this is a five hundred US dollar case and more importantly you straight-up can't by them anymore thankfully it turned out prayed and clean we actually ended up stealing the PCI Express slots from a thermaltake tower 900 and it worked perfectly for the eight cards that we needed to install then we mounted the daughter board with some upside down bolts threaded through the bottom of the case and it was off to the races now as for the rest of the trunk over here we ended up going with dual EVGA 1600 watt t2 80 + titanium power supplies with some sexy cable mod cables now I'm one of the first people to point out that one power supply of this magnitude is totally unnecessary but this is not exactly a normal computer remember guys even just the GPUs in this system could be too much for a single power supply 1600 watts or otherwise so for us then two of these bad boys fits the bill nicely and should even give us plenty of headroom for capacitor aging or even overclocking think of it kind of like being that guy at the car show with the nitrous bottle in their trunk except the nitrous is a second power supply and rather than being outside they're in their mom's basement speaking of horsepower adders the 810 terabyte nas drives that we have installed in the front of the case can be used to assign local bulk storage to our virtual machines and we'll be using our dual Intel 905 P series octane SSDs as a right cash for our magnetic drives as well as for raw high speed storage from the windows installs for each of our editor now the reason we used octane for this is that when you're hitting a drive with six users at a time booting up or launching programs even a high speed nvme SSD can struggle well obtained has much faster access times so we're hoping that to our editors this entire virtualization experience should be transparent although we haven't actually tested that yet now with the build mostly dry assembled at this point we could finally get to running our tubes yes we went with soft tubing so no it's not the sexiest machine in the world but with a good chunk of Ek water blocks nickel fittings and a little bit of creativity we still think it looks pretty good not in a blinged-out RGB gaming rig kind of way but more of like a this thing does real work kind of way and it has the added benefit of making it much easier to reconfigure the system if we ever decide to upgrade it in the future so from there just add water and a little bit of patience and well BAM finished system of course we're not done yet though I've been out of the office for a few days while Jake's been getting things together so why don't we go check it out alright so for our first power-on test we're not trying to go full ham virtual machines everything so we've actually unplugged our opt-in drives and our hard drives and just through a simple basic SATA SSD with the windows install on it because we want to make sure it's all still working after the assembly ordeal we have fans spin hey do we have display on the other side nice we want to find out if our cooling solution is actually adequate before we start though let's do a good old-fashioned Cinebench r15 run ready there it is boys oh my god and you're done 7000 so something that a lot of people don't know is that just because you have two CPU sockets doesn't mean that even a heavily multi-threaded application like blender you can see it's using the entire first CPU it doesn't necessarily mean that it can utilize the second CPU it just doesn't quite work that way all right so here we are blenders running our GPUs are all sitting at 75 80 percent utilization our CPUs at 92 percent and all we can do is let it cook for a bit oh wow like just this chassis being made out of aluminum just like feels like a idea like there's so much flex to it if only it was like a cheese grater I don't think he could fit that many cores in the cheese grater yeah this is twice as many cores as a new Mac Pro just say the highest-end macro yeah that means each one of our editing stations effectively has an 8 core CPU 60 gigs of memory a 100 gig octane drive and its own Titan V and wow they actually booted really fast in spite of you like starting them rapid-fire like that that's flippin awesome and we're good you know what no for the purposes of today we're just trying to find out if it can handle a full load yeah thermally and stability wise so let's forget about premiere let's just start loading up stress tests on these things what stress test should we do well let's throw like Ida and fur mark boom there alright so here comes our first set of stress tests we're going stress FPU on i-264 and GPU stress tests at 1600 by 1200 yeah that's better if we don't leave a couple of cpu cores for fur mark to grab then it throttles the GPU and we don't use up all the power so I'm do you number four I'm having fun it's finally done all right I'm ready to go with stress test number four not bad is there a reason you didn't put fans in the bottom of two here no no good we should yeah cuz that would look more symmetrical ish we've got to cool these obtain SSD zo actually it's not a terrible idea fans still not on on the second power supply ok so we've had the whole thing running for about five minutes now our block of GPU blocks is noticeably warm to the touch not hot not uncomfortable but it's warm these fans that are blowing down at like it's kind of like having a space heater blowing at me from under the computer same thing up here and we've actually got some temperature results as well so it looks like our GPUs have settled in right around the 55 to 60 degree mark depending on which ones we're looking at and then Jake you've got CPU temps right 48 49 across the board now we're not fully loading the CPU but I mean we're probably over 80% right you tell me that looks not bad we're hitting it pretty hard so that's it guys at long last it's finally working not only that but our cooling solution is adequate good job Jake and the thing actually seems to be stable so all that's left now then is to get a nice long 40 gigabit network cable plug this thing into our switch and get six editors set up with full stations around it and to see if we actually can do it because this is all been theoretical up until now theoretically if we have eight CPU cores and a Titan V and 60 gigs of RAM should be fine but it's all theoretical up till now let's see if we can do it six x 8k editing workstations off of a single power it's finally working speaking of work I've got some check out the link below and get your HD 6 xx headphones today so thanks for watching guys if just like this video 8 it's on now you can hit that button but if you liked it hit light get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like the one I'm wearing and our community forum which you should totally join I'm a little bit concerned one of our displays just went blank hey ok the monitor just went to sleep it's all good yeah yeah it's still working so 100,000 dollar computer was based on if we were gonna load it up completely with top-end Quadro cards which didn't end up happening so we took some artistic liberties with the gaming of the computer
