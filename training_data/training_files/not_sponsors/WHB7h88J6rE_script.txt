hello and welcome to another video it's really crazy to think that 1990 was 30 years ago and that's how old the laptop is we're going to try and fix today it's from 1990 actually got it off of ebay for $40 but it was being sold as four parts not working and from the sellers description it seems as if the hard disk has failed that's probably a pretty bad thing given how old the laptop is anyway below and become a member of the channel VPN for sponsoring this video so let's open up the box and see what we've got using my trusty knife I dug my way into the box this wasn't exactly what I was expecting well at least I can see the seller didn't skimp out on packing peanuts either way it looks like they've helped the laptop arrive safely and have made quite a big mess at least I can pretend it's snowing first impressions are pretty good cosmetically it's in great shape along with a lot of laptops from this time period there's a neat little carrying handle before I even think of powering it up let's check that the battery hasn't leaked inside thankfully it's easy to get access to it looks like an old-school lead acid battery I can feel where most of the laptops weight was coming from I'm also really thankful that the battery hasn't leaked because that could cause a lot of corrosion even though it's a hefty battery it wouldn't have powered the laptop for very long at all with it safely back in I now need to get a compatible charger the adapter needs to me nine volts at at least two point four amps I searched through all my power supply tubs but didn't find a match one rainy day trip to Jake are solved this problem they had exactly what I needed and you could easily change the polarity which was super important for this laptop I kind of just hoped that it came with a plug that was the right size here goes nothing after pressing in the power button it made some beeping noises and entered the BIOS after adjusting my camera shutter speed to match the display the picture looked pretty clean I fiddled around with the settings and let it try to boot up Oh 549 kilobytes of RAM that isn't a lot it's at trying to detect the hard drive for quite some time eventually it displayed the error 1780 I put an ms-dos 6.2 to install a floppy in to see whether it could detect the hard drive I kept getting errors and the floppy drives struggled to eject the disk but after a bit of fiddling it managed to get into the ms-dos setup unfortunately it does not detect any hard disk either so the laptop does thankfully start up everything seems to work apart from the battery and of course the hard disk although let's be real for a laptop that's thirty years old there wasn't much of a chance that the battery was gonna work was there the next step is to crack it open and see what lies within on the base there are eight screws I had to remove now I could gently lift up the top casing from here I could remove the keyboard which was attached to the motherboard via a small ribbon cable before we see what's inside now back to that really old computer there were three connectors I had to detach before the top casing could come off here are the rather simple internals powering this laptop is a 10 megahertz NEC v40 CPU which is equivalent to an intel 8o double 8 of that time period it's a bit dusty inside so we'll be sure to clean it out later in the video first of all let's remove that hard disk to learn a bit about it the drive is held in a rubber mounted bracket to reduce vibration I carefully dislodged the small ribbon cable and lifted the drive out on the top there was a weird sticky residue I believe someone likely spilled something on the keyboard and over the years it's seeped through peeling back the ribbon cable reveals this is a conor CP 4044 a 42 megabyte 3.5 inch a super slimline hard drive taking a closer look the connector is much smaller than a standard IDE interface that may make finding a replacement a lot harder to see if the drive would still show any signs of life I listen to the drive carefully it made some noises and did light up briefly so at the very least it wasn't completely dead there are two sets of jumpers on the PCB of the hard disk with the information I found online I tried some different configurations doing this will address the drive as d instead of C at this point I was basically going to try anything I could think of I loosely placed it back together to see what would happen once again it sat there for a while before displaying a slightly different error message controller failed 1782 meaning it didn't even see the hard disk working or not for interests sake I thought I'd try booting up the laptop without the hard disk installed at all the error message we got was once again 1782 meaning whatever I did to the jumpers made the system not even detect the drive with this knowledge I put the jumpers back to their original configuration and plugged the hard disk back in and what do you know we get the original Aramis of unit zero era 1780 I tried other jumper configurations which didn't appear to make any differences a few people online said this drive is just IDE well it simply isn't the connector is a lot smaller and the pin out may actually be different from the research I've done this interface appears to be something called SSL IDE but sadly there's very little about it online and at the very least I'd have to make my own custom adapter or cable to see if there was absolutely anything I could do with this laptop in its current form I made some older ms-dos boot discs if you want to do the same I left a link in the description I'm using Windows XP as I had trouble doing this in Windows 10 the first version I wanted to try was ms-dos 3 point 3 which is what this laptop would have come pre-installed with it also didn't detect the hard-disk I went ahead and installed commander Cain onto the boot floppy disk it actually attempted to run but couldn't find a compatible graphics card even after I clicked yes to continue it didn't do anything another dos game I installed onto the boot floppy was captain comic it loaded the first screen and let me define the control inputs but it failed while trying to write to the floppy disk the next idea I had was trying to use an ms-dos 5.0 boot floppy this gives me access to a lot more tools and I can actually try typing in QBasic I tried about five other games all of which had similar problems my next idea was to try and connect another floppy drive to the connector on the motherboard to power the floppy drive I used an old Windows ME computer that I cleaned up in a video last year with the floppy drive plugged in I powered up both machines at the same time to see what would happen the answer to that unfortunately was nothing the laptop showed no signs of life with the floppy drive plugged in well this isn't good how about I try to plug in a standard IDE hard drive wait never mind this is a much bigger connector one with 50 pins perhaps this is for a scuzzy Drive with all other options exhausted let's try opening up the hard disk and the floppy drive after removing four Phillips head screws the rubber-mounted floppy drive can come out after unclipping the metal casing we've got our first look inside the floppy drive it's interesting to see how the discs are inserted and ejected when I first got the machine it struggled to eject discs but after using it for a bit it ejects them fine now to get in further I tried to remove the circuit board on the top however there were several other ribbon cables that I couldn't get easy access to so I decided to stop since I've gotten this far I used some isopropyl alcohol to clean the heads to lubricate the motor I used some wd-40 one thing I did mess up is the alignment of the sensor that detects when the head has reached the end I tried to remove it when I was taking off that PCB on the top and now the drive doesn't function after several attempts I got the alignment right and the drive was thankfully reading disks once again the hard disk was the next component I wanted to take apart I really wanted to be careful as this drive working or not is kind of rare now wolf Jack's that doesn't look good the foam has turned into a sticky mess it now resembles the tar that's used to make roads I began scraping it all off which wasn't as easy as I thought it would be it also turns out that there was a lot more under this paper sheet I got the bulk of it off the rest I had to scrub off with a toothbrush doused in isopropyl alcohol there was still some on the circuit board after pushing it off I realized that it had actually started to corrode the solder points and after a quite a bit of cleaning it did look better but you could definitely tell where the disintegrated foam had been the rest of the hard disk was also looking a whole lot cleaner to see if what we'd done had actually made any difference I put the hard disk back together when the system started up I waited with my fingers crossed and it still had the 1780 Drive error even in ms-dos it was still unable to detect the hard drive I was really baffled by this the drive showed signs of life made some noises and the light turned on yet it still wouldn't run or even be detected I was honestly quite frustrated at this point the only thing left to do was to open up the hard disk since the drive didn't seem to work I really didn't have anything to lose with the hidden screw removed I took out the 612 t7 screws before carefully prying up on the lid the rubber seal made this a little bit difficult to do there we have the internals of a 30 year old 42 megabyte hard drive there is a single Drive platter the whole thing doesn't look too much different to what you'd find today I'm not sure if it's supposed to look like this but you can actually see the lines on the platter are these scratches order really old drives normally look like this out of curiosity I run the drive with the casing off to see what it would look like so with the hard disk open I thought I would simply try booting the system up and what do you know the hard disk actually started working it loaded into this weird software interface I have never seen before the headline at the top is Neil's juicy main menu I really don't know what makes a menu juicy and quite frankly I don't want to know honestly I was ecstatic I could not believe that after all this work I got it to finally fire up straight after I unplugged the drive made sure there was no debris and quickly put it back together it was now time to give the laptop a much-deserved clean out a lot of the dirtiness was easily brushed off I'll give the casing a dose of eucalyptus oil at once it's all back together the hinge was definitely quite creaky I thought it was a good time to open up the display assembly and make the hinge as strong as possible the original user manual which you can actually find online tells you how to do all of this which is pretty awesome there are four small pads that cover the screws once removed iron clipped the plastic backing and here's the CFL bulb that works as the display backlight the manual also says that it should last about 10,000 hours of operation I applied some threadlocker to all the hinge screws to hopefully strengthen them although the hinge was creaking it wasn't broken thankfully this piece of glass with a white backing is what diffuses the backlight making it appear more evenly on the display while I had the panel open I also applied thread Locker to some of the other structural screws the assembly could now be pieced back together in an effort to perhaps loosen the stiff hinges I applied some wd-40 after dusting out the keyboard I scrubbed it with a toothbrush that had some isopropyl alcohol on it this was very effective at cleaning it up I also went around the case and cleaned up any grubby areas the reassembly could now begin I'm very glad I got the hard disk working once more before I put the keyboard back on I removed any gunk that was around the edges relieving Li the laptop and the screen were both still functional before we check out what's on the laptop I gave it a clean with some eucalyptus oil first of all let's try some word processing after the cleaning it's great to see that the keyboard still functions correctly in the DOS utilities there are many options for formatting drives buster advanced version 3.2 by leprechaun's software is nante virus from what I understand I wasn't exactly sure what you do but I eventually worked out how to quit the program whatever games were installed here don't seem to work which is a shame extra seems to be a program that lets you easily explore the directories on your hard drive I had less luck trying to run Lotus 1-2-3 which just came up with a CPU related error code another program installed on here is called solution 6 some sort of primitive accounting software maybe once again I tried to install Commander Keen this time I could install it right to the hard disk although same as last time it couldn't find a supported graphics card whatever settings I tried to use lemmings would not work either a few of the programs on this interface sadly aren't installed at all I did try and stall it some dos games sadly none of which I could get working as far as I'm aware the system simply doesn't have the graphical capabilities although duke nukem kind of worked that the sound was working and because i know the first level i actually managed to get through some of it after upgrading the ms-dos version to 6.2 I thought I'd have a swing at trying to install Windows 3.1 but this laptop simply doesn't have the capabilities to do so this was quite a small laptop for 1990 not a whole lot of connectivity though at the back there was definitely an option for more ports having a neat carry handle really made this very portable the keyboard is definitely not great I guess it may have degraded somewhat over the last 30 years so there we have a true relic from the past this is definitely a very compact laptop for 1990 although its performance is definitely underwhelming I couldn't even install Microsoft Windows 3.1 is this doesn't even have a 286 either way a lot of time was spent on this video and I'm very glad I managed to get it running once again
