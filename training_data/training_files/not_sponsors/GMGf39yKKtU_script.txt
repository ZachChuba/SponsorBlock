this is a national emergency tomato season is headed off-peak and if you did not make a BLT this summer you need to get a move on here's the tea the star of a BLT is the tea I'm not one of those fetishistic tomato freaks who treats it like a damn hand fruit but if you don't agree with me on this one you're not gonna like where this whole video is headed slice a tomato into thick steaks and season each one with kosher salt and coarse fresh ground pepper lettuce contributes crunch to the ripe soft tomato and not much else the lettuce should be iceberg or just the white half of romaine anything else will be either too flavorful or not crunchy enough or both slice it as thin as humanly possible you may choose to toss in a tiny amount of thinly shaved white onion and Italian seasoning the BLT bacon should be thin cut and cooked until crisp I don't think thick cut bacon ever gets truly crisp in fact I hate thick cut bacon it's like taking all of the best parts of a fresh crispy potato chip of meat and turning it into a quarter inch thick slab of chewy flesh that never breaks cleanly pulling out of any sandwich and bringing its neighbors along and frankly ruining everything the bread should be quite bread ciabatta is too crusty BLT bread should be soft sourdough is crusty and it's sour a roll already filled by the acidic tomatoes go with Pullman wonder potato even focaccia toast it in a buttered pan before assembly some people will suggest that you toast the bread in bacon fat but that would be too much bacon flavor and say it with me the star of a BLT is the tomato here comes the epic reddit armie to ddos me which there's no such thing as too much bacon flavor comments the last remaining element is mayonnaise vegan mayo is actually pretty good plain Mayo it's just fine if you desire you may flavor this with pesto or hot sauce chopped Chipotle's whatever again people will act as if spreading mayo on a slice of bread before toasting it is some kind of big brain life hack but I'll never do it butter browns and mayo doesn't stick to the script the toasted bread provides a semi impermeable defense against soaking and soggy may on the entire bottom slice this will anchor the shred us to the bread this lettuce is the perfect foundation for tomatoes during consumption all of the juice will catch wick and disperse throughout the lettuce before the excess mixes down into the thick mayonnaise to create a thin sauce that's fatty juicy acidic and overall unbeatable top it all off with bacon the top bread and press it closed if you make a proper BLT in August or September it'll drip more juice all over your gob face and lap than a Georgia Peach that's why it's such a great summer sandwich perfectly balanced as all things should be each item with its own direct foil bread and butter bacon and tomato lettuce and mail it ain't pretty but it's pretty good
