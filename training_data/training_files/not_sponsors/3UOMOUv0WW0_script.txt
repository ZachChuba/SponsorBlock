okay well that was the worst timing possible we got the call that the plane was coming we got everything ready we saw the plane the plane was like right there coming in hot and then this storm kicks up and the plane leaves we are soaked you can hear the thunder everything everything we have is put away we have no shelter and the plane left the plane is gone because you couldn't fly in the storm so now what this is day nine morning of day nine hello how are you doing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] at around 4:00 I woke up and smelled some smoke part of the forest is burning right now you can really see it smokestacks this is unreal it's a good dream hole ramming speed ahead oh man way less visibility here I can't say I'm not a little concerned from being on it what would you do what do you do if you're out here no life I know all flights are grounded [Music] supporting my channel for sponsoring this on to the video well breakfast was breakfast I did clean up my thumb last night like I said but the old band-aid got all soggy and excuse me and fell off or I took it off because it was all soggy so what I think I'll do is I got this gaffer tape on um this is a liquor bra a pole fixer in case one of your poles snaps into ten just slide this over both of them and bows around it and it it's a field repair type thing but I figure if I wrap a band-aid in some of that stuff it should stay on for the at least today's paddle so I think that's what we'll do we're we're just kind of relaxing this morning it's a windy day we don't have far to travel at all like I was saying so today's gonna be a nice chill day but still move well so go check out some really cool stuff and fish I like this easy pace canoe trip and a good time we were saying we're starting to feel like we're getting into the groove of things it's hasn't been a hard trip by any means but still once you start to feel like very relaxed and very calm at home out here I think is when the goods good stuff starts to set in and this is day three now I'm feeling pretty good I'm feeling really good I just want to have my morning ritual everything came out all right everything's been all right and I'm extremely blessed and happy that's the case because I needed this man I'm hoping this is gonna heal me completely today's ritual was better than yesterday's it'll only get better from here damn that ain't going nowhere at least till tomorrow or when I go swimming might start the day off with a little swim actually we'll see we'll see I keep saying that but still just sitting here it is hot how does the Dickens we're gonna get out of here now yeah just after 9:00 paddle down and check out that cool spot we've been talking the boat pretty impressive to everything so far all the gear all the weather everything there's been a lot of ticks here at this site probably said that last night but I pulled another five off my stuff this morning none of them were embedded and they're all big so they're not the bad one they're not the Lonestar or the red leg or black leg two deer the ones that make you allergic to meat how crazy is that how crazy is that anyway they're just annoying they're not really nobody really likes ticks I don't think [Applause] well the clouds came back with full force oh my goodness look at that that's where the wind was coming from there was no clouds that way at all look at the not too nice you know a little bit of waves a little bit of wind but we're not really going against him how's it going across it that's okay these little boats are great for that take your time you gotta troll I guess I will [Music] you know choppy oh here [Applause] [Applause] Slendy yeah no bites a whole time nothing well we've made it to our 100 meter for highs for the day not dreading this at all hello windy homie I would have been scared to Big Canoe in the middle there yeah I don't like its hanim canoe regardless for many reasons regardless [Applause] [Applause] this looks very bare area zero erased 1000 meter poor Tosh just planning on a hundred brawl you'd only full of piss and vinegar hopes and dreams we'll need to have it crushed [Applause] I'm burned again oh man no that's unfortunate I like Kyle said this lake is burned as well or another burn lake but it's only early in the morning hopefully we can 12:30 hopefully we can find a decent squat with some shade and some fish [Music] frye leave room for Kyle when he comes with his boat clear head captain canoe head typically in those I move my boat all the way out the way in the way everything no appreciation [Applause] [Applause] no go on the fishing in the little Rapids there a little pool although I'm very happy that we went down there I really wish I could've got that snapping turtle on film I'm so I swear it's like three times the size of the biggest navin turtle I've ever seen it was prehistoric the things arms were as wide as mine not that that's saying much all right we're on this Lake we're gonna go find our camp and we're gonna do that click I'm starving and I need to swim swim you guys have seen me use these gear ties in the past to keep my rod attached this year I got these dealy-bob you're literally called Deeley bubs you can see how that works right since you drown tell you it tight anyway it works well it's quick release you can do it one hand just put it back on there so I don't lose it there's a campsite right in front of us it looks big enough but there's zero shade at all that's alright I'm filming [Applause] well lunch is done we pulled up to the site we were looking for and as you can see it's burned not only is it burned there's absolutely no flat ground like not even for one tent it's early it's too early to stop and stay here so we got to look at the map and reevaluate we're starting to lose our minds because everything it's just so exposed we're in constant Sun there's no shade we're literally sitting behind this little rock to try to write any kind of shade and we do have that tarp obviously but we're gonna rig it to the rock here yeah it feels like an exposed mountaintop really it's the same feeling like there's no trees in just rocktron I mean we have trees but I won't really call those trees yeah I don't know I've not experienced that but it's it feels very similar um yeah so anyway we'll figure out what we're doing either we still want to go check out that little fjord place and boot around the cool thing but this site was that we will remove all of it leave all of our stuff here boot around light but that's ok like I said yesterday man things change over here it's constantly changing the wind dictates everything look here the band-aid fell off once again I literally wrapped it three more times after I showed you and yeah it's hard to keep it on with all the water ok let's look at the map so we slept here last night claim across from here to here is very windy there's some Falls try doing some fishing we're right here in this green triangle so we want to come down this way head west a bit and then down this is supposed to be a really rocky cool area with high cliffs and stuff and now we need to decide do we want to go through that and try to camp on this bigger lake which we have to flip over and look at a different map or go down and look at this and then come this way the problem is there's one campsite here a portage and then apparently this is a problem I don't know what this means beaver I think there's a bad Beaver Dam right here and then we're on Mexican hat Mexican hat has a lot of good campsites I think it's the top of this is that doesn't no name huge huge lake I'd be cool it's in one of these campsites here if it's not burned yeah we can definitely go check that's do that it's simple the easy let me look at our own ship so it's one complete picture let's go down we'll go into a GN o GN and then if it is but we don't have to go to all the way to the sites if it is burned yeah we'll just go back and we're just exit the fjords and look down that way and if it looks terrible forget it and we'll go back and do Mexican hat well maybe you would might be able to camp at that site beforehand if it's not burnt as well before the port ours right correct all right yep I think we got a plan let's go through this we have a plan crisis averted well it's mercy here so maybe the fire didn't go away this way I don't know don't call me on this and I hope I'm right what it looks like this is the end of the burn and then right there starts to be the live trees again all across is all alive and everything that's a really really good sign all live all green man I'm trying to film Kyle all right well this is Pike number two does it make sense I'm not doing the same thing is you just too angry like the fish is yelling over there by himself he's yelling I think the fish can pick up on his this is just another fish on it's probably a pike feels pretty big bigger than a than a walleye at least yep I like this they're all just getting in the corner of the lip I want to crash into the shore [Music] [Music] it's old old old and these new trees have grown up oh yeah look at this in here yes Wow I'm very excited to see green trees how happy do these green trees make you do it definitely right there so nice to see oh yeah this is pretty nice and shallow and close in here right tight oh look at that down the pipe it's cool this is so all right Kyle it looks like there's a portage or animal trail right there over here my daughter watches oh man just scratching the paint drop all up rocks absolutely beautiful it is pretty well that was the Fuhrer okay if you go back through that tomorrow we both decided there's no way we're paddling all the way back there to the original route today to go back to Mexican Hat lake it's not happening we've been paddling for way too long to get over into here we both made a deal with each other that if there is trees over here if there are trees live trees over here we will camp over here and there are and we don't want to paddle back so that's the school that's here's a pretty cool example of a black spruce so you see this one here with the club on the top that's a very stereotypical this one here top broke off and then two leaders grow and also here you can see an example of that up there the top breaks off from the wind or whatever big heavy birds landing on it and then the the to come up in its place and compete for the leader spot black spruce picea glocca I see a glocca I think is the Latin name all right great success is Lake we're on now is off of our wrote and it is not burned and it looks beautiful that enormous lake we're gonna go down until a set of three campsites check out a camp site and yeah set up our stuff and just kind of relax for a bit I'll have to double back yeah tomorrow back along the same trail we went today or seemed calculate today that's okay the fjord was nice to see and hopefully tomorrow we'll be going with the wind as opposed to as opposed to against it I was a hundred percent sure I was completely stuffed o'clock right by a point right yeah and it's that I actually got a pike yeah well it's the first time for everything man oh look it only so happy it's a good fish he's fish I went from zero to two and five minutes you know uh-huh zero to 100 real quick real quick full squad on that reel well we've made it to a campsite we're on a really big lake on a point there's a fire pit here and it's all hot and in the Sun wait till you see this this is like something out of a movie for us right now all right have fun look at this flat flat flat ground shade that chairs up just relaxing trying to cool down cause gonna go drop one off oh man so happy to be here I've noticed there's no texture I don't see my clothes or anything not like last night baby pretty pretty common last night I think the sights we different a - it's a actual sight will say yeah that old burn there's a live trees provide shade and look at this flat ground that's amazing this would be like a b-minus site in Algonquin to me right now it's just like best about it this is the best site we've been out for sure yeah I'm very lucky very happy to be here we passed what three four other ones that were all just kind of mediocre one was on top of a cliff yes so we saw - we ran it rounded a corner a Kazakh is that a canoe there's 210 boats at this site actually that they put here says woodland caribou Park on it with a sticker so I don't know if it's like it's gotta be some type of like flying company or something they do that or the park office I was thinking but maybe either way I think there's probably great fishing in here because of that yeah it's a big old Lake I'm sure there's lots of Lakers I got the biggest bike I've got here so far days that was it's good times we got both them in this lake they're spread over there a little go back brother I don't know if there's walleye in here if there is maybe they just the time of day we were coming up through here wasn't good for walleye but like I was using that same rippling red fin and there's no good everything I've caught is pretty much but I'm the Pala would X wrap it up yeah just silver in green and then like the super bright green that I lost somehow the line just like snapped out of nowhere I must have hit something you probably had like like a fray or something yeah from that fish getting it I think I'm gonna put on a Deep Diver tonight maybe oh maybe I could just meet jig for Lake TRO - I have a big little heavy a couple of heavy Jake heads we haven't used like barely any of those mister twisters we brought right hundreds of them we never use it I probably have the same one on the jig that I yeah he's yeah we got loaded up with I don't know we probably have 75 jigs I I'm trying to think it's do anything else I would do different tackle wise you don't need the leaders I've discovered know who's do it Brayden 12 pound braid you're fine we haven't got like a monster monster pike but still I think you're fine just had lost a couple big ones but still my line was fine it wasn't because the line got no no no yeah so I think the the leaders not needed I'm are you direct tying all your stuff you're using it all haven't use a swivel at all this whole trip I just been direct tying all my stuff I always use a swivel before and I have it all I just I haven't really lost I think I lost it one lure or something I've lost one it's not bad it was the one that was working really well but yeah I mean I dragonflies huge has something smoked look at right here they love you there's like a dead one in its mouth oh it's just getting down oh that is they're making dragonflies is that you sure it are they making dragon passionate huh maybe eating him or both okay it's one of those things really like do it and then I swear I'm not exaggerating that's her okay we went down to the that those Falls or whatever that little Pulos like very scenic but I go down there and make a bunch of noise like I always do a cast I'm talking to the to the camera and I just see under the water because the waters like this deep I see under was a slow slow movie thing and I said Rocco's movie I'm not even joking the shell was this big like I'm not exaggerating that the the limbs on it were this thick like it was crazy man why did she go skinny-dipping in there I I should have like rassled it Steve Irwin style but there's a bit much that was crazy I really wanted to get in the camera for you guys but yeah there's more bug life here a variety of bug life than any place else I've seen I was always surprised at how much bugs there were this far north but not like mosquitoes like Blackfyre it's just like ants and like I just kicked off something I'd never seen right there the dragonflies are like a lot of those that's that's a big help for the biting yes so the bug school we seen I don't know half a dozen dozen bald eagles number half-dozen easy Osprey last night some seagulls yeah no big game no big things we've seen moose poo several times in the porch at least a yeah only a couple times not much at all not yeah we've been in Algonquin before where it's like you know every 10 feet you run into it I haven't seen it we haven't done any of those poor Taj's like that all you want yeah and like to be like yeah we're the caribou would be or anything like that maybe that's that part we get screwed tomorrow that said he said merci the on the the map it says EFT yeah at one part alright footer just took a pen wrote that in and drew an arrow so apparently there's a what is it a big Beaver Dam oh yeah it's yeah it's a like everything flows into one spot then he said it's a Big Beaver Dam and every time you step on it you like fall through the Beaver Dam we're used to that and we've done that like catching fish is that the thing we haven't yeah I haven't had any near-death experiences on this trip no this has been an easy trip yeah we're only day three this is gonna be so cold yeah you gotta film it these are other boats it's kind of unfortunate but it's on the best site to which is also kind of unfortunate that is what it is as well cold flipping is Right funny do I look you look ridiculous I bet in there that's cool it's probably really stupid of me to leave it right there no no that's fine no no there's no wind no way is it slippery yes all we have is neoprene oh yeah this is slippery as snot oh it's gonna be cold Kyle oh this is so cold it's cold bro okay thanks man oh it's so slippery yeah I don't think I can do this go ahead you first this time I can't in bold last time just running jump man you fine Oh God the backings better yeah it's fine [Music] taking me away yeah yeah man that wind uh sketchy oh that's refreshing I know show off the big camera on the other side did you notice what maintenance in out of a molehill I'd say oh it's a Drew Carey Show is a Drew Carey Show reference I wonder if anyone gets that all right I got the old I got the life jacket on he was gonna lay around in the water I think Oh No I'm cold oh it's cold again all righty I was not graceful I look so nice with the light somewhere on the gear pile yep we're gonna do dehydrated chicken we got some dehydrated chicken right this is the first for me and there's a bunch of us takes place in there as well we'll try this out today and see house all full of piss and vinegar a little spent okay old man on the ground anyway what I'm gonna do because I'm not ready to eat yet and there's rice in here that's not cooked at all before I think it might take a little bit longer than the chicken to cook so I'm going to a cold soak it beforehand with clean water this is different we'll see how this works a little cold soak it and then we'll just cook it up normally in about an hour and I imagine I'll plump up in there some beforehand and who knows about the rice if it'll make it easier to cook or not but this is what we're doing this for to test it out I'm trying to a yeah I was joking geez Louise Kyle now I'm living the tree safely it is shorts and water shoes you did a good job just so everyone knows that tree is dead [Laughter] you know at home before this trip I didn't even want to open my gear or my bag after I had packed it to put in things I had for God or dad things or whatever organized things because it was such a hassle to you know take it out and put it back in and on this trip I've probably dumped out my whole backpack 15 times easy just again how it is how it is every time I'm so glad to be camping like this again so glad to be back to canoe tripping real to canoe tripping I want to go on another trip when I get home I really do I want to try to make that happen walk the path Joe all pisser no it didn't [Applause] [Music] yeah it'll be a big excuse me sir just and here a look plane in the distance let's split this down yeah she's uh she don't wanna split working on top of this rock here you gotta be careful right right there we go XQ see I'm gonna use these for my twig stove tonight at least these three it'll break up into it quite a bit for my twig stove I do this all right all right good amount for my twig stove anyway don't look that way all right now you just split up the rest of this for a little bit of wood to go on right after the kindling we've got a big round and we've got twigs so this will be the intermediate pencil size as it were but actually not pencil size we've got all of our twig size which I was speaking about there good pile of it and those pine cones make really really good fire starter tinder fuel and then they're the piece de resistance big pile of sod wood so we got our firewood all dialed in before we go fishing tonight don't have to work it well at all now I'm gonna have supper relax and go fishing the lake is calming down big time look at that wind only just as I say that anyway at least there's no waves tonight's electro tonight tonight tonight' skylake truck night will come back we're done in there will no longer be a lake trophy I got the fire pit all prepped out there with some logs get a nice base of coals cooks and fish on if you watched Joe's video it's gonna look like he did 99% of the the prep it's actually the exact opposite he just films the last one let's point out who did what hey this me anyway so back to the real story I'm gonna go out and catch some fishing out here after dinner I want you can leave your family leave your family I want you to all note about the scene that I did prior to this one roars like it's Kyle's night yeah he's gonna get a Lake Trail we're gonna come back cook it up it's coaster just talking a lot big time and then he just tears me down look it I want to point something out I want to point something out look at half that's me all these big pieces are me out of the wet crumbled pieces of yours what is this who cut it aside green Sakharine see no one will believe me I mean no together call this tex-mex it is brown rice a bunch of like good spicy seasonings black beans corn green and red peppers and then I've got a bag for you crush some of these on it should be good to show yo your setup so this is the ever new nine hundred pot with titanium windscreen and then I've got a little tiny lumen thing under there what is it aluminum thing alcohol stove by the way if you're looking for denatured alcohol in Canada it is nearly impossible to find we went to what four stores and I ended up having to buy a whole gallon jug of it methyl hydrate yep all right mine's starting to rehydrate a brief yet it stops a lot of that water up so pull out a little bit more and get this wood stove going I'm hungry [Music] cup of tea case of the cons did you bring any monster energy drink out here put some drywall what about your buddy Chad does he have his white sunglasses well it's not so bad it would be much better if I did not put a mountain of Montreal steak spice in this before I left it's the most peppery thing going I do have BAM Sun seasoning with me but I don't want to add more spice to it so anyways it's good it's just overpowering with the pepper it kind of tastes like a like a chicken soup type thing but the shredded chicken I can see like squash carrots onions peas leeks and Oh cold starting a cold like that cold soaking it worked I didn't have to cook it for any extra amount of time although this thing was a good jet I thought the lid was gonna go into orbit yeah that's good I'll do it again no Montreal's takes place you know maybe I'll use a little bit of like Frank's Red Hot or something just a couple dashes after the after that all right I took all my meals and I preseason before I brought huh I thought it'd be easier just to like put all the stuff in before now I'm thinking like it's hard to kind of adjust 100% I used I used two recipes so I kind of need like you know teaspoon that go over that whatever they've come out okay I think I think seasoning after the fact is what I'm gonna do it now just bring a little little tiny jar of a bottle of it I use some like smoked paprika a couple of like extra spices and stuff in mind that I wouldn't bring like seven jars cuz that'd just be too much I think dude the spices but maybe like the salt content don't do that at least that's what I'm gonna do that way you can change the salt content out here that does a lot with flavor and that salt really perked up those that fish yes well just getting it into me all right we got a camp set up it's time to go fish spare change your pants on feel it's nice to have later on oh I can show you the boats now Kyle what year did it say for the park but they're from 1998 and 2001 1998 yeah so apparently you don't need this anymore they're here super illegal or no one ever uses them are they they haven't been here since then so yeah obviously we aren't the first people to be here we were not Native Americans settling this land living on this land and other people have been here as well waste up now after all your gas mine well yeah we didn't have a gas competition but maybe we should have well someone in the fish one so the ELISA twins oh yeah man I hope you get one that's a lie okay fair enough let's go fish fish got something on not sure what what it is I was trolling deep and it's pretty it's fighting pretty good it might be a bike oh yeah sighs Pike this trip at least I am just getting hammered by this win oh just barely got him food there he goes nice okay my fourth Pike today no Lakers there's gotta be no walleye walleye in this Lake files off to go back the way we came to fish down there cuz you got a few earlier today there they want to circle the island there's a little shallow spot or shallows I want to check for sure yeah as you can see I'm moving man this win is really [Music] so I'm heading back in this when I head back and sit down for a little while we'll see probably not today there's a lake that's all right III might be a No we didn't know what to expect on this Lake right we had things mapped out before like the walleye lake trout leagues and stuff like that on our route but this isn't on our ropes again anyway sounds like he's got to Pyke already and he's got a third one on was it a Laker [Music] it took your lure your lure you gone yeah but it's so far away yeah I rely thought oh it is for sure I thought you had a really big I thought you had a leg trope for sure because you're in the middle of nowhere very deep yeah yeah I have my whole reel out a couple times oh well I think we tied up today I think we both got four Pike today you just are you checking this to see if I fall over I'm just filming with this lens for a change the different lens but yeah I definitely want to get it if you fall in don't get it twisted don't get it twisted I have hopes Sherwood well that was easy enough one little click on the lighter that's all toy day three day three the three was a real canoe trip today I was saying to the back when my camera over there I felt like okay this trip is real like we've had a night or two out we've had you know a couple of poor Tasha's I feel dirty now caught some fish we've caught more fish this trip you know like five fold more than any of other trips together yeah it might just go like well that's a look at the gradient though it's a dark blue light blue every all the way down the pastels yeah waters calm and now it is as soon as I landed the canoe then it got called yeah I smell let me look at Daisy I mean it's not as bad as it has been but we're not talking roses here I'm not talking yak you're right no I thought I was gonna go back out and fish tonight turns out my body says no it didn't really get the pinks and purples that I was hoping for tonight so it's okay I'm I'm fine sitting here for the first night and actually relaxing a fire as opposed to fishing this is awesome we have flat land there's grass here I've never been so excited to see flat land and grass in my whole life this is the best campsite we've had for sure yeah it's great oh really the flat the flat ground is nice both previous nights have been very lopsided and very lumpy it's still sleeping well still soupy very well look there's that light again in the sky where do you say you think it's Jupiter I don't I don't know mercury it's got to be a planet it's Uranus it could be Uranus it's a possibility you wouldn't be able to see it if it was mine Wow yeah if it was it was yeah I'm never gonna say yeah yeah so where else can we go canoe tripping guys let me hear some some some ideas we've been talking Kyle lives on the west coast obviously and Here I am almost on the east then we're saying how where he lives there's nothing like this there's no lake systems like this this is very stereotypical Canadian it is I mean epic backpacking but no no River no lakes like this yes so this is very Canadian I mean I'd come back here a million times over don't get me wrong right it's nice to go to different places though it's cool to different try different things and the adventurer like you never don't wobble kini have you know I could do that but it's very similar to this it's not gonna be terribly different and quite a cause well I might even do quite a coup later on this year to be honest with you I might do political later on this year oh maybe we do Joaquin next year okay I don't Minnesota Wisconsin type areas have canoeing like this is Wisconsin the same thing or no they're two different states yeah but does it have stuff like this I don't think so okay so if it does is very little okay so I'm going to so far south you know there's like a river canoe trip I know it's real popular in Northwest Territories don't like that might be cool the Yukon River yeah I go more west I would do that I would do that all day long the only thing I don't love is grizzly bears if there is them there I don't think anyone loves grizzly bears in the backcountry not even address Gurkha no I meet him poop scared the poop out of a bear that's one of the best like YouTube clips ever he's like you can tell he's like you know way deep into the bush and he's good anyways but yeah we were talking about where you can go over to trip with the canoe trip and the rest of the world like this and we came up with Russia and maybe Sweden Norway something like that I wouldn't mind going to Norway I on it I would go to Norway there's some there's a there's cool backpacking both with country still will you do a backpacking canoe trip that'd be cool I would do that hell yeah rent a tandem canoe go backpacking fish first sleep there's something cold like it's like the wheatish fish there's our grass first exactly right is the native land so go there like all Swedish get it out look at it I'm Swedish tent with Swedish pants using a Swedish stove sometimes using a Swedish accent Swedish we're both really pale too very but we would fit right in yeah look good dirty dirty dirty Bert no offense no offense yeah and I'm sure they're great folks anyways that'd be cool I would go to Sweden for sure I should do that we should plan and do that that should be I've always wanted to check it out oh let's do it next year next year this time July Oh fist ball you saw it it's a it's a pact I'm down let's do it I'm serious I want to do it no I'm not joking around do you know how many dumb things we've done over some sailor and a fire before Burch Burch cliff Creek is what we died literally says on the map Kyle and I rode up on a long Algonquin canoe trip and it literally says on the map don't know what does it say uh-oh I can't remember the name of the other Creek but it says this Creek is always hard to follow sandy bottom blah blah blah whatever that said it's always better and easier than birch cliff free and we could have went both the ways but because old Jake old Jake at the store was like oh no just go down birch cliff it's easier that was that was the worst thing ever that was where I remember I fell over backwards out of the canoe in the back of my pants I felt scooped ice it's scoop like I saw I fell backwards out of the canoe and when I stood up it like scoops and EDD to my underwear pants I do remember that we continued portaging while I have I had a lot of sand around me remember I got stung yeah we ran into a beehive essentially it was like right there and then we trying to back paddles yeah we went the wrong way down in this little tub never had a little tiny Morse there's nothing like this here we went the wrong way there was like a left or a right or right in whatever and we went of course the road rough why why and then it kept getting narrower yeah I remember was standing on top on the cannula to look here like this is we got a backtrack yeah so anyways yeah we should do the International we should go more international all right we're going to sweet we're going to Sweden or Norway in Norway Finland something like that one anyway we should get a cook side we should get
