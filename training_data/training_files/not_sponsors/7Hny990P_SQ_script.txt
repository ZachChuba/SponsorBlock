description I really appreciate it and yeah on with the video when I was about 11 years old my dad married a woman who is now my stepmom at the time I hadn't done anything much in the way of housework or cooking or anything so when we moved to a two-story four-bedroom three-bathroom massive house one of the nicer neighborhoods in Boise it was a bit of a culture shock for the first time of my life I had chores watering plants dusting stuff moving furniture and the occasional cooking since I had no experience with pretty much any of those things my stepmom often had to give me these really thorough instructions they were occasionally weird and I didn't understand them but they worked out 99% of the time it was kind of like something from the Bible where Moses could just be standing in front of a massive body of water leading thousands of people away from the Egyptian army the Pharaoh and his soldiers are storming close around the horizon and tons of innocent men women and children are primed and ready to be slaughtered Moses like um God what do I do and God is like tap your stick on the ground and Moses like what and God is like no balls do it so Moses does it now what do you know everything works out great I'm saying all of this to simply establish you don't question what my stepmom says if she gives you instructions no matter how weird you follow them and things will work out for you fast forward about a year or so and I kind of understand all this she's like a mini Martha Stewart - the stock trading front we have an old family friend Chelsea coming over for dinner we haven't seen her in ages because she's been off doing crazy cool adventures like college and stuff my stepmom was so excited that she spent days and days preparing the nicest lasagna that you've ever seen premium ingredients worth around $100 they're organic they're fresh they're imported from Italy and stuff like that they were blessed by Buddhist monks if you served it to a ghost in The Sims 3 that ghost would probably come back to life it was the night Chelsea was supposed to come over I got a call from my stepmom hello hey pumpkin I'm running a little bit late your dad is sick upstairs so you're gonna need to do this I need you to pull the lasagna from the fridge put it on a cookie sheet and stick it in the oven I'll be home soon simple as pie I opened up the fridge and the lasagna almost blinds me with its glory I put it on the counter and I think about the instructions okay put it on a cookie sheet when we made cookies as a kid we'd lay globs of dough on wax paper so a sheet of paper you put cookies on wax paper cookie sheet okay I got it so I'd pull out a sheet of wax paper and I lay it on the counter how on earth am I gonna get all the lasagna on the wax paper how is this gonna work out nope don't you question your stepmom she's like Gordon Ramsay - the f-words remember the whole Bible thing yeah don't forget that I grabbed a spatula and I eyed down the lasagna and it's perfectly good hand-blown glass container it shouldn't be too hard you just tilt it down help lasagna slide onto the cookie sheet easy peasy lemon squeezy so I started and quickly found out that it wasn't easy peasy lemon squeezy so the sauce came out of the sides little patches of grass and flowers sprouted from the floorboards like I said this was the finest lasagna ever crafted eventually all of the lasagna tov started to come out I was hoping would retain its shape it didn't all the layers were lost all the toppings they were sliding out the sides it was a mess but it was still salvageable I realized things were not going so well I tried to slide it back into its bowl that was not working okay I know dad is asleep and sick but I need his assistance I wandered upstairs and poked his shoulder and I was like hey Dad I need some help here his eyes shoot open he's half awake what huh what do you need um stepmom told me to put the lasagna on a cookie sheet and stuff but it's not really working out I just put the lasagna on a cookie sheet like she said there's no plausible way it could go wrong just just do it please then he just rolled over and went back to sleep although in his defense you would have to use a lot of imagination to figure out a way that that could go wrong and he felt super crazy sick anyway I wander back downstairs and tried to get the lasagna back when there was knock at the door I answered it to find that Chelsea had arrived I was standing there dripping in tomato sauce oh hi Chelsea hey me busy everything okay oh yeah everything's fine great dandy how about you come inside and I'll turn on Forrest Gump for you I mean I can't say no to good old Tom Hanks I guess just let me know if you need anything thanks see ya I scrambled over to lasagna and I continued to try and fix it a giant slab of meats and vegetables and pasta just fell to the ground and splattered a puppy crawled out of the mess because like I said those lasagna was really really good Chelsea heard it and poked her head over the couch everything okay I'm gonna die in here ah geez let me help you she wandered over and saw the mess the thing that you need to know about Chelsea is that she used to live with my stepmom she knew what stepmom was capable of there was a look of terror in her eyes Oh what have you done I'm on my last legs here we need to clean this up before she gets home and wouldn't you know it that's when the garage door opened up my heart dropped into my stomach and my stomach dropped into my butt and my butt ran away with the spoon Chelsea glanced over me with a really big eyes so she runs into the hallway to stop stepmom and I'm shelving the nicest lasagna anyone has ever made onto this black paper stem all marks around the corner because apparently Chelsea sucks at distracting oh hi Nate is the lasagna ready to go she sees the whole thing I look like a toddler who stuffed his face with birthday cake there was sauce all over the counter running down the island sides pulling up at my feet chunks of meat and pasta with bits of tomato clumped up in soggy wax paper the goodness of lasagna evaporate into the air leaving some kind of quality vacuum for the legions of Sena occupy it looked like a murder scene stepmom stopped dead in her tracks she didn't drop her groceries she put them on the ground she looked over at Chelsea stepmom smiled never broke I think you should go in the other room and wait a minute this will only be a second sure just help clean up Wow Chelsea Chelsea went to the guest room like a dog with its tail but your legs and as soon as the door closed behind her what is the matter with you I gave you simple instructions and you went ahead and growing family dinner for everyone this lasagna is worth more than you are in the black market I spent days perfecting this see that puppy in the corner that miracle was birthed by my hand and you went ahead and smeared it all over the kitchen like a monkey throwing rope on the walls my dad wandered into the room half dead essentially he acts as my defense lawyer whenever I mess up oh what's going on over here where have you been all night the lasagna has been absolutely ruined because of your absence in all this Nate how did this happen I thought wax paper was a cookie sheet and I didn't stop to question stepmom because she's always right about this weird stuff ah that makes sense no conning it was just a misunderstanding don't honey me this isn't a misunderstanding this is just stupid why would you remove this priceless lasagna from his hand-blown glass bowl the insides were greased with the tears of Robin Williams the pasta was crafted by weight from George Clooney's property in Italy I snuck over the fence to get it myself it was almost eaten by guard dogs I missed my mother's funeral while preparing this did you know it was my birthday yesterday I did nothing I stayed home delicately lay each strip on top of the other in perfect symmetry I attended a college class on Fang Street with chief perfect balance for this dish and now it's ruined God you know what you need to understand about my stepmom is that she's one of the most powerful incredible amazing sweet kind thoughtful women you will ever meet in your entire life 98% of time anyway this was that 2% coming out in a fit of mad rage that was totally justified on her end by the way Chelsea was still in the other room listening through the walls and having war flashbacks from when she lived in the house many many years ago stepmom blacked out and threw the glass container in the sink a little harder than she thought and exploded to a million pieces Robin Williams tears ran down the drain Chelsea probably thinks I'm dead at this point so a few hours went by and we wound up having shrimp [Music] so how was work today sweetie good nice I love you I love you too sweetie you know what nobody wants to hear it Chelsea hey Nate I'm running a little bit late your dad is up in late rhyme so what if I called you pumpkin I mean it just sounds like hey Nate I'm running a little bit late I'm driving up the state dude to death but depature dinner dad I hate you so
