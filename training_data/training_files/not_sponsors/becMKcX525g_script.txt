this video is sponsored by brilliant dog it was suggested to me on Twitter that now that I am completely done with the University I've done my undergraduate my masters and my PhD I could look back and ask what kind undifferenced I keep myself up with at night sometimes where I think back to specific events or to just general changes in behavior and how my life would have been different if I done those things as it is I'm very happy with the way that my life has turned out and I actually wouldn't go back and change anything even if I could but if you were to send me back to my undergrad and you gave me two objectives to maximize how happy I was during my undergraduate degree and to maximize the grades that I got at the end of my undergraduate degree then I have identified five things that I would definitely have done differently number one end my relationship before I went to university well we're going in hard today before I elaborate on this one I just want to be very clear that this is specific to my situation I'm not saying that everybody in a relationship going to university should separate from their partner I don't want to be responsible for like a million heartbreaks around the world in my case though it definitely would have given me a better experience at underground and I also should be clear this is something that actually talked about with my ex-girlfriend we both agree that we shouldn't have carried the relationship on to university why was it a bad idea to continue our relationship to university well I was studying in Oxford and she was studying at Cambridge but that wasn't the problem and we would see each other every week I would go and visit her every other week and she would come and visit me every other other week that meant that during the week I was working flat out I was working 9:00 a.m. till 10:00 p.m. every day didn't socialize did nothing really but work even on the weekends I actually also did work with Herbert that we'll get to that in a bit the problem was I was clinging so tight to the mast of the relationship that I didn't develop a support network in Oxford I didn't have a friendship group and with the time most of my year left coz I was on a four-year course most people in three of courses I don't think there were very many people in my year that would have called me a friend and that is a profound regret that I missed an opportunity to make friends with a bunch of interesting people and profound regret that I didn't have a support network of friends to help me when things got tough which they frequently did maintaining my relationship from school into University definitely negatively impacted my time at undergraduate I'm not saying that everybody would benefit from separating from their partner because this is obviously an individual response but in my case it's probably the single biggest thing that I would have changed and my undergrad secondly I would have worked less now I know that I said that one of the objectives here was to try and maximize the grade at the end of my undergrad which is hopefully you know what a lot of people watching this video are probably looking to do I genuinely believe though that I would have done better at my degree if I hadn't pushed so hard if I'd actually taken a step back from my degree and not worked for 12 or 13 hours a day every day during the week you will not do well in a degree if you don't work hard that's just the fact even the smartest people at university have to put the time in to reach their potential and anybody who claims they don't have to work hard is just sort of trying to show off there are however two sub points here one burnout and two the difference between working hard and working smart firstly if you just push and push and push and put all your time into working like I did then you will burn out quite frequently and this happened to me underground a lot I would just make myself sick because I was trying too hard I was so tunnel vision on I'd got into Oxford I didn't think I belong there I was starting from the very bottom of the ladder in my head I had to work my absolute hardest nerds to get by but that resulted in me burning out and doing worse than if I just taken the the pace down a little bit and work more consistently over the course of the year because sub-point number two there is a massive difference between working hard and working smart you will need to put in a larger number of hours every day in order to work but it doesn't have to be an overwhelming number of hours if you plan your time and you structure your studies in an appropriate way this was definitely something I got better at towards the end in my third year I developed a system of spaced repetition where I would have a diary of covering not just during the revision period but also during the whole year when I would cover stuff that had been covered in lectures and I did by far best academically my third year partly because of that technique this is something that I would make a video about but frankly thomas frank noted member of the smart youtuber mafia already has an entire youtube channel full of fantastic videos on this topic so if you're interested in working smart rather than hard definitely go check him out the fact that I persisted in working myself into the ground and I developed this mental image of me being in the very bottom of the academic ladder and I had to just grind by putting more and more hours in to get to the top rather than thinking about how I was doing it remains one of my biggest life regrets so if I was to go back to my undergraduate I would stop worrying so much about how many hours I was doing during a day and worrying more about how I was maximizing the efficiency of the hours I dedicated to studying this actually directly leads on to my next point committing to extracurriculars Jun my undergrad I played in a wind band I was actually the manager of the wind band for a year when I played saxophone I did a little bit of rowing I did to terms of Rome for my college and a little bit of physic Society and that was kind of it like I said before I spent almost my entire time working during the week and then seeing my girlfriend on the weekend I just didn't take time to do things that I actually enjoyed doing compared that University routine to school where despite the fact that I was doing debate hockey discus scouts school officers I was getting top grades across the boards because I was happy and I was happy because I was doing stuff I was interested in outside of my studies my mental health improved so much when I move from Oxford to Exeter obviously lots of changes happen with that transition but I think one of the key things was that I committed to singing and doing music and doing a lot of it I dedicated a lot of time alongside a PhD which is not exactly a minimal time commitment to an extracurricular that I love doing if you are in good mental health you can study better it is as simple as that if you neglect your mental health for a long period of time you will not perform at your best academically it exactly the same way that if you neglect your physical health you're not going to perform at your best in a race or a weightlifting competition you have to maintain a certain level of competence this is something that I understood without really knowing it at school and something which I've rediscovered during my PhD but you remind a graduate I just threw it out of the window so if I was to go back I would set up a time table and fence off slots for time off and doing extracurriculars I commit to doing some music doing some sport spending time and socializing with friends and ring-fence time that is for me this actually sounds an awful lot like advice I was given at the time and I just ignored taking these two most recent tips together though I would absolutely create a schedule and stick to it I would have a large number of working hours during the day but also ring-fence time for doing other things it genuinely makes me angry to be saying this now because I heard this advice letters chose to ignore it at the time and I can see in retrospect how wrong I was so if you're a current undergraduate if you're going to do undergraduate soon-hee disappoint me the same mistakes I did tip number four find a study group I would estimate that I spent about 90% of my time during my undergraduate on my own like entirely on my own obviously I went to lectures and you know you'd seen the same people all the time we develop a couple of sort of friends from that group and maybe sit with them although I think I did actually quite frequently set on my own at Oxford you have tutorials also doing tutorials which are two or maybe three students with one academic same students every time so you sort of get to spend time with them and then you also have lab work for some of the year so you're gonna have a lab partner where you do experiments for a couple of hours a week but the rest of the time I was always on my own I was always in the library working on my own always been a bit of a lone wolf I already mentioned that during my undergraduate I had this mental image of me being at the bottom of the academic ladder I came in as the worst student on my course and I had to work my way to the top and another part of that mental image was that I have to climb alone I had to work out how to do absolutely everything on my own and derive as much from basic principles as I possibly could without any help from others I think in part that's a laudable attitude and I think it is important for physicists to be able to derive pretty much anything from first principles but that doesn't mean that you should have to learn it on your own one of my favorite TV shows of all time is community by Dan Harmon and I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that it is just so different from my educational experience I have never really been part of a study group the one time that I was in anything approaching a study group was a disparate group of students in my fourth year who revised together and Calvin Dan and cherry if you're watching this those hours that we spent revising together in those rooms are some of my most precious memories from Oxford though there's some of my favorite some of the very few happy memories I have I look back on revising with a group of people and chatting and being social and making studying something which I could enjoy and I just wish that I'd done it with from day one rather than waiting as of the fourth year of my degree those of you familiar with the Oxbridge system may be thinking well and there were other people on your course in your college you know why weren't you working with them and in some cases I think that works right in our College we were just quite different people we didn't really gel as a group we didn't get on very well so it didn't work out it happens but my failure here was to sort of give up for him there was a whole university there are 200 people in my year at least to begin with before we lost like a third and first year at least a hundred people doing my degree in my year that I could have reached out to that probably suffering from the same problems of isolation and loneliness I did attempt to set up something in my fourth year again which was called the we suck at theoretical physics club but it turned out that a bunch of the people in it didn't really suck at theoretical physics and we never met up if I was to go back to the start of my undergraduate I would 100% be more social and try and get to know other people on my course and get a study group together and get people to share the load of province shoes so we can teach each other and revise together it would have made me feel like I wasn't so completely alone and so completely crushed by the academic pressure I'm not saying that I would go back and try and make my university experience like the study group in community and know a shortcut the Turkish district just having people to share the load with would have been a massive help for my mental health then lastly tip number five using external resources when I was studying a given module in my undergraduate of course I would use the lecture notes I would go through the problem sheets which were set by the tutors I would refer to cause textbook or textbooks if there was more than one but that was pretty much it now the funny thing is I did best in my third year when I actually expanded this a little bit as well as looking through my courses notes I'm looking through the course textbooks I would actually take notes from textbooks that were a little further afield that weren't recommended but that were in the college library or taking notes from online resources I did the best in that year for just some reason I can't quite put my finger on when you're learning and creating your own set of notes your learning is greater than the sum of its parts the more components you add to it the more perspectives that you can throw on a particular object the better you will understand that object there are hundreds of physics degrees going on around the world and some of them have great resources that are available online but beyond that there's also MOOCs there are also course textbooks that your lecturers might not be recommending there are so many resources that you can use to supplement your learning and I just I didn't do enough of that and when I did do it I did much better so if I was to redo my undergrad from the beginning from the very first day I would start finding resources from other universities reading other courses notes and whilst you know bear in mind what I said before about not just working after after it's trying to work smart it's trying to work in a way that uses all the resources your disposal to maximize your grade at the end perhaps I was victims of this idea that no I should be smart enough to understand whatever is put in front of me I should be able to work this out you don't have to make life hard for yourself the degree is hard enough on its own use the resources that are available to you from outside of your subscription thank you for watching this video this one has been quite cathartic to film and I hope that my ramblings and reflections have been at least vaguely instructive and useful to some of you if you would have done things differently in your undergraduate than do pop your recommendations in the comment section below I'm going to be really addressed to read these of course thank you for watching the video pop in to like if you enjoyed it subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in the next one
