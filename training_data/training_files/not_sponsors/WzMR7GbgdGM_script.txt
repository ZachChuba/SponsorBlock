hello this is chef john from food wishes
, with fried mozzarella puffs that's right people love bumpy food especially
when it's also crispy and produced by frying cheese which is exactly what we
have here as I'm attempting to update and sophisticate the good old-fashioned
fried mozzarella stick and not only are these tastier more interesting and more
fun to eat they're also much easier and don't require any breading so with that
let's go ahead get started by making a very very simple pastry dough which
we'll start by adding a little bit of butter to this pan along with some cold
fresh water and what looks like a lot of salt but it's not since we're gonna be
working with mozzarella which tends to be a little bit bland and what we're
gonna do here is set our heat to medium-high and as soon as the water
starts to simmer in that butter melts or almost melts we'll go ahead and dump in
our flour all at once reduce our heat to medium and stir that in with a small
spatula or wooden spoon freakishly small or otherwise and it's not gonna look
like things are going well when first start but don't worry just keep
mixing and stirring and smearing and eventually all the flour lumps are gonna
disappear and it will all eventually pull together and smooth out at which
point all we have to do is cook it stirring for about 2 or 3 minutes and as
we do this that dough's gonna kind of want to stick to the bottom but because
of the moisture in the dough as we kind of stir in scrape it's also gonna not
want to stick to the bottom okay so basically the dough doesn't know what it
wants to do but anyway like I said we will cook that for two or three minutes
scraping and rubbing that pan as clean as we can and then what we'll do once
that's been accomplished is quickly remove that from the heat and transfer
it into a mixing bowl where we will let it cool for about five to 10 minutes and
to help that process it's always a good idea to kind of spread it out and really
all we're waiting for is for this mixture to go from very very hot to just
very warm which if I had to guess is going to take between five and ten
minutes and then what we'll do once this is cooled a bit is season it up with
some freshly ground black pepper along with the obligatory sheikha
cayenne and then we will add one large egg from
a distance of about three feet so that the yolk breaks when it hits and by the
way that last instruction actually serves no practical purpose it's just
something fun to do and then to finish this what we'll do is take a whisk and
mix this until it all comes together to form a very soft very very sticky dough
and fair warning when first start doing this it's gonna look like
something went tragically and horribly wrong
but don't worry just keep mixing and eventually it will all come together
literally come all together as in it will all come together stuck inside your
whisk and that's how you're gonna know it's done and then once that happens
we'll take a spatula and clean off our whisk into the bowl which is by far the
hardest part of this whole recipe and it is a lot faster if kind of bang the
whisk on the bowl but then you'll probably have little pieces of dough
stuck to your wall and ceiling so I'm just gonna go with the spatula so we
will clean off our whisk and then give that one last mix with the spatula to
make sure everything's beautifully smooth and then what's gonna happen next
once we have that all together in one lump and we've scraped down the sides of
our bowl the best we can is we're gonna cover this in plastic and refrigerator
for about an hour before we add our cheese which is why we'll wrap it with
the spatula and while that's chilling we can go ahead and make our marinara sauce
dip which is simply going to be some prepared marinara sauce that we will
accessorize with the following ingredients some dry oregano some red
pepper flakes if want it spicy which we do we will also do a little splash of
balsamic vinegar and then last but not least one anchovy fillet or as we call
it around the office Italian msg and then what we'll do is go ahead and give
this a stir and we will bring this up to a simmer on medium heat and that is
pretty much gonna be it other than giving it a stir or two we'll just let
that simmer for about 10 minutes and then we can turn it off and just keep it
in a warm spot until we're ready to use it and it is kind of nice if the sauce
is served warm but room temperature is totally fine okay so our sauce is done
and then assuming our dough is chilled we'll go ahead and pull that out and we
will finish this off by grading in a relatively large amount
of low-moisture mozzarella cheese also known as not the good mozzarella cheese
okay for this recipe to work we really have to use the firmer drier stuff which
means that beautiful fresh creamy mozzarella is not going to work here and
by not work I mean explode in the oil so this time we're gonna let buy the
cheap stuff and for heaven's sake grate it yourself
okay cellulose dust is not on the ingredient list so we'll go ahead and
grate that in and give it a mix with the spatula
and what's kind of funny here is we're adding so much cheese this recipe
actually shouldn't work but somehow it does and then once we're sure that's
been mixed in and distributed evenly we'll scrape our spatula down with a
spoon and then grab a second spoon since that's how I like to get this dough into
the oil okay so we'll take some with one spoon and then if we want we can kind of
shape it with the other into sort of an oval shape which by the way is
completely optional since it's been my experience no matter how carefully you
shape these they all kind of look the same once they're fried which I will
prove later and then what we'll do once we have the amount in shape we want this
carefully transfer that into some 350-degree oil which by the way mine
wasn't I was inpatient and it probably was just
over 300 and the problem with that especially if you're trying to get away
with just a couple inches of oil is that it can and will stick to the bottom
although it usually will release easily with a little nudge
but anyway what we'll do is fry that for about two or three minutes or until
browned and crispy and for this test I'm just doing one but can easily do
four or five or six at a time and other than going by the appearance one way you
can tell these are done is that you'll see little tiny pieces of mozzarella
poking up through the surface which I was trying to show by flipping this
over but it wasn't working okay you're gonna kind of see it here as I lift it
out and that's it will just drain that for a minute on a napkin or paper towel
at which point it's ready to enjoy and if these are still hot or even warm when
break it in half and pull it apart you're gonna get that super sexy string
cheese effect which everybody loves especially the kids and crispy texture
and stretchy visuals aside these things taste like a beautifully creamy hunk of
warm melty mozzarella cheese so other than the oil temp
that was my very successful test and I
proceeded to fry for more intentionally not spending any time shaping them okay
I'm pretty much just scooping some of the dough and pushing it off with the
other spoon and other than making sure your oils at the right temp the other
thing to be careful of is not to drop these on top of each other okay after a
few seconds that surface will seal and you'll be fine but when drop another
one in make sure there's not one right under it and like I said earlier we'll
fry these for about two to three minutes and of course the exact times gonna
depend on how much dough spooned in so you'll have to observe and adjust I
mean guys are probably Jimmy Gees of how long to fry your cheese but about
three minutes is a good guess or just fry them until they look a little
something like this and of course is the one frying any little random bits of
rogue dough that fall into the oil are allowed to eat mmm
micro puffs and as can hopefully see even if don't shape these they still
come out looking quite nice and very very enticing although for comparison
purposes I did fry four more after these taking the time to shape them as
carefully as possible and while they do maybe look a little more uniform those
four in the front do not look that much differently than those four in the back
we fried before these so the point is do not stress trying to get these perfect
going into the oil and then because this is an Italian American appetizer we are
required by law to garnish with a little bit of parsley and that's it these are
now ready to officially enjoy which I would have loved to do right away so the
cheese was still stretchy but I didn't I took way too many pictures so these cool
down and I didn't get the sexy cheese stretch but that's fine even at room
temp these are still amazing especially dipped in that extra flavorful slightly
spicy sauce and even though my brain knew these weren't stretchy my fingers
did not get the message so I kept trying to pull it apart to stretch it but even
though these weren't visually stretchy the insides are still beautifully creamy
and they really do taste like you're eating a piece of crispy fresh
mozzarella cheese although somehow unlike eating a chunk of fried
mozzarella thanks to our French pastry these are actually very very light in
texture hence the name puff oh and I should mention if you're doing
a large amount can reserve the ones fried in a warm oven and they hold
beautifully so something to keep in mind but anyway that's it what we're calling
fried mozzarella puffs if like fried mozzarella sticks but don't enjoy all
that messy breading and associated gunked-up fingers are absolutely
gonna love these which is why I really do hope give them a try soon so
