hey guys masa coax here and welcome to some extra value content and I'm pretty sure that you guys like a little bit of that extra value content but what is this content about exactly and how many times can I say the word content in this opening gambit I mean the answer was for probably three last week I put up a Google Form on my community tab where you can find the latest update about what I'm up to and what one of those things was was what you thought about the state of Dragonball and where it is right now and this was more of like a survey questionnaire about what you guys think not what I think it is because you've heard enough of that already I want to know what the general consensus of my viewer base thinks about Dragon Ball right now because there's a lot of things to think about concerning Dragon Ball I think it's good to share what the collective knowledge and understanding of the franchise is instead of me trying to pluck an idea out of my mind whatever is in there spoiler probably not a lot but before we begin I just thought I'd of what you guys think of Dragon Ball and don't think this is some kind of ad-hoc spur-of-the-moment thing this was prepared I have a tablet ready and everything to make myself look all professional and stuff like that and British and erudite and endearing I am a professional also I say but that doesn't matter what matters is your responses to the questions that I put out for you and I had over 660 responses that's quite a lot in the space of a week I'm not actually very interesting to see what the reaction is all the video comes on after the video comes out so I'll leave the link to this forum in the description but anyway the first question I put to you was would you still consider yourself a Dragon Ball fan actually a whopping 86% of you say that yeah you'd still consider yourself a Dragon Ball fan well that's great that Dragon Ball is still engaging enough for you to still call yourself one and that everything is going relatively smoothly but the more interesting one is that it's actually pretty big contingent of you that say yes you are but you are slowly losing interest why is that well there are multiple reasons why there is just no mention about the show's future the manga is trickling along that's all very well and good but not everybody actually has access or wants to read the manga right now they wait until the binded volumes come out and that's what I do and the span between each volume it could be like months hey it's just like an hour an hour episode am i right and then three percent of you said that you wouldn't call yourself a Dragon Ball fan but you don't mind watching the series which it's actually quite interesting that a you would give Dragon Ball would go and actually you're even here so if you're here just for me or just for everything else here then thank you I'm I appreciate it now the next question was okay you may call yourself a fan or maybe a fan but out of all the multi episode series so this is the one where it's like a long-running one which one of those was your favorite and okay I don't think you need to know the answer you probably already do 65% of you said yes Dragon Ball Z is your favorite that is to be expected but what was interesting is that nearly 20% of you a fifth of you said that Dragon Ball super was your favorite multi episode series there's a lot of blowback that super has and the fact that it's actually made a positive impact that nearly a fifth of you out there would consider yourself a Dragon Ball super fan over a Dragonball Z fan or you just prefer that serious disease you know is testimony to the improvement that the series had so whatever they were doing that actually ended up with what we got at the end of Super of course Dragon Ball super burly it means that they were doing something right 11% of you said that Dragon Ball was your favorite series the original one and okay that's pretty cool because everybody needs to see the original Dragon Ball series so that's good you're looking back to the show's heritage good on you and I really do appreciate that and okay there is of course Dragon Ball GT about three percent of you or 20 out of the six hundred and sixty-three respondents actually said that GT was their favorite and I don't know whether that was people making fun of it or whether they actually genuinely thought GT was very good the stories have potential but again the way it was carried out less so there were people out there that did say that super Dragon Ball Heroes was their favorite about seven of you out of everything that's been going on what do people think about the short term medium term future dragon bully 2020 slash 2021 what's it gonna be and 65 percent of you thought a continuation of Dragon Ball super on TV would be the thing that would tickle your fantasy that's nearly two thirds of you would just go yes we just like a new series please and I am in total agreement with you having an episode out every single week on multiple platforms keeps things in the public knowledge and yes you have a movie that can generate hype but that can you know that can go into the background for a long time before suddenly getting a new trailer and then it goes are up for a while and then it just goes back down again it's peaks and troughs for a movie or as a TV series you just have to wait a few days and you get the next one it's always in your area of awareness people did want a movie and this was broken into two like opinions this is really interesting and this is something that surprised me twenty-two percent of you said that they will prefer a sequel specifically to broli but only nine percent of you actually wanted to have the moral arc represented in a movie and that's really interesting because the moral arc at the moment from what we see is a really massive tour de force for the series and yeah all I can say is that I'm Daanish about the difference but at the same time I'm not because it's Broly so the another one was just the games will suffice and that one was a much smaller affair with just 20 or 3% of you saying that okay it's fine we don't need a series just the video games will do yeah that's a very small one and then there's about 1% that says nothing you don't need to do anything the series is done yes it's a very long running series and I understand why some people might think that's enough but at the same time harsh now this next one really really took me for a loop because I asked people to rate out of 10 what they thought Dragon Ball super was now that this first stint or whatever we get is done 34 percent of you so over a third of you said that they would rate Dragon Ball super at least a 7 out of 10 now for me a 7 out of 10 would be rated as good and then 28 percent of you actually said that it was very good an 8 out of 10 so the vast majority of people that responded to this said that they would rate at least Dragon Ball super as a good and that's not too bad given the fact that nostalgia is so powerful with Dragon Ball Z that Dragon Ball super has made an impact and it's been pretty good and meaningful much more so than GT and that came right after Z 13% would still Rea be the 6 out of 10 and then after that you get like 7% for 5 out of 10 but they're minuscule in fab 4 percent if you were actually given a 10 out of 10 the mood is positive we're super and that's great and then I just thought well super Dragon Ball heroes is a thing how people rate that and yeah this one's more of just like a traditional curve and the mean of this is about 5 out of 10 so people think it's okay yes there has been an upward trend with the latest episodes you know actually super Dragon Ball heroes being taken seriously and people realize and go oh yeah people are actually watching this okay let's put some more resources into it the spike is mainly on the positive side some sixes and sevens more but you know there are a lot of people that do rate it as a one three percent if you said one out of ten and I can understand why in fact I can understand why this is kind of a confusing subject that there are lots of people out there that just don't know what to think that's fair but there you go super Dragon Ball heroes have made some kind of impact now this question I wanted to ask was what do people think about the way that Dragon Ball is being handled by TOWIE are they treating it well are they doing this very big franchise justice again this is something that's really kind of making me think well okay it's not as clear-cut as I thought it was 68% of you right here would say toe animation handling Dragon Ball well sort of and I can understand why that might be there really should have been an announcement for the series if they're going to do one a couple of months ago and it should have actually been coming out roundabout now but you know with one piece Stampede becoming a thing things have been delayed on whatever or maybe it's not happening at all because to--a just don't know what to do with it they're focusing on one piece they're focusing on other things it's very confusing and it's leaving Dragon Ball fans thinking well okay what's gonna happen with the show because Dragon will supers a thing the games are doing really good fighters has been an absolute sensation and super Dragon Ball Heroes itself is not the worst thing out there yeah what's going on yeah it's just people are being left too confused nine percent of you say not really so yeah that's a bit of like a no you're not doing this right because for an average show okay there is a bit of a break but this is Dragon Ball Pier so there are some people that think well you're not doing it justice but at the same time there are about a fifth of you that say yeah toe is handling it just one okay that's perfectly fair but I think that that could rise in the coming weeks that people will start to think then not being sure about it the next question was when was the last time that you made a draggable related purchase that wasn't an in-app purchase within dokkan battle all legends or something like that this one was pretty much you know really kind of evenly spread so I won't spend too much time on this but the biggest contingent but only just was that the last purchaser anybody made Dragon Ball related it was about three to six months ago with more than a year ago just behind that pretty much inconclusive it really depends where you are so fair enough thank you very much for responding all the same now my focus moved on to the games because the games are a very big part of the Dragon Ball fandom out of the people that would have played a dragon ball game at least a couple of times a month more people were playing Dragon Ball fusions than Dragon Ball heroes world mission so Nintendo please port fusions to the switch because there's your answer right here fusions is a very good game if you still have a 3ds I would suggest going and finding a copy of fusions it's such a good and refreshing game and another surprise right here was that Dragon Ball legends it's only been out for a year it's almost got as many people playing it as dokkan battle which has been around for four years or so it's not taken that long for legends to catch up and with more content coming out for it all the time I can see that legends would overtake dokkan battle in terms of being the more popular mobile game xenoverse 1 & 2 yeah of course but it's close between them fighters I suppose is that competitive element that brings fighters up there but again xenoverse has been around for four years or so fighters has only been around for 18 months so that immediacy that quick rapid rise to the top fighters will overtake xenoverse unless there's a xenoverse 3 and then of course as Dragon Ball Z Kakarot you know this could skew this even further but the next question is related to Kakarot and lots of people were actually giving their opinion about it half of you exactly half of you are thinking about buying the game there's still more information coming up for it now including more playable characters it's not just about Goku you can play as Vegeta I think as well as piccolo 32% say they will buy the game 17% mm probably not and I can understand why it's an RPG is not your typical fighting game for like fighters or something like that it's something that will require a little bit more information and a bit more gameplay about it yeah Bandai if you do a demo of Kakarot I think more people will be more convinced to buy the game so the last one here is a little bit self-indulgent in terms of my content what do you watch the most I appreciate this that 35% people say all the videos so thank you very much for responding there so there we go there are the pie charts for the state of Dragonball and what the overall opinion is is that Dragon Ball super has made a good impact Broly has made an even better impact we all want a brand new series to come out at least the vast majority 2/3 of you want one and on the whole super Dragon Ball heroes isn't the worst thing out there and Joey you really need to step up what you're doing was super that's the collective thought of you guys out there so again if you want to actually add your thoughts to the forum then the link is down below in the description and it's a pinned comment thank you so much for giving your input to this question and I hope to do more of these because having a Google forum is really really fascinating it's a really good way to have a long-term focus on what things are like about Dragon Balls so thank you so much for your time and I hope you having a good day until the next one be sure to LIKE and subscribe and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
