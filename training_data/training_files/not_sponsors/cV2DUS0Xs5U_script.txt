do you remember that feeling of being new in rust you normally spawn on that beach by yourself the hardships the struggles we've all been through it that is until someone with a little more experience opens your mind and suddenly you see rust in a different light the adrenaline you capture when you make your first players like meth amphetamines and you're forever chasing that dragon well i'm goldilocks's drug dealer and my goal was to make him a regular customer his editing goes above and beyond most youtubers in this community myself included but his gameplay needs a little refining i guess he could consider this like a drug-fueled retreat we were going into the wilderness master and apprentice to free his mind from the crushing pressure of learning the way of this brutal island and if he didn't come out of it with a full belly and wearing a chinchilla coat he might never progress beyond the beaches when it's just him on his lonesome this is a true underdog story and i get to live that fresh feeling of rust through lockheed we all do [Music] oh yeah i was looking the opposite direction i was like looking at the other horse there we go that's better first things first we needed to get a base down you couldn't sleep under the stars in the wilderness you needed a roof over your head and some walls around you to keep the predators here so um tell you something genius i like to do grab food and actually forget to eat it oh really oh my god i forgot to eat you gave it to god take it over your life yeah i think it's a bush that's abortion it's delirious eat those pumpkins dude that compound is like touching that facility yeah i don't know how they got it to get that close oh yeah did i mention that we have a custom monument on the last week of every four swipe they're made by loan his links will be in the description this week we had the medical facility so it's not touching it but it's like yeah like really 20 meters away from it yeah jerusalem the [ __ ] i'm saying like a 20-story tower made of wood [Music] nice now that our base was down we had to farm some cacti for bags and bows and then it was time to head on over to the medical facility just to have a quick geez of what it was all about this looks cool [Music] get in the air vents okay oh i didn't even see that this is some perfect dark [ __ ] some splinter cell that's me coming up just saying all right i'm on the roof oh there is a box hey salvaged pick oh [ __ ] score straight off the bat um there's some barrels and stuff too i'll grab the comps oh i see the fuse area oh have you got a oh actually we need a card oh i see boxes i think when i saw the medical yeah that was medical yeah all right doesn't seem to be anything else all right let's move on then oh okay that compound is active and here comes that's just a naked don't worry we could go to um outpost and recycle whatever we need yep and then get scrap that way oh sorry low grade that way with the scrap mm-hmm i got 18 logo just from that thing so let's start we need about 150. um i've got a crossy as well nice i can't even see what's up sloppy joe he's got naked in his back parkour parkour all right good enough oh you got the uh spare tools mate i have clothes oh sick thanks you're a legend you're a legend i was like dude is that my [ __ ] logo over there and i was like nah and then i had to double take my logo's over there yeah i saw that the other day how cool is that what the [ __ ] how neat that's a screenshot right there all right um how much scrap do you have uh 65. can i have it please sure thing thanks how many metal frames did you end up getting 260. can i have it i've got five high coil uh i guess i can stack it to clear up some room for you i'm gonna go to the norse hatchet fancy now the fun part running back running back past that big compound you know about not hitting the shiny part first right i do now okay hit the non-shiny part once hit once and then hit the rest on the shiny and it goes like i missed that goes way quicker ah alrighty damn dude you went [ __ ] back to your scottish roots just then all righty while i was out getting nodes lockheed hit up the roads and got some components but everyone was pillaging them there was just like nothing there so i said lucky we live on the ocean let's go out on the ocean what a good compass yep oh we have 556 high voltage high velocity high voltage ah it stinks we came back rich with ocean loot might i just say that that ocean loot is very underrated especially the large boxes you get from diving but anyway we came back with so much we had enough to do our tier 2 and we could also erect our furnace base [Music] but like any sign of progression it never goes unnoticed by the local clans there was a scout in our midst um yeah custom oh man i had a bow and nine arrows and i shot one of him this little [ __ ] had gotten a taste for blood and now he wanted to camp us he wanted to camp us our base now you have to deal with this [ __ ] head-on i hit him really hard i might have even killed him uh hit him once yeah oh no he's still up you're alive or dead alive oh i jumped down he's just outside the doorway [Music] nice just like that we gained an mp5 and it hasn't with the vermin now exterminated we were now free to use the tools that we'd been crafting up that whole time we'd been getting camped satchels all right can we go for this one all right five satchels do yours as well so i might as well sorry yep i'll get back dude heal up if you have one spare satchel still yep oh is that a thing they go out head shot him i think he's still up oh i'm down at full dead gear up come back i was just i've got a bag halfway i'm just gonna run over to myself watch your head bro yeah i'm just gonna peek to the left just to get my side all right might be making a run it looked like it kind of went down no i got bolted that base is loaded all right okay oh [ __ ] it up that's a rip bro there's nothing we can do about that except maybe turn on that old youtuber charm hey you don't really need a new guy's raid do you guys there's heaps here hey come on boys fresh spawn we just started decide we raided two by two counting yeah you [ __ ] [ __ ] sucker he's like hey we're just countering a raid and shot me in the face with an ak ah they didn't want none of it the [ __ ] all right we're getting counter-rated and [ __ ] and it was the guy who door camped us and his clan so i took the movie 300 as an inspiration and used their numbers against them it was time to set up the funnel come trap [Music] [Music] idiot a little bit like i won't be upset if we die but if we make a play bread [ __ ] did it kill you yep full dead i got gruff killed another all right i'm just gonna run back without anything there's more though all right he was naked as well yeah that was smart of it actually yeah that was a good idea is that just another explosion so [Music] out it was one guy on the roof but there's so many of them bro yeah man those little [ __ ] it was just one left one we were free free ah luck had not been kind to us today so far hopefully at the start of the next video that would all change because we were about to move we're about to head down south just us with a couple of sars couple tools and in our path a couple ak guys one with a rocket launcher in fact but sorry
