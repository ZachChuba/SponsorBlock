India which is in its shape quadrilateral has its Eastern as well as its western side bounded by the Great Sea but on the northern side is divided by Mount Hema Dawa and that part of Sathya which is inhabited by the recipients who were called the Sakai while the fourth or western side is bounded by the river called the Indus which is perhaps the largest of all the rivers in the world after the Nile the extent of the whole country from east to west is said to be twenty-eight thousand stadia and from north to south 32,000 being thus of such a vast extent it seems well nigh to embrace the whole of the northern tropic zone of the earth and in fact at the extreme point of India the son died or may frequently be observed to cast no shadow while the constellation of the bear is by night invisible consequently with this is also stated that shadows there fall to the southward it is said that India being of enormous size when taken as a whole is peopled by races both numerous and diverse which not even one was originally of foreign descent but all were evidently indigenous and moreover the India neither received a colony from abroad nor sent out a colony to any other nation the legends further inform us that in primitive times the inhabitants subsisted on such fruits as the earth yielded spontaneously as was the case with the Greeks and that in like manner as with them the arts and other appliances which improve human life were gradually invented the whole population of India is divided into seven castes of which the first is formed by the collective body of the philosophers which in point of number is inferior to the other classes but in point of dignity preeminent overall for the philosophers being exempted from all public duties are neither the Masters nor the servants of others they are however engaged by private persons to offer the sacrifices due in lifetime and to celebrate the obsequies of the dead for they are believed to be the most dear to the gods and to be the most conversant with matters pertaining to Hades in requital of such services they receive valuable gifts and privileges to the people of India at large they also render great benefits when gathered together at the beginning of the year they forewarn the assembled multitude about droughts and wet weather and also about propitious winds and diseases and other topics capable of profiting the Haris the philosopher who errs in his predictions incurs no other penalty but silence this video has been made possible by the great two courses plus the online learning resource the

description to start your free trial now thanks the second cast consists of the husband's men who appear to be far more numerous than the others being moreover exempted from the fighting and other public services they devote the whole of their time to tillage nor was an enemy coming upon a husband man at work on his land to do him any harm for men of this class being regarded as public benefactors are protected from all injury the land thus remaining unraveled and producing heavy crops supplies the inhabitants with all that is requisite to make life very enjoyable the husbandmen themselves with their wives and children live in the country and entirely avoid going to town they pay a land tribute to the king because all India is the property of the crown and no private person is permitted to own land the third cast consists of these shepherds and in general of all herdsmen who neither settle in towns or in villages but live in tents by hunting and trapping they clear the country of noxious birds and wild beasts as they apply themselves eagerly and assiduously to this pursuit they free India from the pests with which it abounds all sorts of wild beasts and birds which devour the seeds sown by the husbandmen the forth cast consists of the artisans of these some are Armorer's while others make the implements which husbandmen and others find useful in their different callings this class is not only exempted from paying taxes but even receives maintenance from the Royal Exchange and gives itself up to idleness and amusement in times of peace the entire force men-at-arms war horses war elephants and all are maintained at the Kings expense the sixth cast consists of the overseers it is their province to inquire into and superintend all that goes on in India and make report to the king or where there is not a king to the magistrates these seventh cast consists of the councillors and Assessors it is the smallest cast looking to number but it is the most respected on account of the high character and wisdom of its members for from their ranks the advisors of the King are taken and the treasurer's of the state and the arbiters who settle disputes the generals of the army also and the chief magistrates usually belong to this class such then or about the parts into which the body politic in India is divided no one is allowed to marry out of his own caste or to exercise any calling or art except his own for instance a soldier cannot become a husband man or an artisan a philosopher among the Indians officers are appointed even for foreigners whose duty is to see that no foreigner is wronged should any of them lose his health they sent physicians to attend him and take care of him otherwise and if he dies they bury him and deliver over such property as he leaves to his relatives the judges also decide cases in which foreigners are concerned with the greatest care and come down sharply on those who take unfair advantage of them India as many huge mountains which abound in fruit trees of every kind and many vast plains of great fertility more or less beautiful but all alike intersected by a multitude of rivers the greater part of the soil moreover is under irrigation and consequently there's two crops in the course of the year it teams at the same time with animals of all sorts beasts of the field and fowls of the air of all different degrees of strength and size there are monkeys rollers of rocks which climb precipices whence they roll down stones upon their pursuers it is also said that there exists in India a one horned animal cooled by the natives the Carters on it is over the size of a full-grown horse and has a crest and yellow hair soft as wool it is furnished with very good legs and is very fleet its legs are jointless and formed like those of the elephant and it has a tail like a swine's a horn sprouts out from between its eyebrows and this is not straight but curved into the most natural reeds and is of a black color it is said to be extremely sharp this horn the animal as I learned has a voice beyond all example loud ringing and dissonant it allows other animals to approach it and is good-natured towards them it is prolific besides in elephants which are of monstrous bulk as its soil supplies food in unsparing profusion making these animals far exceeding in strength than those that have bred in Libya it results also that since they are caught in great numbers by the Indians and trained for war they are of great moment in turning the scale of victory the inhabitants in like manner having abundant means of subsistence exceed in consequence the ordinary stature and are distinguished by their proud bearing they're also found to be well skilled in the arts as might be expected of men who inhale a pure air and drink the very finest water and while the soil bears on its surface all kinds of fruits which are known to cultivation it has also underground numerous veins of all sorts of metals for it contains much gold and silver and copper and iron in no small quantity and even tin and other metals which are employed in making articles of use and ornament as well as the implements and accoutrements of war the Indians all live frugally especially when in camp they dislike a great undisciplined multitude and consequently they observe good order theft is of a very rare occurrence megasthenes says that those who were in the camp of sand ricotta's wherein lay four hundred thousand men found that the thefts reported on any one day did not exceed the value of two hundred two drachma and this among a people who have no written laws but are ignorant of writing and must therefore in all business of life trust to memory they live never less happily enough being simple in their manners and frugal they never drink wine except at sacrifices their beverage is a liqueur composed from rice instead of barley and their food is principally a rice pottage the simplicity of their laws and their contracts is proved by the fact that they seldom go to law they have no suits about pledges or deposits nor do they require either seals or witnesses but make their deposits and confide in each other the houses and property they generally leave unguarded these things indicate that they possess good sober sense but other things they do which one cannot approve for instance they always eat alone and that they have no fixed hours when meals are to be taken by all in common but each one eats when he feels inclined the contrary custom would be better for the ends of social and civil life their favourite mode of exercising the body is by friction applied in various ways but especially by passing smooth evany rollers over the skin their tools are plain and the mounds raised over the dead lowly in contrast to the general simplicity of their style they love finery and ornament their robes are worked in gold and ornamented with precious stones and they were also flowered garments made of the finest muslin attendants walking behind hold up umbrellas over them for they have a high regard for beauty and avail themselves of every device to improve their looks truth and virtue they hold alike in esteem hence they Accord no special privileges to the old unless they possess superior wisdom they marry many wives whom they buy from their parents giving in exchange a yoke of oxen some they marry hoping to find in them willing help mates and others for pleasure and to fill their houses with children the wives prostitute themselves unless they are compelled to be chaste no one wears a crown at her sacrifice or libation and they do not stab the victim but strangle it so that nothing is mutilated but only what is in Tyre may be presented to the deity the King departs for the chase in back an alien fashion crowds of women surround him and outside this circle sphere man arranged the road is marked off with ropes and it is death for man and woman alike to pass within the ropes men with drums and gongs lead the procession the King hunts in the enclosures and shoots arrows from a platform at his side stand two or three armed women if he hunts in the open grounds he shoots from the back of an elephant of the women some are in chariots some are on horses and some even on elephants and they are equipped with weapons of every kind as if they are going on a campaign these customs are very strange when compared with our own but the following are still more so forma Gaston ease states that the tribes inhabiting the Caucasus have intercourse with women in public and eat the bodies of their relatives but deviating into fables who says there are men five spans and even three spans in height some of whom want to the nose having only two orifices above the mouth through which they breathe according to megasthenes on a mountain called new low their live men whose feet to turned backward and who have eight toes on each foot while on many of the mountains there lives a race of men having heads like those of dogs who are clothed with the skin of wild beasts whose speeches barking and who being armed with claws lived by hunting and fouling he speaks also of a race living on the very confines of India on the east near the source of the Ganges the astone me who have no mouth who cover the body which is all over hairy with the soft down found upon the leaves of trees and who live merely by breathing and the perfume inhaled by the nostrils they eat nothing and they drink nothing they require merely a variety of odors of roots and flowers and of wild apples
