okay well I think you might be single I've been married for three years she targeted me right away she said you are not married I was like of course it is how long have you guys been married quick everybody oh my god I've been married what years just two years like last week really one year I was married this past May so like four months see I say 50 but if it was like 50 but does everyone believe that does everyone believe in traditional marriage okay the system well wedding rings all that stuff yeah yeah everybody yes or no the first thing you have to do is detail put your hands out let's here we're just two your bands I thought he was a little too obvious he was all over everybody I'm Bruce really specific I want to know details quick if you're waiting okay he's got one I've got one okay does anyone does everyone have their tan because if you're married you've got you've got a tan lines I have a crazy tan line I have a white band around my ring finger I thought instead of that you tell you the day you go oh hold on hold on I like the Rick he asked you questions he was putting important people on blast it was quick it was too quick it was a good round to observe the others one suggestion was made and then there was 15 seconds left I personally pounced on it cuz I was grateful that it wasn't me good luck very very married what day were you married cuz I got married October 11 which is my birthday oh really yeah birthday August 17th is actually three on our three-year anniversary Oh wonderful me and you I got one question for you now stop no I'm asking you that question okay what what amber its 2003 now okay yeah November 7th 2000 okay generally 28th 2017 okay 19 18 not that anyone asked how long were you married uh let me see it'll be 30 years 30 years what did you say before this exactly I was joking with exactly what I caught to you what was something that went wrong in your guys's wedding we had all white wedding everybody wore white and one lady came in purple and that would piss me off I believe that she was not invited my best friend was late to my wedding and that kind of pissed me off because I noticed when he were totally well I have to say there nothing went wrong ya know we were married in our home yeah and it just it went so smoothly it had me I was actually crying let's let's look at detail here pay attention to detail not just the questions look at detail reactions look it's uh Mike I'm here to win so I want I want to make sure everyone you're the lawyer of all people a lot of manipulation I do class actions plaintiff side guys maybe it's the guy with a fanny pack and all these props thank you very much and always remember the obvious is always your worst enemy if you don't pay attention to detail always remember that it's about illumination at the right time and it just it ran out for me I felt like we got the wrong guy out I was like we still have candies in here there's something about candies I come from that institution so we don't believe in divorce you know we don't divorce our husbands we bury them that's what my mother said Candace was you know she was out there how old is your significant other my husband is 35 and you are I'm 55 okay what's up like a small detail about your wife that you love that differs her from your others and my aunt's first thing that I saw were her legs even it might be so you asked the first thing and I'm telling you all your other wives legs yeah and and she was no no yes let me tell you and that's what surprised and everything else worked out fine she said things that we're confusing to me like she said that her husband was 35 but they'd been married for 30 years and so I was like so your husband was five when you married him where you just have to like off the top of your head before we do that can we see the hands again yes yo mine's like yeah you're the only one that doesn't really happen no I don't why don't you worry I never have I don't wear a ring so I figured the best thing to do is of course tell them that maybe that's again why it hasn't worked out too well for me in the past no no I'm on three I think get it covered though if you're the color I have always loved marriage I believe in the institution strongly it would be unfair to face the decision solely on oh you don't have a tan line there's a lot of reasons why someone might not wear a ring okay I'm not gonna lie I'm so suspicious of everyone oh yeah hey you know what's funny if we're gonna talk about who we see but I think you two are suspicious cuz you asking all the questions and asking I'm an attorney like why I'm trying those questions like you asking me all this question but you asking her any questions I think you might be suspicious you like any question you want in the next 47 seconds how does it move one year September and u18 yeah my husband's 27 he's turning 28 on October 11 another cougar huh something off right there so started in a head up he believed in traditional marriage she believed everything about marriage but he never thought about wearing a ring I'm like having no assumption I guess I saw that coming good luck you guys thank you I was like happy to stop there I once all went out because I'm like I think I'm comforting us three and we're gonna split the money so you were captain but he persuade you basic yeah she felt that way and I'm not gonna lie I feel like when I started asking you questions you got really defensive and trying to push back I just figured that I do really think that you are married but how do you stop this I just made this up thank you but that's why I put my head up with I believe in you guys and now you guys related I have much regret about having initiated the vote oh my god you have treated me I'll never trust another woman again I would still just relieved that Ali didn't like jump up and be like just kidding it's me thank God I know towards the end I was like well you can't tell a book by its cover I've been married three times it just didn't quite work out for me and now I'm observing the three-strike rule no more marriages I felt some regret with all of the other people who had been voted out but I also felt pretty good about winning I wanted without the money well you know I really want to have fun I says so let me see if I can do a different kind of strategy maybe lie a little bit mix them in with the truth cuz I figured well maybe I could catch the mole but uh good game really good game Oh that episode just reminded me how single I am but you know maybe
