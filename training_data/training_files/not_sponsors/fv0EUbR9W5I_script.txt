[Music] in the last video i decided enough was enough and i stopped going for the rapier before attempting the inferno with the kraken tentacle in hand it's time to get one of the most iconic items in the game everything is gonna be different and it's been so long i have to melee the nibblers and my oh my god my attack option it's already doomed my attack options what is this timer why is this been here for like two years i hope i have the cape by now if i've been here for so long jesus while my character is spending his the sgs is just going to hard carry me through this inferno like draining strikes would probably be way better for the inferno not gonna lie but having the five specs is pretty damn nice so the waves are like the easiest thing ever with tankar i mean i'm just testing my limits here i'm taking three different things it's not even touching me i don't even have a shield i have a defender that gives negative range defense and i'm just i'm doing fine so okay oh we have to get the bad attempt out of the way right now i can go straight back in make more potions second try here wave 65 which means i've pretty much guaranteed myself a ticket to triple jabs now which i'm gonna be meleeing triple jabs i've never done that before and i have no idea how to do it but i'm just gonna do it how i think i need to do it i just know that i can't get melee that's about all i know but uh it'll be great basically if i get meleed it's like kind of game over oh my god what was that so i didn't realize it spawned so far east my god okay so i literally just have to yeah so if he melees me it'll align its cycle with one of the other jads and i'll be getting hit twice in one attack by two different jazz i really don't want that i'm not gonna be greedy with my hits at all i'm literally just gonna go when i know it's safe not even close first one down well it should be easy from here at least to be very very easy from here and thank god i have those chins to tag the healers otherwise would be really not fun all right triple jab's completed it's time for zuck which uh this is gonna be interesting i actually have to mark my safe tiles trying to figure out what i need to wear for that ranger that spawns on the set because i want to have a combination of good dps and good defense to tank him but also be able to actually kill him so i don't usually have a blowpipe for this it's so easy to kill the ranger in time with a blowpipe but blowpipe makes a huge difference healers are going to be a nightmare without a blowpipe as well this makes things very very interesting hello yad long time no see god i love chins dude so convenient couldn't kill the ranger in one shield cycle and that cost me the run that was it i drank three brews on that ranger i really need to learn how to flick sets i was gonna learn once i start speed running this for the sub 75 task but it might be worth learning now so i just i can't damage the ranger i mean i drink three brews tanking that guy for two shields yeah that's expected though there's room for improvement for sure there's a lot of things i can improve and i can honestly get some better gear now i think i'm gonna make a couple upgrades real quick i'm gonna change some bolts right now so i can go to kriyara later i really would love an armadillo piece like a chest plate or a chain skirt would be so so good for helping out with the consistency of the dps in the meanwhile i really want to go to demonic gorillas that's like where my biggest upgrade lies right now if i could get a zenite that would be big oh my god yes dude that's my upgrade that's my freaking upgrade 12 kills i've done 12 kills that's so spoon fed even for boosted drop rates oh my god there we go 260 taco once again blowing the bank for an onyx 250 points and my life is about to get so much easier in the inferno i'm so excited i don't have cosmic runes apparently and there we go imbued ring of suffering uh this is such a massive upgrade so my current defense bonuses are just about around 200 or so uh and when we equip this ring they all go up to the 220s it's plus 20 defense in all defense stats and it has a plus four prayer bonus which is a huge huge upgrade for a ring slot like that's actually insane for a ring to have those stats and there's the kandra medium diary done and there is the candran hard diary done and i did these for very very good reason not only do i get some amazing lamps for this which i am going to use on prayer in a bit here but the main reason i did that is because the kindred hard diary gives your bolts an extra 10 chance to proc so for that ruby spec that does a hundred damage uh that goes from a six percent chance to proc to now 6.6 so it's going to help a lot on the zuck fight to get more consistent dps that's pretty much all i'm looking for right now and i am now the proud owner of a jewelry box and this is so good it just has so many useful teleports i should have built this so much earlier 84 tiers and that's gonna get me to 60 mining not bad 60 base stats now and two lamps later and we get all the way up to 76 prayer from that that's beautiful dude and there's a quick task and there's another quick task who knew the avantus flail would give five prayer bonus man valid or medium diary done and straight on to prayer getting me 77. that's seven extra levels i have for the inferno now plague city quest done power of life done and already medium diary done straight on to prayer and there's 78. feeling really good about this i got eight extra prey levels i got the ring of suffering now and i brought in more brews this time oh my god oh my god wow holy [ __ ] i was spamming bruce that was such disgusting what was that i'm gonna replay that for you that was actually gross that was like 120 damage through what nearly 400 range defense what well that's healers down but i let them heal zuck so much i had such a late tag on one of them [Music] [Laughter] i just learned a lesson i just learned a lesson the hard way [Music] no my shield can't take it no i could potentially come on tag attack attack it please be humble no no 80 farming 85 farming i should have done this a long time ago honestly i'm going to buy the obsidian shield it's going to be a big help for zuck where i just i've been doing it with no shield so this should help a lot for tanking that ranger i'm also going to use it at criara so hopefully this is the difference hopefully this shield actually uh lets me tank a lot more it should uh i just kind of figured i wouldn't need it because i already have such high range defense but can't hurt to get more done eight crear kills yeah so i'm just gonna see how far i can get with the bolts i have currently and hopefully it's enough to get me an orbital piece 200 armor kc now with only a helmet to show for it armor-wise anyway hoping i get at least one thing before i run out of bolts here well that is a drop god sword shard two welcome to the club my friend well yeah i'm completely out of bolts i am completely out i don't even have bolts for the inferno anymore because i was so stubborn i just used all my bolts i was supposed to save some for the inferno but no one helmet in 241 kc my goodness all right time to make some more bolts and uh back to the inferno we go i guess hey 250 points for slaying an abyssal demon we love to see that uh i'm actually hunting another whip because i've done enough attempts at this point to where my kraken tentacle is i think it's at like 1400 charges which could be enough for one attempt but i really don't want to risk it so um [Music] what excuse me abyssal dagger i take those i i honestly like why would i complain about that that's what like one in 11k with boosted rates yeah hey there we go abyssal whip that's another 10k charges onto my tentacle i'm almost done with my task too came in clutch managed to juggle a clue to completion let's see ah catholics coy we did get the task five uniques from hard clues okay uh unfortunately i have an armadillo helmet the only armadillo item i have so that's completely useless but we take the task i have 417 range defense in this setup if any ranger ever hits me ever again i retire i just i simply retire so if i put the blackhead body on now i actually have way more accuracy and similar range defense to when i didn't have a shield that's pretty cool i'm gonna catch some chins and uh then we go on to another attempt it has to be the next one man it has to be the next one i i've gotten so close so many times i think i've gotten zuck to sub 100 hp twice now so has to be soon has to be soon good fight yad on to the healers we go oh my god dude it's just i can't do anything about it my shield's dead again yep rest in peace oh my what is my brain doing what is my brain doing why did i do that 90 farming and 100 points for checking a mahogany tree as well no oh my god i could have sworn i clicked that i'm just bad at the game i'm just terrible at the game oh my god in my defense on this one there was actually a lot of ping delay i clicked on the right spot at the right time it just didn't move please tell me that's it please tell me yes yes oh i'm free oh my god i did it it's done it is done equip it infertile cape on the league completed first try baby oh oh that feels so good dude i'm so happy i'm so happy i did it after like three maybe even four times that i got sucked to like 150 hp or something oh never want to see this fire cape again in my life please give me the pet sir never lucky oh scythe bandos the inquisitor's infernal cape just pieces it all together so beautifully it's it's a work of art truly a work of art oh i'm so happy i got it done dude i'm so close to having the greatest gear in the game i just need the torture which will take me really not much time at all demonic grills are really quick and then i just need inquisitors hell yeah awesome
