reaction to Jesus is King was roughly comparable to the feeling you get when you open a bottle of milk you thought you bought last week only to find out it's actually a month old upon opening it you discover that the milk smells like Shrek swamp and looks like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that's because the hardest thing for me to realize about the album was that Jesus is King is nothing if not an exercise and thought lesson a teaching moment because let's be honest it's clearly not a cinematic masterpiece the album is small it's a scattered collection of songs and ideas built around one central theme Kanye's career was made by his expansive albums with long songs massive production and strong iconic concepts Jesus is king gives us a small taste of all of that but delivers on none of it it's 27 minutes long with 11 tracks making for an average song length of 2 and a half minutes there's no structure no high art inspiration and no real commentary on the world it's just a bunch of songs but that's not what I'm here to talk about I'm here to talk about the fact that I had no idea if I even liked it or not [Music] you in order to understand what exactly is so confounding about Jesus is king we first have to take a quick look at Kanye's past and I can plead to my t-shirt I'm but none of that matters does it after all one of the most important themes in the Bible is that no one is too broken to be redeemed first Timothy 1:12 through 1:16 illustrates the Lord's grace to Paul a biblical figure whose writing is considered to be one of the most profound influences on Western and Eastern Christian thought I think Jesus Christ our Lord who has given me strength that he considered me trustworthy appointing me to his service even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man I was shown mercy because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief the grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of Who I am the worst but for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me the worst of sinners Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life so I think it's safe to say that Kanye's new viewpoint on life is perfectly legitimate from a religious perspective but when the album first dropped one of the earliest criticisms I saw of it was about Kanye's hypocrisy as a former secular musician turned fundamentalist Christian because Kanye wasn't just any secular musician his music defines the spirit of our century in all of its opulence promiscuity and I mean Kanye wrote an entire album around the idea that his importance in Fame was comparable to that of Jesus Christ himself Kanye's luxurious bombastic art his massive personality it's kind of a summation of our cultural attitudes in the 21st century we are compulsive consumerist we glorify ourselves to the point of widespread narcissism social responsibility is an afterthought that we have to hide in order to avoid being called too sincere its Kanye's world and we've been living in it but Kanye wiped his slate clean in a beautiful and powerful conversion right well not really it looks to the trained eye like Kanye's sudden conversion to Christianity isn't a legitimate show of faith and the power of redemption but rather it's yet another chapter in Kanye's long history of finding different ways to vindicate himself against criticism from other people because Jesus is king easily could have been a powerful commentary but Kanye missed the point entirely and as always made it about himself the one thing a Christian isn't supposed to do according to Matthew 1924 again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God Kanye has spent most of his career coming up with different ways to use his fame to make money you know the gist he sells shoes clothes goes on tour he's one of the richest musicians of all time his potential for giving his potential for meaningful charity is massive because he's not just rich he's also famous it's exactly the sort of person you would want to convert to Christianity Kanye could be outrageously generous and do innumerable good with his power fame and money he could lay down his worldly crown give up his throne and follow in the footsteps of Christ it would set an example that could shake our culture to its core but he didn't and he won't it's a conflict that makes Jesus is king a deeply confusing album Kanye's conversion is loud bombastic and enthusiastic but that's not really even the point that's not what the world needs and it's not what God asks for anyone with a basic knowledge of Scripture could tell you that it doesn't require theological readings or academic study to know that the meek shall inherit the earth that Lazarus was raised into heaven while the rich man suffered eternal torment are you following me not entirely all right get this Kanye in a few days is going to speak and possibly even perform with his choir at the megachurch mega churches are massive churches that preach thousands of people every week but more importantly their sprawling wastelands that remind us of how America has cast out the truth of the Bible in favor of money and Status mega churches are popular in part because they make Christianity more approachable for Americans whose lifestyles have drifted far from biblical ideals but that's a massive problem Christianity is an organized religion with guidelines and rules on how its followers should live it's not something that you conform to your preferences it's something that you study in order to have its truths revealed to you but besides the fact that mega churches preach a pretty lazy somewhat softened version of Christianity to the masses their leaders are even worse they put heavy emphasis on donating large amounts of money to the church they claim millions of dollars per year in income they have boats and mansions and private planes their sermons resemble crappy self-help books more than they do any sort of real theology the Instagram account preachers and sneakers post photos of preachers who have historically been the voice of the poor and disabled and disenfranchised sporting only the most expensive designer shoes and get this Kanye isn't just going to any old mega church he's going to Joel Osteen's mega church joel osteen if you've been lucky enough to avoid his name in your life so far is perhaps the most famous preacher in America today and he's a verified scumbag that co-worker that always gets on your nerves you've been praying for six years for God to move them away you know why they haven't moved they're serving you during the devastating Houston Texas floods in August 2017 Joel Osteen's Church was caught lying that their building had flooded in order to avoid having to shelter victims of the disaster multiple eyewitnesses confirm their lies with pictures and video evidence that the church had not suffered any flooding at all it wasn't until four days after hurricane Harvey made landfall at the Osteen Church which is capable of holding 16 thousand people was finally opened as a shelter but that point the hurricane had already claimed 100 lives and caused one hundred billion dollars in damage Osteen's answer for his actions was silence but what else would you expect from a pastor who owns two mansions that are worth a combined 13 million dollars Osteen like all other mega church pastors is a liar and a thief he leads his congregation astray diluting the Word of God with selfish individualistic ideals for me Kanye's planned appearance at the symbolic death of Christianity in America was the nail in the coffin his conversion contains no religious profundity rather it's another step in the ever-evolving force of ego and profit that is Kanye's personality but Kanye this is what you could have done you could have recognized that Christianity wasn't born as a tool for personal freedom but rather that the message of Christ is one of liberation for the poor and downtrodden you could have drawn parallels between modern black diaspora and the plight of the Israelites in Egypt you could have talked about the fact that we need the story of Christ more than ever right now because Jesus was a far cry from the watered-down corporatized gentrified lamb that most churches portray amass today Jesus was a revolutionary activist he spent his life challenging the status quo he was resistant to materialism an empire and war in the words of Huffington Post writer John Whitehead those living through this present age of militarized police SWAT team raids police shooting of unarmed citizens roadside strip searches and invasive surveillance might feel as if these events are unprecedented the characteristics of a police state and his reasons for being are no different today than they were in Jesus's lifetime control power and money much like the American Empire today the Roman Empire of Jesus day was characterized by secrecy surveillance widespread police presence a citizenry treated like suspects with little recourse against the police state perpetual Wars a military Empire martial law and political retribution against those who dared to challenge the power of the state if Kanye were to capitalize on the idea of Jesus as a revolutionary if he were to draw attention to the issues we face as a country right now by using compelling historical precedents it would change the world the life of Christ culminated in an execution by law enforcement over his right to believe and preach freely just as the lives of so many people today are ended by law enforcement over their right to live freely instead Kanye bought stock in consumeristic American evangelism mentioned owning yacht sailing Range Rover evangelism he supports a presidential administration full of known white supremacists he continues to live a life of high society opulence why because Kanye isn't from the ghetto his mother was a decorated English professor and his father was a Christian counselor Kanye was raised in a suburb where the median home value is more than two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars he was raised in China for years when his mother took a high-paying job teaching English at an exchange program Kanye is successful in part because his parents had the resources to give him a great education and a privileged life because of this Kanye has bought into the dream the dream is an idea I'll take from Tony he see Coates and his book between the world and me the dream is the idea that the American Dream is a literal dream that Americans have chosen to believe in it tells us that anyone can achieve prosperity in America if they work hard enough it tells us that big houses with nice lawns and driveways are the true measures of happiness the dream is tree houses and Cub Scouts and pink polo t-shirts Range Rovers and sailboats and nice clothes the dream is the enemy of progress and virtue it rests on the backs of the poor and downtrodden it was built by black labor and oppression against black people the dream at first subjugated black people it then freed them but only enough for them to survive as societal outcasts and sometimes not even then the dream finally granted black people equal rights under the eyes of the law but the eyes of the law are sometimes prone to seeing a cellphone or a pack of cigarettes not for what they are but instead as a gun things are changing now even though the dream is deeply tied to the ever-changing idea of whiteness not all dreamers are white you can buy a ticket into the American Dream no matter what color you are and that's what Kanye has done cops don't stop black men and mega hats they don't stop black men and Lambo SUVs they don't stop black men on private jets Kayne discard his responsibilities in exchange for a wonderful luxurious and blissful dream and I think he's just one of many people who will continue to trade their heritage for wealth and fame in the coming decades as our society changes the dividing line between Americans will continue to grow but in a different way than it has throughout history it will be a dividing line not of color but of money not of black and white would have haves and have-nots we are advanced society we are selfish jealous and tribal it seems to me like hope for the future is contained within a select view of society's most humble humble in spirit and in status [Music] number of different
