[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel and welcome to another exposed video been a while since I've done one of these and they're actually some of my favorite videos to do as I find people like this to be extremely interesting today I'm gonna be telling you the story of a woman named Tania head but before I get cyber monday deals so Tony ahead was a survivor of the attacks on America on September 11th 2001 there were so many lives lost on that day it's incredibly sad I mean most of us have some type of memory of it or if some people have personal connections to that day because it affected so many people nationwide globally even it was very scary for the world honestly but there are many survivors of 9/11 people who were in the buildings that day that did end up surviving now Tania head had a career in global investment and she worked in the South Tower on the 78th floor and this made her one of only 19 people that survived above the impact point of the plane however her fiance Dave was actually working in the other Tower the North Tower and he was one of the thousands of people to not survive Tania was really injured and I'll get more into that but she still managed to survive which was pretty amazing she managed to get out of the towers before they collapsed a firefighter carried her down and she was then brought to the hospital to be treated for pretty severe burns on her arm but other than the burns on her arm she was pretty much okay and after that she doesn't remember anything she claims that she just woke in the hospital with burns on her arm and news that her husband Dave did not make it I'm saying from the air that's that's what I was doing from the impact I was smelling my own skin burning and I started crawling over people who were burnt from head to toe who were cut up and I was I was trying to help them this was incredibly hard for Tania she said the love of her life her best friend died that day and part of her you know died along with him really and then in 2004 a couple years after the attacks Tania ended up joining the World Trade Center Survivors Network and she ended up putting a ton of time and money into that it's our duty to remember those who are no longer here it's a duty to to do something with our survivor experience this is Tania she's also a survivor and she's also one of my best friends within the first couple months of her being part of the network she really helped with her help the network was able to get state funding and she even found a trauma expert who was able to lead therapy sessions within the network for other survivors who had gone through traumatic situations and another major thing that she did for other victims was get everyone access to ground zero there's something known as the pit now some people don't like to refer to it as the pit but a lot of people do there was you know dirt and rubble there dust and debris and who knows what from the building just all piled there for a long time most of the bodies were not found on that day and so a lot of remains were there and so she got the group access to go to that site to if they wanted to if they felt comfortable of course touch the ground and feel connected again to the scene which can be a huge part of trauma healing this was special for their survivors Network though you could not just get down there if you were you know random torus or people wanting to sell t-shirts or something like that it was very restricted and Tania was the one who was able to make this happen she literally negotiated with the authorities and organized a time made a post to everyone like hey come down with me and we'll go you know have this experience together one of the members of the survivor Network spoke about how he remembers her picking up the soil the ground the rubble and smelling it and then just crying you know just absolutely going into hysterics and they were all hugging each other it was a really beautiful experience for all of them so people really appreciated that about her that she was fighting for others within the network and she quickly became a leader people were blown away once they heard her story and how she lost her fiancee and that she was strong enough to go and fight for these things was mind-blowing to a lot of survivors I mean they were going through trauma they were you know having depression in their lives they're struggling with mental health they are trying to cope with something terrible that they lived through but she was so tough and so strong and had the time and energy to not only help herself and try to grieve and stuff but to help others and I think a lot of survivors were blown away by her strength and resilience she continued to be super involved within the network she would even hold like workshops for people to cope with their trauma she was really into making sure survivors were taken care of and we're dealing with what they went through she really believed in writing about your pain telling your story and it kind of became like a competition of the stories according to people who were in the network you know they were making online posts and stuff as well and it became like who had the most interaction with it and who was getting the most attention because of their story because not every story is interesting and has many details to it and she had many details which I'll get more into that as well but she would also send out these mass emails to the 500 plus people that were part of this network one time she posted this long update to the whole group about how she had called the bridal shop that she had bought her wedding dress from remember she's supposed to be getting married and how she had to tell them to just go ahead and donate the dress I mean she had no use for it right and people ate that [ __ ] up people were like amazed by her kindness to donate your wedding dress a lot of people would have picked it up for themselves but people were so into Tonya and the drama around and the love story behind her and Dave she almost started becoming famous within the network she also told a long story and sent it out to a lot of people this is pretty triggering for other victims I'm sure but she talked about how her assistant was decapitated in front of her on her way out of the building she came across a man who was not going to make it out of there and how he gave her his wedding ring and said to give it to his wife because he knew that his ashes would never make it to her like this really intense story and people were really interested in all her stories within the group and it really got to the point where other members of the network almost became fans of Tanya and people wanted to be close to her and she was leading the pack however the more that she started to share it with people which became more and more over time like there were more details added to the stories they got more intense more you know things came to her head as she remembered new details and people started kind of picking up on some inconsistencies for example she told a lot of people that she had lost her husband while she told other people that it was her fiance like she couldn't seem to keep track of what she was saying when people would ask what her fiance's full name was cuz she would only call him Dave she would give people some random last name and of course people took that name Dave whatever last name she gave them and looked at the records of who had passed on that day and there was a Dave with that last name so they thought you know okay there was a lot of talk within the group in some circles about just questions for Tanya you know finding little holes in her story that didn't connect things that didn't make any sense but people felt guilty even questioning her you know it's not something you want to question someone for especially because you know Tanya had an actual burned arm you don't question when there's someone with a giant burn who tells you that they are a survivor of 9/11 you know you're not going to question and then back in May of 2002 the New York Times published a story about the last terrible minutes inside of the Twin Towers and the New York Times ended up interviewing everyone that was above the impact point of the towers on the south side at least and they were like who is this other person Tanya why didn't we have her in our records so this is when the media started to question her a little bit and then on September 9th 2005 the 9/11 tribute center was opened and this included accounts from various survivors including Tanya's Tanya's story was actually one of the ones that inspired people to dedicate an entire area of the tribute Center for survivors to talk about their personal experiences and she was actually chosen to give a tour to important people coming through the area like the mayor and other big politicians because she was really resilient and seemed like she really had it together for someone who had been through something so traumatic she was inspiring to me I mean who better to lead people through an area that is supposed to be inspiring but you could tell all she was giving this tour she was freaking out if you can just tell she wasn't at her best she was kind of miss speaking and seemed a little nervous this was films and everything and I think inside at these moments she's [ __ ] a brick but you know and after giving this tour she ends up deciding it's a good idea to mass email everybody and tell them about it basically brag and say oh I'm so honored to have given this tour but I was so nervous I don't even know what I said I was just rambling she even talked about the amount of cameras and how it was really overwhelming to her but for the most part people were really supportive of her and excited for her but some people were just a little bit weirded out that she was getting so excited over all the attention so as time went on even more her story kept changing again she started telling some people that instead of a firefighter bringing her out of the building it was some random when she first told me she was on the 78th floor one of the first things said it was did you see the man with the red bandana and the answer was yes she saw him but over time that became not all good she's seen him but he put the fire out on her back and I think I think possibly that he led her to the stairwell or something so it seemed to change over time that's what I noticed and then on September 7 2006 the New York Daily News actually posted a whole story on her and it didn't make sense compared to the article that was put out before by the New York Times and remember they had interviewed everyone that was on the floor that she claims that she was on and she was not one of them however despite these inconsistencies a lot of the people within the survivors network still supported her and eventually she was voted as the president of the survivors network and people said that what she was elected into this position she acted like she was better than other people in the network and as she kind of started to annoy more people more people started to poke holes in her story the New York Times starts contacting other people within her story you know they want to confirm some details so they're like you know tell us about your assistant the one who was decapitated in front of you do you have her information you have her name let's reach out to her family how about you know your fiancee let's talk to his parents like let's make a story on you and it didn't start with the intention of an investigation it was going to be about them highlighting her story it didn't take long for her story to unravel it was like immediately that they asked her who these people weren't she didn't have any names and they started you know questioning her and putting the heat on her a little bit and she started wigging out she started going to other members and saying oh my god they are trying to like ruin my life they don't believe my story how dare they don't believe my story crying hysterics people felt really bad for her actually her friends within the network completely backed her up and they felt sorry for her by being attacked by the media so she starts emailing other people within the network being like hey don't talk about me to the media no matter what and they're like why there shouldn't be anything to hide so it didn't take long for everything to come crashing down soon the New York Times publishes a front-page story on Tania head and exposed her as being this giant liar and this story blew up nationwide there's a good chance a lot of you know about this story it's very popular people were just shook that there was a woman running around claiming to have been through the trauma of a 9/11 survivor who was not there when they contacted the man that she claimed was her fiance you know because she never gave contact information so they tried to track him down as best they could they contacted someone that they thought could have been him and they had never heard of Tania they had no connection the stories in matchup boom liar it was also discovered that Tania had claimed she had a degree from Harvard University and an MBA from Stanford University but both of the schools had no record of her she also claimed to be working at the big banking and investing company known as Merrill Lynch in the South Tower but Merrill Lynch had no record of her employment and they didn't even have offices in the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks and another thing that came out a Spanish newspaper discovered that just ten days after 9/11 you know when Tania should have been in the hospital recovering from everything that she went through that she was actually enrolled in school in Barcelona Spain there were people from the school who claimed that they were in class with her during the time she claimed to be in the hospital and when she was in school she told classmates various stories of what happened to her arm everything from house fires to car accidents even injuring her arm from horseback riding it turns out that Tania didn't even own horses so she was at least making that one up and we have no idea it would actually happen to her arm it turns out that Tania's real name was actually Alicia Esteve and in addition to this it was discovered that she was not a US citizen and wasn't even in America at the time of the attacks she had never even been to America until 2003 two years after the attacks and if you look at her past it kind of makes sense normally people who lie pathologically like this have something that happened in their past that taught them to lie when she was younger her brother and her father were put in jail for a massive fraud and some people think she really never got over that and you know was inspired to lie or it just runs in their family I mean who knows some people if she was super desperate to be loved and this was her only way she knew how to get attention in love but what's so crazy is that when she was making all these elaborate posts and these stories early on in the earlier days she may have been making those from Spain it's very possible it looks like she traveled here because of this like she came over here to live this whole fake life and because she was obsessed with the stories and she was obsessed with 9/11 so much so that she wanted to make her whole life surrounded she literally could have stopped this all early on because you know in the beginning she you know when she was still in Colombia she could have said on the post you know I never want to go back to America because of all the damage that it caused me and all these things like she could have just ended it there but she took the lie to that next level by flying out to America and becoming the president of the survivors Network like honestly she has some balls to lie that much and it's honestly so disgusting I really have no sympathy for her like a lot of people have sympathy for her and I see that but like I don't at the same time because what the hell dude so many victims of 9/11 are suffering so badly and to make it almost look like they're not doing enough because you know they're not as strong as you during that time and you're just thriving off of being the strong inspiring person like meanwhile other people are actually suffering because they were actually there it's so irritating to think about I would be so frustrated if I was one of the people who was kind of conned by her and people to this day are not over it they're very angry and upset and it this has been another thing that they've had to deal with you know they really trusted this woman she helped tons of people like emotionally she became really close friends with tons of people in that group it became her family she was so into it and to find out that she was just lying the whole time I think was devastating to tons of people within the group but despite the fact that she was a giant liar she was never convicted of any crime because there really was no crime I mean if anything she came in and helped people she donated time money resources energy she really did help so you can't like argue that she conned anyone out of their money or anything like that she didn't do anything like that she conned people out of their empathy and their attention and sympathy but she never you know committed any type of crimes so there was no legal accountability for Tania head as soon as this came out she got the [ __ ] out of the country now to this day no one knows where Tania is I mean she could be been watching this video for sure but I'm sure she Lane is relatively low I mean I think the whole thing was super embarrassing for her and there's a lot of people who hate her really it's hard to come back from a lie like this especially when you are lying to people who have been through something so terrible you know and no one knows where she is to this day there have been reports that she was seen with her mother in New York at one point and another point she was back in Spain in fact in July of 2012 there's a rumor that she was fired from her job in Barcelona because they found out about the giant you know why she told but that's really all we know we have no idea where she is to this day and people that got affected by this just feel really hurt I mean it was really upsetting for people I find people who lie like this to be so interesting you know they'll keep going without thinking about the future and what could happen this wasn't a very thought-out lie and you'd think that someone like Tanja who's probably a pathological liar she probably has Experian in lying right well I don't know because this wasn't very well thought out like she didn't really think this through she set herself up to be one of 19 people that were above a certain point she could have made this a lot more believable but she really went for the moon with the story in those details and like who even is gonna believe the whole story about the ring that she took the ring - you know this wife who lost her husband because oh my gosh I can't even I can't even it's like she was a creative writer who was just inspired by 9/11 and wanted to write about it and that's like all she was into it's truly remarkable that some people can lie to that extent and just not realize that something's gonna happen you know to go out on camera and take people through such a sacred place and completely be lying the whole time like takes some serious balls I don't know man tani hood but I want to know what you guys think in the comments let me know I'm sure a lot of you think there should have been some type of accountability for her I wish there was but like legally she did nothing wrong I think it's a pretty interesting story though I have a whole playlist on other people who are major liars and it's interesting stuff to look at if you're curious but that's it for me guys I hope you're having a great day and I will see you next [Music]
