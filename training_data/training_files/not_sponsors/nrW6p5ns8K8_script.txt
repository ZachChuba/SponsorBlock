this is EVE Online EVE Online is a massively multiplayer online game that has probably best been known for articles about massive space battles with tens of thousands of players or stories about in-game Kahneman's screwing over their allies after years of friendship and just about the most boring twitch streams you have ever seen EVE Online is interesting for a bigger reason though that is often overlooked that is it's amazingly realistic economy almost every item in this game from rounds of ammunition to Space Station's a player made and by player made I mean that raw materials are mined by player corporations then transported by players from logistics corporations to open markets where the materials are traded to players that will again transport these materials back to space factories where they will be turned into usable items and once again hauled back to an open market where they'll be sold to an end user who will probably do this with it to get a sense of how diverse industry and economics isn't Eve this is a flowchart it's a condensed version of popular professions that people can do in this game sure other games have crafting that is almost as intricate as this but no other game combines that with the level of player involvement seen here throughout that entire process we just saw not one NPC was involved every trading partner was a real player and this means that even line has a surprisingly realistic and genuinely fascinating economy now there is so much I could talk about in this video when it comes to the crazy capitalist market of Eve but I really want to focus on one aspect in particular and that is player owned sovereign territory everything in EVE takes place in this fictional galaxy called New Eden at the center of this galaxy is Empire controlled territory this is a relatively safe zone for new players where there are consequences for engaging in aggressive acts that doesn't mean that aggressive acts don't happen but there are consequences the further out you go on this map though the more you get into no-man's land there really isn't anything supplied out here but it is free for anybody to claim and hold as their own this means that groups of players can assemble into alliances and basically start their own in-game Nations outside the control of any static game restrictions now a big distinction that I must make is when I say in-game nations I am NOT talking about a gaming clan with a clubhouse in their own banner I am talking about a group of tens of thousands of players that live within a defined border with a player run military a player run industrial sector laws diplomacy capital cities defined leadership structures and most crazy of all social security I'm not kidding most of these large sovereign alliances have systems in place to make sure that all of their members can afford ships to fly in because the more parts that they have in space contributing to industry or flying in their defensive fleets the better the biggest of all of these in-game nations is a coalition called the Imperium this group has everything that we have seen earlier and this one even comes complete with its own space Donald Trump an outspoken loved or hated bombastic leader who does really stupid stuff when he gets on stage but that's a it's a whole other thing the most amazing part of all of this for economics nerds like myself is something called the monthly economic report this is a detailed report produced by the game developers CCP the details all manner of things from the eve economy from trade balances of regions to the consumer price index of in-game items and yes we are still talking about a video game here something really cool that this allows us to do with a bit of engineering is to work out the GDP of one of these in-game player nations both in terms of in-game currency and the real-life dollar equivalent a quick reminder is that GDP is normally used to work out the size of real-life nations economies and it is calculated using this formula GDP equals household spending plus government spending plus investment plus net exports the Imperium draws its borders around this area of the map centralizing on an in-game region called Dell the borders do overflow into surrounding regions like query Oz but a vast majority of the imperials trade and industry takes place here delve is also where their capital city is located so for the sake of simplicity we will just look at delve if we look at the monthly economic report for January 2019 we can work out everything we need to know to get a GDP figure starting with household spending the total market trade in delve in this period was forty eight point six trillion misc misc being the in-game currency to add on to this there were contracts traded in this region for an additional 32 trillion esque contracts in this game are normally used to trade higher value one-off items but for all intents and purposes it's the same as trading on an open market this gives us a combined household spending figure of ninety point six trillion asked for this region for this period next up is government spending in this case the alliances of the Imperium are the government now this actually cannot be determined by the monthly economic report because unfortunately it keeps those figures private but remember when I was talking about their welfare systems that ensure that everybody has a ship to fly well using this we can reverse engineer a rough guesstimate of how much the Imperium spends on this service every ship destroyed in EVE Online is listed on this third party website that has some amazing tools available to filter through who it belonged to and how it was destroyed by looking at this period we can determine that about two trillion escs worth of Imperium ships were destroyed and that would be eligible for a ship replacement welfare program this is admittedly the roughest figure in this calculation because the Imperium does spend a little bit more money on in-game items despite this welfare and not all ships destroyed unnecessarily eligible for this welfare but I am happy to agree on a rough two trillion s figure for this period next up investment now in EVE this figure is roughly a function of normal consumption the one thing EVE Online does not have is a functioning financial securities market there are certainly players who will purchase commodities in this game as a long-term investment but this kind of transaction would be indistinguishable from normal trade and so this figure is just combined with the figure from household spending if any Eve players know how to better determine the breakdown of investment first normal spending please let me know because it's genuinely very interesting and I could not figure it out finally we have net exports delft the primary home of the Imperium imported five point eight trillion discs worth of goods during this period and exported nine point two trillion discs worth now this gave it a net exports figure of three point four trillion discs so now we have all the figures household spending of ninety point six trillion is government spending of two trillion is and net exports of three point four trillion discs we are left with a GDP figure for this period of ninety six trillion discs now remembering that this was only for one month of the year we can get an annual GDP figure by assuming that this month was about average which looking back on historical data is the case and multiplying by twelve giving us an annual GDP figure of 1.15 two quadrillion esque okay cool that's a big number but what does it mean in terms of real-life money well in game is can actually be purchased from the game developers through an in-game item called Plex 500 Plex extends an accounts premium subscription to the game for 30 days and sells for about twelve US dollars in game these 500 Plex are worth about two billion esque by this calculation in real-world dollars the GDP of the Imperium is just under seven million US dollars with one big asterisk and that is while real money can be used to buy in-game money in-game money cannot be sold for real money at least not with the blessing of the game developers but when there is a will there is a way and shady sites do operate for Eve players looking to sell their in-game money this black market esque is significantly less valuable but in the interest of fairness if the GDP was to be based on this tradable currency pair the GDP of the Imperium would be closer to about three million u.s. dollars per year beyond this it must be remembered that the Imperium is only one entity in an expansive game with hundreds of entities vying for economic dominance and so everything we have seen here is just a small part of an even greater and more intricate video game economy EVE Online is not a game for everyone if the idea of looking at contracts and trade spreadsheets and market graphs doesn't appeal to you there are definitely more exhilarating ways to spend your time online I really love stories about EVE Online because while it is absurd to say that it in any way reflects a real-life national economy it does genuinely have some incredible similarities in intricacies that give us a glimpse into what an economy would look like if the rules were removed and the place was run by internet Spaceship mean lords thanks
