Julie did you bet bet Clemson oh yeah fool before the game before the game I was I was dying to see over Denis T destiny you didn't you didn't think that oh you were dynasty over destiny and then instead of her destiny her dynasty I hammered I I mean the day it came out I think the day came out me and Ty Schmidt saw the line it was at five and a half it actually dropped I thought it was gonna go up I hammered LSU very very very hard and I could boy you forgot about that bet until I saw Joe Burrell wincing going into the side into the locker room when I was like wait let me go check this room here now Mike that was a big red eye and I immediately regretted it but I do believe that touchdown you can't wipe that off the board yeah I mean I was an idiot for thinking the team that won 29 straight games and back-to-back potential national champions let's go keep it close I won't say this you bet on Clemson for next year yeah Oh big Trevor Lawrence that dude is the truth man though granted he was trying to fit some balls into some spaces he was overthrown a little bit maybe now as an NFL quarterback he might have been squeezing the ball a little bit too tight I even see whenever I'm playing catch you squeeze ball too tight you try to overthrow it it comes out wobbly and then you're off just a little bit what you can't be against that LSU defense especially that Stingley jr. dude he is unbelievable he's gonna make all the money in the NFL is an island corner he was very good but Trevor Lawrence handled that press conference after the game perfectly I mean he was sad for the seniors that were leaving he was like we're gonna get better off of this he's just bombed I mean everything about Trevor Lawrence just gets better and better and better and this loss is gonna make him better and better and better and they started off a little slow this past year I think Trevor was trying to be something he wasn't because of all the height and because of national championship and he found himself I can't wait for a year of Dabo Swinney in that Clemson strength and conditioning staff telling them that they're not good enough what's gonna happen next year that Clemson team is gonna be a buzzsaw and the ACC knows it every time we talk to an ACC coach this year for those Thursday night games they said we're all kind of the same a lot of parity in the ACC except for Clemson a point to prove now you got them pissed off I'm excited to see Trevor Lawrence pissed off yeah they might win every game by like 50 next year number one recruiting class that doesn't hurt look he might throw eighty touchdown they have Trevor Lawrence that is the a Trevor Lawrence who now has something to prove well hello there and get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic didn't have anything to prove number one picked since what a senior high school national champion never lost and I understand that he's a competitive guy and he has stuff to prove it's like yeah but you listen to this stuff like Drew Brees Aaron Rodgers you name it most and won't you have something to prove it brings out the best in you now Trevor Lawrence has something to proof and not by the way I don't think he does he's still number one draft pick still the most I can't wait to see him in the NFL systems I can't wait to see all that stuff but now in his mind I think he probably has something to prove in that long haired handsome he's a handsome dude he's gonna so Waterhouse next year I think yeah they're talking about Alabama and all these other teams it's like I get it I understand yes you see is gonna be very good all the time a pissed off Trevor Lawrence is gonna be a problem Clemson Ohio State by the way that mega cast super fun way to watch the game like incredibly entertaining yeah you know we never really touched on that it's stressful there was a lot going on on that one on yours one cuz like it just seemed like there was so much action and I don't know because I didn't watch the normal one I don't know if I want to watch the normal on if it would have seemed like the game was moving that fast or not but you guys just spreading up and down the sideline just like gives it a nice top yeah first up Stevie when I had a very good agreement and we had a very good first quarter we weren't allowed to do anything they were kicking us off of everything like we're getting yelled at by photographers and Steve Levy was like no I was on the field last year I'm gonna break like well this year there's different rules because whatever happened and he's like unbelievable or whatever so we had to abide by the rules so we did have to sprint to get a good spot in the first half that second half though me and Steve are basically in the chillin there in the end zone this is awesome I I loved it I had a blast nothing I think there should have been a little bit more fullscreen football and then back to in full-screen football but I'm not the director or producer or if they're even allowed to do that watching it back I watch him back but man I had a blast I was very lucky to be a part of that and I think they picked a good crew to let me dance Steve and Adam that's a good crew to have it I think we had a blast
