everybody [Music] good evening thank you for joining us here on nasa tv you are getting a live feed from ellington field just down the street from houston texas our johnson space center ellington field that is the gulfstream three aircraft on board doug hurley and bob bankin who just landed from a 64-day mission aboard the international space station for the demo 2 mission thank you for joining us here today i'm nasa's gary jordan coming to you from down the street and mission control center this is where we have 24 7 hour operations of the international space station control teams here uh switching rooms during the covet 19 pandemic as we are waiting for uh the crew to uh to get out of the plane they're with their families now but we just got a touchdown of them a few moments ago touching down 6 uh 27 p.m central time uh touching down here in ellington just five hours ago they were in the gulf of mexico splashing down off of the coast of pensacola getting some great views of the crew now coming down from the gulf stream aircraft we're expected to hear some words from them as they get situated in front of them is a group of uh vips bob banking on the left doug hurley on the right we should be hearing some words from them coming up here shortly [Applause] hey good afternoon and thank you all for coming today i'm mark guyer director of nasa's johnson space center i want to thank you for joining us here today at ellington field for the return of our nasa astronauts after a stellar mission doug and bob welcome home it's great to see you guys yes so of course we were excited to see you safely splash down earlier today but we're very happy to see you back on earth here in houston uh on behalf of all the employees of nasa and jsc we congratulate you on completing your historic mission to the international space station you know many of us many of us here today are committed to the goals of the aspirations of human exploration but you and the other astronauts actually take the risks that make human exploration possible i did want to mention a couple other people today you know in the audience we have kathy leaders who's now the new head of the human exploration mission operations mission directorate and and steve smith steve stitch the program manager of the cc ccp program you know today is really the culmination of an incredible amount of work by you and your teams to enable the united states to launch our astronauts from the united states so thank you too thank you and your teams very much all right so without further ado i'd like to hand it over to bob and doug for comments all right we're not going to stand right now for those of you who have done this before you know it's not pleasant standing for a few hours after you get back five hours ago we were bobbing around in the gulf of mexico so i feel like it's pretty good that we got this far in five hours but uh i think the the biggest thing that we would both like to talk about is just to thank uh you can see steve and kathy here in elon you know this has been a uh quite an odyssey the last five six seven eight years five years since bob and i started working on this program and to be where we are now the first crude flight of dragon is just unbelievable uh we said it before just a tremendous privilege to be part of this program to be part of nasa and to spend two months on the international space station with the one of the greatest officers crewmates astronauts chris cassidy just was a a real pleasure for both of us and i'm sure bob will talk about the space walks but that just to see those two work uh out on the international space station you're not gonna see anything like that again it just was uh it was just amazing to be part of that and then you know the flight of uh dragon on falcon and then the re-entry today it's uh it's a lot the process as i said five hours ago we were in a spaceship bobbing around making prank satellite phone calls to whoever we could get a hold of which was kind of fun by the way you can send him the bill for the sat phone uh but anyway we we really appreciate uh all of you coming to say hi and welcoming us back it's uh it's a little bit overwhelming to to to see everybody here considering the things that have gone on the last few months since we've been off planet but thank you again for coming to say hi and and uh hopefully we'll be able to share a lot of this mission with you uh in a few months hopefully if not sooner but uh thank you again well first of all thank you for everybody who who came out today i know with all the challenges everybody's wearing a mask uh with the situation that we're in it's uh not trivial to get this many people here to try to be close and celebrate what we've accomplished i think for both doug and i the thing that we're most excited about having accomplished with this mission is you know it's written right on that sign where it says launch america and then of course land america today uh as we went through our years as astronauts here at the johnson space center we got to live through a big chunk of the shuttle era and a big chunk of the assembly of the space station when the space shuttles retired when doug took his final flight to wrap that up i think it was a sad day for us because there's something special about having that capability to launch and and bring your own astronauts home and uh we went through a lot of years without that capability and i think we're both super super proud to have been just a small part of the team that accomplished bringing those space flights back to the florida coast and bringing that capability back to america as doug mentioned we had the luxury of having a just a super crew on board the international space station with chris cassidy with anatoly and yvonne they just took a wonderful care of us i can't think of anything that we could have had more in place and ready for us when we arrived than what chris set up for us and so we're we're extremely thankful for him and his work to make things look easy for us you know we didn't have the full training template that was out there we had an abbreviated flow and and got to take advantage of an opportunity if you will to try to take care of space station as we accomplish this test mission and so i i think we're both really proud of that and happy that it didn't become a distraction we were able to accomplish the test mission objectives and work through those kind of get dragon certified and in some sense to be ready for our return home when the time came to do that and so it all just worked out wonderfully and so uh today when we got the wake-up calls from our boys uh telling us a little bit about what they were looking forward to which was us coming home and in theo's case getting a new dog it was it was a wonderful morning and we very much appreciated it and so again uh i think this kind of comes full circle took years to get here we brought the capability back to america and we came home safely to our families and it took a lot of people a lot of time to make that happen and so to kathy thank you for that of course you had steve as your right hand man for the most recent history at least and we definitely really appreciate the the hard work that that you all had to go through to ensure that the contractors in this case uh uh the spacex team really could understand nasa and what we needed to be able to have in place to have human space flight be safe in the way that we wanted to to operate it and i think for the spacex team we couldn't have asked for a more wonderful team to work with i think you know we definitely are our old dogs and like some of our old tricks because it's not always because lazy sometimes it's because we did it before and we know an easy solution and we try to share that with folks and that's really as we go forward to further activities whether it's in low earth orbit to the moon or beyond we need to figure out the best way to share what nasa knows with the contractor team and help them be as successful as possible and i think maybe we weren't there five or six years ago of course but by the time we launched and certainly by the time we returned i think there was a very tight knit relationship between the spacex team and our nasa team and we worked together to accomplish what we accomplished so with that i just want to thank you all for coming out today and celebrating this uh this victory uh with doug and i and recognize our small part of what was accomplished thank you all well thanks again bob and doug and we'll see you around at jsc and so one last time let's thank these guys for the incredible mission they did for nasa so bob benkin and doug hurley providing some brief comments uh nasa and spacex representatives present many of whom work directly on this mission banking and hurley are going to be boarding some ground transportation making their way either to crew medical facilities or on their way home to be with their families for the next few days we do have some more programming to get back to their live at ellington field more vips present you see center director mark guyer and here we go i've been told i'm not allowed to hold the microphone and that's really hard for me to do but i'm going to take my mask off for just a few seconds here and just say thank you to everybody who participated in this you know we just saw bob and doug and i think all of us are going to have memories now for the rest of our lives when they launched in fact we'll have memories of the day that they didn't launch and then three days later coming back and doing the whole thing again not knowing whether or not they were going to go 50 50 on the weather and then sure enough uh the skies opened up and we were able to launch bob and doug i want to say a few words just about what champions they are beyond just being the first crew to fly on dragon it goes beyond that they they knew that when they were doing this it was a test flight they also knew that they were going to be responsible for you know conducting a lot of operations on the international space station for a period of months to include what ended up being four space walks spending that extended period of time on the international space station and then flying back and amazingly coming off the jet just right now after being weightless for the last 63 days coming off the jet sitting down and doing a public event and i got to tell you i've never flown into space but for my he that's that's not normally done it's very difficult but they wanted to take that opportunity to connect with the american people on this momentous occasion and i can't say how much i you just can't put into words how important this was for our country to have access to space again from our own soil so again i know they left but congratulations to bob and doug and their families what an amazing day for the united states of america i would also say that what we just saw is the beginning of what will be a whole lot more activity in the future right now when we talk about commercial crew we're going to go for the dragon we're going to go from development and operations of course we're always going to learn and we're always going to modify but making that transition from development to operations is going to be a challenge but the nasa team is up for it but it goes beyond that because we still have starliner and we need to get starliner flying uh and then we've got to get orion flying and we've got to get starship flying and we've got to get what what's that a lot of stars absolutely so look there there is a lot to do in front of us but here's what we know we know that when members of congress come together in a bipartisan way and they fund nasa amazing things can happen right now we have before the house and the senate the biggest budget request in nasa's history in nominal dollars by the way right now we have the biggest budget nasa has ever had in nominal dollars now if you look at real dollars apollo might have us beat by a little bit but we're heading the right direction and next year if we get the budget request that is before us right now next year we're going to go up in order of magnitude and that is necessary because today we're flying into low earth orbit and in a few short years we want to be flying to the moon and not just go once or twice but we want to go sustainably with a purpose we're going to the moon sustainably we're going to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time we're going to use the resources of the moon in order to live and work and we're going to take all of that knowledge onto mars that's what we're able to accomplish because of the bipartisan support we've had in the house and in the senate for the budget that we have right now and what i'm asking for our members of congress to do is look at what we've done with what we have and if you fund us at our budget request level we will be on the moon and we will be successfully on the moon with our commercial partners and with our international partners so today was an amazing day it was a historic day it's been nine years since america launched and landed from its own soil and yet here we are but the next step is we're going on to the moon and then on to mars this is about momentum it starts today and it finishes when we put an american flag on mars all right i've got the honor to introduce somebody who we are very grateful for to help us accomplish this mission i've said it before and i'll say it again nasa seeks to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low earth orbit and we want to have numerous providers that compete on cost and innovation and safety and i will tell you there was a moment maybe not even a year ago kathy leaders you can tell me how long ago it was when we had some significant challenges we we might have had a few disagreements on parachutes we might have had a maybe a disagreement on um you know maybe maybe we need to change uh the titanium and because of its reactivity with uh nitrogen tetroxide and um i sent a tweet elon and i know you remember this um and since we've had a number of dialogues i sent a tweet and i said that it's time to deliver and i tweeted it at elon musk and i want to tell you elon um you had you responded absolutely magnificently uh and you have in fact delivered you have delivered beyond anything any of us would have expected and and i will also say that all of the reports i'm getting from all of the teams on commercial crew is that this mission went as good as we could have hoped and we're so grateful for the team at spacex the great team in nasa's commercial crew program and all of the operators that helped us to get to this point so i just want to say thank you elon musk the time is yours thanks jim that i mean after these great words that were spoken um i i i'm not sure i have much to add there's uh from from you know bob and doug and jim um but uh i do think what what this heralds really is fundamentally a new era in space flight a new era in space exploration we're going to go to the moon we're going to have a base on the moon we're going to have send people to mars and make life multi-planetary and i think this this day heralds a new age of space exploration that's what it's all about um and this is the result of an incredible incredible amount of work uh from people at spacex people at nasa hey kelly hey this is i mean so much we're 18 years this has been 18 years to to finally fly people to overton back and um i mean i really came here because i just wanted to see bomb doug to be totally free like thank goodness um i think i think i think like mine like my entire adrenaline it was just dumped you know it's like my god you know you know i'm not very religious but i prayed for this one so just once again thanks everyone uh spacex nasa f a ever everyone air force you know that that played a role in in this and not its key suppliers um that did incredible work thanks thanks again and you know i think this is something that the whole world can take uh some some pleasure in and and can really look at this as an achievement of humanity and this you know these are these difficult times when you know there's not that much good news and and i think this is one of those this is one of those those things that is universally good no matter where you are on planet earth this is a good thing and i hope it brightens your day thank you thank you thank you jim and elon for those inspiring words you know all of us are here because we believe uh in this country in exploring space we believe in humanity's destiny to explore the solar system and it as was said we are here this is a milestone moment and it's an honor to be here so thanks again for coming thanks for everything you do for the mission of nasa uh and the work that we do thank you [Applause] and that wraps up today's welcome home event bob bankin and doug hurley the space dads back
