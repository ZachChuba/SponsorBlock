[Music] it's been a while since we last spoke face to face it's mainly been studio blogs for the last few weeks but I thought I would do another holiday specials and last year we made this too many crowns and shivering no but this year I thought I would do something a little bit more complex we're gonna make stabbed wrapping paper I asked you guys in a little community tab if you wanted to see that and most of you said yes well no I said no I'm sure you want to see it since you clicked on the video that's how they how'd you like that years so thank you so much for choosing to sponsor my video anyway let's get started so what you'll need is this big [Music] so for this project I'm gonna be using this roll of craft paper you can get rolls of paper at IKEA you can get last time I told them to steal paper that was not a good thing to do do not steal paper but you could use this this this this even this it really just depends on the ink you're using and the size of your gift so you need to make that decision but Kroft paper is simple and easy and I appreciate you can get it any like hot material store any craft hobby stores step number one we need to sketch our designs if you want to draw your design on paper first you can I'm just gonna go straight into it because I feel like it doesn't really matter if it's hamper did anything's gonna look good you could do shapes you could do patterns I'm gonna do many little steps I think that'll make the design more interesting i'll 2min the Ituri grounds and shivering now I'm leaving some space in between the drawings because I'm gonna cut them out no I don't want Christmas themed I want everyone to be included in this but hopefully I could draw this Alam I've never yeah I need to draw tiger this is Tiger he's my new friend that roughly got from Ecuador [Music] not needed anything how cruel we use him then we just throw him away like trash so I've done some main objects not sure how they're gonna turn out however I'm also doing some patterns in between so even if they don't really turn out it's okay it's abstract am I right girls and boys in Australia the holidays are in summer so I'm doing some popsicles and nobody can stop me remember Santa you know him personally yeah can you ask him why he didn't get me a doll all these years okay so I've done a really weird ruff thing don't know if you can see that oh it's too bright so what I'm doing now is I'm just cutting each of the little images away so that each little drawing is its own stamp I actually don't know what 4k is okay so let me teach you Wow I'm actually carving so many stamps right now the next step is to carve your brother stance I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get these done in time because rocket and I need to go to my mom's house to eat spaghetti bolognaise and that is priority let's choose our favorite sounds to begin with trees obviously houses these little patterns stars and then I'll carve these for another time and obviously in a llama because that's like you so grab your carving tools you can usually buy these in a set the ones that I'm going to use most the detailed little v-shaped ones I'm not really sure what it's called I did like one modular printmaking in university but I've retained very little information in my brain and then I'm gonna be using a really wide u-shaped one so that I can dig out like the big blocks of whites that I don't want to be part of the staff ground one of the hot tips that I need to tell you it wasn't really a hot tip it's more just like safety so it's not really hot at all but always point the carving tool away from you when I was in year 10 my art teacher would always say this and now it's like fully ingrained into my brain just make sure it's not in line with any body pot so we've carved most of the stamps out we've left some because we're running out of light and I need to go eat spaghetti bolognaise the two methods that you can use to print ah if you have one of these spongy ink what are they called yeah a spongy ink pad these are more common you can buy them from stores but if you want to go even more luxe you can use block ink which is what you use for printmaking twines are about 16 dollars a bottle so I mean it depends how much you want to spend but I think that the result is a lot nicer because these are really opaque whereas these are more water based they're more like thick like tar and these ones are more like watery you know how stands work you probably know how to use these ones so I'm not gonna waste time by show you how to do that what you'll need if you're using block ink you'll need a roller you'll need something to put the ink card I would not recommend putting on your table because if it can be quite permanent but you can use things like baking paper kind of take it down but I'm gonna use just a piece of glass that's what I was taught to use in uni so that's what I'm gonna use now I actually don't know if these stats are working yet so if they're not working it just means you need to spend a little bit more time on we don't have time because we need a spaghetti oh yeah these are the part knife you can use a spoon I'm gonna stir the ink you should always do this because often the heavier parts of the ink settle these are really old things put a line out not too much because if you put too much it'll fill the holes and what you're gonna do is roll it out up and down and back and forth we'll get this sound yeah that's good so when I get to this like wall like texture and its really really tacky but sounds so good nostalgic let's go with blue mr. house roll over the top just lightly ready pop it down squish and then pull up thank you thank you cute I'm not sure I have this something uptown out it could be really really bad but we shall see kit I'm happy I'll put the bigger ones in the main ones evenly spaced and then you can use the smaller stamps to kind of disperse the pattern throughout the wrapping paper and that's how you can kind of make a more balanced design we're gonna do rocky Rock the reason I you'd like to use rubber stamps more than potato stamps or like ones that are made from less durable material is that these will last for ages I've got stamps that I made years and years and years ago still and I can still use them and they still function really really well okay for making so fun no more of it this year I love wrapping paper I don't know what it is about writing and I just freaking love designing it no matter if it's digital stamp making just randomly painting it's just so much fun okay finish look upside-down wrapping paper that's it pretty easy huh it didn't take that long it probably took one hour or so and that sounds like a long time but the majority of that was just making the stats and once you've made the stamps they'll last for years you can use them every single year and it's really really quick and fun you do it with friends you can do it with kids it's really really nice and it's just a really nice touch to have something handmade wrapped around a present for something someone that you love please send me photos I would love to see if you think this is a little bit too hard I did a wrapping paper tutorial last year which was really really really basic it was basically just smudging lines onto paper anyone can do it anyone can do this too but if you're less confident first of all believe in yourself and second of all you can check out that tutorial I important especially as a creative so enjoy I hope you like this tutorial and happy holidays everyone I'm gonna wrap these later I need to go eat spaghetti now but I'll see you in two hours bye thank you for watching my video I really appreciate it you guys are cool by altering the Ituri crowds and shimmering flowers in canyons of Steel [Music] it's been more than a day hello again I am feeling fresh the pasta was excellent thank you for asking so what I'm gonna do is just wrap some gifts I haven't got an old my Christmas shopping done but I want to upload this video so I'm gonna wrap stop some of it some of it is to me I'm wrapping gifts in myself you're gonna love yourself you gotta treat yourself I wonder if any of you actually gonna do the tutorial I hope so the fun one I love wrapping papers it's just so cute I'm gonna make more she's not gonna be enough off-camera I made some gradient yellow and orange wrapping paper I really like experimenting with color I feel like it just completely elevates anything you do also I can't help myself when it comes to color it's like completely an addiction or compulsion I remember a time when I thought that my work wasn't edgy enough and my solution in my head was like oh everyone that's cool is doing no color so I'm gonna try not to do as much color but it didn't work out so oh I like color welcome to say oh my gosh yeah so cute because I feel like it's not a great tutorial and I'm really sorry about that especially since you're at the end of it I hope that you learnt something new but if you didn't I hope you're at least entertained I just launched so it's those boundless Plains to share basically all of the profits go to the a.src to help asylum seekers and refugees so we raised one thousand seven hundred and something dollars which is insane that is all you guys thank you to anyone who brought a print seriously it's like I merely just donated my time and you guys did the rest with my little sister I forgot to give her a copy of zoom so she's gonna be getting that as part of her presents I don't think I've ever said this on camera but I find the support on YouTube really really really really nice like unlike any other social platform that I've used recently used to get this feeling on tumblr where everyone was a peer and it was really really mutually supportive and stuff and just when when things shifted to Instagram it was kind of less so I guess because the comments were quicker they were more similar it was like nice so nice you know any name which is great but sometimes it gets it gets lost because you don't know how much of its churned how much of it just like a autumn automatic comment but on YouTube it's like you guys send really long and detailed comment and I appreciate every single one like I don't know how to describe it but my experience this year in YouTube who's been insane I went from like having like five thousand subs to whatever I have now I don't know if any of my social channels over burger in this boss but I just want to thank you guys for being a huge part of that and even though my content is inconsistent I don't post very much I take forever to edit I'm not like reliable tonight thank you for sticking by me because it's really nice that you're here especially Komi studio bugs it really helps motivate me aside from my own one of documenting my work it's really nice to know that there's a community that's really interested in what you're doing and that's there for you if you freak out I'll have like mini meltdowns yeah just thanks
