i didn't really notice until a few days ago but if i complete what lies below we get a bacon ring with this ring this is actually my best in slot ring this gives me plus two magic attack bonus hello our second dragon pickaxe i don't really care for these i actually want the snapdragon drop here i'm out of supplies for the nightmare and i'm gonna need a lot of superstores to go back oh we got a unique address attraction attraction nose tresonos tresono's ring we got a tresonos ring look at that i don't know if this is better or worse let's see here 250 points um it's worse in magic i think it's worse in general god look at that another dragon pickaxe can i just get the snapdragons i've killed over 160 not a single snapdragon drop i actually dc didn't die to vinonatus oh great any itemers what hanukki's gets an inquistors greytown that's an upgrade for him uh that's the first item i've seen in 50 kills did i just miss an item while banking i think i just missed an item pan got elders orb ooh new if we got an inquisitor harbor i don't think he has that one congrats oh he got an inquisitor harbour while i went afk oh he got a bit he got the pet no way that's so beautiful look at look at that little guy the ranger got the little buddy this will be kill count 800 at nightmare is this the orb 800 dream no it's not 800 kill count i'm out of supplies back to fishing yep this is going to be my fishing spot for the next two hours dark crabs alfie alfie got the nightmare stuff i'm so happy for him i'm so happy he got this nightmare staff finally mr alfie rules got his eldritch orb while i was banking this is like the third orb i've missed because i was banking and this only happens to me no one else i feel like i'm very not lucky sick of this game not no oh my god not the staff not the staff oh i got an alpha does the same thing to me i just came with the orb i'm serious i'm sick of this game let's see how much can i hide out this for 360k oh my god oh inquisitor played skirt no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no i i don't wanna uh i don't wanna you know i wish this was the main game because then i would be filthy rich but now i'm not fooling quister twice and two staffs hey good luck you lucky luck luck no no no oh my god oh my god no way it's over it's over it's over it's done the grind is done the grind is done it's over i want to give a big shout out to a cold one and panuki's for helping me out with this tree man oh my god do we put it on put the volatile orb on the nightmare staff yes we have a voltaire night smear staff for 500 points 500 points completed the volatile nightmare staff completed it's done it's actually done it's over the grind is over oh my god let's try it out this is the first time in leagues that i have a magic special attack weapon we can special attack five times using this staff i'm so happy what what was the kill count for this 864 the dream number let's see does this work ah it doesn't work okay the special attack doesn't work on the nightmare keep that in mind but it's gonna definitely pop off on the pillars all right let's test this pillar zero 18 all right how about now 92 86 67 okay how about this pillar he hit that 164 all right okay second try with the volatile orb here that's a big hit 130 back to back the dream back back dream never lucky let's have a look at the collection log the nightmare we got all items twice no mace no harmonized and no aldrich and we got the volatile orb it took us 867 kills putting us at the rank 2 nightmare we lost our rank 1 but we are currently rank 2. max it with a volatile orb 73 and with the imbued heart and prayer on we can hit a 73 okay so it doesn't matter we can max it as 73 on people on players on monsters this is wild 5 73s in a row imagine one thing i believe to be possible is to become the mvp the most valuable player in a theater of blood together with meliors it's never been done before but i believe with the volatile orb and the nightmare staff it's actually possible here we go come on is it going to work here 47 holy do i have to press every time oh my god look at the speed the volatile nightmare staff was more accurate than i thought it would be it hit 70 at one point as well but despite this meal is still the dominating combat style at maiden alright is this going to work at bloat oh 4k xp drop 64. zero ah decent hits i i would say gmo is better here at bloat as well even for a major i did test out the volatile special attack on every single boss at the theater of blood it was definitely useful in every single room besides bloat i would say keep in mind if i had unlocked kanderin instead of the wilderness i would be able to use the occult and the tormented bracelet for an additional 15 damage bonus another spec incoming that's a bigot 71 jesus christ that was quick kill and we didn't get a loot but meal is definitely dominating the magic mvp didn't happen but the dream is still alive i still believe it's possible i still believe it's possible there is so much content we can do with this staff for the next episode bosses training methods p cane combinations anything let me know in the comments what you want me to try out keep in mind these are the five regions i do have unlocked the wilderness mr mauritania desert and calamia that's the kill five specs in a row oh we're gonna have some fun you
