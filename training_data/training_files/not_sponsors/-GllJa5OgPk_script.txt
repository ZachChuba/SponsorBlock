before this video starts I have an announcement to make raid your piggy bank because merch is back baby we have two brand-new designs spray paint and sketched spray paints has a cool hazmat guy with my logo sort of splash in the background and sketched has a clean drawn look to my logo that also comes with a backside if you want to keep things low-key it's no problem you can choose to not have the backside and go for the simple embroidered pocket logo only embroidered basically means sewed on so it will have that pop feel and look what's cool about all this is that not only will you be able to represent and support the channel but when you make a purchase you have the option of leaving a private message to me and I will do my best to answer them all this drop is only gonna last one week so if you're interested I suggest ordering now thanks for tuning in and a big thanks for 700k now let's get into the video welcome to rust today I'm gonna be playing solo and do I have any be piece on here yeah yeah okay we have a few things here so hopefully we can make something happen with this so look there's a man hey brother all right so I don't have any plans for today I don't have any goals just to make gains you know a lot of stone nodes I hear there's a scrap heading on top of that free would easy okay they're going towards bandit maybe there's some stuff left here DB nice only one shot but better than nothing wait this is awkward goddamnit bow guy you've ruined it oh my god woof combo just gonna be kind of nice I guess I can do a little bit of gambling or something okay let's try 300 [ __ ] I had like 8 on 20 I still think it's gonna be 3 yes I might bind them 90 oh no way dude no way we're almost at LR lr is 5 under Scott but LR barely gives you any 5 5 to go with it so I think I'm just gonna buy an m9 dude since I had some basic blueprints on this server I could craft extra ammo for this m9 just like live grenades for gunpowder make like a couple of hand mates and then we'll make the rest of the pistol ammo good one dude Oh what why would you do this search your one here we go okay I guess I'll go make a base I mean I'm down a base around here this is like pretty solid I think all right we got a base cool this is a really good spot I got outpost bandit you know pretty decently close train yard power plant oil rig when I want to even large rig is down on this side of the map I think this is gonna be a good spot once I finished up the base I went back to bandit to lose the rest of that guy stuff it may have just been scraps but as a solo I needed everything I could get kind of want to go for that okay this is really really good so far three double barrels extra armor extra weapons just looking pretty solid but I don't want to jinx it okay let's go to train yard upon arriving at train yard I heard some voices inside did you just take off his kids because of Chinook he did he [ __ ] did that is truly unfortunate for that guy oh there's a crates a train I'm gonna go for that I'm not gonna activate it unless something else to it and I'll shoot him in the head when they start doing it exactly what I was waiting for Python I'm just gonna leave with these guns Wow okay I need to make another box oh there's two of them both waiting on either side that is unlucky I could have went back with the mp5 gear set but even after losing the Python kit I was still up I knew there was at least three people guarding the crates in very good positions so fighting this would be too risky what is he doing so I cut my losses and I went elsewhere with my mp5 okay I want to go to the abandoned supermarket try and get a green card and then I can do super branch I guess she has he I saw just a glimpse of him Luke was his name I'm gonna go quick tipo this okay lost the Python got back at ami gonna bring a fuse in case I do find a green key card then I can just hit Sewer right away oh my god okay I'm just gonna go deep oh furnace on on that base over there that could be the four man from train yard oh there's someone right here I'm just gonna keep going I'm actually gonna keep this heartbeat sensor cuz if I find a smart alarm I can actually set that up wait doesn't Minnie my goal here is um to get a red key card while also getting scrapped for it's here to look I can only make it here to you this is perfect I couldn't crap myself meds and I can go to oil rig with a red key card so I went to train yard to get that red key card and I heard a raid in the distance satchel raid probably gonna be a fourth satchel and then that's it I may have a case yikes maybe I will go to that right after I get this red card I'm not I'm gonna recycle I'm just gonna go straight home I think the raids well over with but there could still be people around so yep no way holy [ __ ] guys we already have an 8k that was a pretty easy eight hair with this Aki decided to do oil rig someone's calling it right now I think that one of them is on top of redwoods they're both in Red Room Oh what are you kidding me [ __ ] I'm going back I'm going back I'm going back the [ __ ] side that was such a bad idea I think there's only one left I full killed that guy oh that's crap Ellie's going towards [ __ ] I trapped myself god damn it what the dude what is this game we're just gonna wait for more reinforcements again that's what's gonna happen what are you kidding me a head shots oh my god was one health dude I kind of dropped the ball there but I still had a couple of guns to fall back on I noticed cargo was out so I figured I'd go for it oh my god this was him Oh it's over it's Gigi I've never seen someone hand me a dub so fast in my life oh you gotta be joking dude once again I threw away my channels I went to my death marker to see if my body wasn't looted as it did fall into the water but as expected it was however while I was out there I found something I'm gonna bring this rib back because that decayed base is two stories tall and if I use the rib I can boost though there was nothing in this decayed base but it was another base that caught my eye this is a good way to make your face look juiciest [ __ ] yo yo yo yo yo wait a minute wait just a second here I can't tell I really can't I'm trying to figure out if this triangle here is open I feel like it is dude if you guys don't get what I was trying to figure out here I'll explain this base has a backwards front door if I soft-sided this with a jackhammer it would then allow me to soft side the ceiling that would hopefully lead to this room on the second floor which is clearly loaded with boxes this would be a gamble because I wasn't 100% sure this triangle didn't just lead to another wall but it was worth checking before I followed through with this plan though Trainyard Chinook dropped again a little bolte up here I'm gonna try and kill this guy first once again I was outnumbered and they had the positional advantage pushing this would be suicide so I went back to base with the intention to carry out my plan thanks their mini right here outside of my base what was this guy doing edited Adam like I'm so confused - dukkha this is not the same guy I'm gonna make it tier 1 so I can refill the jackhammer on over there I mean I guess I'll take the mini culture there might as well poor guy one thing even knew what was happening he's got a little bit - all right let's start this thing hey man what you doing mine mano-a-mano if you just don't bother me here yeah thank you and do this running back and forth is getting a little bit redundant not gonna lie I think a spear would be much faster here oh my god yet that was TC no way that was TC it was no way no way and this is hoping I thought I had a cone okay okay okay I need to focus on one thing at a time here okay that's that's that's an OTC boom wow dude it's this one open - no no no no this is scripted dude this is [ __ ] scripted why don't they lock the doors more stuff the return from the seeker raid was far better than I expected all of this loot would make up for what I lost on oil rig and cargo ship so I transferred the best loot but left some of keeping the raids so I can use it as a secondary base once I finished with this I saw that cargo was out again so I went for it [ __ ] off dude okay so someone definitely is on here it's probably a solo cuz they left a lot of the scientists where is this guy scientist okay dude like how does he get there it was only one person if I got back fast I could win this fight good thing I have this endless supply of mini cop this is the only time this has ever happened to me [ __ ] yes yes holy [ __ ] man too close too [ __ ] close oh my god another Forex so what's really cool is I got this smart alarm now I have that heartbeat sensor at home I can literally set this up that would be so cool we made it boys so I noticed that this shop is selling explosive five five four seven hundred sulfur uh that is actually a pretty good deal so I'm gonna do that before logging off for the night I grabbed that explosive ammo from someone's shop after researching that I decided to set up my raid alarm just in case any pesky offline Raiders were interested in my base okay so basically how the heartbeat sensor works is that it has to have line of sites I don't want my alarm to be going off when people just walk by my base you know that's just gonna be annoying so I'm trying to think like what is gonna be the most common point of entry so if they come from roof they're probably gonna end up blowing this door so maybe like right here would be a good spot there it is and now I named it hair device it's inactive right now exclude authorized there we go okay yeah so now whenever I walk by it I won't trigger the trap okay now it should work yo it works that is actually really cool here I'm gonna turn on my silent mode turn off my semi monami there we go yo base alarm ah [ __ ] here we go again that's so cool that is so cool alright guys that's it hopefully tomorrow I can make some more plays so far this solo run has been pretty good but you may be saying to yourself how does this solo run keep getting better like I say there have been a lot of ups but just as many downs well day two is about to answer that question and well you've been this I'm terrible guys okay now this is going to answer that question get in they didn't get it my god I whipped that's unfortunate oh hello [ __ ] die dude like the [ __ ] ball tease man so many cross fires my headshot him he's not bad dude invalids feels bad wow that hurts man the fight was mostly grubs now so I quit while I was up in a keg ear set and waited until it died down once it did I took my best kit and I headed to the base i raided yesterday to call in the airdrop I got from cargo you take but you don't use against me okay oh my god this guy's meds during that fight I lost the airdrop Lutz but I profited the aka gearset amongst other things while I was out surveying the area with a throwaway kit I oddly heard some gunshots coming from the shore what the [ __ ] there was four fully geared players in a wide-open area I knew exactly what I needed to do next I got better be dead all dead GG boys all my god no way has a cheese in it I think and just like that I got a bunch of raid equipment dude I need to go home like home home I ran this along with the extra a gear set back to main base and by the time I returned heli came out no that's in Grubbs City all right let's try this [ __ ] is he dead please let me walk I'm assuming that was him again nope monka okay trash that's really good that was so close forgot an end to boys oh my oh hi guys what's up therefore I think there's for my ass is gonna get so [ __ ] raided man I wonder if that was chulo that I just killed well obviously was trullo that I killed at the crash but I'm wondering if it was true lo with that he brought back the boys just now oh no that soon dude if I start getting online though I'm whipping this out now that a group knew where I lived I felt like a raid was coming soon hopefully I would be online when it did for now I got myself prepared hey I got a little light now that's cool that's my ceiling you Lancer worth to he because they just give you cool stuff like light little did I know while I was making my preparations this group was making their move much faster than I anticipated I think the boys are here yep alright boys big mistake what are they doing and you're all dead GG thanks for the rockets guys papi chulo the group that rated me was with the same person that i killed at the heli crash i guess they figured that because i was so low the raid would be easy boy were they wrong but you see I wasn't gonna stop there just over the hill was a reasonably sized base with a bunch of turrets they kept coming from this direction so I figured I'd give it a look I think this is where Papa chulo lives and it doesn't look very easy this is the direction they came from it would make sense if they live this close what they have an army of horses so I'm thinking I should probably raid some kind of farm base before I read them oh you know what a good raid would be those guys on the desert in that 3x3 so if he didn't catch on I'm considering raiding chulos group but as of now I knew I didn't have enough explosives something I figured I could raid though was this 3 by 3 I saw near supermarkets it was active and they once shot on me with aks so it's possible that it's loaded so I headed over there in advance to make a small raid base but then I got distracted by another raid in the distance probably gonna go for that if I profane auch it's from this I might just not even do that raid I might just go straight for cholo I think that guy saw me dude I'm gonna make it look like I'm running away and your triple headshot how the [ __ ] is he not dead holy [ __ ] dude this guy bled no explosives for now but I'd be going back for round two after I Depot oh no these are smokes that's good to know oh my god what I got what I came for it was time to make my escape get me out of here please oh my god like this is just ridiculous dude I'm getting close to enough I honestly am I think I might have enough to Rea these [ __ ] guys we would look at my explosives right now six rockets for c-45 satchels nearly four stacks of explosive ammo five a cheese and then a whole this sulfur I more than doubled my rocket count when I went for that counter raid so now I felt like the raid against trullo would be possible so I headed over there to make a game plan all right what's my game plan for this base definitely gonna incendiary rock at these external wooden walls that's for sure maybe I'll in Sandrock at that turret there even if I don't win this raid at least I'll be able to free the horses you know so turrets are only three high velocity rockets if you hit them point-blank will not point-blank look straight on so I probably want to get rid of the top one definitely that side one is high positive rocket it's here - it is okay you know what I have high velocity Rockets from a heli because dude like I have so much GP and I don't have a tier 3 yet so I can't just I can't make more explode with it so might as well just making high velocity Rockets the first part of my plan was settled I'd research in craft HV rockets to take out the main turrets so I could get a closer look at the main base once inside of their compound alright boys let's get this [ __ ] oh my god I miss that thing there we go that's definitely a hit wait is it gone ok I got it I got it AHA hey let's see here that one's facing that way holy [ __ ] horses dude dude this is gonna be so loaded oh hello stashes is there more look at all the horses dude why so much charcoal before I have the chance to bring any serious explosives over here counter Raiders showed up I just want to free the horses there is many trapped horses in here man I am doing world favor for this man they are scared and lonely let me free horses I tried reasoning with them but it didn't work busting my way out was my only option before bringing the main explosives I needed to get rid of one more turret why I have so many questions okay I'm freeing all these horses go now run go relieve yourself of your clothing begone your prayers were answered unlock these chains free yourself okay that's all the horses I'm gonna do for now this actually takes way longer than I first anticipated released a lot okay so we're gonna go continue on with this raid once I had a look in the compound I decided on a point of entry ID 200 expo mode the reinforced window and splashed the embrasure I wanted to save my rockets for the Corps so I believe this was my best option all these shotguns we have no dates oh that's beautiful okay I don't want to run over with the Rockets while those guys are chillin out there so I'm gonna go clear it first yeah that's why I didn't go out with the Rockets these guys were clearly upset about losing a few sets to me as they kept coming back in camping the area but after waiting along while the coast finally seemed clear so I went over with the rest of my explosives okay we made it dude thank God big bass is the name holy frig [ __ ] me do this is gonna be loaded this is gonna be a frustrated isn't it at this stage I knew I'd be mindlessly shooting Expo amo so I destroyed the ladder I hope that does damage to it okay it does good this is known as a frustrated or suicide drop down meaning if you drop down to loot the boxes you'll die the best way to counter them is with f1 grenades they have insane splash and do very good damage to the boils such as shotgun traps it usually takes about five per trap but I slipped up and died come on it would be useless to run straight back I had no f1 grenades in base to break the shotgun traps to retrieve my body so as long as I couldn't get my body neither could anyone else I quickly ran to bandit camp to purchase a bunch of f1 grenades just to be safe okay they're gone trash garbage garbage all garbage on fortunates okay let's do us behind these another trough oh dude that's gonna be main loot I was positive I found where their main loot was so to get some decent closure to this raid i scrounged up supplies to raid this last door I bought a rocket from a shop and I found at tier 3 to craft my remaining gunpowder into explosive ammo it was time to end this raid oh my god TC what have we got okay dude holy [ __ ] look at all that [ __ ] fertilizer I used all of that scrap to research a lot of important items and then I got off for the white just to quickly go over these two days of solo IP DP'd Eco rated made some clutch plays took heli defended a raid counter rated and finally of course I did my own raid on the clan that tried to raid me all as a solo I'd say those were a successful couple of days and I hope you guys enjoyed the journey until next time peace
