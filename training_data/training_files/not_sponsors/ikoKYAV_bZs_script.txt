hi there hello there what's this video we're going to be focusing on mental health a lot of people who use art as an outlet for stress relief therefore I thought it'd be fun to do a series where I cut with simple art projects that are just fun to do keep it stress-free simple easy and hopefully at the end of it you have a nice piece of artwork kind of a lot of theme of this video this video has been sponsored by best fiends stars this is a brand new game made by the makers of best fiends but it's still a puzzle game and puzzle games are something that I tania's to de-stress so I thought I've actually worked out really well in this video well I'm okay start out we're going to paint this entire canvas so for this project we're going to be making a color cloud we're gonna paint the entire canvas black you can't start with any other base color that you'd like to this is a really satisfying about just painting a canvas just one color to start out that's the first part of this black come on it's like you don't have to crop the exact quantity that you think you need for a project just start and flow out you can always that what we're gonna paint this stuff yeah very good I do like art projects like this one because you already have like a goal in life so it's just a simple task of I'm painting this this one color and you're not having to do too much thinking beyond that there's something nice about that it's just a task also art you notice with a lot of my paintings I paint in sections that's how I like to paint I like to be able to focus on one part that time and finish it and then go on to the next one and it makes the project seem a little bit less big sometimes and because I do paint on larger campuses that's my way of being able to do a project without it being too big all at once I'm using a big flat tip brush and it gives that nice brushstroke sound that nice scrapes great easy-cheesy need a little bit more peace good nice day since I art is my occupation a lot of the time art projects do you tend to cause me stress partly because I'm trying to make everything as best as I possibly can days like today where I can just kind of chill out do a friend project and not have to worry about making it my group isn't it's done I am going it's like a code you don't have to do you let me know in the comments if you think I should make this like an ongoing series so we are painted a canvas flat this is dry enough so we go through a second Kurt I'm now adding the second coat of black paint this makes it more of a solid color and cleans up all the spaces I'm also painting the edges now we had paint to our palette and I put every color of the rainbow on there I also have sponges here that I'm going to tear into ten little pieces starting with the red I'm going to sponge paint on a small red triangle on the left hand side using the new sponge I'm going to add orange paint to the right of that making it a little bit bigger and then adding yellow paint we're going to go wider again then green paint again each time I'm using a new sponge next comes aqua and I'm taking this one up more going to a bit too smaller in size I'm going to add some blue paint and purple trying to curve up the top of it and then a dash of pink on the end and a little bit pink to the other side as well now we go over all the colors again since the basic shape is there we're going to make it more refined now and spread it out more into it you envision as a cloud shape just as a reference point puffy clouds tend to arch it more at the top and flatten out at their base now I'm going to dab white paint on top of the colors to add some basic highlights as well as just going back and forth with blending and then adding lots of color trailing off from the main color cloud and overall just having fun with it [Music] I'm finishing off with some dots of light green and white around the main shape making the dots bigger and smaller and just random and there we have it a cloud landscape of things and now you're going to paint this so as you can see it looks like not clear if you recommend trying it with the hairdryer the reason for this is otherwise it will take a very long time to drive and it might still be like a little sticky because essentially this is glue it's a cloud easy art the Mod Podge has made this nice and shiny if you try this up be sure to show me on Twitter or Instagram I wanna see how you guys taught me I do have my weekly golden couldn't give away oh yeah but should you like to win any golden pins please leave a nice comment down below I will not somebody next week and again this will change at the beginning of next year last year let's get the art ship golden pins thank you for watching and I'll see you again next time
