so just got the 20/20 point 12.6 software update which adds traffic light and stop sign control beta now if you currently have the hardware 3 upgrade and the full self-driving feature in your Tesla you should have already seen these traffic lights and stop signs showing up in the visualizations on the screen what this feature does is it adds the ability for the car to go ahead and stop at those traffic lights and stop signs to enable it we go to autopilot settings when the car is in park turn on traffic light and stop sign control beta a few things to note here it says that you will have to tap the accelerator or stock to proceed through all green lights blinking lights and off lights that's a pretty smart conservative decision there it will continue straight and will not make turns it will not control for all intersections therefore we must pay attention at all times including braking when the feature is enabled it will limit your autopilot speed to the speed limit of the road so a lot of people aren't happy about that it will be conservative it's gonna slow down often and over time it'll learn it doesn't work very well in all environments so we just have to pay attention and keep in mind that this is a beta so let's enable it I have cameras all over the car let's see how it works so it looks like we can set faster than the speed limit on a freeway so no change there six on the right so it's turning on the turn signal taking the exit one thousand feet turn left onto something he's very drunk now this exit has a left turn lane and a right turn lane I expect it's just going to kind of stay straight which would be that right turn lane even though navigation wants to take a left no actually it pulled over into the left side it's pretty cool it's pulling up and it's freaking out a little bit but it's stuffing hey that's kind of a I'd like really wide with a turn so I don't know so maybe that caused it to freak out a little bit or it obviously wasn't sensing my hands also so we're approaching an area where some versions of autopilot where there's an entrance ramp coming on and the road appears to widen this one's doing a really nice job in the past they have just jerked the steering wheel over to try to Center up in that lane really aggressively and it is just not necessary so this one's upgrade this next exit is going to have just a single lane that comes to a stop sign and we're going to want to take a left after that like the car thinks we want to go right right now so we'll see if they kind of just puts us in the center does it try to take us to the right she turns on the signal starts taking the exit 500 feet turn right on soprano road they stop in for traffic control now turn right onto Prado Road they came to a stop but again it kind of freaked out a little bit like it wasn't sure that I was still there all right this will be an exit ramp with a traffic light and several lanes and navigation was to take a left now turn left onto McDonald Road so it's not putting this in the left turn lane this time and it's just kind of keeping us straight interesting so didn't take the left turn lane which I wasn't expecting it to anyway it might have done that last time because it was a car in front of us possibly and then when I gave it permission to pass through the intersection there kind of freaked out a little bit so this next exit just has a yield sign at the end of it now previous versions of autopilot would just come to a stop at the yield sign so I'm curious to see if this one will roll through it is it turn signal on taking an exit in 500 feet turn around on to Monterey Street now turn right on to Monterey Street says autopilot navigation complete press accelerator to resume so that makes sense it's treating it like it's a green traffic light I tap the accelerator and it just moved on through we're still in autopilot speed limit set to the limit of the street we're on I'm gonna go ahead and tell it it's clear to go through the green and it just moves on through all right GoPro battery died on me so I had to stop and charge for a bit we'll see if it has enough to make it through the last section here so we're gonna go through downtown one thing I'm curious to see if it'll do is will it recognize crosswalks because even though that's not a stop sign or a traffic light we still need to stop at those so let's see engaged got the red light behind a car got a bicyclist over on the right side green give it to go ahead it's clear we're coming up on the crosswalk here just cruising on throughs to definitely no crosswalk recognition you need to go ahead again just right through the crosswalk which they don't claim that it stops for those there's just curious coming up on a yellow it looks like we're gonna pass through green I'm gonna use the gear stock this time works just like the accelerator clears the message and the car just rolls on it looks like we just lost the GoPro but that's fine we were about done anyway so I say overall I I like it you know it's kind of along the lines of navigate on autopilot it's good in some situations not so good in others I can definitely see where some people will just choose not to use it because it's not immediately that helpful but I do like that it shows progression we're getting some more baby steps towards full self-driving we have to walk before we can run and right now that means approving for it to go through even green light but next step we probably won't have to approve green light so it's it's cool to see progress I'll continue using it because without people training it it's never gonna get better and I hope others will too scenarios you'd like to try and thanks for watching
