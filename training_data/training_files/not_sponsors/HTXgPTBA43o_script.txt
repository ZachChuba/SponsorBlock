hey what is going on guys my name is Thomas Park and welcome back to another video today we're gonna be talking about what other VPN reviews do wrong now I'm talking about youtubers bloggers website corporate magazines like PC Mag etc I've been doing VPN reviews for around five years or so so suffice to say I know my way around the block I've kind of distilled the VPN reviews to an exact science I think doing better reviews anyone out there I'm not trying to brag I just honestly think that's the truth and I hope you guys here on the channel who have watched 60 plus VPN reviews on the channel might also agree today we're gonna be talking about what other VPN reviewers do wrong going through five things hey guys if you haven't checked done as well anyways guys back to the video so guys I think the number one problem most VPN reviews have is that at the end of the day they're less reviews and more just like regurgitation of marketing materials if you look a lot of Norview interviews for example the reviews themselves will highlight certain things like saying how Noor VPN has so many servers the fact that it's based in Panama or the fact that they have stuff like bug bounty programs and other things like that to kind of combat some of the security leaks have had in the past but a lot of these reviews don't talk about some of the other things about Noor VPN that are critical they don't really provide any criticism at all and a lot of ways it's not really a real review real reviews are supposed to be nitpicky and critical and talk about things that differentiate products from one another so that way whoever is reading it can decide which product depict the way most reviews are written are just they very rarely go too deep or analyze the VPN and what it's missing just kind of schemes over it and what the VPN does well that's not really review that's just an advertisement number two I think most reviews are very biased because they're trying to promote high ranked VPNs that have high commission rates and this will make them the most money so what I mean by this well there's a reason why almost every single VPN review site is rating the same top five VPNs the highest because these VPNs are very popular for one so people will know about them but they also have very good percentage of commission which means if they recommend the product they're gonna make a lot of money from recommending it a lot of the smaller VPNs that are actually very good stuff like tor guard we VPN air VPN IB VPN VPN area lots of others on the list that I can't really think about right now because there's 60 of them that are reviewed a lot of these smaller VPN providers are often cheaper faster have really cool security features and a lot of ways some of them like tor guard and maybe air VPN more secure than any of them out there but they don't get recommended because they only have 20 to 30% commission percentages which means that people who recommend them aren't gonna be making as much money this is a sad fact of the affiliate industry and if the affiliate industry had VPN affiliates have a standardized commission model let's say you can only I guess pay up to 30 to 40 percent for every single VPN I would expect that most of the VPNs themselves would be rated differently on sites from one another but then again there also could be undisclosed affiliate deals or sponsorships going on behind the scenes that could also negatively in fact I guess ratings as well so that could also be a problem if that happened and it's still a problem today with a lot of people recommending VPNs another problem is that good VPN providers are often rated incorrectly with missing features or inaccurate data in the review I've seen a lot of VPN providers say that they have problems would reviews out there because the people who writing the reviews are often they're not really that well versed in VPNs and they will miss details sometimes they won't update the reviews quick enough when VPNs push out new features and the people who are writing the reviews don't really want to update the reviews sometimes I've seen even youtubers mistake very easily seen details and give a lower score than necessary for certain VPN providers and this is very common like I said before most VPN reviews just regurgitate advertisement information they don't even hardly some of the times I don't think they even use the product so it's not surprising that they will miss features or present inaccurate data in their review itself number four I think most scoring system for VPN reviews aren't really relevant or modern or kind of good for the everyday consumer most VPN reviews are based off some false ideas and misleading advertising I think one example is that a lot of VPN reviews based the system of recommending VPNs only that are in five and 14 I outside of five and 49 countries which doesn't make sense because most people who are going to be using VPNs aren't people who are going to be targeted by mass surveillance now what I mean by this well what VPNs do is protect you against mass surveillance so every day you're using a VPN torrenting doing whatever you're encrypting your outgoing traffic the FBI in spy agencies can't really see what you're doing because it's obsoleted now however if you become some kind of terrorist or something like that and you're still using the VPN and a spy agency gets wind of it they're gonna target you and there's pretty much nothing you could do a VPN is not gonna hide you because they could go into the VPN they could force the company give up blogs or something like that maybe if it happens this doesn't happen all the time because most people are using VPNs aren't really doing that kind of stuff theoretically it could pretty much happen I think with every single VPN out there no matter if it's based outside of the five and fourteen eyes we've seen companies like peer VPN for example that are based outside of the five and fourteen eyes they gave up logs on a user but they didn't have to but the spy agencies were able to put enough pressure on them I'm just saying if you're using expressvpn and you're terrorists and you think it's safe because they're based on a British Virgin Islands well I hate to put it to you that's not going to do anything it's not going to protect you at all and you shouldn't be using consumer-grade VPN [Music] number five I think a lot of VPN reviews themselves stuff like written on VPN PC Mag some other magazines out there IGN seen that a lot of these reviews aren't really written by people who are being able to be honest most of time these magazines have corporate overlords and they have objectives and VPNs they want to push we see this all the time with stuff like IGN there's a lot of inaccuracies between the reviews some VPNs will be rated very highly in speed test and then they won't be recommended for gaming or something like that not only that but I've also seen stuff like PC Mag and some of these websites have a certain list of VPN providers that are fast but then next year they're completely different and the results are completely changed it's like what's going on you know why is there no consistency in reviews and I see this all the time and most of the time it's because corporate overlords of these magazines have decided certain VPNs to push and so they have to change reviews and the data to make their recommendations make sense if if possible and it's hard to do that like I said it's easy to find inconsistency number 6 I think that most reviewers skip over detailed analysis and data too quickly this makes it very easy to fake speed tests and fake metrics as well as not put things in a data-driven kind of analysis I see a lot of VPN reviews on YouTube showing speed tests and charts or something like that you know even if you have some kind of VPN speed test team or something collecting different users from around the world if you're just putting in a chart and not presenting evidence of people testing and what's going on behind the scenes then it can't really be taken for to be accurate data because you can't really verify it that's why in all my reviews I show speed test happening live so that way you know I'm not making up the data you know of course I could show screenshots in like that and edit the HTML and whatever but that's why I show it doing video editing because it's more authentic and more genuine and it makes it harder to fake which is kind of the main point why do youtube videos on VPNs and not just written reviews because it's it's a lot harder to make a fake review when you're showing yourself using it showing yourself filming it that's kind of why I do my review some kind of this first impressions kind of basis because it kind of gives you an accurate sense of what it's like to actually use the VPN itself anyways guys those are some of my on what VPN reviews do wrong perhaps some of these things can be fixed in the future but I kind of doubt it the VPN industry itself is heavily corrupt and motivated by money and I don't expect anyone recommending VPNs to really change that fact here on the channel we try to do things differently by presenting objective data analysis of VPNs as well as scoring them alongside a really good scoring system that value stuff like cheap prices speeds application extreme compatibility which a lot of VPN reviews don't actually even take into account so far as I know I have the only website out there that really promotes VPNs that are cheaper but also very good as well and not any other website has tested every single VPN for streaming compatibility and that takes a lot of work and I think it shows here in the results of what VPNs are the best make sure to check out VPN to your list and I'll see you guys in the next video very soon
