what's happenin B's and G's and welcome back to another episode of upgrade and unlock the series where things we do unlock further places in the map losing our hardcore status or dying after that loses places of the map as you can see currently this is what we have unlocked on the map all these squares that have nothing on them and then everything here with a number on it is a potential square that we can unlock when we do another action if you'd like to know all corner and you'll be able to watch the first episode this is episode 4 let's get into it the first thing we're gonna go ahead and do is unlock the tutorial island here because there was so many of you that commented saying you've already been there that shouldn't be part of the things you have to unlock and those comments got so many up votes as well so that's what we're gonna go ahead and do we're gonna unlock all of these obviously these squares have tutorial island in them so we're just gonna go ahead and do that and now this this this this this this all gets unlocked if we can unlock number 5 we will actually be able to do restless ghost the only reason we can't do rest this ghost at the moment is we can't go and talk to the brother or the father whatever he's called in there and we can't get it go speak amulet but if we can get number 5 unlocked and then we can go ahead and get another quest done and I've just realized that's not one of them now one thing that we're lacking a lot is runes and we're just gonna go ahead and claim some to start with oh we've got some in the bank I'm gonna have to go back to the bank and quickly grab those out we're gonna start stockpiling some runes because I really want to get this magic level up and to be honest we do have the Wizards guild or the Wizards tower even unlocked and we can get some wizard robes and stuff like that as drops which will help us in the future and it's probably the best in slot up at bowmen we could go to dark wizards but because there's level 20 dark wizards i don't really want to go over there just yet and they do drop better runes but as of right now i think getting a few defense levels maybe some attack and strength levels while stockpiling a few runes maybe a staff maybe some wizard robes will be the best thing we can do at the moment there we go straight away a blue wizards hat which is actually gonna give us a bit of magic defense because they did actually hit me quite badly and but there we go we get our to magic and a two plus attack magic wise which is gonna help in the future so really happy with that make sure we'll get these bones we want as much XP as possible but um yeah they did hurt me pretty badly so we can have to go get some food I want to try and work out how I can make some better food so looking at it the best food is gonna be fly-fishing once we do unlock that or the easiest food to get and obviously that's really good levels as well but until we unlock ports to rim we can't actually buy a fly-fishing rod so right now my plan is just a stock pile right here with some feathers get a load of feathers will obviously get some prayer levels here as well and we'll get some food from the chickens so compact the chicken pad seem to spend a lot of time here at the moment but it is gonna be really good for the future and what we need right so we just got 25 cooking which means we can now make stews they're a little bit annoying to make but if we can find a bowl I can use all the ingredients in this area so when you go have a look and see if we can find a bowl anywhere yep there we go so we buy two of these bowls here where I drop a few chickens we do need the chicken to the stews they are usable in the stews so although I'll hop probably get a few more bowls and we'll go ahead and make some stews he'll 11 hit points which is pretty good if we pick the potato use that on there that gives us an incomplete stew so go ahead repeat this process then we have to put a chicken in to the in completes G and then we have to go and cook that and to be honest probably gonna burn quite a few but they do give really good XP so it might be a quite a good way to get a few levels up at the moment and we could push that really I think is 112 XP past you or something so not bad at all let's give it a go and see how this is gonna go down not a great start okay we cook the second one cook the third 117 XP past you which is massive in the grand scheme of things at the moment just a shame we're gonna burn a few of these but 11 heals that's massive the stews are proving a lot better it means we can take way more hit so we can stay here for a lot longer got ourselves a start that is our first magic weapon and I'm trying to think of it I don't think there's any other magic weapon we can get at the moment so there's the best in slot until Varrick is open up a little bit more there is they blue wizard robe yes please coming on now I think that is everything that gives a bonus I don't think the robe actually does does it or the the legs whether you call them I'm pretty sure they don't actually give a bonus so that is a the best in slot magic is probably isn't and someone in the comments gonna be like you can do this and I'm gonna feel like an idiot but I feel like I've got best in the slot at the moment if we can cook the stews here then we can get the water there the potatoes there the cooked chicken here and then obviously cook them there but I'd it does say you have to cook it on a range and I know you can't cook potatoes unlike a fire and I'm not sure whether it counts this is a range or not so we're actually going to test it here if I burn all three I'm just gonna go with I mean it could be super unlucky and we burn all three but if we do burn all three I'm just gonna go with that uh we can't cook our stood on here not looking good there okay no we can't awesome I mean this is like the stew area then we have everything we need literally in this little area so that's good and that is our first ever farming level just from our raking weeds we can now grow marigolds now that we've got the best in slot for all the mage stuff and there's not much point in killing the Wizards anymore we might as well kill the dark wizards here and behind Draenor Bank they're only level seven which is really nice I'm not gonna hit us as often it might still hit us we'll see but they drop runes a lot more commonly oh we got the black robe exactly the same as the one we currently have on the blue one but a bit of fashion escape I like I don't know why I prefer probably the blue because he's got the blue hat at the moment that is level 20 defense coming in so we will now change to change to strength to get some strength to XP up because that's gonna make everything else quicker but uh there we go we can now buy some myth legs which we can get an hour career didn't get as many rooms as we were expecting but we are very very close to 275 which will obviously give us a new chunk so gonna go ahead and do that with magic here and hopefully there we go get the safe spot going and yeah this really shouldn't take longer to lose we're only a level 10 magic this this is gonna be super quick so two levels of magic and then we get that chunk and here we go that is the level 12 magic coming in nothing new that but of course the 275 total level taking us to a new chunk I'm gonna finish this kill off and then we'll jump into seeing what we get guys if you series so thanks very much guys and enjoy the rest of the episode let's see where we're going what are we gonna get oh we can't get in there yes we can't we can go up there Oh My yes that's huge let's just click that so we can see exactly what's there we get the magic shop we get the anvil right next to the bank we get the museum we could go and do the quiz because we can go downstairs Wow okay that's huge get hor Vick we get the sword shop we can now do Prince Ali's rescue um can we do no we need to unlock that to do the the Demon Slayer quest we get the Zap shop so we can now buy a better oh that is amazing that's so good right let's err I need to come up with a plan see what I want to do here while I'm here in Draenor now that Varrick is pretty much unlocked let's be honest the the stuff outside of that isn't really that important now that we're here we might as well buy a chronicle because it will be nice to be able to teleport over there very easily to be honest we are gonna get some magic that was pretty quickly here as well money is gonna become a bit of a thing we need now cuz I do want to start buying obviously the staffs and runes better sword better armor so money is gonna be something that we have to start thinking about now but while we're here let's trade with where is he there he is big man so we'll get the Chronicle and I don't know how much is a teleport card 150 umm it's by five for now and that will just do and now this is what this will do if we wield that I don't know if actually gives any bonuses I don't believe it does no no bonuses but at least it doesn't take up an inventory slot and if we just teleport takes us right to the champions guild and that is a chunk that we have unlocked so works really perfectly we can get from there to here pretty quickly now which is really really nice but let's go and see what the plans gonna be in peril now we could actually do this before we unlocked this chunk as Charlie is actually in the previous chunk but I thought you know what let's let's go for it and seems we have a bit more of this opened up maybe there's a chance we'll be able to do the second part but we'll have a chat with Charlie the [ __ ] and start this beginner clue says he needs a leather body I think we can buy one in here I didn't know that they can give you tasks I don't do clue skulls very often so but I think we can get a leather body here with vasilia or whatever she's called another body right gone then let's give this to him and see if this gets us further in the clue here you go mate nothing interesting happens okay maybe if we yeah I really need another body crafted by you I'll for [ __ ] sake Charlie you wouldn't have a clue if I craft it or not so we spoken with Orlando we effectively just have to go around the the whole of the museum and answer questions about each of the the exhibits and I've pressed the button by accident so we're getting a nice cutscene above a cow fight but if we click the study but there we go and luckily rune light tells you exactly which one to click on so this will not take a lot of time at all think that is it yes it is so that was an XP mouth hunter and Slayer thank you very much goodbye mate and that's gonna give us 9 Slayer and 9 hunter very very nice and take us to 2 9 1 which means we only need another 9 levels and we have another choke - ah - ah so what I'm gonna do is some of the majority of things I just don't think a bit need at the moment or things that just a useless and if we trade with ZAF I'm also gonna buy these for 8 coins all the hoes that's absolutely nothing and at the moment I'm gonna buy a fire staff because we are only level 1 level yeah one level away from being able to use fire strike so that may most sense to use that nothing else here from ZAF we can get we also need that pink skirt for Prince ali's rescue so we're gonna grab that sell that back because charlie won't bring by that office and then the sword shop hopefully we'll buy a few of these things so albury will buy these off us all 54 coins each that is naughty right they can all go back 1.2 K that's buy one error in pack that's buy 50 mines and I'll sort of just see how that does for now we will need a few more airs because we're using two but for now I just want to see where we're gonna be at so we're gonna cost win strike on this guy just to get our level and then we'll be able to cast fire strike once we get this level up there we go there is a level which means we can now cast the fire strike right one more magic hit and that is gonna be 300 total coming in I think what I'm gonna go ahead and do is attack this level seven first and what I think I'm gonna go ahead and do there is level 19 and that is 300 total coming in I think we're gonna see where this chunk goes and if it doesn't give us anything too great then I'll probably go ahead and do prince Ali's rescue which would then give us another chunk just cuz I've really need a square that's gonna open up that will make us money cuz right and how money is not easy to get by it really isn't and I really want something that's gonna do that I don't know what we'll to be honest but I need some inspiration right here we ago what it's it's time to spread out now and five would mean we could do a quest so that would be an unlock nothing really other than that unlock there though the mining spot and that's about it really so I wouldn't be over the moon at that but let's have a look at what we are gonna get oh [ __ ] hell absolutely sending it up this way nearly close to the the wildy now um does that mean I can start Slayer I don't know I think you have to do your tasks first in birth or I'm not sure um does open up a furnace close to a bank which is nice so maybe we could start doing some mining maybe if we mined there banked there got a load of iron together maybe and and started making stuff we could probably sell plate bodies for money that probably wouldn't be too bad a couple of new trees and we get the Edgefield dungeon ooh Hill Giants there's some mining spots down there which is probably closer than that I would say we have unlocked this area as well so we can get a brass key hop up out of there and as you can see there is a slight walkway there so we can go and back on that way okay I'm a proper IDEO obviously it was chris d'elia up top um in edgeville obviously we can't do that but if we do go down into the edge of your dungeon we have van acker and i think you need to be level combat 32 use van acker I'm not what I understand sure when we go past him we will have a look but obviously we got the mining we got the hill giants we got the moss giants we've unlocked bright though topia whatever that boss is called with 100 bore as well so actually really not bad the the dungeon really saved that so we'll head on over to Edgeville and just have a little look out while we're over here we did actually get this clue the easy clue search the coffin in Edgeville so that is actually a step we can go ahead and do let's see let's see what we get here and see if we can carry on doing it after this another easy clue think of the middle of the fear wheat field in lumbridge do we have this unlocked yes I can leave that for a later date for now and just cuz I want to get into this mining I brought a few students there's skeletons down there and I don't know if this is gonna be viable or not if it isn't we'll probably just use the the mining bit underneath barrack and banking Vera Kerswell but if we can do it here be really nice I'm gonna do tin and copper for a little bit because we do need to get 15 smithing before I'll be able to make iron and obviously I think if we go ahead and do I'm 15 at daggers but the real money's gonna sort of come around these levels where we can do things that are worth a little bit more money but uh that is the plan a few levels on the way mining and smithing wise and hopefully these skeletons aren't gonna be too bad yeah that definitely is a viable we're just getting a grows I mean you can keep mining while being attacked but um the problem is we just got I don't want to be wasting food I'm risking my HP like that but we will grab the brass key if I can click on it there we go and go out through the ladder and give ourselves an easier way in and out to the dungeon and to be honest I think the hill Giants might be something we are we safe spot because they're really safe spot I will drop a decent amount of stuff and obviously we can get o balky which we won't do net now but I later on in the account so mobile Keys might help so I'm just getting some things together we are gonna go ahead and do Prince Ali's rescue because I'm all out unlock a new chunk and as of right now I could see a great plan and this is gonna be the end of the quest big man has San thank you very much mate and that means another chunk for us to open up this is gonna do it let's just go I can send it here we go pick a random chunk and it doesn't do much for us opens a tea stall up yeah not the best of of chunks we're gonna got but oh well we definitely can't do that quest we actually can't even get in there cuz it gotta go around the back there actually no we could we could we could go in from the bottom but I'm pretty sure Karev what's called the depths of something maybe we'll have a look at it but I'm pretty sure that's not something you could do doesn't open up too much there get up Nome glider but I don't think that's unlocked at the moment and obviously we can't even go over there starting to really open up over the rock way which I'm quite happy about much better than opening up down the desert way but nothing too much to be unlocked so the quest is actually a Souls boom we could technically do it but it does say we need to kill level 45 plus monsters and to be honest at level 26 on a hard court I'm not feeling like that's gonna be worth it but if we do train our stats up a little bit that is another thing that we can go and do and get a chunk from excuse the mouse going nuts I didn't actually have an outro thing so I had to use a frame so enjoy that but guys that is going to take us to the end of this episode 300 total level the account really coming on and loads of things being unlocked thank you so much and like if you haven't already I will catch you [Music]
