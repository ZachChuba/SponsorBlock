a dude with a Fred shirt crossing the street and I swear to [ __ ] my auto pilot was like oh I better take my foot off the brake and step on the gas to run this guy over and I didn't do it but like I once I got my foot off the brake I realized like what just mike my gut had told me to do and I was like uh that is funny now do you think there's a reality where you would have hit that guy go to probably 150 s slow down and then a cop would have said don't worry you know something we checked his body at a fred shirt you're free to go you know this is the reality where i want to but it's not know this I like that Tomer me and Sachi ever tell you our Fred story no one time we were like brought into a YouTube networks like headquarter we let it tell the SEC I think they're yeah yeah I collect collective is like is like yeah I got bought out or something I think one day got bought out to they didn't [ __ ] follow up on their deal correctly I never got paid three [ __ ] them anyway

but it was basically that blood because it was like he can't the capture to like psych us up and we were just like dude yeah I think I also think he asked a question to us at some point to ask us like what do you so what do you tubers you guys watch I think we just like we really watch with you that well there I go you weren't the underdog so it's fine yeah now you're the underdog but yeah it was just kind of funny there's like yeah it was like a shiny table they were like yeah we represent Fred you know Fred yeah that's us okay and we have the Annoying Orange so that's pretty much like you're in the right place here was like this guy's this guy was saying all this behind him on top of a shelf behind him was this gigantic rubber annoy George head that was like a little bit folded into itself smiling I was staring at all this guy's talking all the time wasn't there some movie where raywilliamjohnson like pushes Walter jr. around in a wheelchair it happened yeah they can a film there
