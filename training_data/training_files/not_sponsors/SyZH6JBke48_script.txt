with bacon wrap double dogs
that's right we are building a better bacon dog by using two smaller hot dogs
instead of one larger one which we will merge together using the
latest cutting edge bacon binding technology
and for reasons we'll review later this really was superior
and great news for people like me who are just not comfortable putting two
separate hot dogs on one bun it just seems unnatural and i find it
disconcerting so with that let's go ahead and get
started and for this technique you're going to need two small regular size hot
dogs which are about two ounces each and then
we're also going to need two strips of preferably center cut bacon
and we really do want the regular thin cut style and not that extra expensive
fancy thick cut bacon which is nice with eggs and home fries
but for this the thinner cheaper stuff is better
and to create this we will take hot dog number one and place it on the top edge
of our first strip of bacon and we'll give that a little roll to
secure the piece at which point we will place on hot dog number two
and then take our bacon and wrap it around a little bit of an angle like
this and if everything goes according to plan
we should have just enough excess when we get back to the top to fit down in
between those two dogs which we will secure using the old
spread and tuck and at this point we should have half
our double dog covered and then to finish this we'll take our
second piece of bacon which by the way should be really cold
so it's easier to handle okay mine was kind of warm and flimsy
which makes it a little harder to control but anyway what we'll do is tuck
that end in right where we left off and then continue wrapping around and
again once we get to the end we should have just enough to tuck in
between those two links and that's it a perfectly secure
aesthetically pleasing bacon wrapped double dog okay so let me
show that one more time for the people that don't like to rewind
video in case you're wondering why is it better to wrap two smaller hot dogs
instead of just doing one four ounce hot dog well there's actually a couple very
good reasons and the first one is i find the bacon
stays on a lot better using two hot dogs versus trying to wrap two strips of
bacon around one larger dog since there's really not a good place to
tuck in the ends and then people end up using toothpicks
which not only makes the hot dog harder to turn i just think the toothpick
sticking out of a hot dog are a bad look but the other much more important reason
is that it's a proven scientific fact that round things do not brown up and
crisp up as well as flat things in a pan okay so by wrapping up two smaller hot
dogs like this we are creating a lot more flat surface area
to come in contact with our pan or grill which really is the major advantage of
this technique oh and i should mention if you're really
into bacon you can actually fit three strips on these if you want
although you do get more overlapping which means you're gonna have to cook it
a little longer to give that extra fat time to render
out so personally i think two strips is ideal
but you decide i mean you are after all the betty page
of this bacon binding stage but either way once those are wrapped
we can go ahead and cook those up in a non-stick pan set over medium heat
and you can just use a dry pan for this all right that little bit of fat you saw
in the pan was from an earlier test and then from here you could probably
figure out the rest of the procedure we are simply going to cook these on
both sides until that bacon with witches are bound browns up beautifully
and i'm just making two but the more you fit in the pan the better
and that's simply because you're going to end up with more fat in the pan which
is going to help everything brown and crisp up even better
oh and when i said cook on both sides i should have actually sat on all four
sides because we do want to try to brown those
edges as well which i do just by leaning one up
against the other and if you're really good you could probably lean both up at
once but anyway the point is we're going to
try to brown these all over which reminds me you can if you want to
do these outside on the grill although i do recommend using indirect
heat all right dripping bacon grease directly down on your coals can cause a
big fire and your bacon wrap double dogs will get
charred black and the people at your cookout will not be impressed
except for of course that one person who says they like it that way
right there's one of those people at every cookout you know who you are
or if you want to make things a little safer you could actually cook them
halfway in a pan where you will have a lot of the fat
already rendered out and then let them cool
and then bring them to the cookout like that and then when you're ready to serve
you can just finish browning them up on the grill
so that would work too but anyway no matter what method you use to cook these
make sure you are very happy with the browning of the bacon before you serve
these up all right not sort of happy like
absolutely thrilled which at this point i was so i went
ahead and served that up in a very well mustard bun
and yes i did use a slightly larger hot dog bun which was actually sold as a
sausage roll and then the official toppings for a
bacon-wrapped double dog are some pickle relish
and not sweet pickle relish dill pickle relish all right we're going to get
enough sweetness from the bacon and then we'll also do some diced red
onion and then last but not least some diced tomato
and that's it our bacon wrapped double dog is bacon wrapped double done
and that my friends was one of the best hot dog eating experiences in recent
memory just absolutely everything i was hoping
for and because of all that extra previously discussed surface area
and the fact that i really took my time browning this in the pan
that bacon was perfectly cooked and most of that fat had rendered out and there
was absolutely no flabbiness involved and by the way i'm not a big hot dog
toppings guy alright i usually just go with mustard
but because we're enjoying two dogs wrapped in that rich smoky bacon
the pickle onion and tomato really do work incredibly well
oh and i don't know about you but other than maybe potato chips
i think a nice potato salad is the ultimate hot dog side dish
and of course we have at least a half dozen very nice recipes for that on the
channel but anyway that's it what we're calling
bacon wrapped double dogs no matter what you serve these with i
think these will make a beautiful change of pace to the regular old hot dog
and whether you enjoy these inside or in the backyard
or tailgating before a baseball or football game remember those
but anyway no matter where you enjoy these i really do hope you give them a
try soon so please follow the links below
