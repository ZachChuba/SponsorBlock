alright guys welcome to another solo run I know you guys love this kind of thing let's get into it so I'm kind of desperate for content right now man like twitchcon kind of screwed me over it was a lot of fun and it was worth it but I got no content and it's been a long time since I upload a video and you know I'm struggling to get content man so hopefully I can pull something off man cuz I desperately need a break here so we got an interesting spawn nice little uh you know Moses bridge we got here hey everybody welcome back to another rust video so as you guys just learned I am doing a solo run in this video however midway through I do a duo with frost on a different server both runs go pretty well in terms of PvP however rust doesn't always work the way you want it to there are plenty of downs to go with the ups but overall I still had a good time so I hope you guys enjoy always shoot the ground with your first arrow after you craft a bow because it's got this weird glitch where your first shot from a bow is kind of delayed this man - four - he's a god I know you need to figure out where this revolver guy is before he figures out where we are it's the only way we win that fight okay I think I see him that's him for sure it was - mmm wait is it one guy he's being he's playing really weird no it's two guys together for sure I can't win that they have to be Pepe Gus I mean you only live once man I'm gonna put a stash shot next to my bag store this metal frags and stuff I'm gonna frickin go for that yep there they are coming for me I don't know where that guy's Rev is but Crossville will have to do for now I see him I win and that's why you risk it for the biscuit guys I'm telling you and you off thank you so much for watching guys now enjoy the rest of the video I want to make sure I'm not getting Jones but I got him find this guy's revolver if you like but I literally I can't find it yeah it's not here and I hear a bow guy I'm leaving alright that's pretty good start your sewer branch over there [ __ ] that's a long way but I feel like that would be worth going there cuz super branch is super good for solo I don't know how I dodged that guy but I [ __ ] did so I'm a lucky boy I guess Dubey here Tommy and stuff I think I'm just gonna slap down a base right here dude okay um another door a lock and a box wait can they do the box can't I need ten more metal Franks shits I think I'm gonna go for that man tough I'm gonna go deep oh this definitely gonna go like guys I need everything I can [ __ ] get that take my time with my shots with Python and not freak outstanding Python is a no-no it's like I have a pipe so I kind of want that [Music] [Music] we ain't boys oh okay guys hold on let me let me show you what I'm seeing this is what I'm seeing right now did you guys know that I'm actually playing a video game right now what a joke what the [ __ ] going on over here that sounds like outside though like close [Music] [Music] knew it oh there's three and when I was a [ __ ] Tommy just like that I lost both my kits in a few minutes so I decided to step back for a bit and mind my own business by going to go farm so I headed a train yard I need this too now I'm gonna go hit up sewer with the green key card [Applause] Jesus [ __ ] there's just so many grubs endless amounts of kids yeah like a set of the beginning of the video everything doesn't always go according to plan when playing rust and I really started feeling that struggle right around here what the [ __ ] in spite of all these losses I was able to catch a break you have to understand that this place was now a hot zone a grub nest if you don't know what that means it basically means that a fight has gone on for too long and all that's left is a couple like geared guys and a bunch of nakeds it's easier to third party the fight and make a play than it is to get out of there so I have this zigzag between the rocks and trees making sure I don't run into any nakeds with double barrels [Music] but as expected that break was short-lived I only had a handful of decent guns left I'd have to make a count otherwise I'm back to square one hey rust you guys should seal off the roof of drain yards so that that doesn't happen anymore because if you want your progression system that makes sense then make it so that mid to your loop requires a mid to your item which is a blue keycard and not just thirty low grade [Music] I can research med now foggers due to p2s I'm actually kind of down I like the P -
