if you guys remember we're actually on a continuation of the same hardcore world we started the last stream which i must say hasn't happened in a very long time that we have a world last this long but also we have all the blaze rods we already got all the blaze rods we need so we're actually like halfway there at least getting the ender dragon but i have gotten myself into a predicament in this world because i have once again gotten carried away building a house be sure to click on the link in the description so i have this half built house right now but the issue is i also want to get i want to get kind of decked out before i even fight enderman i kind of want to get diamond armor holy [ __ ] i was not expecting that okay so let's finish this up i think we're gonna have to go with stone and i don't have much cobble on me so i think this is the the part of the time or the part of the game where we start digging because this is going to be a permanent mine this isn't no floofy doofy mine this is the real what do chis do there ouch i'm gonna kill myself on accident here there we go the house is enclosed just like that that didn't take too long it's an interesting look compared to what i usually do not gonna lie but it's different and that's what makes it special so we back in the mines trying to get that diamond from said to side all right let's dig i hear some no no's yeah there's the i hear a lot of no-no's i hear a lot of no-no's and i really don't know if i want to fight with them right now i'm just gonna try to be smart about this i honestly don't know if they're actually like in the immediate area but i don't want to [ __ ] with them so i'm just going to close myself in and keep digging down it's not even diamond level yet so i really don't want to [ __ ] with it i'm kind of soft right now because i'm scared [ __ ] god damn the [ __ ] united [ __ ] states of [ __ ] america [ __ ] you just managed to sneak your [ __ ] green butt cheeks in here well here we are at our destination [Music] yeah this is kind of shitty here we ain't finding [ __ ] that one got me whoever did it you did it you know what i'm putting that piece of gold back uh i guess we can do this because look at what there is over here alright so we got a little bit of diamond here i don't think it's gonna be much more than three we got even lucky that we got that piece fart poop hot funny words like there's a lot of lava you know what we call this a lot of lava a lot a lotta lava it's our problem free philosophy there's a lot of lava [Music] getting ripped off i will say that this has probably been the worst diamond finding performance we've ever had [Music] ah we definitely got a four piece here oh oh well we have a five piece only a five piece yikes ah and on this day hold up i should just mine it right i shouldn't [ __ ] around i shouldn't need fortune or anything right if i make a crafting table though i might be able to get fortune maybe we'll leave them there for right now let's let's see how far we can get on a crafting table or enchantment table because we need bookshelves though all right guys i'm drinking the stew does everybody have their
