ways that the ball can travel it's extremely inconsistent sometimes the ball dies in the air sometimes it hooks off to the right or left or it just keeps sailing because of the wind and from the moment the ball is kicked the return man has less than five seconds to track exactly where the ball is going to land get to that location and prepare to catch the ball oh by the way you can't just be looking up at the ball in the air and plan on being able to run you have to have the ability to look down for a split second and track where the covers units at if they're too close fair catch if not you have to catch the ball and instantly react no one did this better than Devin Hester anytime he's ready at the 35 [Applause] backs up to his own thirty waits for a block here he comes again this time he did [Applause] devin hester had made a name for himself at the University of Miami he was one of the few dudes who ever played all three phases of the game for the U but more than anything he stood out on special teams what's interesting is Hester looked up to Deion Sanders more than any other player ironically Deon played for Miami's rival Florida State but these two were actually pretty close Deon even helped Devin out Devin even adopted a similar nickname in tribute to prime time they called him anytime what's amazing about Devin Hester was that he was projected to be drafted almost entirely on his return ability in college the problem was that this was only a small portion of the game to spend that high of a draft pick on just a return man that's a pretty big risk during the 2006 NFL Draft the Tennessee Titans planned on drafting Hester in the second round but they decided to stay away thinking it was too much risk the Chicago Bears on the other hand wanted Hester badly and they decided to draft him in the second round of the NFL Draft at the time the Bears took a lot of criticism from the fans in the media was this really the best they could do with that second-round pick for the fans who may have been upset at first that quickly changed [Music] [Applause] Neely's kick pressure kicked not even close [Applause] [Music] 40 pester at the 45 [Applause] really [Applause] and they do take a deep back to Devin Hester at the farm [Applause] through Hester's record-breaking rookie season the Bears have been dominant and possessed the number one seed in the NFC playoffs they marched right through the playoffs on their way to the Super Bowl so here's the setting it's Super Bowl Sunday the Bears versus the Colts my family is getting ready to leave to a friend's house to go watch the game but since we're running late we haven't even left the house yet and the game is literally about to start the Bears win the toss they decide they walk the ball first instead of getting in the second half that means the Colts had to kick to devin hester to start the Super Bowl as the kicker is setting up the ball on the tee my family had been waiting in the car to go my dad and I decided that since we had already waited this long we might as well just watch the opening kickoff before we leave just on the small hope that Devin Hester might take this one back the rookie who is so dangerous who went to college here at Miami we let the NFC and vote kickoff returns and punt returns and the Colts have had a hard time all season covering kicks it's Hester trying to work it back to the middle get past the first wave and here he goes it's history inside the 30 Hester is going to take it away from such town and no flag 92 yards this single moment cemented his legacy to football fans everywhere literally anytime he gets the ball he could take it the distance whether he was playing football for Miami or playing in a Super Bowl which happened to be in the same stadium that he played college in he could very easily take the distance unfortunately for the Bears they didn't do much after that return and would go on to lose leading to Peyton Manning's first Super Bowl victory so for any of you who have played Madden at any time in your lives you would know that the maximum speed strength throw power throw accuracy whatever it was it stopped at 99 one of my favorite things to do as a kid when I got the new Madden was to see who the fastest player was in the game usually it was a few guys up near 98 or 99 but mad no 8 Devin Hester had a 100 speed rating this had never happened in the history of the game Devin Hester had been so dominant the developers didn't know what to do so they felt this was fair what made Devin Hester so much better at returning kicks than any other player ever so after I went back and looked at all his return touchdowns in his NFL career his vision is off the charts once he sees a crease he instantly reacts combine that with his choppy quick-footed run style that allows him to make a cut at any moment while being much quicker than most of the coverage unit it was a deadly combination Devin Hester wasn't just some one-year wonder he was consistently great over the course of his career Dave with the plan maybe late in the game to get Mike but you don't make that decision on a thing Jim this early Canaan beautiful punt his Hesburgh retreats to the 38 and he's passed everybody except the punter he please his past him and it's Devin Hester's night his 20th career return touchdown the tribute to be on sentence of the high-stepping as he got near the end zone history that man right there genuinely wanted you and he prayed for you to break his records and he takes as much enjoyment out of its watching you this perform that's true then then you do I love it overcome with emotions right now because I told you I will do it I want you I love you as a man as a father as a husband I remember the beginning man I love you too and I'm so proud of you man I'm so proud you know that the Texas giving man you might not think you know because I know you sent it to a couple guys but you always been there for me man and not just at age 34 and years from his last return touchdown when it seemed like everyone had forgotten about Devin Hester the Seattle Seahawks were in the playoffs and decided why not and they signed Devin Hester who was a free agent at the time this was his final game he ever played like just there and see how much they're going to take out and deep in the end zone from the commercial team sucks that exact question does he have anything left and he said just watch he does 22 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
