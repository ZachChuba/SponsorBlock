for the past few years MSI has really been pushing the limits of how much power can be crammed into a small case and cooled properly with their Trident lineup now after making some truly small systems MSI has given us the Trident X a much larger version but also a darn powerful one rocking a core I 999 hundred K and an RT X 2080 so let's crack it open and see if the machine itself holds up to its impressive spec sheet and today's video websites like Amazon eBay and more get it today join honeycomb /l TT it's free [Music] from a distance the tried necks is a good-looking machine I appreciate the smaller size although it is unfortunate that it can't be placed on its side like previous Trident models for integration into a home theater setup after getting closer to the tried necks though things get a little less convincing like the front USB ports and their lettering is in red but then moving around to the GPU it has green accents come on you guys how did you not just swap these stickers for red ones and moving over to the other side things get even grimmer now I appreciate that there is a tempered glass panel here but how did this gap pass inspection and behind it isn't even painted also the CPU airflow cutout is kind of wobbly and then back over to the front these two RGB lights don't match why is this light in the middle so much brighter than the ones around it and why is the base such a different color why does this power button feel so mediocre and why do I have to point all of these things out now the tempered glass panel can be swapped out for a metal one and this is actually how the tribe necks comes out of the box so it solves the Tesla ask panel gap issue and also means that you won't have to worry about your side panel getting shattered when you're going to a lens so the bottom line is really this honestly the tribe mix is not a bad looking machine at all everything that I complained about was a little icky picky detail it's just the kind of thing that the Corsair one would have done right and I hope that MSI can fix these problems in the future since none of them are particularly big ones and there's a lot of good stuff here so back to the good stuff specs rocking an NVIDIA r-tx 2080 core I $9.99 hundred K 32 gigs of RAM this thing is no slouch and normally this is where I would say but can they keep it cool in a case this small the thing is though honestly I'm not concerned because the design is really solid first let's take a look at the graphics card well okay it's just that it's a full sized desktop graphics card with a nice beefy cooler and lots of access to fresh air this also means that upgrading the GPU in the future is relatively simple just take the side panel and top panel off undo a few more screws which might be the hardest part since one of ours came factory chowder's and you're good for the next gen as for CPU cooling once again before even testing it there are no concerns here this heatsink is massive and breathes in nice fresh air and the motherboard that's included is standard actually before we even get to the performance I should talk about the insides a little bit more I do wish that MSI had given the outside the same kind of attention to detail that they did here despite cramming so much Hardware in MSI has still somehow allowed all of it to be easily accessed upgraded repaired and with great cable managing to boot need to upgrade the storage well there's two two and a half inch bays right here and the second one even already has the power cabling done for you making an upgrade pretty much trivial need to change out the m-dot to drive well just open the other side panel to reveal this easily accessible and extremely high performance Samsung Drive the power supply is also a standard modular affair either in 650 watts in this version or 454 the twenty-seventh equipped model and replacing it is entirely possible with the only real bummer for upgradability being the RAM which is underneath the CPU heatsink now this does have the benefit of providing the RAM with a little bit of cooling but the real reason they did this is probably just that the standard 120 millimeter fan fit best this way and removing the cooler is actually still a pretty simple operation it's just the only blemish that we could find on an otherwise really well-thought-out internal layout so then performance as expected under a full synthetic load ri9 9900 k8 core processor has no trouble staying cool with temperatures peaking at just around 80 degrees fantastic and it stays well above base clock settling in around 4.3 gigahertz sustained that's even better than the corsair one and that one was liquid cooled the GPU also doesn't disappoint topping out at 60 and degrees and boosting to a sustained eighteen seventy-five megahertz and that's after half an hour of the 3dmark portroyal benchmark these are really strong numbers and even more impressively it does this while remaining very quiet like okay it isn't quite Corsair one quiet that thing is really quiet even under full load though I was hard pressed to hear the tribe necks over the HVAC in our office and I doubt it's gonna be annoying to anyone even if it's sitting next to you on your desk like this one is running a benchmark right now my mic is right here so all this adds up to then the tribe necks giving us well the expected desktop levels of performance you want a game expect heaps of frames you want to render a video well don't expect it to take very long basically you're getting bombed Hardware in a smaller case and you don't have to worry about building it yourself which I guess brings us to the make or break of any pre-built computer the price since at the end of the day hardware is hardware and there's nothing particularly special about what's going on in here now our recommended config comes in at 2500 US dollars which is a pretty good price especially when you compare it to the Corsair one but it's still actually about $500 more expensive than building it yourself which also gives you a little more flexibility and could result in you ending up with a system that looks more to your liking so the answer is as usual if you want to build a computer yourself yeah you should you should do that but if you don't want to build a computer yourself maybe try anyway it's pretty fun it's not actually that hard oh no no no this way ha ha ha ha and then if you're still not convinced well we actually really like the MS I tried next this is a really good option down below you will get $25
