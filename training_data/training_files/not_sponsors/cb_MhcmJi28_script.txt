Mohamud today were brought to you by upstart but I'll tell you about that later for now let's begin with what is and forever will be the Roper report for some news we have six stories today we're starting off with a brand new Star Wars Jedi fallen order trailer that just dropped this comes from in gap it's Igor B I Bri v8 it because I would butcher the mess out of their last name so I'm calling you the Igor B for the time being it reads after providing an extended gameplay look at Star Wars Jedi fall in order earlier this year EA and respawn have released a new story focused trailer for their upcoming action-adventure game the trailer opens with calc Estus the game's protagonist escaping from second sister one of the imperial inquisitors tasked with hunting down the last of the Jedi kal is saved by seer junda a Jedi Knight in hiding a Barretts pulled up the trailer here if you're watching on video Alex meaning you've both seen the trailer yeah I've watched it several times over number one the cow looks exactly like Archie Anderson Riverdale but he does besides that Joker in the Gotham right yeah I don't watch Gotham interesting what's the name of this lady right here oh can you pause I should go back to second is that uh Sarah Genda is that who that is I believe said somebody in one of the YouTube comments said that she looks like Mars from Simpsons hit and run do you do only one that sees that yeah I see it you see it yeah yeah yeah this trailer look looks really good it does it looks you know I was telling you in the car on the way over here that Star Wars Jedi following orders one of those games that it was announced is like oh let's go like excitement you know we haven't had we had Battlefront 2 and then we had way back we had force unleash you know yes swords like single-player Star Wars games we've been few and far between and so this one is like just like for me the the hype just keeps growing and yeah it's almost like it's like a silent type it's like you kind of have forgotten about the game at times but every time I see a trailer it's like it pulls me back in you know yeah and like I think this is the first trailer for this game that I've watched and I'm actually like very excited for what this game is going to be yeah like I saw the e3 footage and I've seen like the extended gameplay look and like watching both of those had me looking forward to the game but they didn't necessarily had me like oh let's go I'm ready for this but like looking at this action right here right whether his game cutscene that looks fantastic the bossfights look fantastic and that seems intact ik I know the gameplay from back in III made it seem like a more linear slow plotting like almost like a Dark Souls or like a Sakura shadows die twice because they had like the grappling hook and stuff they need to come off like it was gonna be more of that type of experience but like even in this trailer and from what we've heard right like it seems like it's going to be a bit more open in terms of going back to your ship and yep flying to different planets there's a scene in the trailer where it looks like it looks like from the pant playing at so yeah you can see what planet you want to go to and in fly there I think like all of the the environmental puzzles that they're teasing like with how you interact with the environment with your force powers that's really exciting for me oh yes it's just something to break up not the monotony but like you know you're doing more than just you know get in fights yeah you're doing more than just like the linear' like okay I'm gonna walk down this corridor I'm gonna fight some more eel yeah it seems way more involved and I don't know I I'm very much looking forward to this game EJ writes in and says you know Star Wars Jedi fall in order looks good but I'm still on the fence about the game I was thinking why this it why this is and then I realized oh it's EA it's the first one for it's a first for me to be hesitant about a game because of a publisher just because I don't know what shady [ __ ] they will try to pull post-launch maybe the game will be four hours long which personally I don't mind I'm not a person that believes a 60-hour game should be at least 15 hours and anything under that is a waste but I feel like EA will do something shady post-launch there is a trend to add a loop boxes to games two to three months after launch I can't help shake the feeling EA will put a lot of cool [ __ ] in this game after launch and it will be randomized and so EJ here thinks that uh that this game being in the hands of EA is probably going to mean that post launch we could very well see some micro transit microtransactions and loot boxes and that stuff not implemented well his game as we've seen before especially Star Wars games yeah battlefront 2 was you know was kind of a mess at launch and I believe that they went back and like changed a lot of how that those systems work and battlefront - from from recollection but yeah I don't know it I think single-player games like we've definitely seen stuff like shadow of war wasn't it weren't there some interesting yeah what's there saying that in I didn't it really depends on us because okay some people be like yeah the microtransaction stuff in that game didn't hinder the experience much but then other people will very well tell you that the end game of that game was like ridiculous yeah yeah I don't know I'm I I definitely I definitely understand the hesitation I think that's totally in your right to do I'm not so hesitant I feel like who was EJ yeah they referenced the apex legends during yeah it'll unaware they there's a something called the iron crown collection event and essentially there was a very rare item locked behind a series of loot boxes that you had to purchase and I believe that if you added all of it up all the costs up plus the purchase of the actual item you're trying to unlock it was looking over 200 dollars I think in that case there was some there was definitely some right some some rightful backlash I think as far as like hey this isn't cool but yeah I don't know I to me it wasn't the biggest deal because it was cosmetics and and I think those are a totally optional way to play a game yeah and maybe maybe that's like maybe those work their way into fallen order I'm not sure but yeah - finish it - finish EJ's question here right he continues to write I know it's a respawn I know it's respawn making it I mean they said that stuff won't be in the game but hey apex legends $150 loot boxes happened and as a Call of Duty as d Call of Duty developers said about their ps4 exclusive deal quote some things are above our pay grade so in the end EA will have final say on what goes into fall in order and ER yeah I think I I definitely understand the fear here and I think like I feel similar ways in terms of the fact that like I'm really excited about saw we should have fallen fallen order especially after watching this trailer right like yes like all this appeals to me like I really enjoy Star Wars games released some Star Wars games enjoy the last well the last couple battle friends but you know you like to franchise that yeah like og battlefront on ps2 like battlefront - one of the great female time Thank You yes our most bout front twos is for sure in my top like top 30 for me yeah um and you know I want I really want this game to be good and I really want to love this game and I expect like this game is being developed by respawn and Henry spawned put out apex legends wonderful fantastic game right they also put out titanfall 2 wonderful fantastic game right and so like you know I think there's also a difference in a live service game and a single-player game as far as you know with a game that is ongoing constantly being updated something like apex there there's more opportunity for that sort of stuff to to kind of come to head right yeah whereas with something that is you know more single-player I feel like yeah sure they could they could patch it but if there's if they're saying that that stuff isn't in the game I want to believe them you know that mean I want you but this is one of those cases where like I think for me as a consumer mm-hmm I'm probably a way for reviews I'm probably going to wait for this game to come out and to actually get a clear idea of what this game is going to be yeah because like history has kind of presented like hit history tells me that yeah there could be some non favorable microtransaction implementation into this game sure yeah I wouldn't put that past this game for the for who the publisher yeah but at the same time right like knowing that it's respond I'm I'm I'm on kind of torn yeah I'm torn right I'm pulling with in between two places yeah but do you think you're probably gonna get star wars Jeff Jeff all in order yes I'm not sure if I will get it launched just because the onslaught of games like there's a lot of games coming out the week before that are the two weeks before that we're getting the outer worlds then we're getting oh Luigi's Mansion 3 yeah somewhere in there is general somewhere that do internal training in this it's a busy fall yeah I want to get it I'm just not sure sure what if I have one if I have the time to I don't know so you Star Wars person yes yes I'm not I'm not that I'm not like Barrett level Star Wars where you know he's watching the Star Wars rebels and and all this stuff and yeah the book that's not me I am more so I grew up on Star Wars the original trilogy so I had like fandom there but as far as like extracurricular universal stuff in the France it's it's not necessarily my forte but I'm very excited for a new Star Wars game Barrett you've seen the trailer yeah how do you feel about the story elements from this trailer do you like have you been following with following what's been going on in the story and the narrative of this game I mean like I the obvious one it's like it's a couple years after episode 3 so that that's really interesting because there's such a big gap there hmm and I think the only like to like Canon movies that we've had so far that take place in between Episode three and four are solo and rogue one and neither of those really deal with like the like the Jedi side of things it's like Han Solo and then it's about the rebellions who aren't force users and whatnot so this is really interesting to have a story closer to Revenge of the Sith and we're Jedi are being hunted down and whatnot and I didn't realize that it was the second sister who is hunting down the I forget the lead characters kal kal like I didn't realize that that was an Inquisitor which the inquisitors are like a big story element in rebels I think in a season or two or maybe the entire series it's been a minute but yeah I'm to be fair I'm not that I'm not like that I'm sorry I'm not like reading like the comic books or like like a picture or what like I'm very much like I love the movies I like finally caught up on the Canon TV series like last year and like I like the video games whether they're can and still or not like I really like fortunately you shouldn't show like that so okay I'm I'm really excited to see finally like a story in Canon cuz for some leases now no longer canon I believe of like something in between Episode three and four because there's so much like interesting story of Jedi's being on the run like one of my favorite when I did read the books way back when when I was in middle school there's a really interesting new series I don't know if it like last really long but it was about obi-wan during this time trying to find other like Jedi who survived and there's just like a really interesting concept so story wise yeah I'm all in awesome when it comes to microtransactions I don't like yeah because it's he AI could see it but again it's like one of those things where it is like a single so it's not like a pay to win over someone else it's like a it reminds me of the Assassin's Creed Odyssey thing where they had like the little micro transactions of like XP boosts and stuff like that which I like I don't really like care if that's like how you want to like play experience and play your game like that like I think that's fine if they add cosmetics like that's totally like up to you and like on you and I think Lea yeah so i'm except number two there is an update on the Last of Us part twos multiplayer and this comes directly from Naughty Dog's Twitter they tweeted out like in image with a bunch of text yeah and it reads we wanted to address multiplayer in the last was part two as we've stated the single-player campaign is far in a way the most ambitious project Naughty Dog has ever undertaken likewise as development began on the evolution of our factions mode in factions of trim familiar is there multiplayer mode our factions mode from last was part one the vision of the team grew beyond an additional mode that could be included with our enormous single-player campaign wanting to support both visions we made the difficult choice that the last was part two would not include an online mode however you will you will eventually experience the fruits of our teams online ambition but not as part of the last was part two when and where it will be fully realized sorry it will be realized is still to be determined but rest assured we are as big a fan of factions as the rest of our community and excited and are excited to share more when it's ready Naughty Dog okay how do you feel about that Alex because I know like me and you played factions together among the last was part one a little bit and I really enjoyed it I think you enjoyed it yeah one of my favorite games and Gears of War and I felt like factions did I miss at fractions this isn't a math game uh uh factions they didn't you do a lot of dividing though oh yeah you go yeah but yeah so like it's a it's a mode where in like I think you mentioned yesterday on the show where you can you can listen and use those kind of mechanics from the last of a single-player game but though I love the the format of it where and I believe it's it's one kill and you're out of the round yeah I told you out of the wrapper mode yeah yeah I love that and and that that ties back to my love for gears but this is very exciting to me because I was definitely one of those people I know there's been you know discourse online about like oh you know it doesn't really need multiplayer I think a lot of us do enjoy the Last of Us multiplayer though like you said yeah and I don't know I'm really excited yeah frankfurter writes in and says good morning blessing and Alex yesterday you and pear had a good discussion about the fate of online multiplayer for the last was part 2 and his future possibilities there was also a good discussion on the subreddit about how the best friends felt later that day Naughty Dog released a statement that we will eventually see an online mode slash game of some sort but that it may not be the last was related do you think multiplayer will be added on to the last was to after release or will we see or really see some sort of new IP from Naughty Dog that will introduce a Last of Us esque multiplayer with with other modes interested interested on what you think will happen thanks again for all you do Frank Furter I have a question for you yeah how integral is the lore and the characters of last of us to the factions multiplayer not not really like there's anybody out there like oh I just I'm playing as droll let's do yeah and we hear a lot of things you're playing as side characters right well you're playing is like unnamed that's what I was yeah you're not playing as any of the character okay there you go I think you I think you do in the Uncharted most play are not played much of the you do play and yeah yeah unlocking names and the next thing like in the last was multiplayer right like the characters aren't integral really the story is an integral the world is kind of intact it is but it's not like you can't take those same mechanics and put them into a different world or like it make make like a different story around what's going on there like it could even still be post-apocalyptic but maybe not in the last list maybe it is like a different type of apocalypse and I don't mean I don't mean to bring the game up so much but apex we saw we spawn take the titanfall 2 and Jimmy yeah and make it into a new IP yeah it is and it's starting of the universe yeah it's still the titanfall world right and I feel like that's worked out swimmingly for apex yeah for respawn but I would love to see something like that and give them a chance to expand their portfolio and and yeah maybe it's tied in to the world maybe it's not but I think at the end of the day it comes down to you know the main mechanics and main systems of that multiplayer mode crafting the one shot one kill so not that much I won't kill though the one death yeah kill you down and out yeah those sort of things I think are what make that experience so fun and so I feel like they could get really creative and yeah maybe it is the Last of Us universe but I don't know yeah I feel like it could be bigger than just a multiplayer mode if they do yeah you know because I'm looking back at this last paragraph they right right they say however you will eventually experience the fruits of our team's online ambition but not as part of the last was part 2 when and where it will be realized so still to be determined but rest assured we are as big of a fan of factions as the rest of our community and are excited to share when it's ready that nothing about that tells me that this is going to be the last list yeah yeah very it was very like non-committal as far as yeah it starts like what IP or what the game might be I think it's exciting I also gets exciting especially for talking to pear yesterday on this show he actually like floated the idea that I didn't think about the fact that like this console generation is almost over yeah right you imagine the PS 5 comes out next fall and so you know what's the point of releasing a multiplayer game it's gonna die off if it's going to die off in a year right next way you imagine like last was part two whether it is through backwards compatibility or a a re-release of some kind right is going to make its way onto PS 5 and so like you know it could be a thing where they package it with that right they pack in the lastest part 2 or it could be a thing of like yeah like when we released last was part 2 we do that and then maybe a year or two later we release whatever this multiplayer thing is gonna be that takes the heart and soul of the last part last was part two factions mode I think I mean either way I'm pretty down for my one fear would be the fact that like you know you talked we talked about apex legends in compared to that right apex Legends is a free-to-play game yeah and one of the issues I did have with the last list part ones multiplayer mode was the factory line yeah it was allure some aspects of that yeah it was there a little bit of the paid win illness it was a shotgun specifically that I remember just being frustrated by because the wild weight just draw me you can see them like coming like Oh and like I don't know how much they I have faith in Naughty Dog as a you know storyteller and or developer of single-player games right and I mean they do good good job with more player two but I don't know how much faith I have in them as far as like making a games as a service if that is what a multiplayer focused thing is you have to be from them I think also like this wave of games and service titles really kind of got started after the Last of Us released mm-hmm came out in 2013 I feel like if I'm not mistaken like that wave kind of started with like destiny and like 20 I think it was 2014 yeah that was like definitely a big like a big yeah and I feel like we've come a long way and and I think like the industry and community has been very outspoken about expectations now you know I think I think they they are I think they can certainly learn from what they did in the first game I got yeah I'm not really too worried about that honestly good number three there is a weird pokemon sword and shield livestream announced for next week this comes from Kevin knezovich over on GameSpot it reads power source art power pokemon the story I don't where I got power so an hour started power source on weapon yeah pokemon sword and shield are less than two months away in the Pokemon company is hosting another live stream ahead of the game's launch the next one is scheduled to begin for next Friday October 4th but it will be a little different from previous streams beginning at 6:00 a.m. Pacific time in 9 a.m. Eastern Time the Pokemon company will broadcast 24 hours of quote live footage from glim would tangle a forest area in the gala region the stream is presented as research being conducted by Sonya the professor magnolias assistant and granddaughter to observe Pokemon in their natural habitat I don't know if you've been following Pokemon at all I I have I'm looking forward to the game it's I'm one of those people I don't like seeing the Pokemon I know they love to reveal those yeah I don't want to know the Pokemon that are in the game I'm definitely of those people who and I it's been a let me clarify for people who aren't aware so in a long time since I've played a Pokemon games like this and so same I'm very much going into it like with I want to try to rekindle that excitement that I had as a kid and not know what is in the game and I know a lot of people love to know that so it's totally cool but I have kind I've taken a step back as far as like the coverage goes yeah but I don't know I'm wondering how they're going to do it 24 hours yeah that's the thing one zone yeah I'm like do you have like he and here's this have 24 hours worth of like content to show here is my prediction okay this is the area I believe we're like you can just see kind of Pokemon roaming free and [ __ ] right I wonder if it's not them playing the game like I wonder if it's just like a character hanging out and you just like it's like a 24 hour like kind of like the ambient but like like you just walk laps in a way yeah knocking these better learn just exists in their environment yeah now kid that would be very creative yeah yeah and especially like if like the systems that they have at play in this game like support that sort of thing right like if this is the type of Pokemon game where it is like yeah hang out and like wash these Pokemon like Rome around and interact with each other and see like see like a wild Pikachu just murk like a sob oh yeah Wow survival of the fittest changed yeah I mean I expect there to be new Pokemon reveals I expect that's really all I can really say I'm like you where I haven't played Pokemon for a while like I'm play played let's go yeah we did play let's go peek but that was kind of like a different experience yeah and that was like you know it's pokemon red yeah kind of that really I haven't played a new Pokemon since probably like Ruby and Sapphire yeah and I'm really looking forward to this one mainly because I am ready to like get back into it and so you know this stuff sounds interesting and yeah just so you know Pokemon fans that's happening number four Mario Kart tour smashes records on day one hits 10.1 million installs this comes from Adam blacker on app topia and it reads Nintendo's Mario Kart tour launched yesterday racking up 10.1 million downloads globally this is record breaking for mobile game launches on their launches Super Mario run the iOS only launched generated four point seven million downloads in Pokemon go the previous record-holder did about six point seven million downloads and as an update from sensor tweet or sensor tower they report that Mario Kart Tour has actually been downloaded 20 million times as the wire time of reporting yeah Wow it's on the way over here I downloaded the game to try it out mm-hmm because I knew it was coming I didn't realize that it's kind of you're kind of like on Rails and you are you're drifting back and forth so as far as the game goes I'm curious what the reception is gonna be from yeah 20 million players yeah what their expectations are compared because I mean you look at you know Mario Kart deluxe yeah like that which there's a game there right and like it yeah when you come to Mario Kart you come for like I imagine for the most part for the full experience and I know that since this is on mobile people will probably have those expectations kind of roll back sure sure yeah yeah but this is interesting especially because like I feel like from what I've been hearing and seeing from people a lot of people aren't really feeling the game but also we're kind of reminds you of the launch of Pokemon go a little bit because I know Pokemon go at launch wasn't the best experience right because like there a lot of server issues I know a lot of people were upset that like the battling wasn't there right I like it was trading wasn't training wasn't there right and like oh it felt underdeveloped for what you wanted it to be for like a Pokemon game that's supposed to be like pick take place in real life and whatever yeah this is kind of struck me a similar way of like oh yeah it's a Mario Kart game that from what I see cuz I've only played a little bit of it so I don't want to critique like fully crewed ticket myself and I can't really say I'm here thing but like from what I've seen people say people aren't loving it but I mean the game I mean looking here right the article continues is uh it reads impressively Mario Kart tour I said the number one overall rank in the iOS App Store in 93 countries the game has a four point seven rating on iOS in a four point three rating on Google Play so maybe I'm just completely off in terms of yeah I feel so yesterday my brother texted me to download the game and I think there's also a misconception that I thought this game was a multi player we were in the car over here and I think it seems like it might not be yeah Tim was talking about this on games cast okay that like it seems like it's trying to trick you um I think Greg looked this up and yeah the game isn't multiplayer but it presents itself as being multiplier especially like it matches you with what looks like other players with their own usernames and like a lot of usernames I like you know written and different like maybe in Japanese characters some like weird like I forgot the bear did you say that there was this one I wanted the players I played against like yesterday I was just like Gucci yeah versus like Nintendo making up these like weird like names or these like actual user names that they're just putting on top of like boch or whatever yeah it's confused it's full shades here yeah I don't know I don't know how I feel about that but I think I think it does it not be multiplayer for me personally saps a little bit of the appeal from the game but I mean 20 million players is no joke I think a lot of it they were at least on iOS you you could pre-order the game looking pre-downloaded or something like that yeah I think you could pre-order and then once it once the game or something some early morning time hit it would auto download to your phone your iPhone I think that might play into how many downloads are on this are ya know it here I know Mario Cart it was like a super popular game in general right and so yeah you know you're pretty you're putting what is already a game that is going to sell like crazy on to a wider platform as far as install base right Android in Apple right like it is it is a recipe for blowing up yeah absolutely and so just to continue the article a little bit cuz I think there's some interesting tidbits here they write how does it monetize here's the quick and dirty ads no in-app purchases yes purchase characters carts gliders loot boxes etc subscriptions yes a $4.99 a month Gold Pass with and they have a free two week trial which unlocks the extra fast 200 and 200 CC mode obtain additional in-game rewards from racing and gain access to bonus goals and exclusive bonus goals exclusive to Gold Pass holders and so I mean I'm interested to see what the numbers will be as far as like you know sales numbers for this game right like what these micro transactions and the gold memberships are stuff like what that pans out to if our gold pass I'm here this is me interesting yeah very fresh it's fresh yes we got I'm very curious and we're talking on an earlier episode about like Nintendo not necessarily having like the best run with their mobile effort yeah and so this might be a when despite like mixed reception yeah I don't know the game I don't know number five capybara games co-founder Nathan Vella's leaving the studio after 16 years and this comes from Alyssa McAloon on Gamasutra Alyssa writes nathan Vela one of the one of the founding devs behind below developer capybara games is departing the Canadian studio he helped found back in 2003 Vella made the announcement on Twitter earlier today sharing that the shift will ultimately see him departing both Cappy in the city of Toronto for a position at a

attention to comments and what a lot of people like I think Greg talks about the vocal minority all the time right like yeah there's a lot of negativity out there especially like especially in the gaming community and so like yeah I feel like we need a reminder that like great things like this can happen right and yeah people you know go out there support you know find somebody who you want to support it looks like ooh Barrett looks like yeah I'm gonna yeah because there's there's breaking news oh yeah no I mean I mean to wrap it up right you know be good to people um and this is this is an example of how to be good to people right support streamers that you think deserve to be supported go out there the others were disabled underscore Tron right yeah on Twitch if you want to find their channel and put them right super cool that's awesome I guess I'm adding a seventh news story because there's uh oh wait really yeah are you serious it dropped right when the show starts okay go back to let's go back to the tweet me so a number seventh news story um comes from apex legends Twitter and we're being Alyx really excited about this because both of us really love apex legends we have an apex legends podcast yeah um this tweet reads welcome to the world's edge a new apex legends map where molten heat and chemical ice collide join our cast of legends including the newest legend crypto on the dropship as they as they're whisked from Planet solace toward towards the world's edge on planet Talos let's go we can go dude I knew map we cuz like we didn't think it was gonna happen oh we did it like we thought yeah alright whoa okay so I'm watching that bears pulled up the trailer for PBS are watching on video it looks like it's a new garage sit on a couch or on a ship together it's a CG cinematic and it's like they're setting up what the story is going to be all the heroes are together on the ship yeah man I'm so excited - dude that's all show me the map show these damn I said molten ice and molten yeah so there were leaks data miners had to have brought up that they thought I was gonna be called fire and ice but it's called molten what does it call me yeah crypto the new hero crypto and if you're familiar there was that there was a CG trailer that came out earlier I think what either earlier this week or last week it was like could we talk about it yeah where it kind of showed off holy cow it introduced the character of Krypto who I believe like has a sister yeah so like Chris's backstory it looks like his sister was kidnapped or something like that and crypt was kind of getting revenge so in the CG that were watching right now the heroes just dived out of their planes land on this new map right and yeah there's water geysers they're shooting up from yeah frozen areas is frozen area of Awesome this oh my gosh also they do a really great job with their cinematic they do it's like if you're if you're not familiar right overwatch does also similar things where like you know when they were they whenever they introduced new heroes they have a new CG cinematic that they show off right and it's really good they do a really good job of fleshing out the characters and making those great apex legends kind of does a similar thing they do different art sounds it's definitely a way different arc style right yeah but this is this is looking very exciting yeah this is looking I think one of the things about Kings Canyon which is the current apex legends map is that as far as like biomes go it's a little OneNote and this is almost like adopting like a philosophy like the fortnight right it is you have all sorts of different biomes on the map and it's got every every playthrough feels I feel like I feel like very interesting like you can and snow in the desert in the grassland and this is very much kind of bringing that vibe the season 3 frame season you love to see it melt down yeah and we I think we're trying to figure out what melt down men

wild October 1st it just so soon it's awesome let's get into viewer questions arvo underscore cry night critted writes in and says hi blessing and Alex first of all this has been an awesome week of content blessing thank you thank you I really appreciate that yeah a great job thank you I appreciate the very good job now it's my question today has been the release date of FIFA 20 to my knowledge this is only the fifth game that EA has released for the switch so far next to PHA unravel - in FIFA 18 and 19 when I saw the cover of FIFA 20 today I was shocked to see the label legacy edition which means that only statistical updates and team up team updates have been made compared to last year's edition but given the fact that the switch version is not based on the Frostbite engine as with the original version of the game in that frostbite hasn't been ported to to sweat to the switch after two years do you think that EA will ever support the switch eventually within its lifecycle thanks for the thanks for this great week our Ville well I remember about a month or two ago there's an article that came out it was an interview with with a rep from me I believe kana pani calm / you're wrong and they essentially said that they were not necessarily prioritizing the switch because they're like their audience would rather play their games yeah ps4 or other other platforms and so I think that was very clear as to what their their priorities are at least right now yeah and like I I remember hearing that quote and my mind being like or my heart being like that can't be true yeah like FIFA on the switch sounds like a thing like that should sell the Sims on switch sounds like something that yeah [ __ ] especially yeah yeah um and what looking was our we'll talk about up here talking my FIFA yes yeah and Fame but um I feel like sports me want for sports games on switch feel like something that that that should so well but my mind tells me that like they probably have the numbers yeah like they probably like done the number crunching I feel like also sports games are really lend themselves to like couch co-op sort of play like playing with your buddies and and granted you can you can do all we have my sports games sports games yeah okay I know my great I don't know okay I play a lot of online feel do you okay yeah but also like you know there is a lot of potential there for couch camp like yeah and I say that because that's the only reason I ever play sports games yeah and I mean that's it that's I think a lot of people get put on to sports games through like couch co-op you're my buddy sounds play yeah because I remember in college it was a huge thing to go over to the homies house and we played FIFA a lot okay like FIFA was our thing that we didn't write that and then like eventually turns into fighting games in Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter by didn't play my Street Fighter because I was very bad a Street Fighter and Tekken uh stuff but like you know sports games couch co-op in 2019 I don't know much I mean I don't know it could like it could be a thing where it's still happening like I'd ever know they don't have my brother-in-law will you know invite people over to hang out and play fifa right and so like I'm sure it's the thing that's still happening I'm sure that like that's still a huge like a big way in which a lot of people play the game but yeah online prevalence of online clips online is definitely a good thing that people do okay yeah and so like I don't know if EA will ever go full fully in on the switch I think they'll come around that's my yeah II think so I mean I think the attach rate from what we've seen is like super high and like their there are it's just like the switch is constantly like having double use and like yeah it is growing like this or switch audience is is only growing yeah the switch is selling like crazy I think eventually you have to like look at that platform and say okay maybe they're they there's a way to bring our games in a smart way yes which and I would like to think that that's why ei thinks but he is such an interesting company because like they very much stick to like kind of what they do yeah because like if you know if I had to like play which will call like armchair quarterback or whatever right for ei I'd be like dude like you know make exclusive switch games if you don't if you if you feel that porting these games to the switch it's just going to put people off because like people rather play the other words because they're the they're the better versions right then like you know do like some I don't make NBA Street for the switch right more like like you know sort of like exclusive like switch titles because there's and make it from the ground up for the switch so that you don't have that problem of like you know an inferior version yeah I I feel like you got me very excited when you said NBS but I don't think there's I don't think that that's what EA I don't think that's the way they think yeah yeah we could dream though we can dream for sure BJ Bernardo writes in and says hi all I for one welcome our new okay beast overlords in blessing great job this week thank you so much BJ Bernardo and I to welcome the okay piece overboard to the kind of funny I love storytelling in games a man after seeing all these story game trailers am I excited for what's coming so I asked you guys is storytelling in games the best it's ever been what story are you most excited to play through out of all the upcoming games what's your favorite story lining games thanks BJ mmm good question yeah I think one yes I think storytelling is better than it's ever been I agree especially with like the prevalence of like the indie space in like way more diverse voices having access yeah having actually the ability to be able to even like just tell a story whether it is through like you know something like undertale what is like a I want to call it a JRPG why no it's not really a JRPG but sure it's a it's a RPG inspired by games like earthbound right that game has such an interesting fun quirky unique story that it tells it's great right or you can look at something like gone home where it is like a walking sin that is meant to really engrossed you into this environment and tell you this slow plodding story through yeah that that isn't bogged my combat isn't bogged down by extra mechanics right they're just they're just like hey explore this house have fun learn what's going on here right like totally the ability to do that has allowed videogame storytelling to come such a far away not to mention stuff like dating simulators and like you know doki-doki literature clubs is the circular yeah you can get like really you get some really unique again now and and as far as like you can also get you know the Last of Us yeah and and leg is triple-a again on the triple-a side right like technology has come such a long way that like you can see like the facial expressions in the last was part two trailer yeah like you couldn't get that right on the ps2 right you couldn't like really like feel you know what was going on in in Ellie's head right the way to do in the last was part two trailer um and that's only because like video game technology is coming far far away along with like the fact that like yet like a lot of people horses in the space more voices different types of ways to tell stories with different genres on stuff yeah so yes I think vo games story storytelling is the best it's ever been but as far as like our favorite video game stories Alex favorite or upcoming well yes for both your story like so let's talk my favorite sorta like first and we'll get upcoming favorite storyline oh this is tough i I'm very much I think the Last of Us great mmm-hmm undertale is you already mentioned it but that is one of my favorite stories ever I the characters in that game yeah and just the world that they've built out and such like a it's a small package but like it is just so creative and I don't know I undertale Delta and all that stuff is yeah very I'm with you we both really love undertale yeah life is strange is a big one for me I love life strange and before the storm I really loved those stories last list of course I don't play and I should say like I I don't play as many I think you play more story driven experiences than I do but I think of things like fire watch and firings and like what remains of Edith Finch yeah I love that game so yeah I love the Miller Solid franchise despite my favorite franchise if I had to like narrow down because like you know you're saw one amazing Metal Gear Solid 2 like crazy meh like I saw three is my favorite one that's me recap the story Metal Gear no blessing do you want me to make you really upset right now no please god no do you the only Metal Gear game that I've ever played which one survived why it was okay yeah cuz yet you had to do gameplay yeah dude Mel we saw it three this is so good you only played five it was great five is also great yeah the game like but that's like more of like a the gameplay there it was like it's systemic yeah the gameplay was great I liked the story about Gear Solid 5 too but it's definitely like not the best more solid story but yeah from beginning to end like and that's more so a thing of a thing of like I think the way they present that story and like the the the style of it the cinematics the the cutscenes like all that stuff its presentation is awesome but then like when you get into the details of what's happening it's just so anime is so wild so over-the-top which is why I like as far as like you know the upcoming game story I'm looking forward to it's got to be death stranding for me you know even though like I know there's like a lot of trepidation as far as like what that game is and what it's going to be but like I I just really like the weirdness of Kojima I like specifically Kojima's weirdness because he is weird in very specific ways yeah we're like I know like in Milla you're solid too right in the beginning of that game there are like ice cubes that you can find and you can like I forget the exact detail but if you place them in a certain place right they'll melt faster than if they were like next to like or like if you rotate them I think they'll melt melt faster than if they're like close together yeah like that's cool and like that's just one example of was just plenty of details yeah and a lot of coaching in like the Metal Gear Solid series right and so like I like the fact that like you know from what I've seen there's monster energy drink I see that and I'm like let's go yeah that's I'm into like all the weird stuff like the the BBS or whatever they're called yeah babies the bridge babies yeah like I see that I see like the Troy Baker character I mean he like takes off his mask and puts it in the ground and then like pulls it up and then summons like a freakin wolf creature yeah that stuff looks cool and so des training is definitely like of course last was part 2 and of course like cyberpunk but des training at least in the immediate future is the one where I'm like I cannot wait to die out of this yeah why you yeah favorites for me I mentioned last of us in her tale Celeste last year oh yeah it was a really great one yeah hold my pick what about your upcoming oh I'm coming I'm sorry um upcoming animal crossing even though that's not really like you don't go to animal crossing further narrative I mean it's like what's Tom not gonna be up to next but yeah probably cyberpunk mmm last was part 2 yeah same as you I guess halo infinite oh yeah yeah when chief was floating in space and they wiped the fog from the glass in the last trailer chills excited for the modern warfare story for the next call duty yeah you know going into before this last week before we sell the trailer at state of or at yeah state of play yeah I was like uh you know I'm excited I like Captain Price as a character Modern Warfare one's one of my favorite games so I'm excited to see what they do next with that with that set of characters and after watching the trailer I was kind of blown away honestly yeah so I'm I am very excited for that yeah like I'm not like I've not really been in love with any of the Call of Duty campaigns for watching the trailer I was like yeah this one this might be the one yeah Boursin zero zero writes in and says good morning bless keen Alex Logitech buying stream Labs seems like a big deal but is it Corsair bought oh god Oh last year but besides a few things there is there is still known as boys and I'm trying to figure out you try to tell me right here man besides a few things there there it's still known as el gato and people recognize it is still known as oh god is what I think he's trying to say yeah yeah and people recognize the el gato brand it's Logitech just acquiring stream labs just to have some streaming stuff in their library as I think everyone's starting streaming we're streaming now has a Logitech cam or two thanks for everything you have done this week blessing and you have been amazing thank you so much more zero zero yeah stream Labs is buying Logitech I didn't include that in the news rundown because I feel like I didn't know if people would be really passionate about that news story yeah I'm particularly not that's just me again I I think I think you know seeing these big companies come together to make to make form partnerships to make things easier for streaming and yes playing game that's good that's all cool and all yeah I'm not like super passionate about it like but yeah I think this makes sense right logitech and stream labs because yeah i I believe I have a logitech webcam I have a lot of canals yeah and like you know I own logitech product like I know is it el gato that did they have they have like the green screen oh yeah no gotta make some buy stuff yeah like may they make really cool hardware and stuff and so I think like you know a partnership especially seeing like the growth of streaming all this stuff right like a partnership makes sense so that you can't have those things of like oh yeah stream labs integration with you know your webcam somehow I don't know man maybe they can make a special streaming webcam I think it's also nice like L gotta to makes great products I think a competition is also nice yeah you know to make things maybe more affordable if possible but yes having stream labs get in the space and as far as like hardware goes and Logitech into the software side it's cool to see to merge together for sure last question comes from Frank Furter they write in and say good morning blessing and Alex Mortal Kombat is getting a RAID mode I'm just as bewildered as you probably are but I'm excited to hear about it especially after giving the news that there is no less was to Malta clear yet in that in in that Call of Duty is locking locking a mode out for other platforms I'm not a fighting game person but I love hearing that a game is trying something new and letting people play it for free is there a game type slash mode you would like to see put into your favorite game if so what thanks Rahl you do Frank Furter now I like more combat 11 yeah I I saw the news of a RAID mode well were your first impressions whatever I don't know the details maybe if I read the details I might be like oh let's go but I don't know everything like three player rate like that's what yeah raid mode I imagine what it'll be a little problem in there details are probably already out there so I'm probably just like speculating for nothing sure sure um but I imagine is probably like one of the towers you and two friends are like competing in the towers at the same time and contributing to like an overall like score or whatever to try and like finish a tower or maybe like you're doing the same challenges maybe all you guys have to finish the challenges at the same time or something like I wonder if that like as a as a fighting III awful at fighting games I wonder if it's something that I could team up with you you run me through this done and we run through this tower together whatever and maybe you like teach me some like it's almost like yeah like you can maybe teach your friends there cuz like I'm Adam I'm sure that's not the intention yeah maybe it could be a way that because we did the the Destiny to raid together like the first one right yeah Kalas dungeon or whatever and we did that and you know I had people like you right who were like who are shooting what was the worst of wants like you know shooting game experts right okay no you know what you're doing when it comes still I go raid and destiny to listen yeah I know my way around a gun yeah I had like you Rihanna in there and you guys like are like better at definitely to the sure sure sure right it's like you guys were able to kind of pull me through in that way I mean it was a great experience for me as somebody who wasn't like to our hardcore destiny - yeah yeah and so like it may be it could be one of those things I doubt it might it's probably not the intention but you know you never know but um you know as far as Frank's question here right like I'm not like a funny game person modes we won added to some of our games yeah our games yeah I would like to see a multiplayer world add it to last was - but man I'm still thinking about the apex news I'm trying to talk about the time I've been wanting to do us for a while on that oh yeah I've been trying to think I play a lot of like multiplayer games and so I'm kind of I don't really have like crazy crazy modes to add but I'm trying to think like a game of that I've been playing control I don't know like a score attack I don't know I feel like you have like so many different powers in that game yeah but like have some sort of and honestly like I drown or ten oh you could do you know one of my one of my my new issues with control was like how much they tried to gamify it as far as like all these like the mod system in the upgrade systems and like the like a lot at certain points it could feel kind of like okay you guys are just throwing enemies let me just throw enemies that mean yeah right inside for control I I think it'd be awesome if they were like okay we're gonna scale back that stuff in the main story in a separate mode and then in a separate mode we're gonna make it all about the gameplay experience since like because that feels all because it feels awesome to play right but I feel like you know for control it stars like some of the single-player stuff goals right like I feel like you know the way that at certain points it could just feel like a monster closet social over and over over again like that could have definitely like helps if it just did a separate horde mode for people who wanted to just like have fun and do that yeah now it's time to squad up let's see Barry where did where do people right in if we want to squad up I don't know if I've been doing that at all this week you can go to patreon.com/scishow neat games
