now as weird as they might be neither hybrid catfish nor triploid oysters are considered genetically modified because they weren't engineered by directly transferring specific deliberately chosen genes this last example though is a proper GMO in fact it's the first truly GMO animal to hit the market for human consumption it's called the aqua advantage salmon unlike wild oysters and catfish wild atlantic salmon are already pretty good at converting food into body mass but scientists wanted to create an even more efficient version because like have you tasted salmon don't you want more of that to modify this animal researchers took fertilized eggs from wild Atlantic salmon and inserted two new components the growth hormone gene from a chinook salmon and a short bit of DNA called a promoter from a fish called an ocean pout the chinook gene was chosen because compared to Atlantic salmon these salmon tend to grow more from the same amounts of food and the ocean pout promoter was chosen because it allows the pout to grow year-round as opposed to the Atlantic salmon which only grows during certain times these researchers essentially took two beneficial traits and threw them into one organism they also made the salmon triploid and sterile to make sure they could never mate with wild salmon even if they somehow escaped captivity the aqua advantage fish was tested for safety and approved for sales in early 2019 and compared to its wild counterparts it grows faster and reaches the same size with 25% less food so more salmon for us projects like these are major ways we can continue eating seafood without taking as much of a toll on wild populations and habitats they won't solve all of our problems but these clever creative ideas do have the potential to really improve sustainability if you want to learn more so thank you [Music]
