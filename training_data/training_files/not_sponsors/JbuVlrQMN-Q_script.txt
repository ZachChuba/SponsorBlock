most important concerts of his career in front of 3500 people but we announced that this would be the last show is he in his band show of the tour but this is the last show that will ever do well the audience didn't know it Bowie himself would return to the stage just a year later he wasn't signing off his career he was killing off his legendary persona Ziggy Stardust the last moments of Ziggy Stardust life were a beautiful painful rendition of the rock'n'roll suicide forty two and a half years later on January 10th 2016 David Bowie himself shuffled off this mortal coil three days before his death Bowie released his final farewell to the world the music video for Lazarus both rock and roll's suicide and Lazarus proved to be reflections on Bowie's life and they helped us get a glimpse into Bowie's mind at these pivotal moments let's take a closer look rock-and-roll suicide was first released in June 1972 as the closing track to the rise and fall of Ziggy Stardust and the spiders from Mars if provided a conclusion to the rough story David Bowie told on that album it's Ziggy Stardust final moments washed up and exhausted from life as a rock star in his last performance Ziggy Stardust sings a final message to his fans before disappearing forever of course Bowie would echo that story in real life at his Hammersmith Odeon show I think it's easy to forget where Bowie was at this point in his career by the summer of 1973 he had already released six studio albums he was 26 years old while young by most standards already aging by the rock star standards of the time from those 26 year old eyes rock and roll suicide is an exhausted reflection on a life well-lived lyrically it opens on a phrase that echoes manuel Mikado's poems songs and Alou butts of any amount time is personified here as an old friend lighting your cigarette as you prepare for the inevitable it also speaks to the way that time can wear you down force you into substance abuse Bowie seems to be sitting in a calm state of reflection a liminal space between now and then he looks back on memories of his youth stumbling home after late nights trying to avoid the Sun he talks about ignoring the sound of the milk truck signaling morning don't let the Sun don't let them float you're mine it's Bowie's youth but it's more than most people have had in their adolescence walking home as the town is just stirring exhausted and lonely but with a kind of halo floating around you it seems here that Bowie is not just reflecting on his own life but talking to his legions of young followers when you watch his final performance it feels like an intimate conversation Bowie is having with his fans gaunt and made-up he gazes out at the crowd musically Bowie wanted the song to fit midway between 1950s rock and roll and traditional French pop he captures that vibe perfectly with a lilting 12-8 rhythm quiet in the beginning but building with the addition of more guitars and a horn you can also hear shades of the show tune you'll never walk alone in the song one of the biggest influences both musically and lyrically on Bowie was Jacques Brel this comes through in the chorus which is lifted from the dark cry of brows Jeff in that song brow sings no Jeff comes up too soon no Jeff not alone instead of singing about a single person though but we have seen to his fans to his younger self these things that he was hard on himself wishing he could show this younger Bowie all he knows now it's a plea to remember all you have around you no matter how the darkness claws at your mind Bowie understands and empathizes he's had his share he wants to help his listeners his audience his younger self shoulder the pink and it ends with a triumphant momentum love and acceptance written by his then wife Angie give me your hands who's your wonder as Ziggy Stardust reaches his final moments he looks outwards to those he touched leaving them with a message of hope in a lot of ways the final message Bowie gave to his fans on Lazarus was similar he wrote Lazarus for a musical of the same name while he was fighting cancer though Bowie was actually in remission when he wrote the song he's clearly wrestling with mortality in it producer Tony Visconti even described Lazarus and the rest of Bowie's black star album as a parting gift to his fans and structurally Lazarus is similar to Ziggy Stardust final gift both songs open on Bowie's current state looking at where he is in the world before moving on to a reflection of his past and finally to a last hopeful message accompanied by a musical swell in the beginning of Lazarus Bowie places himself clearly among the dying in the opening lines it seems like he's talking directly to his fans from beyond the grave look up he's in heaven it's an echo of the moments in rock and roll suicide sitting alongside time alongside death looking down on the world even in these moments though Bowie sings that he has drama that can't be stolen you'll never be able to take the life he lived away from him even in death you'll never be able to take the echoes of characters past of a dozen reinventions from Bowie but the flipside of that is that everybody knows how this played out he's public for all to see laid bare even in death in the second verse Bowie sings the psychological impacts of being on death's doorstep so high it makes my brain woo then he drops his cell phone down below leaving the material world leaving his attachments to all those he knew the musical Lazarus was written for is based off of one of Bowie's mini characters Thomas Jerome Newton from the film The Man Who Fell to earth much like Ziggy Stardust Newton is an alien who came to earth and ended up beaten and defeated by humanity's vice where Rock and Roll suicide reflects on Bowie's youth Lazarus reflects on his fame he sings that he was living like a king but we would adopt New York as his home and ended up dying there it's a moment of reflection on the excesses of his career and it leads to his ultimate conclusion where rock-and-roll suicide opened on a possible reference to a poem Lazarus ends on one Bowie sings that he'll be free just like that blue bird blue bird is a poem by Charles Bukowski it's about the pressures of living a public life the struggles of trying to be your true self under the gaze of the modern world Bukowski writes that he doesn't want anybody to see his Bluebird in the second stanza he talks of how he tries to kill this Bluebird with substance this is relevant to Bowie's lifelong struggle with addiction perhaps most notably Bowie fell into a deep period of mental illness and cocaine addiction during the making of station to station in that period he assumed one of his darkest identities the thin white duke in the video for Lazarus Bowie makes an appearance in an outfit he wore as the thin white duke as a blindfolded Bowie dies on a hospital bed the Duke creeps out of a closet writing a maniacal message it seems to be a reflection of the struggles Bowie has the way his characters could take over his life keeping his real self his Bluebird deep inside and as Bowie approaches his death he realizes that he's finally going to be free of all of it for better or for worse part of him is ready to accept his fate but if you watch the video you can see that he's still pained still scared this is a farewell unlike Bowie has ever faced in order to take on this final farewell but we had to look back on his career look back on the many deaths he had faced before and by doing so Bowie was able to create one final piece a farewell for his fans and an epitaph to echo throughout the ages David Bowie is a really important that I sent you [Music] [Music]
