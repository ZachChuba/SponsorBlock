what is a chap lot a lot of chat welcome everybody to another centex tankers episode where we left off we were conversing with our chat bot here and he was just about to say that anyway uh yeah so where we left off we are able to talk to our chat bot and get responses back but actually what we want to do is get audio responses back in the form of text to speech so uh that's what we're going to be working working on in this video and hopefully it won't take us too too long because we actually already know kind of how we're going to do it we're going to use jarvis to do the text to speech um i will just throw in again there's only one version of there's only one like voice in this jarvis text-to-speech so you know in time i would like to use other voices and i am kind of still looking around i know there's like google text to speech and with that uh the thing i like about google texas speech is it's like lightning fast uh there's a couple other ones i can't remember all the names and then there's like mozilla text-to-speech and mozilla is literally like it let it has everything you could ever need for like training text-to-speech models so i'll also probably look into that and my expectation is that anything that runs on the gpu is highly like as long as you can run it on the gpu uh it's going to be very fast so um anyway yeah that's what we um what i'll probably do in the future but for now we'll just use the jarvis version so with that uh let's go ahead and um i think this is from before let me get rid of that and move this okay great uh so what we're gonna do is um i think i'm gonna make a copy of this i am going to rename this and i'm going to call it just two tts out i don't know just something just in case we get lost and we need to revert back to the original so then getting back to our original jarvis files talk tran i guess we'll maybe talk is what we want let's see so in order to actually speak i think we'll like we use this args output i think output is just for a file output file till yeah and we don't need to output to a file we literally just want to hear it um also this is gonna so probably cause a slight issue because i'm recording like when i've because as i'm recording is gonna come out of the speakers it's gonna go into the mic and i bet it's gonna loop maybe i'll i think i can turn on when this hopefully i'll remember i'll turn on desktop audio that's how i'm going to do it thanks for helping me guys okay so all we need is probably to set this here and how did we set i'm going to close this before we get in trouble how did we set we do take server here and then where did we actually where were we communicating hello yeah so i think what we could do probably is tts going we could probably do these uh i'm gonna move this over actually i think into a separate like i'm just gonna put it here hopefully you can still see enough of that uh we want to bring in this stuff so we already have uh jarvis audio uh we don't have tts or oh we do have the server so really we just need to bring in tts and then wave it looks like so so there's tts we'll bring in wave cool so i think that's everything we need there um we also need this like uh this voice choice probably so i'm just going to throw this in it's just going to default to lj speech um i don't as far as i know there are no other voices available at the at the moment i hope they add more um so then let's see so where are we using args dot server at the moment inside of main and then it does this so inside of main i think here i'm just making space so i can easily find this if and when this doesn't work so so in there we're gonna take it like all of this here uh copy paste we already have this i don't so then we don't need channel anymore um tts client is fine and this doesn't have a repeat so actually we just needed those two things um and then scrolling down to here it looks like okay this is how you specify what i guess this is like what a request is and then as time goes on we'll just replace rec.text the sample rate will be picked up here i suppose stream open stream right the hard part the thing that's giving me a hard time is where is where does like this come where does it actually come out i'm guessing maybe here maybe when you do tts client synthesize uh maybe that um maybe that's what generates the audio i'm just taking a guess here what's the worst that could happen like people ask me all the time like these questions like on tutorials and stuff they're like what would happen if i change this variable to this and like like you could have just found out in the time that it took for you to ask like it would be quicker um okay so i think we have that and then we pop down here to listen print loop and that's gotta be again where we're gonna do all of our stuff so here output darn it for let's i'm trying to decide because we don't really want to say dialog gpt every time it outputs anything so tokenizer decode so really it's just this so let's do right output um let's just say like i don't know tts uh out will be equal to that i hope uh tokenizer.code my expectation is that this would be a string already but let's just go ahead and be certain and then uh what we're gonna do well we haven't defined the wreck yet uh the request rather um boy i'm not sure where i want to do that there's probably a better spot to put this but i'm gonna put it all right here [Laughter] uh okay and then all that happens like i'm not sure what stream got right like i really don't know because really because you would think like okay you would probably only write if arg's output but this is outside of that if so i kind of think we want to include the stream and in fact we probably yeah maybe what we should do is treat this loop here that way again syntax organization technique uh okay so we have that request here we probably need to open the stream like this boom uh okay now we'll take all of this and in a moment we'll get rid of the args output so we'll come down here paste what if we can be done within eight minutes that'll be awesome if we can just boom bang this thing out okay uh we don't need this and then wreck text becomes tts out i don't think we need this i don't think we need this i don't well we'll leave that and in fact let's encase that in yellow uh we don't want that stream.right oh we need probably how we close where where did there it is um although we're never going to hit that because we're going to control c so we probably will never i can't think of a time where we're gonna hit it but is that right yeah okay let's see if that works uh it always makes me happy to just be super hacky uh let's see do i already have yes okay so let's go ahead and python three two uh and then we need server is dgx a100 omg [Music] please work no syntax error yet that's good oh how are we going to do this i think we'll just see what happens first and then i'll have to like speak mute turn on desktop audio what oh did we have a different it was probably a different serve i think i got screwed up on that hold on let's see yeah we had the asr server but not the tts server that's i my bad copy that come over here paste bring back this and i think i'll turn on let me turn on desktop audio before i forget okay i hope this works i want it to work so bad why um i guess it's because um we can use the args in here right because we've defined them here but we where is this i'm getting so lost at this point wait where are we where what was that where was that here what line are we on man uh 248 and then 133 for rec.voice name right here where are you okay uh i'm just gonna hard code it for now um it'll be easy uh it's just lj's speech done done now audio handle audio handle not defined okay wait it's this um are we gonna i guess we can just throw all this into um i just want this to work uh i don't want to deal with all this nonsense yeah i'm just going to cut i'm going to toss it up here and then let's see channel oh gosh are we gonna really do this are we gonna hmm yeah how do we want to do this this is getting dirty this is getting really dirty but i just want it to work right again these are just scentx tankers this is not final product a100 omg um i'm totally gonna fix this later um okay again hey what's going on i'm so close i'm just i'm so close and this this this stuff is just messing with me and oh you know the thing is i removed the whole i didn't care like how long it was taking um so start time.time stop i it is interesting how fast the the texas speech generates i am actually kind of curious i think we will leave that and uh let's go and we'll import time okay come on it's gotta work now it has to work now now up what are we doing what is this what is a chap lot of chat very interesting very interesting indeed i'm glad you liked it i did i did what you did what i think he means he did the same thing as the other guy i think he means he did the same thing as the other guy i think he means the same thing as the other guy i think he means the same thing that's the other gut is the one that's the same as the one on the left i think he means the same thing what do you enjoy talking to yourself i do do you learn anything interesting about yourself i learned that i'm not a loser very interesting how do you know that i've been to the same place i'm not sure what you mean by that do you like any movies i like a lot of movies i like a lot of to shows i like a lot of music i like a lot of things what's your favorite type of music i like a lot of different genres i like a lot of different genres alright well i've got to go see you later see ya uh i hope i got my uh mute and unmute working correctly there um yeah so that was really interesting um cool i mean i i don't really know uh what more from here i mean this is a bot that now you can literally talk to it talks back to you over the mic um to be a little more seamless i'd probably use like headphones or something like that um and then maybe when it's talking have some sort of flag that disables the microphone input i think that's pr that's probably the way you would do it is whenever the chat bot is talking yeah i think that's what i would do um i don't think i'm gonna do that in this video um but anyway uh cool i just think it's so cool how quickly i have been able to develop a chatbot that you talk to it talks back to you um and how fast it is right i mean it's just incredible how far the technology has come i mean to think about doing this like three years ago or four years ago no way no way and now it's like it it works really well and it's like instant i mean that was really that was a pretty fluid conversation other than me having to hit my mute button so the microphone doesn't pick it up so uh anyway yeah that's really cool that's really exciting um i hope you guys have enjoyed i think i'm gonna leave it here for now there might be some tweaks that i make and maybe i'll do another video as i make more more and more tweaks to this um but yeah that's really cool it's really exciting i can see a lot of applications for this and then uh i think i'd like to bring it into discord so so people could talk to it in discord like in the voice servers i think that would be really cool so anyway uh that's all for now questions comments concerns whatever feel free to leave them below otherwise i will see you guys in another video you
