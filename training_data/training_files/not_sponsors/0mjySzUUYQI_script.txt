however on you a Tesla Chum and welcome to my youtube channel where I talk about all things Tesla electric vehicles and renewable energy if this is your first informed with any new content it also helps my channel grow in this video I'm going to talk about the new software update twenty twenty point sixteen point two point one including round about testing possibly speed bump success animated pedestrian activity for full self-driving visualization on our center screen and also a new interface for the toy box for Tesla Model 3 performance all that and more right after this alright first things first I went out for a drive this morning to test out the new software update and first off the list was round about testing this is what happened okay so about the tests I ran about on the new software update on our Tesla Model 3 its engage autopilot now this one's a tricky one just don't know how well this is gonna do yeah not that time ok so that's what normally happens alright let's try the same roundabout from a different angle now that was going way too quick that one no oh good ok another roundabout coming up here just drive right through it this side of the road now that drove straight over the roundabouts again okay so not quite the success I was hoping for as you saw a few fails there on the roundabouts on our Tesla Model 3 having seen Tesla Australia's success with his two-lane roundabouts his car did pretty well I think as it was two lanes there were lane markings on the roundabout and also because he was following the car ahead of him the roundabouts house testing one it was a little bit trickier there weren't any lane markings there were a little bit smaller as well and so I think Tesla's got a bit more work to do with roundabouts I wasn't game enough to try any massive roundabouts just the little ones where it wasn't too high off the ground in case the car decided to go straight ahead it wouldn't do too much damage it would just act like a speed bump basically there's a speed bump coming up it's gonna go way too quick actually stop at the speed bump okay so as you can see from my reaction I was pretty happy initially they thought that the card actually navigated a speed bump on autopilot and I was pretty happy but when I went back through the footage again it appeared that the car had actually gone through the speed bump at speed and then slowed down because it saw the car after the speed bump in its lane so I think it slowed down because of that car rather than the speed bump itself so unfortunately my excitement was premature so hopefully with future updates the car will be able to successfully navigate a speed bump alright next up we went up to Bizzy Chatswood on a Thursday lunchtime lots of people around to check out the new pedestrian animation for full self-driving visualisation this is what we saw pedestrians crossing the road now need some pedestrians I would think so there we go look at Aryans everywhere little ants on the screen as you saw lots of activity there lots of pedestrian animation the cyclists are still not quite animated so hopefully with the next update you'll see some wheels and legs turning as well so hopefully that's more to come and finally just a rundown of the update to the toy box interface for the center screen and also an update to how you find charges on the navigation screen check it out all right so we're gonna check out the software update release notes for sixteen point two point one a new Tesla toy box so a more user-friendly interface and nearby charging sites so we're gonna go through that as well and then dashcam improvements you can now format the USB Drive using the car it's supposed to have any do it from the computer so that's handy and then backgammon improvements so now it's become more difficult personally I have never actually played a full game of backgammon so if you can explain those rules to me in the comment that would be nice to know all right well let's have a look at the toy box upgrade so let's have a go yeah press that ok so now everything is listed on the side here supposed to those icons flashing up before so emissions testing modes is always fun and down have different types of fat let's have a look at this one oh that's nasty let's go short-shorts Ripper it's a short sweet one Falcon Heavy Ripper Ludacris fat as long newest ink now this one's my favorite boring fat man that little one at the end it gets me every time it's old fart on demand you seen this one guys like press the steering wheel and it farts for you turn the volume on and and fart on turn signal like seriously this keeps the kids entertained for hours and I say the kids keeps me entertained for hours and then there's the random one and sometimes I've left it left this on then down it's pretty funny when I turn forget to turn it off okay I'll turn those off because that tracks is the music music thing okay romance mother sent a car up heating up not sure anyway there we go temperature should really rise now it's nice for a winter's day I suppose get up date night in the car that's not too cold today but certainly feel the heating coming on air it is it's nice Oh got quite rusty good old sketch pad let's see if that's improved Wow music came on for no reason same old same old okay using my left hand here so apologize for the bad writing if I publish the same thing yeah so you could still publish it miles mode we know about changes your car into the Mars map which I already have on currently then Santa mode yeah we know about that one this one turns your current it's really loud I'm not just Santa music and then Rainbow Road yeah I guess I can do that I'll do that for you in a second but that's basically toybox okay so now in safety and security in the settings you can now format the USB device which I'm not gonna do obviously now it's working pretty well for me super charges have got a number of stores available so one little bar means there's only one card charging there nobody's charging here at the moment at berry so with the charging map now you can actually filter the different levels of charging so I was under the impression that the level two charges would be the same as the you know AC type charges like the ones you find in shopping malls and things but it looks like if I toggle the level to charger it doesn't actually take away the sort of shopping center charges like the Westfield car park it's a claw white six kilowatts 22 kilowatts ring or more stop them 22 kilowatts so that's nice to know that they tell you the charging speed as well which is a nice update and then level one is what those you know AC charges are for one one lightning bolt two lightning bolts doesn't seem to do anything too much when I toggle it seems to be the same charges that appear for whether it's on or off so not too sure about that I won't have to clarify but level three of course is the super charges and also the you know any DC charges I'll show you something interesting to look the supercharger Macquarie is 150 kilowatts and then the one of Broadway's 130 kilowatts so that's something I didn't know before the Macquarie which is Sydney's newest one is apparently faster at 150 versus Broadway at 130 interesting all right well let's go try out the cowbell Rainbow Road Easter Egg ok let's try out the cowbell Road that's funny alright guys well that's it from me I hope you enjoyed that video if you liked it please give it a like really appreciate that and subscribe if you haven't done so already stay safe guys and until next time happy charge you
