ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of Minecraft but all the crafting recipes are randomized if you're just joining us for the first time it's minecraft but if you go into the crafting table you'll notice that nothing recipe wise makes any sense other than sticks cuz they're horizontal but everything else kind of doesn't make a great deal of sense also brought to with your friend O's so Big Ups to them so we can make more eye of Enders we've got the recipe and things are things are happening I was I was going around collecting lots more spruce because fortunately there's a lot of it here and did we need to just spruce logs I can't remember was it spruce planks uh it's just actually it's just any wood I believe any wood planks and now I am at eight I have Enders right was what again redstone is also hit redstone is also wood wood planks so basically everything stems from wood planks you have a tie vendors oh the redstone right I'm just following slightly behind it happens man it happens so the other thing though that is of potential interest is if we could find a way to get access emeralds it would be helpful for us to trade with an armoire and get more stuff that way but I don't know if that's gonna be difficult we do have I think we have access to an emerald recipe don't we yeah we had an easy way if I recall so that means if we can find a dude who has access to a blast furnace that would be al quite nice that would require us to go find another village though no there's a blast furnace in this one I'm pretty sure he's pretty sure guys he's pretty sure as a shepherd he's a pretty sure yeah we already have a boy over here this is Norma right a weaponsmith hmm we could we could still trade with him to get an enchanted diamond sword ah no there's no enough nothing for an emerald recipe if I search it did you have one maybe I have eight emeralds I have two emeralds but I think we got those through other means 18 black wool gets you an emerald from that guy 1000 you just want to trade for emeralds gotcha no I gotcha we have options 18 white wool that is very expensive that's Frick how are we gonna get more wood planks it's an interesting question I don't have the answer do we we haven't found anything with a shovel either we discovered how to make a shovel you're right we haven't and that's bothering me significantly oh I think that was the case see oh oh it is yeah I just hadn't gotten any wheat yet all right yep it is bread bread for emeralds but we need a lot of wheat in order to do that is the only problem do we know how to make a hoe uh yeah I have a hoe oh it's just polished granite and we're sticks and stones to break those bones we can't make sticks right like that's nuts that didn't change nope that chain cool we need to break trees for sticks ah I feel like it's gonna take a really long time to grow a bunch of weed unless we easy access to a bone meal do you having my inventory so yeah I mean that's gonna take a long time but I don't know Oh what are out sand gravel and blue dye we have access to blue dye though manganese No l√°pices not blue dye it's it's different now oh right right it's changed somehow dang that would be that would have been nice but oh well so what are you thinking what should I be doing how help me because I've just always lost I'm like I don't know what to do with my hands I've got any four diamonds but I don't know how to make boots sort of thing but I'm eight if I try and make boots with diamonds than I get nine more diamonds so that's convenient yeah yeah no we we have infinity diamonds which is nice yeah we just need to find wood basically that's all there is to it so how much wood do you currently have I have 42 planks and thirty logs can you can you hit me up with the planks yeah because it's a jukebox recipe to get I offenders okay so we well how are you feeling how come are you arrows would be good if we could find arrows I feel like I feel like we could do it Oh 100% we'd die but we don't we don't have we don't have chest plate and we don't have boots like well we have an iron chestplate alright you don't have an iron chest okay I'm gonna sleep cuz I clicked on the wrong thing but you know nighttime where did I get my iron chestplate from we don't have a craft abilities for it so hmm if you find it in the village sometimes maybe okay one of you guys we need emeralds is anybody we need a footer sorry we need arrows we need a Fletcher do we have the ability to make a fletching table nope OOP is there a flexing table in this village these guys won't talk to me they're just they just grumble me and I have good he said hiccupping yep twice know my name I never do never do that's how you want uh mmm I don't know what the best way is for us to get a lot of stuff hero's we're getting an iron chest plates not difficult Oh what was again sandstone in the stonecutter oh okay nice nice nice and that's what I and I Oh the nether brick gotta unlock some recipes it's the one cool okay a coal block planks how do I get those planks so I don't have the I guess I mean we can just go dice and skeletons we can go to we can go die some skeletons dude there there were some around I saw them or alternatively we could try to find a village that has a fletching table but hey you don't know what the basis for teacher e's i we've figured out furnaces what do you mean figured figured out how to make them yeah i mean we don't really need to because we can just break it from village I'm pretty sure oh maybe there is there a furnace in this village like it i'm i'm happy to steal it or use one I haven't have not seen one immediately oh there's a bunch more planks over here and grab those in case I just ran around this house like 14 times not seeing anything a lot of logs oh my god I just unlocked arrow yo that you do rake I got a carpet and and apparently that did it holy crap to carpet purple carpet purple one yeah the purple it you already have it unlocks no you don't think so okay okay so you did pick up all the purple carpets then this zombies not attracted to the villagers okay so let's see arrow oh okay so it's white carpet with a lime guy ie we got lime died course not why would we why would we have what we need aye Caramba yeah that's gonna be tough dude it is it is tough that's disappointing so yeah era recipe looking no bueno which means maybe our best bet is just go to the strong and like um see we can find some stuff there maybe know what this okay yeah maybe I mean yeah we get an infinity enchantment that would be great oh yeah that would be convenient and then highly unlikely sort of way mm-hmm trying to think I mean you can find that do we have the ability to make an anvil we've gotten that negative you've not unlocked anvils so we have no idea how to craft that currently unfortunate oh hello do we we don't have obsidian right no but we could get obsidian because we just mine it because if we went to the nether then we've got all the nether blocks and unlock a bunch of recipes I mean we yeah we can just bring his mine it but the problem is I don't think we can let's see you get a bucket no we get a flint and steel actually I guess we don't need the flint and steel we can just use a lava so yeah you want if you want to go through the nether we can what do we have the bucket I didn't I didn't know we can just direct some water to lava usually there's lava or ground or water underground it I've done before it's actually not that big of a deal that's an undertaking but really all right never - I'm gonna taking guys hmm dude lime die for arrows okay you want to go underground sure or do you want to find the stronghold and then go underground from there because we'll have to and yeah let's do that okay let's do that cool cool all right anything you need to keep from here or on our way do we have a way to make torches or we want to steal all there's [Music] just just just trying to you know look into the light you know yeah yeah let's do that let's let's see you let's joint their torches dude sounds nice enough this this village is not gonna be happy come nighttime that's all right they've are there already missing a bunch of stuff yeah I mean I think their floors lures anymore particularly cuz we didn't notice that there were the the the plank of the docks over there we could have taken instead yeah but no we needed all of it we didn't need all of it I think we got that didn't we yeah I got the dog so he wasn't talking about the dock guys yeah I wasn't I wasn't many other things okay listen skeleton that is your real name oh yeah there was a lot more dock actually over here I'll get that yeah there's a lot of dock over there all right I'm gonna get more just in case we end up getting completely sure ruined with luck on the eye of Enders it's happened before yeah good you never know where it's gonna go down I took a bed did you take a bed I have not taken a bed but I do think that if I were to think it through that'd be a good plan okay I agree with the assessment if not the spirit okay all right what were we using for food chicken chicken is very easy do I have chicken I just I mean my potatoes oh these dolphins are very happy playing with the items that we've hunted the water yeah cool pre kill oh I did I did forget to uh yeah they put my sugar cane I don't even know yeah cane either so it's like I have no chicken if we get him sitting in though I can combine it with an eye of ender and make an iron axe hey well I've got a stone egg so I don't not too worried about it yeah where did I get this don't know I think the stone axe is from the stone cutter actually I do not remember which block it was it's died right okay dead from it as well this regular die right yeah as well as yellow wool they don't if that unlocks stuff it does more coal yellow dye where is all the diary gone I know there was some down here other I made some diorite some way or another horse armor terracotta beacons we probably ought to take the stonecutter - oh yeah no good idea ah there we go I keep thinking hey I got another new dye can I just mix it with one of these other guys to get the different cuts not how that works all right well if only we could have had some more uh good well shall we hit the road hit the road deck yep okay all right well let's see what direction we use ahead got the eyes I do in D so you are the eye in the sky you were the one who cans into the ocean and a pop it's a good sign the best that's that's the best of almonds right there well hop in my boat unless you have one I mean your boat oh here you are guiding the boat okay went this way right mm-hmm I just let us collect everything that we've thrown in in the has been distributed [Music] tell me when you want made a stop there's night long yeah probably when we hit some more land though it's saying I see land ahead land oh I'm also looking in the water because somehow I've had this crazy luck the past few series where the stronghold is visible in the water that's crazy luck I see underwater ruins which might have some random items or enchantments that might be good it could it's possible let me off the boat I had a moment where I was like I'm not keeping you on the boats not it was the game yeah okay we're still going very much oh that's right no very much in that way do you and it broke didn't it no we're good okay do you want to continue that way or do you want to look at yeah the ruin let's continue we can do it I believe I believe we're gonna we're gonna beat the ender dragon with the least amount of gear possible I hope hmm I hope unless we that was a lot of equivocating yeah I'm sure came on the right okay let's get ourselves some chicken mmm I mean I'm over here eating potatoes man it's that nice vegan chicken dude you get it go get it Pete mmm again all right ah let's throw another one from over here probably as you wish yeah dude I mean at least we have it would be good dab a bucket I will say that much but also if we get agar pearls once we're in once we're there then we can use those in case we get you eat it up into the air and and kind of recover so right did you try killing Turtles for scoops they do not drop scoots that's uh that's when it goes from a baby to an adult oh right yeah right mmm these might unlock new things the slab are you sorry yes slab Oh polished diorite which is actually a new thing when you're trying the stone cutter maybe right I'll see the head polished diorite before I can actually remember I had sight that's what I was looking for the stupid furnace for was so I could start doing that sort of stuff a black banner that doesn't help us a great deal can't make much with banners nope nope it's like I have so many different areas so many different series going back and forth in my head that I'm like Oh that'd be good I can break it it's a new block it'll drop new block you know Oh trust doesn't doesn't do that trust me I as the random newbie that it's been really difficult to try and like wait no that doesn't help me you're such a random knew I'm I'm like a randomest of noobs even no idea I mean I think you do have some idea you've seen me play on the tournaments speaking of which are you playing in the tournament nope not tomorrow no no thank you nope some some of us are once every other week and some of us are weekly oh okay yeah I know how this works you're a clout I know not how this works okay all right have you thrown that okay we're still heading various direction this being one of the farthest is anyone has ever had to run I think you asked that last time we were looking for what didn't you yeah is new sorry ow Chris I didn't mean I was trying to punch the flower and then your face ended up there yeah yeah yeah that's the back of my head all right well back in my hand back to the ocean the boat ssin how do you pass a puffin oh oh I forgot my chicken Brad I'm going over here to get the chicken you can run it all right I could just you know keep making a lily pads I don't think you can let me meet lily pad of fertility the lamp of fertility there's a koala biome over here but I don't think that enables God if that was a random drop series that'd be sick but sadly his nuts alas but Alaska it is nuts but seriously folks I'll ask a liter dolphins I don't think we've gotten a pufferfish I don't know can you make anything ah potion but I don't think that no nothing in craft example I don't think it's gonna make kitchen noises of disapproval oh we overshadow the other direction all right so it's in the ocean apparently so that's a thing and the boat this is this is current version so the torch trick doesn't work very well nope it's gonna be fun you have a strange definition of fun no definition of fun I mean let's look we can look around in the water I guess this is a very shallow sea though so it's unlike that the strongholds actually be popping through which is a bummer the same time we can actually go I can't I can't see it Oh Decker they're still you you were you were spinning so I was like I can't narrow in on anything I have no idea where anything is where it go it's sunk it's supposed to float there it is a sign I saw a bacon bar era back in the boat like can you make I don't think you can make anything with signs but there's your seat pickles thank you here I'm gonna just throw up in the coaster here I guess I assumed it was gonna continue but hey skeleton you want to give me an arrow and that way maybe just maybe we can get infinity inside of a chest and then not be able to apply it because we don't have an Advil and seems reasonable no arrow okay oh it's back over here and it broke OOP well that's no bueno actually I can make more I have the resources to make several more eye of Enders if needed as needed don't shoot me ow you shot me hey it's narrow what the crap did it go down I think uh-oh over here all right well I think we've just about narrowed in right yeah let's punch with our fists I mean unless I could build up a little bit let me build up and just toss it and see what happens I just want to I want to try to target exactly like the block it goes in do keep an eye out okay okay so it's over in the water then God dang it it broke it was right like here I was like underneath it so if we want we could build like put some dirt down and block out the water I was coming I'm picking up dirt which I don't know why I'm not I just got an iron which unlocked all the things okay Thank You Dom B ah yeah there you go okay yeah that's a there's a there's a few things unlocked there it's a oh we can note we can't do okay pocket nope no arrows no buckets good are you gold gold is an iron sword and then but there was a chest plate in there diamond chestplate that I saw diamond chestplate is shining it's an endless Oh God we just how do we get more iron don't know don't know how we get more iron bummer okay well shall we dig down yes I didn't say Angeles Oh anvil is a thing oh it's to iron for an anvil oh oh that's not breaking oh my god it is it's so heartbreaking Wow oh go kill all the zombies I mean I literally if I have an iron ore on me so if we had found the furnace what do you mean if we'd done the furnace couldn't I smelt the iron or does that turn into something weird turns weird turns weird yeah here let's make your daytime you want to sleep real quick sure we can except on point just in case of bad things and I'm gonna go cheat ow I'm in bed one for me okay please sleep sleep God you guys suck hey I'm sleeping again I'm trying oh my god please sleep yes get the Frick out of here bro I mean if we'd have gotten some membrane then I would have unlocked something down the hatch do it now like maybe we can get iron inside of a stronghold chest actually that might be a thing yeah that's not entirely unreasonable didn't you say you were wondering how to get gold because we can definitely get gold yeah I know that's it's a new crafting recipe but I I just oh here it is nice stronghold boom we have a homicide chicken my ask lead an arrow or a bow not an arrow yeah well we have oh um wake away I was just taking the anti sight and throwing in the stonecutter and making things gotcha Oh Blotz good a button mm is useful in certain things isn't it I suppose iron bars guess the other question though is would we we don't want more food I'm not sure oh I found it wow that was fast right here like hello okay out of here I can't break this pushing thing oh my god there's many oh no oh no oh no my god there's so many here I'm gonna break the spawner break this why I took I took care of it for yes you seemed to you seemed to be in a bit of a pickle there phew they're angry oh hey we have exactly the right amount nice now the question is this I mean we don't even have a way to shoot it no we definitely need to get arrows somehow like the right so I'm thinking let's let's try to find chest there's a chance that we could get an iron thing and if we find a libraries as well okay that would be good watch I'll get myself lost and never be able to find the end after it was so easy the first time doesn't seem like something to look forward to like no no I'm not really oh I should have courted it I mean let me go back and get the chords exactly just in case of badness I'm right here oh okay you want to put them in a chat real quick yeah I'm working I gotta get there okay like I'm right here but I'm not like right here right here yeah 464 2 2 3 9 cool at 27 all right so there should be there should always be libraries and a strongholds and if we feel a lot of things that don't seem to things I don't know what makes stuff I just build ok apparently smooth stone slab got me a Golden Arrow is it an easy recipe I don't know I'm looking to see because oh my god I need the arrow spectro arrows it's a lot of sticks and a smooth stone slab that's it and it gets us to arrows so it's not terribly cheap yeah but it's made the armorstand recipe I guess okay that's what that's what people who know more than me are saying well hi how you doing wasn't startling at all okay found a library better me I've found nothing no enchantments sweets here's literally above the channeling lure and sharpness three I mean it's something he's not bad but hmm it ain't no infinity though no it certainly is not you can tell by the way the letters and wording is different oh hi how you doing I still haven't found a single chest either no chests here oh it's got gold but it's not got any iron no found a chest but Goldman where I'm guessing you you did know as I was repeating what I assumed was going on I was simply expressing my disappointment give him that I wish okay all right all right all right all right man hey I got you really not a whole lot of uh and I not a whole lot of chests in here no this isn't this hasn't been like the the fortuitous bounty that we might have hoped for it seems like there's an inverse relationship between how click how quickly you find the end portal and what sort of loot you find in the store fortuitous bounty yeah damn nothing down there down there oh hi are you doing oh well chest I found a chest in one iron bar giving me whoo wait you had one and I am and and we needed to know you you had the one that I gave you okay I was like oh I already had one but I also found iron booties which was helpful oh yeah you know for myself I apologize that I can't make this valuable to you well okay so we have one so that means we can choose between I guess we could make an anvil and sharpness or we can't make any arrows yet god it gall darn it I don't actually know what the best way is to do I mean we could just go Yolo mode and just try it I mean we just sleep next to the portal I mean puts we have all the Diamonds we need not that we can make what we need with those diamonds I guess oh you mean so we can just make a lot of diamond blocks and we can use the diamond blocks to break the end things by hand when I was talking about remaking the stuff that we needed but which doesn't work as it I was like yeah diamonds don't really do much for us in question oh I understand I just interesting I picked up the different type of planks and got a whole bunch of different recipes make sense oh we could beds trap Sarah bed strat there actually is a bed strat I'm not sure what the bed I don't know bed strat [Music] can-can bed strat make it so that you don't actually hi hello excuse me no can beds try make it so you don't need to actually break all of the stuff you're asking me I have no idea not sure I have no idea so if I take both of those and I can get some of that and if I put that in there it's something I'm gonna use you know there are recipes with a bowl no I guess I guess we still have to break the things wait you can't you can't break the end crystals with snowballs I don't think can you I think that's a thing actually wait really that sounds familiar I don't know why I got it oh but we have he's on the shovel yet oh my god we can't do it cuz no shovel this is uh this is a problem golden carrot cooks steak diamond pants we have done how do I get those already how we do yeah you're wearing them good I was excited yeah mm-hmm yeah the problem is we can't get snowballs so levar might be good do we just we just yolo it we just do it well sleep next to the portal because we're playing on a server we're not doing we're not in hardcore because otherwise one of us would get kicked off if we do monetize and that wouldn't be very fun so we just do it will you just do it I mean I'm over here discovering stuff but whatever I only had discovered that though whatever you want to do I mean what else did you have on the agenda that you were trying to discover that you think might get us either arrows or infinity I just I'm using all these different blocks the different stone blocks in the stone cutter and just finding oh that's a wait so I've just been kind of rolling through that apparently crack doesn't get you very far remember kids crack doesn't get you far wise words wise words oh my god dude all of these silverfish dude I believe in us I believe we can do it okay library hold up I think it's it seems like you're is we're just reaching in a point of impatience though oh yeah of course but it's like you know but but go for it ooh there are so many enchantments in here smite three unbreaking 3 respiration 3 sharpness 3 sweeping edge 3 power for quick charge 1 Riptide 3 but no we needed none of what we know the nation probably takes them just in case but a block of iron would not convert to 9 iron right I sadly know yeah we don't have the infinite iron trick that all right well I will return and you can plot our course plotting Li ah more sharpness 3 dang it ah well I pulled the sharpness 4 or the power 4 book because it was like yeah why not why not mmm well we might as well apply sharpness 3 to the sword right right so you can make an anvil because you have the you the to iron okay so is it just to iron no it's to iron plus the planks and Vale sticks I don't have sticks oh oh it's the hoe right there you go hey that's sticks there you go cool cool alright oh wait now you get a sweeping edge sword actually instead I think I had it both on the same book as it gonna cost nine levels Wow well that's fine what else are you planning on using more exactly you know well here you go if you want to do it I do is I probably other levels and you don't oof that's 14 levels really not was three okay cool well we have an anvil now that's exciting yeah and stuff so let's get some well I don't know we could use you just use n stone dude oh my and a bear get up to break the things yeah nothing nothing like gathering blocks well under attack yeah yeah okay well here we are and I have a chest so we can put some things down do you know where the portal was again no no no idea okay cool I'm just I'm just breaking stuff so if you happen to know let's see it was at 464 is not this way but maybe there's more stuff we haven't explored over here could have could have another chess I'm just checking it out you never know there is in fact the chest right here it has an iron pickaxe and an apple mmm and this place does go on for a while a whole lotta loot this goes on forever hey 464 these display sadly no buckets yet everybody unless it's in a stonecutter but you I mean I've been trying I've been trying to stone cut my way to victory but not not doing it have not achieved success yet to 239 is this way and we are a little high it's 27 right 2 to 3 9 to 3 9 y 27 either you are def a delivery alright I have every block known to man do we want to put our remake chance down here I have chests ok cool yeah didn't mean to throw that yeah yes what what's up nothin I just confused my life ok you know what happens it for me it does it does indeed ok well you know now is as good a time as ever yep I guess what beat the Enderdragon with no era's yeah yeah oh yeah yeah sleepytime indeed like nothing can go wrong with this nope nope it's gonna work great all we need to do is just block up and then just hit him hit him from a distance and jump and actually well um yeah well we'll see how it goes we might just get exploded by the end crystals themselves so yeah I'm sure I'm sure it would help too what's up is literally no way for us to survive that like that's extense can we not if we punch them is it impossible it blows you the heck up man it's heck and communion what if we uh what if we do have four arrows so if we made the bow I'd have four shots oh I have a bow all right four arrows oh so we would need infinity what if we yeah what if we go up the center of the pillar and what if we went up the center of the pillar or we don't know long it take to mind through that no you don't go all the way up the center of the villa you go up and then at the very end you go into the center and then you try and angle it to where you're not like in blast damage kind of yeah yeah I know we can make spectral arrows but that needed that needed iron as well hmm I mean we could do nether if you feel like it we're so close but nether we could make another portal ace Apple Africa's just find some water yeah like nothing of what we have I think is difficult for us to get we obviously Blake assuming we have the recipes we can figure out what did we needed to get back to it so if we lose our sharpness three sword in our sweeping edge swords whew what are we gonna do with our lives yeah you know like we don't have much to lose boy I'm saying that was a long way to say okay so if we lose we'll just we'll go to the nether you mean yeah yeah okay well give it a shot and that'll be our plan all right leave the arrows behind cuz we don't have those yet so I don't need the arrows you probably need the bow oh oh so just leave the oh yeah leave the bow for sure and keep the swords and I guess keep that we need to keep the pickaxes but pickaxes were easy a Yank yes this is all blocks of stuff to get okay you're blocking purposes okay well this isn't gonna end well as well be doing it okay cool here we go voice what could go wrong I think okay I'm gonna imma leave some torches yeah not a problem I jumped through because you were like let's go well I'm coming in I'm coming in good we're good you hemmed in hard right there at the end a good thing you had some blocks on yeah that's an inconvenient starting location hey there's a dragon this time though good good I'm happy to hear it how would you prefer these recipes I mean ice a lot of wheat we can acquire the obsidian we need for the portal here so minecart minecart I saw that unlock is there's a few things you can make with a minecart I guess we can't really take the obsidian back unless we win though so yeah there's that whole problem let's get ender pearls though because what will happen is if we get you eat it off but don't do monetize there's no dragon is there nope no dragon what you were like you were like there's a dragon last time I don't think there were crystals no there were definitely crystals oh there were yeah definitely Kristen okay so what is uh what's wrong with our stuff I have a suspicion but I don't know okay what's your suspicion they put it on to like paper and spigot and so it's not pure vanilla and it's supposed to optimize things I'm thinking that something happened there that I mean that's it's only a guess and it's all but it's just all I got you know all right well I guess give it the old spa Naru then because we're kind of taking advantage of it not being here currently just a bit oh yeah okay look up real quick it's like a Google dis before oh yeah that's what it was there's no fountain but it'll still land anyway so it's fine land where the imaginary Lance's watch it lands out in the middle of like nowhere that would be a problem and like in the void hey guys I'm hitting the Enderman careful careful I don't a splash you I'm in creative hmm what's up we might uh we might need that we might have to come back after a little bit of repair all right I seem to have broken the server my bad but if you happen to out random craft and have silly things so and also net st. nope he's not gonna move in that same description you can find a link to the playlist you can catch up on any episodes you might have missed and then finally we giggle with these things live as it happens so you can check us out at twitch TV slash CaptainSparklez and twitch.tv slash zine I feel like this was a flawless episode yeah I can't think of anything better so we will catch you guys later bye
