code Cal Lauren to get 10% off your first purchase hey guys welcome back to my channel today we are going to be reviewing my first ever design portfolio so I know a lot of you guys are either new designers or budding designer starting out or just kind of trying to figure out if you even want to go into graphic design and I totally get that so the portfolio I'm gonna be showing you today was my portfolio I completed when I finished my time at Siddim back in June of 2016 I have my associates degree from there so it's just a two-year program and this is the portfolio that I spent almost $100,000 to get beside know I'm in a lot of debt now I have changed quite a bit as a designer since I graduated finem I think working in the field really sculpts who you are as a creative and I think that working for someone or working with clients whatever it may be teaches you to think more critically as a designer instead of someone who just gets to do anything that I want in art school that's good to a point you get to kind of explore just like anything and kind of figure out what you like what you don't like you don't really you know always have to nail down your style and that's part of being in school is being very exploratory but as soon as you are out of school or even if you didn't go to school but you're out there working in the field I think you really grow as a designer and as an adult to kind of figure what you like and what you don't like and what your style is and the designer I am today is a complete 180 from the designer I was when I graduated and also even more different from the designer I thought I was going to be when I went into graphic design cool if you're new to my channel I welcome you and I hope you subscribe down below if you want to see more videos from me I talked about design and I also talked about a bunch of other stuff because I'm kind of all over the place so yeah I hope you enjoy this video let's get started alright now the way I built my portfolio at fit um so I guess it was how everyone built it is that we build a physical portfolio having a physical portfolio has a big impact in a meeting and an interview it's cool people like to see that you can make something tangible unless you're of course designing something that's digital that needs to be a screen which makes sense but a lot of graph design can be printed and I think this is an awesome way to present a portfolio versus like bringing home to your interview because I think it you know I can also show like craftsmanship of how well you can present something which i think is awesome so yeah let's get started during many of my moves my dad wrote metal portfolio question mark [Music] this is my first portfolio this is what we were given by finem to present our final portfolio so it's in this giant metal suitcase that looks like something out of like a movie that has money in it so now for context I haven't seen this in years I know what it looks like but I haven't really looked at it up close and personal in quite a long time so I think I'm just gonna talk you through some of the projects that we did so you can see more of what my curriculum looks like when I was at film so let's get started ooh lots of jumbled messes okay not off to a good start there's some random paper in here here's a picture I took of Matt for my photo class this is gonna need a lot of explaining there's a lot in here a lot that's a complete mess okay okay so at the end of your time at finem you take in our full portfolio class which is where you kind of refine all of your projects that you've done over the course of your time there and then you learn how to pretty much make a beautiful presentation out of it so we have a teacher who was very critical of everything that we have done and we change things we updated things and then we like printed everything out nicely and then we mocked it up on these little like poster boards so we have something to show in an interviewer in a presentation and then we also had to create these little CD packs that had a disc of our portfolio on them and that was part of like you know understanding George George okay anyway it's good to build these little digi packs of our portfolios burned on the CDs and it was pretty much a way to show that we can design packaging for a CD pack that shows who we are as a brand and we also had to explore ourselves doesn't in the class as like meaning what we look like as a designer our own branding and branding yourself is like and arguably the hardest thing to do so if you feel like you don't know who you are as a designer you don't know how and you don't know how to brand yourself you're not alone that's a very common issue I deal with a major design identity crisis about once a year and then I rebrand and I update redo my portfolio that's part of the running thing so with all that being said what do I have here okay so let's start with my digi pack now when I started exploring myself as a designer I kind of came up with this logo that was this like K in L shape my last name is actually Conway it's not Lauren and gay in case you didn't know that my name is Kelly Lauren Conway but thanks to Kelly and Conway I've completely dropped my last name so thank you Kellyanne for ruining my life but that's literally the reason why I go by Kelly Lauren or Kell Lauren is because of her because I don't want people confusing me because that's not what I am so I dropped my last name and started going by Kelly Lauren only as a designer so all of my branding is Kelly Lauren and it's kind of been my brand to this day so I created this little logo it's just kind of like okay block with this little kind of like repeat Elle behind it it doesn't make a lot of sense as like okay and I know but it make more sense than okay but you know what art so everything is just Kelly Lauren art InDesign because I used to focus more on our InDesign instead of just design and owning it as a designer and my portfolio was titled at explore andum which means just the process of growing and exploring and also on the back of my digipak i have a quote from Kasmir Malevich who's a Russian constructivist designer who was like a huge inspiration to me when I was going through design school and someone I really kind of looked up to he was the creator of the black square painting that like infuriates people it's just a black square and that really inspires me because design like art is whatever you make of it and if it means nothing that's literally part of the art is if it infuriates you that's part of the purpose of it so he's a huge inspiration to me and so I have one of his quotes on the back it says it is from zero in zero that the true movement of being begins so you start from pretty much nothing but that's where everything comes from everything starts from the beginning so it's kind of like the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step type of thing so that's my quote that's on the back of my portfolio so then like in here you open it up and it was just all blue so my colors were like this pink and this bluish texture thing this teal blue and then on the inside I had the same piece that mimicked my logo and then I also have these business cards that I still use and I really need to do new ones but I don't need them that often because generally people will find maybe a Instagram or online so I don't have a huge need for business cards but I would like to get new ones because my branding has sense changed a lot so that's what that looks like and then also in here I don't have them in here anymore because we gave a lot of these out in our final presentation I made 10 of these and they were extremely painstaking and difficult and so we have little cards on the inside of just like some little sample cards of our work and then on the other side was a CD so that is my ad explore and digi pack now moving on to the actual portfolio I'm sweating already okay maybe I feel better if I put this on the ground so on the first page we have is this coming completely blown out perhaps okay so on the first page I have pretty much the intro to my portfolio it was just like this kind of like a cover art that I had been working with and just my logo my name and I'd explore and I'm a portfolio because I'm artsy like that so the opening project of my portfolio was a magazine concept that I had created that is still in my portfolio now and I will eventually remove it because I've changed it quite a bit but I don't want any more school projects in my portfolio because it's it's been too long at this point was this magazine I created and one of my classes that fit on that is called palladium so it is a music publication like palladium is a music publication magazine that I made up and so this pretty much we had to do a cover we had to do to layout spreads we also had to do some sample merchandise this is very like ramen of the style that I was really going for when I was in school it was very like like illustrative on top of like photos I did a lot of the lines that went in and around people like that blocks of color filled in I was really big on using beavis new and a veneer and Gotham those were like my go-to fonts I refuse to use anything else so that's just like a general trend oh and a veneer oh my god I loved a veneer so the first one is just the 1975 it was right when they released I like it when you sleep when I took this class so everything about this is just like about I like it when you sleep as you can see like the merch I did over here some little little pins and then like a spread down here that says the 1975 are more important than you think so yes this was page one cool page two all right this was another section of palladium magazine so I wanted to focus on like some of my favorite artists and so one of my favorite artists is MGMT and I chose for this covered a troop for this cover I just have like them but they're very weird and I wanted each one of these represent how weird these artists were so I have like all of these like hands and body parts kind of like floating around so I have like these hands and stuff floating around and I wanted it to just be really representative of like how strange the kids video was which is just like monsters and stuff and then I just have just some other interesting spreads I did of them this is really hard to show maybe I'll see if I can find a digital copy of these probably not so just like some other spreads of them and then I also did some cool merch which in hindsight like this t-shirt legitimately looks like one that I would make now because it's so like like that definitely looks like a t-shirt I would make now and I did a watch cuz I thought that would be cool because then you can get like the little tick marks on the watch line up with where that little POW was happening with the hands punching so that was MGMT's and then this next one I used to be a really big fan of thorns and then as soon as his allegations came out I immediately went through my support from liking him so unfortunately he is in my original portfolio because at the time this was early 2016 where he wasn't a sexual predator so I'm gonna go through this really quick cuz I like the work I did but ignore him so this was another cool cover with the similar dot pattern that was on the MGMT one I also did a cool t-shirt down here in a foam case using that same pattern and then I was really happy with the spreads that I did here [Music] that was palladium magazine general general view of palladium I'm still like pretty happy with that I would obviously change a lot of it but that was a project that I was really proud of at the time so feeling okay about it this next project was also one of my favorite projects I start from like my favorite ones and I go like kind of down the line so this next project was in my brand X class where where we had to rebrand an album and the only rules were we couldn't rebrand an album that won a Grammy for art direction so there were only a few of those I said it was fine to pick some other ones but I chose passion pits gossamer because I never liked that album cover I will put it right here and I wanted to redo it and do some really crazy stuff and I think this is where I haven't really mentioned it in any videos but like this is kind of where I started to figure out what synesthesia was and I wanted to design album packaging to be very representative of what I saw when you listen to passion fits music and if you haven't listened to passion visit music I recommend it and if you are familiar with him you might get what I mean so this was the initial layout for the album so it started up here this was the front cover and the back cover of the album try not to get a glare and then this was the inside of the CD tray so this was like the spine right here and then it was a lyric pack of everything so each page or almost each page had lyrics to a song so I had like carried away and constant conversations so I wanted all the type to be crazy I wanted the colors to be crazy and vibrant to kind of punch you in the face and like I really pushed the bounds of what it means to work in CMYK in this project because I couldn't print anything anything in RGB or offset so I did that I have just pretty much everything I wanted this album to look like I wanted it to be super bright and vibrant and kind of represent that so we didn't redo this digi pack so that's what the album looks like and then we had to turn it into kind of like a semi marketing concepts we have to do like posters - so this is what three of those posters looked like so I got really crazy with my love for avenir oh boy so much some more minimal stuff so some crazy type stuff minimal stuff and then one with the album art with the release date of what of the release date of when the album would come out in theory but this is also the date I took the class and this was the final date of our presentation so yeah that was September 16th 2015 and also I sort of got in trouble because the picture in here was of a joint so I just said it was a cigarette even though it's definitely a joint alright interesting I did so much merch because I now work in merch haha so I designed a Crosley turntable with some of the album art and I also had three t-shirts of just like stuff from the album so I had like some lyric stuff here more lyric stuff and then like something more reminiscent of the actual album art and also a vinyl version of the album down here that's that that was also a really fun project that pretty went to solidified me wanting to work in music so now this next project takes a bit of a turn I liked this project at the time but in hindsight this is one that I feel like is one of my like weakest points I really liked this project in concept but as soon as I was done with it I pretty much hated it so yeah this was a general branding class for a business its way to come up with a business idea and then brand a hell out of it so this is gonna be the northern market okay so if the concept of the northern market was an indoor farmers market that went year-round and it catered to local communities that like local farmers and vendors could come into this old like a train shipping warehouse which is very reminiscent of where I grew up in Northern California and it's kind of like a farm town thing farmers markets are really popular in Northern California so I wanted to build something kind of like that so this is generally what this week project looked like I always try to get a closer shot at this logo so I have the logo up here and then I have like what the what the store signage look like down here and also like what employees could wear with like their aprons with the logo on it and then like another one he can barely see it in the back and then like a produce tag or something very exciting and I had a slogan for the northern market which was eat fresh buy local which I still think is a fine concept to this day so here was like a t-shirt that they sometimes sell it like things like this and then like some honey sticks with some other like mood images what a jacket could look like what else do I have oh yeah like wine bottles and wine bottle wrapping and then more honey with some label design so that was the northern market but yeah I distinctly remember enjoying this project while I was doing it and had a lot of fun like taking pictures of my hometown and kind of like showing how I could make like my home town look more interesting and like a business idea that they could pursue I don't know but it's definitely something I would like to revisit because I feel like I'm a much stronger branding designer now for something that might be a little bit more artisanal which is like I think what I was trying to go for but I think now it looks very amateur and kind of looks yes it looks like a student project like which is kind of like my worst nightmare like now is something looking like a student project or like fan art if you will so definitely I think my weakest project moving on okay this next project is my mother's favorite project she brings this project up a lot because she thinks I should try to license it and like make it a cartoon and stuff but I took a class on character design which was really fun because the teacher for that is not only an amazing packaging designer but she's also worked for like Pixar and Disney with designing like characters so we just had to learn how to like pretty much loosely illustrate which is something like I'm like pretty familiar with but actually to create and develop a character there's a lot of fun hold on there's a helicopter okay take your time take your time okay so people did a lot of different things in this class they made like monsters which was a very common thing they did things with like dinosaurs they did they did like some like cartoons with like people but I feel like mine was very reflective of how I was feeling at the time so this this is Karl the designer who can't get his life together and this was just pretty much a very self-reflective thing I felt very anxious toward my the end of my time at film and I was feeling the pressures of this is what I chose to do and I have to get it together so yeah this is Karl right here he's just like this kind of squirrely dude and then this is Harry because I only had Harry when I made this character and then this is his like little logo it was a mix of a speech bubble also like a little like swash thing of like paint but also I have another version that is a cup ring so he was this designer who had this cat and he drank a lot of coffee and this is him walking and texting on his phone so page one so this is just more like experiencial design of him like sitting on his computer with a picture of Harry and dumped coffee he's always like dumping his coffee because I dumped my coffee once in a lab that I wasn't allowed to have any drinks in and it became a running joke with one of my teachers because she yelled at me oh boy oh boy for the rest of the quarter as the girl who dumped a huge cup of iced coffee in the lab that you're not supposed to have any drinks and so yeah there was that and then I had another time I dumped coffee in another class and in the teacher who taught this class one of my friends shoutout to Kyle immediately through I think it was like a sheet that he had for our photo class on to the coffee and just kind of like pushed it underneath the tables we were working at to like clean it up so our teacher wouldn't see it so and he cleaned it up like immediately and threw the sheet away and it was like over in 30 seconds it was insane so thank you Thank You Kyle for saving my ass in portfolio so yeah just him working on his computer him with a dumped coffee next to him and then like some little Polaroids like the patterns that I had to make for him and then here's like another one of his branding elements was like this Cup ring pattern you're in my portfolio buddy you wanna come here you're my portfolio bud [Music] interesting because this is more merge design we had to do just like apparel design for our characters so I did like this this is a cool pair of like Reeboks I don't know it's like we have some sneaker Reeboks up here we have a backpack and then this was like a couch concept that I had where I made like a little pillow with his branding on it and then like this pencil wallpaper in the back and also just like a framed picture of him up there and here's a t-shirt I'm proud of this to this day I guess this short is pretty cool it's like a full sublimated print with like these coffee rings and his name just kind of spelt out around them and then just what do I have in the back oh it's the same name like pattern that's on the front on the back but without the coffee rings pretty happy with that in hindsight and then also in the bottom here just like some really cute computer stickers of just Carl and it's dumped coffee and also these coffee ring stickers that I pointing at the right thing and these coffee ring stickers in this corner and if you can even see this but those coffee ring stickers were really cute and I was quite happy with those I'm proud of this project it's kind of like a joke to me but my mom really likes it so this is for me I also have a set of mugs in my house my parents also have a set of just like mugs I made with Carl and his general branding on it because my parents loved him so much and so I also have a set here but a few of them are at the office because that's what I drink coffee out of every day so that was the end of my school portfolio we also had to add another slide of our just like personal work and like at the time I really didn't know what I wanted to do and I was making a lot of these like the weird collages so these aren't gonna be great I'm just telling you now yeah okay so here again is this picture I took of Matt for my photo class and I did like some artsy I blurred out his eyes because I knew he wouldn't want a shirtless picture of him in my portfolio and it has the 1975 lyric on the side that says and he said I lost my head wow how edgy and then I was also doing a lot of these cool collages I can't the designer I was like trying to emulate here I'm not really a huge fan of his work anymore but like at the time I was a huge fan of just like this general collage style and so this was just like some weird Spacey collage I did with like this car and these lyrics what's the fun in doing what you're told which is another 1975 lyric Wow and then I have another one down here of this girl in downtown LA with the lyric what does it matter if I lied to you so I was doing a lot of these is very weird collages they took me like five minutes to do and I was like wow these are so cool I'm a creative genius but like now they're terrible and I definitely think I could do a lot better now all right guys that is all I have for you for
