[Applause] [Applause] [Music] project thinking in color starring Nick Blackhurst also starring Richard Bonynge and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tonight's episode change is coming [Music] coming up in episode 28 our friends that killed her figure out what gift to get the guy that's got everything and we finally get the mini stripped down ready for paint and afterwards Nik doesn't know what to do with himself at the end of the previous episode we'd sort 'end the gear cables to aid reliability fitted a fuel filter created some extra strong towing eye points at each corner of the car made some trim panels for the boot and the under seat area and Nick worked his magic on the rain water management which left only one job before we can strip it down hmm panel gaps before we get to the gaps we've reassembled the suspension I'm putting the wheels back on this isn't a sign of madness nope it's because although the chassis of our mini is very stiff indeed it's best practice when working on the panel gaps to have the car sat on its wheels where it's meant to be any flex in the car when on stands is negated and can be pretty sure that all the fettling will be permanent we've dug out the show stands for this endeavor and the car is gently lowered down on to them over the years our mini has been painted a multitude of different shades of crap and therefore it's really quite difficult to judge what's a gap on what's a shadow which isn't ideal when trying to make the panel's line up what we need is a uniform light color either side of the gap to contrast the dark shadow in between so Nick whips out the etch primer of which we have loads to spray over the panels and highlight the gaps can see how the light gray paint has really brought out the darkness of the shadow and the gap now pops like a Jackson Pollock painting or something yeah we'll do that with all the power gaps on the car now not to be outdone I grabbed a cannon started spraying too well they do say a change is as good as a rest there are two schools of thought when it comes to the panel gaps on this car we spend an awful long time making everything as perfect as we possibly can so why change the approach when it comes to the bodywork and there's the more reasonable pragmatic view which is it's a bloody mini and therefore there's no point in trying to finish it to the micron when it wasn't even originally built to the nearest inch now we all know that Nick would like to spend months going round every gap with the verniers but we've never been building a show car and perfection is the enemy of good enough so somewhere between lunacy and pragmatism where's a happy medium that we're going to have to try and find so let's get on with it we'll start with the boot lid because it's not the front end and actually it doesn't look too bad we've just got a slightly bigger gap this side than this side easily visible to the naked eye these gaps need some fettling but there's not much adjustment on the boot lid so bring on the power tools right well they certainly look pretty equal that will do well that turned out to easy enough certainly a lot less ass than nor deny a mangled rotten Alfa for example but that's because this is the only panel it's in isolation on the whole car the rest of the panel gaps I think I'm gonna be a completely different story yes and that's because make an adjustment on this gap and that affects this one and then that gap changes this gap fix that gap and this one changes and that happens all around the car and pretty soon your brain turns to mush and you're a dribbling vegetable a broccoli perhaps or a leek we'll start here where there actually isn't a gap because this wing is meant to be welded to this scuttle panel which is great if you've got a normal mini but we've got a flip front and if we leave it like this it's just going to rub together and where the paint off yep rather oddly we're going to start by creating a gap where there normally isn't one and to do that we're annoying many people who don't like the idea of using a cheap pair of very Mears as a scribing tool everyone loves a flappy wheel though I'm sure we can all agree on that nope I don't think we've got the required gap just yet a little more needs to be taken off so it's back to the flappy wheel now we're getting somewhere the gaps good what it needs now is a returning lip the old dirty finger on a piece of white cardboard trick shows us the profile needed to follow the edge of the wing and then it's transferred onto a piece of steel and then cut out with the grinder the new returned 'let is then very carefully welded onto the wing slowly slowly catchy monkey here so as not to warp the panel some finishing work with the finger sounder is next before the etch primer is deployed or we can see how it all fits nice of course next on the other side - and now it's time to whack the bonnet on and tackle the fit and gaps of one of the last remaining og panels on the car we could have gone for a new bonnet but quite honestly there's no guarantee that it would look any better than this one so why go to the expense this one might be old tired of it battered and probably sagged but I think the bonnet is okay these gaps down the sides may actually be a little bit tight but mini bonnet is rarely seemed to fit so believe it or not this one's quite good so I'm gonna call it a win and take that as dumb the only trouble is I needed to fit like this with the hinges in place which they aren't at the moment and that's gonna require a little bit of surgery if cast your mind back to when Noah was a lad will remember that we installed a pair of Porsche bonnet hinges with integral gas struts mainly because they were cool but also because the action brings the back edge of the bonnet away from the scuttle panel when it opens this mitigates the chances of banach to scuttle action and therefore leaves the paint on but we can't get that gap spot on as we've run out of adjustment on the hinge mounting so NIC has recessed the mount further inside the bonnet this believe it or not is an unneeded bracket but I know right he was for the bonnets day but the gas struts take care of keeping it up so if it comes the hinge is installed on the inner wing supports the bonnet is now bolted into place to get an accurate picture of all the bonnet gaps the spring and catch pin go in to see the distance between the bonnet and the front panel when it's shut properly the surgery was a success and the patient is now for a mini pretty much perfect it's far from perfect but it's very difficult to achieve perfection when the bonnet seems to be a different shape to the hole it's supposed to fit in that and it's so weak it won't actually maintain its alignment between fittings but never mind it's on it fits and it looks a hell of a lot better than quite a few of them do so I think we'll leave it there and move on to the driver's door which isn't too bad at all the window frame fits about as well as can be expected the bottom of the door to the sill is pretty much on man the gaps at both the front and rear edge are for the most part pretty good so I think the overall fit is pretty good where it is so well welded or skin-on and then we'll sort the problems afterwards with the exception of the bonnet the boot lid and the roof all the outer panels on this car have been replaced we went to reasonable lengths when fitting them to get them as lined up as possible so this stage of the build would be relatively painless the door skins are only welded to the frame at the top here the rest of the skin is just folded over the frame and massaged into place my same massage what I really mean is twatted into place using various T's by a 200 pound gorilla with a posh on for Jack Daniels the other end of the door is completed in exactly the same manner okay we have three problem areas here here and here but that's okay because we also have welders grinders and hammers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] here's a couple of before-and-after shots first the door wing scuttle area then the area above the handle and finally the bottom corner of the door it's all very well and good getting the actual panel gaps good from head on but the faces of these panels also have to align across the car so I've been doing that as I go along I'd say that was tickety-boo yep plenty good enough unfortunately we can't say the same for the other side the door don't shut and we're out of adjustment bugger right we've got a problem here so the first task is to try and work out why the door isn't closing to where it should given all the modifications it could be any number of things and this time I have let Nick whip out the verniers to facilitate the fault finding so the width of the B post area where the catch is is the same and the doors are the same width let's just show how far we move the catch inboard on the passenger side a full three millimeters and it won't go in any further so something else is going on here but wait there's one place we didn't look finish spoon sir well done sergeant but not there here see we noticed a difference in the gap between the lock unit and the door skin between the two sides quite a big difference as it happens getting on for six millimeters actually and for a component that has absolutely zero adjustability built in this is an issue see these four threaded holes are in a plate that spot welded to the back of the door frame which in itself isn't that much of a problem drill the spot welds out slot the holes in the frame and then move the plate over five mil except many moons ago some belen welded a reinforcing plate to it to strengthen up the area for the side impact bar bollocks well quite but we formulated a plan after a cup of tea obviously these screws are quarter UNC nope I don't know either but luckily there's all a pre history kicking your own shop sure and we managed to rustle up a handful of nuts with the right thread so the plan is to mark out all of the holes five millimeters to the left of where they are now drill out the threads then gouge a massive SWAT would be angry end before welding the nuts into the right place while they're only tacked in Nick's just checking that the position of the lock is correct and that all four screws go in and then he'll weld round the nuts fully the difference between the two doors was so big were not sure that the door ever closed correctly even fresh from the factory we didn't notice before taking the car apart so we really didn't expect to have to do this but it's done now along with the panel gaps it's hard to overstate just how easy it is to fall into the panel gap trap now these aren't perfect by any means but they're plenty good enough for final fettling of the body shop so I think we'll call that job done we can finally move on to stripping it down for paint no not yet we can't we've still got a sort out these scene finishes once again we've shelled out for the genuine article so it should just be a case of banging them on it's ever so refreshing to find some parts that actually just feet let the need for any modification or adjustment [Music] earthers I spoke too soon the fronts needed a trim to take into account the arch we haven't put them on because they're a nightmare to get off but the trims are held in place with these clips it's hard to get a handle on just how vicious these little buggers are so we put one on a piece of aluminium for scale the final scene trim now goes on just to check it's bit sorted while those fit just as well as pretty much any other heritage panel we've got anyway now that those are done we are ready to strip it down for paint what typical isn't it get all keyed up and then can't get on because someone has decided in their infinite wisdom to pin all the door catches and the door and the bonnet hinges this is so we can use a roll pin or a scribe er to line up everything as it is right now when it's being reassembled after the paint job that way we're not scraping off the new paint trying to adjust everything up again we've spent a long time sorting the panel gaps and adjusting the fit and finish when it would have been just as easy to throw a load of body filler at the panels and block it all back to achieve perfect lines and gaps the problem with that approach is that it doesn't take much force to chip the filler off can brush past the door shut for example with your keys in your pocket and next thing know you've got an unsightly chip to patch up hopefully our efforts mean how many won't suffer from that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so far there's been a distinct lack of funk let's fix that right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's everything off the shell with the exception of the wiring loom to remove that we have a little bit of deepening to do the flip front connector needs to come off as does the one for the wiper motor we're taking photos as we go with the plugs that don't necessarily have the same colors either side of the connector everywhere there needs to be a grommet on the loom we've wrapped yellow tape around the wires this will allow us to measure the girth select the correct grommet and fix it before it all goes back in the last of the wiring from the engine bay is now passed back into the cabin that's almost as if someone designed the access hall specifically to be able to pass the fully pin connectors droop actually what happened was that Nick milled down the outside of the round plugs to have flats on either side quite a few stunts cable tires were harmed during the making of this film I never thought I'd say this but I'm actually really looking forward to getting the loom on the bench and giving it a good wrapping all the junctions and spurs are marked and the grommet points are marked so we should be able to make a really nice job of it we had to deepen the plug that connected the boot wiring and yes in my haste I totally forgot to snip off those cable tie tails but don't worry I sent myself a strongly worded tweet with the wiring loom out of the way that really is it the car has been stripped to a bare shell it's been a long time coming many brackets have been created many cups of tea have been consumed it's been quite a slog but there's light at the end of the tunnel now we're not reaching for the she's just yet and there's still a couple of bits and pieces that need finishing off now I can get at them the first of those little jobs is to create a proofing great big earth point on the chassis to grind the engine to mr. Bolson drilling a flange nut and a little light mig action oh and some H primer pubs next on the list is replacing the crappy little self tapper to a fix the rear window with much more Skookum m4r if nuts yep we could have done this before stripping it but we didn't so stick that in your pipe and smoke it another job is to close in a void created between the scuffle panel and the a post area with a little plate small easiest of places to get the primer into yeah that's all right on to the next one we've got these little stainless covers to block these superfluous wiper holds up but while we've got the welder here we might as well do the job properly first Nick free hands to small circles as banking plates from a piece of one mil thick steel sheet these are then welded to the scuttle very carefully so as not to warp the panel then they ground back flush and finished with a little of pols finest there that looks pretty good back to the wig nuts and this time I'm putting em fives in to where the Sun Visor fixes to it's much easy to get to now that the screen is out sorted finally nick is now closing in the end of the chassis legs we've added a couple of holes in the blanking plates to pass the wiring through and these will have rubber grommets on the loom ready for them and there have it the shell is ready to be taken away and prepared for painting [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tune in next time for another exciting episode from the files of project binky don't
