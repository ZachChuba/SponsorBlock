I have come to the United States of America or Los Angeles specifically William Osmonds house we need to hang out with this guy and talk about nerdy stuff now I've run into a bit of a problem my phone is dead well it has a low battery and all of the plug sockets here in America don't seem to work so I need to find an alternate solution this video is sponsored by Skillshare more on that later so I need to find a USBC phone charger plug hey William can I borrow your phone charger since no one else owned a phone charger abuse I took to Amazon to find what I needed and came across his hand-crank generator with the USB output which should be perfect for charging my phone right so the hand-crank generator has arrived from amazon by turning this handle lights have a small red LED which I assume is showing that the USB is outputting power let's hook these all up 6 hours and 48 minutes to fully charged I'm turning this up probably one and a half revolutions per second and I really don't want to be doing that for the next 7 hours so let's come up with a better solution Peter so this is basically the same crank generator that I've bought off Amazon yeah but geared so that you can hang a big weight off of it and extract the energy from the way maybe I should convert my hand crank generator into one of these yeah charging a phone from gravity would it disassembling the hand-crank generator revealed a gear system a brushed motor and a small electronic board with the USB port I then modelled all the parts into CAD to design a custom casing which could be manufactured on Williams 3d printer once printed I can attach the pulley to the output gear and fit the remaining components inside what's poppin Tom what's purple how does it work so this is the gravity pod phone charger basically a hand crank generator modified into a 3d printed housing gear system inside here it's brushed motor which then powers this USB port here now I've designed it to work with this beaded rope system so I can hang a weight from it drop it off the edge of this ledge and we should be able to charge my phone okay ready yeah how long does a is it four hours why is this Jack McGee the bat your invention sucks time spending anything you made yeah Wow how many times do I need to lower this to fully charge your phone well continuously for four hours so if that took how long did that take like so would be sick so 600 you have to do that six or 700 times I think we need to make this thing lower slower okay so like more weight so in a pulley system that pulls it slower exactly so in order to slow the descent rate I've added two extra pulleys this means the weight will descend three times slower for the same rpm of the generator and since the USB won't output more than 0.5 amps at 5 volts even when dropping really fast it's best to prolong the descent time as much as possible without the current dropping too low so let's try lowering a larger weight from a greater height I am setting up the gravity phone charger to try off the edge of this high ledge it's kind of scary standing on a chair where you're gonna take the potential energy from this coke bottle and put it into my phone I wring the coke weight we're gonna run out beep oh no what's the problem I need to winch it with the way back up so we found the fundamental issue with this gravity powered charger and that is that I have to win yeah no no no no we can try to train the cat to get in the basket write it down and then climb up the stairs get back into the basket right again let's try the first test of the cat in the box ready yes a totally word beer not this was a manager Jimmy was not in the bag at any point in time whatsoever right Jimmy one last idea to test this charger currently dead if I press the power button it doesn't turn on we're gonna see how many times we need to lower this coke bottle maybe charge one percent in battery and take one photo in the comments down below take a guess how many times you reckon this is going to take and once the link in the description down below coming to the bottom of the drop that's three drops that's me the phone let's see if we can turn it on huh it's got into like super power mode let the brightness is dying oh I know we've got we've got something or a 0% 0% take the stupid selfie yeah but we took a gravity-powered selfie if you're doing video as possible and yeah thanks once again for watching thanks to Peter for filming this and I see in the next video
