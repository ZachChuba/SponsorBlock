(TWICE 9th Mini Album
[MORE & MORE] Comeback D-1) (Zombies raided the JYP office) (Find the USB with the comeback tracks!) (Find all the clues in the office) (Save the USB and the staff!) (TWICE's great adventure begins!) (Everyone got
a survival kit and flashlight) (But there is danger everywhere) (Zombies!) (For their comeback,
they need to save the USB!) (There is unexpected terror all around) Are we stuck? (TWICE is in trouble from the start) (Will they succeed
in saving the USB?) (Escaping the zombies,
Team DACHAETZU head to 1F) - Ah!
- What's this? I'm scared. What's this? (Go away, Zombie)
What a relief. (Feeling grateful for the flashlights)
It's a good thing we found these. (Let's go up) (Sighing in relief in the elevator) This is a little bit scary. Yes, look at me. I'm  scared. (Meeting a zombie is terrible) (Thanks, flashlight!)
I'm glad we found them. (Arrive at 4F) (Carefully entering 4F)
♪ Cheer up baby, cheer up baby ♪ - Huh? What's this?
- Huh? What's that? (Team JEONGJIMI is still facing zombies) (We need to get out!)
♪ Stars, flowers, festivals ♪ (JEONGYEON tries to escape) - Ah!
- Take one each. (Girls, hurry up!) (Cautious) (Cautious) (Cornered and unable to act)
Hurry up! (MINA succeeds in escaping!) (JIHYO is stuck) Here!
Why aren't you turning away? - Why aren't you turning away?
- Hurry up! (In order to escape,
MINA catches the elevator) (Now is the time)
Run! Run! There could be a hint here! (What? A hint?)
Hey, come here. (Even now, YOO is searching again)
I found many hints. But there are too many zombies. (Come inside for now!) - How will we get out later?
- Just come inside. Come in. (Team NAMOSA is moving to 1F)
I opened them all! ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la-la ♪ (Arrived on 1F) I bet there are squirt guns here.
(For MOMO, clues <<<<< squirt guns) (Clue)
Huh? Here. A squirt gun, too! (My beloved squirt gun)
Huh? Squirt gun. Just find the camera.
(Camera location = Clue location) Let's go to the 4th floor. Why, all the zombies are in the basement! (Let's go before the zombies come!) (Team NAMOSA checks the hints!) This was "earphones." - "Whiteboard?"
-A whiteboard on the the 4th floor. (Clues on 4F:
Chair, Piggy bank, Cushion, Whiteboard) (HINT. B1 Earphone) Throw the envelope away. (HINT. B1. MDN mirror) - I think it's the location.
- The Madonna mirror? - Yes, let's go.
- The hint must be there. - Let's go to the 4th floor.
- Okay. (A bold warning on the 4F) - Ah, so zombies can't enter?
- Huh? A water spray? (What is the water spray for?) (The spray reveals the laser beam) (The elevator arrives on 4F)
♪ Cheer up baby ♪ (Team NAMOSA arrived on 4F!) (What a relief! Let's go quickly!) Where's the laser? Wow!
(Amazed) (Amazed) (They enter the 4F avoiding the laser) We need to go to the 4th floor.
Did you press the elevator? Yes, I did.
(Let's check the hint first!) (HINT. Elevator)
There's a hint in the elevator. Open this. (Ooh, ah) (Zombie party) (JIHYO, hurry up!)
Open it! Open it! (Let's see) "9F Beans." "7F, 9F Stairs." - Stairs.
- Let's take just this. (Stay calm)
"9F Mug." (Take that! Light)
I always pick empty ones. - Huh? "1F Trees."
- 1st floor trees. (Let's go to 1F since it's the closest!) We've pressed the elevator.
(Elevator, OK. What about the zombies?) (We have our flashlights.)
(We were waiting for you) I have a squirt gun.
(Plenty of squirt guns, too) I got them from there just now.
(All ready) (Zombies are blocking both ways) - Flashing the light behind us?
- Yes. (Crowded) (Calmly getting the hint) (The flashlight attacks are effective!) (Save the zombies.
Ah!) (We're invincible with our flashlights) (Out of the way, zombies)
Go away. Those in the back, please move forward. (Zombies try to attack from behind)
(Beaming a light) The zombies are getting smarter. (Bemused) (Taken back) I think we got all the hints. - Is that a dud?
- Yes. (Sudden zombie attack)
Argh! (Taken back) "You can't run!"
"You can't run!" (Beaming a light) What's that brush? - Brush?
- Will it come handy? (A suspicious-looking brush) (Let's take it just in case) (Elevator arrived at B1) (Quickly gets in the elevator) "Elevator."
Ah, here's the clue. (Don't go) (Team DACHAETZU search the 4F office)
Oh, a squirt gun! (A smooth start finding a squirt gun) (4F Clue. Whiteboard) What's this? (Found a strange whiteboard)
Guys! Another squirt gun! (Team NAMOSA had the whiteboard hint)
What is this? They said this was a hint. When we meet zombies,
we have to take clues off them. - So,
- But the zombies we've found so far, - all of their hints were taken.
- Really? (First time seeing a hint?)
Wow. "Yu," "A," "B," "N."
(What is this?) (Let's just go down) (Obviously, it's an important clue!) I should take a photo.
(Take a picture just in case) - DAHYUN!
- What? (I don't think they're on 4F)
Let's go to another floor. Okay.
(Sure, let's go,) (What's next for the School Meal Club?)
Let's go to B1. (Where the zombie party is at?) Oh, this is... If we overlap them in order, won't we get a word? (Detectives NABONG and SHA guess sincerely)
4, 5... Here. - Do you see it?
- I think I will! (Sequential)
Let's put this together. (The word is revealed in order!) "Tele..." - "Vision?"
- "Television." So we need to find a TV? (Did you already find a TV?) (A clue found
without the help of a hint) (Are you going to look for another TV?) (So confusing) (So many TVs throughout the office) (Dubu is studying the whiteboard) (Such mysterious characters) Is this the alphabet "TT"? (The characters are
impossible to understand) (I don't know) (Also caught up by the whiteboard)
Let's write with this. Oh, write it here? (MOMO copies the characters) (What does this clue mean?) "MORE & MORE?" (Following the stream of consciousness) (Team JEONGJIMI head to 1F) It said "1F trees," right? 1st floor trees and 4th floor cushion! Aren't most of the zombies
in the basement? Aren't there more clues on the 9th floor?
(Looking around) (There should be a clue in the trees...) (Where the original clue was)
Maybe they took it? (Yes... It's already taken...) But only we have the tree hint! But they could have found it
without a hint. (Bingo
Team NAMOSA got it without the hint) (But searching YOO is obsessed with the tree) There has to be something here. Oh, a squirt gun. Darn, it's empty. Let's go to the 4th floor. What else did we have?
You have all the hints, right? Isn't there a cushion on the 4th floor? (HINT. 4F cushion) (HINT. 7F & 9F stairs) (The brush they snatched
just in case) Four hundred! I don't think so. (In fact, the brush was meaningless) (Fooled for sure) (Team JEONGJIMI go to 4F) (Team DACHAETZU arrive on B1) (Welcome) (Welcome) (Zombie hotspot B1)

Huh? (Zombies approach) (Crisis) (Escaping and getting a hint) - Awesome!
- ♪ Cheer up ♪ (Zombies are scary)
♪ Cheer up ♪ (Zombies) (Knock Knock) (TZUYU bravely tries to get a hint) (Zombie touch) (TZUYU loses 1 heart) (Zombie touch 2) (TZUYU loses both of her 2 hearts) (Zombie TZUYU) - The zombie is laughing.
- TZUYU! (The zombies here are strange...) (Cheerful Zombie TZUYU)
I'm a zombie. Stop touching me. (The hint they got
by TZUYU's sacrifice is a dud) (Zombie TZUYU) (TOFUCHAENG can also become zombies) (Delivering the hint) (I'm a kind(?) zombie) (LOL) (Let's get out of here first!)
Let's run! We'll save you first. - I have a lot of squirt guns.
- I'm okay for now. (TZUYU, do you want to be a zombie?) - Too many zombies.
- Hurry up, DAHYUN! (DAHYUN is cornered) DAHYUN, this way! Ah! What's this? It's too dangerous to save me. (Running away for now) (What will become of Zombie TZUYU?) (Team NAMOSA is still struggling) - The Madonna practice room?
- Sure. (The television mystery) The TV might not be
on the 4th floor, right? (Found a TV)
Oh! Is it the basement TV? (Basement) (Bingo) (MO?)
(The one who found it is clueless) (Team JEONGJIMI
arrives at the laser beams) There's one below. - Here.
- Where? Where? (Be careful) Come in, MINA! (Join forces to cross the laser beams!) (Spray) (Spray) (They are more careful than ever)
There's one on the bottom. Here, too.
(MORE spray  & MORE spray) (Pass) Maybe it's the basement TV?
(Yes... Basement TV...) - Shall we go to Madonna?
- Yes, let's go to Madonna. (Something found)
Eh? What is this? (Get the key that was with the warning!) - There's one here, too.
- How many keys were there? (Back in the basement with the TV mystery) (It's always so exciting to meet zombies) (Wait... We'll see you soon...) (Oblivious and optimistic)
We're alright! - I can save you right away.
- We have many squirt guns. (Squirt gun flex)
We have many opportunities. Is there more? (We were waiting for you)

I shone the flashlight! (I'm upset) (TZUYU, come with us!) (Whatever) (Where are our members?) (They hide on the stairs
and check the hint!) (HINT. 4F refrigerator) (TZUYU?) (The world's cutest bellow) (Kind zombie)

Here! (Slowly creeping) (Getting a hint with Zombie TZUYU's help) (TZUYU, thank you) - Let's go!
- Now what? Where to go? We need to make a comeback! (TZUYU. We'll remember you!) (Wistful) (TZUYU. We'll remember you! 2) (TZUYU. We'll remember you! 3)
(Take me with you, too!) (Hectic)
CHAEYOUNG, let's go to the 4th floor! (Save TZUYU TT)
Save me! (Oh, no! TZUYU!)
Where's TZUYU? TZUYU! (TZUYU recovers 1 heart)
Okay! (Escapes from B1 at the speed of light)
4th floor! (Starting to search for the cushion!) (Zombie) (Peekaboo) (Searching hard
without knowing this situation) (Where is the cushion?) (No cushion, just squirt guns)
I found a gun. Here, too! (All are searching hard for the cushion!) (Plenty of squirt guns)
I think I found too many! (The cushion is nowhere to be found...) (Searching YOO's radar activated) Oh, here it is! The cushion! (Team JEONGJIMI on their way) (Red cushions on the meeting room chairs) The others were in this room before.
(Is the clue really here?) - Hey.
- Huh? (Clue: Number 4) Maybe it's a password? - Number 4! Remember!
- Yes, 4. (A zombie enters through the laser beam)
What? Get out! (School Meal Club tired from the chase)
This is really hard. (Can't give up until the end!)
We need to go to 4F and 9F. (Sudden flashback to B1) TZUYU was a very kind zombie. (We're not kind zombies)
Let's go to 4F first. (Welcome to the zombie elevator) (Hello, School Meal Club) Go away, go away.
(Take that! Flashlight) (Unintentionally heading back to to B1) (B1, Michael Jackson
NAMOSA are rummaging the practice room) (Still obsessed with the TV) - "Earphones." What's this?
- Maybe it's inside? (B1 clue: Speaker)
Oh! I found it! (MOMO finds a clue again!)
Boo found it! Boo found it. (Curious)
Look, look. Oh, it's a key.
(Successfully found another key!) (Out of the eight keys,
Team NAMOSA got three) - But we have to do this together.
- That's right. Another zombie!
(Fires squirt gun) Don't shoot them!
(Shooting zombies now LOL) (Remember! Squirt guns
can only be used once!) (And now, more zombies) (Whoa, whoa) Get out! Get out. (Wary) (Close call) - Which floor?
- 7th floor! (Groan)
♪ Cheer up baby ♪ (Songs and flashlights
make them invincible) Slowly. Slowly.
(Turtle Zombie) (Arrived on 7F)
What was the clue? Stairs.
It was the stairs from 7F to 9F. - Stairs?
- Yes, stairs. (Okay, going to the stairs!)
Looks like a mission. (Looking around) (Clue: Number 6)
"Everyone! Don't just pass by! 6"" (The number clues
Team JEONGJIMI obtained: 4 and 6) 4 and 6? (Remember! 4! 6!) (Arriving on 9F
after getting the clue numbers) - Oh, yummy food!
- What is it? (Taking it first)
Let's take it just in case. (Clue on Floor B1: Earphones)
(Found a bundle of earphones) I found the earphones. There are paper cups, too.
"9F paper cup." (I found the earphones, but...) (What is this?)
Could it be this? (Detective MO guessing)
To plug them somewhere and listen, keep the earphones, maybe? Let's take them, then. (We're not sure, but let's take them!) (A load of items)
Shall we leave some guns behind? I don't think we need this much.
(Spilling out) (The end of the squirt gun flex...) (Deciding to take only six!) Did you know? JEONGYEON's shooting zombies.
(YOO shooting wildly) I don't think we need
that much water. Now we need to search
the 7th floor for a key. (7F? Key?)
And... No, we gather up on the 7th floor and collect the keys! (Smart Jeongnam)
What we found. (Ambitious NAYEON finds zombies at the door)
♪ This moment I dance ♪ (Ambitious NAYEON is here for a hint) (Easily gets a hint) (Zombies aren't scary
if you're with Ambitious LIM!) (Ah-ah)
(Grr) (Zombies, I won't let you go easily!) (Getting another hint) (What's their extra hint?)
Nothing? Pig?
(HINT. 4F Pig) - Eh? I saw a pig somewhere.
- I saw a pig on the 4th floor. (The piggy bank they saw on the 4th floor) I thought, "What is
a pig doing here?" Let's go to the 4th... No. - The paper cup on the 9th floor first!
- Sure. 9th floor first. No, let's go for
the pig on the 4th floor first. (Team DACHAETZU is back on Floor B1) (Wary) (Wary) (Still a zombie hotspot)
♪ Cheer up baby ♪ (Zombies, turn around... Leave...) (Arriving at the Madonna practice room
avoiding the zombies) Lock the door!
(Ironclad defense) What if the hints are useless? Dud! (Floor B1 clues:
Mirror, Piano) (Where is the clue?) - Wow, wow!
- A lot of squirt guns! (MORE squirt guns & MORE squirt guns) I'm going to save everyone! Leave the empty ones here. (CHAEYOUNG shines every corner
finding the clue) (Team JEONGJIMI arrived on 7F) (Recording studio
the USB might be in) Hmm? Isn't it strange? (Wide open)
(The open door is obviously strange) Huh? A decoder. (Wary)
(What is this decryption machine for?) (Zombies flocking back to B1) (Against Ambitious NAYEON and the Girls) (Elevator, we like)

Don't! (Team DACHAETZU
hasn't found anything yet) Maybe there are no hints here. (There was a piano among the clues!) Piano? Are you here?
(Found a suspicious-looking piano) (Maybe on the piano?) (TOFU looks around) (They search long and hard,
but they don't see the clue) (Where is the clue?) Maybe they already found it?
(Are they giving up?) (Team JEONGJIMI
enter the recording studio) (Strange objects everywhere) - Wow, interesting.
- Ah! So we need to decipher this! (Found the pig!)
The pig is here. (Coins) (Are the coins
in the piggy bank the clue?) (The School Meal Club won't give up!) - What's that?
- I think they found it. (Found something?) Ah! Ah! Hey! No way! I found it! (A mysterious decryptor
in the recording studio) (The clues must be collected!) (Not much time left!) (They find the clues one by one!) (Will TWICE find all the clues) (and retrieve the USB?)
