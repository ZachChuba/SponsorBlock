so the thing about modern laptops is that there isn't a whole lot that's designed to be upgraded about them except for one thing that most people probably wouldn't think of some laptops out there can actually have their displays upgraded so we and by we I mean Alex ordered a replacement screen for our Acer predator whatever this thing is what is this the yo-yo so we can go from 1080 60 Hertz to 1080 120 Hertz also bigger kilogram really yeah well why don't we do just that [Music] I fix its Manta tool kit comes with a hundred and twelve bits including standard ones like Phillips and flathead but also specialty ones check it out today at the link in the video description so much like many of Alex's videos these days he doesn't appear to have done a whole ton of planning in fact he hasn't even opened the package for the replacement screen but you validated that this works um forums have said it should work forms have said it should work okay yeah hopefully I figure if this one doesn't work we also have a Dell g3 and also it should work so with this yeah [Music] there's a couple of key things that you need to look out for one is the actual physical size of the display that you're buying but there's more to it than just oh I've got a 15.6 inch laptop I buy a 15.6 inch panel and bippity Boppity because there's also the mounting points of which there are many standards and also there are a shocking number of display interfaces for laptops so hopefully we're gonna have some luck today well should we eat should we unbox this first that's the one thing I fix it kids don't have it i watch this will work haha it's set on the eBay listing that it should also work for this and some Dell laptop so we'll see I guess I mean especially given that back when we reviewed the Helios 300 as I recall we said pretty much the only issue with it was that the screen wasn't that great yeah pretty much so you guys got to remember when you buy an LCD display assembly like this it includes the front glass the actual LCD in the middle and also the backlight so we should be able to address the fact that it's 60 Hertz and the fact that the backlight isn't particularly bright and then this says don't touch Oh like was I really not supposed to touch it I figured you might so liquid middle it while we're in there so let's just replace the display and call that the project but it could be just a bit quieter it's not even allow the laptop have you uh like googled anything about this we need to pop these rubber duty keys off or like what's our deal here there we go I'm good I'm clear why are things assembled with clips hold on hold on well that was easier than I expected this might be the shortest Linus and Alex do a weird thing adventure yet there's no way it's just that easy cool okay so those mount points look pretty similar that interface looks pretty darn similar so you can check that out there it still plenty of time for us to break this we get some more tape to put on there yes based on that it just slipped out the other cool thing about this is that there's lots of reasons why you might want to replace the display in your laptop other than you know being on the lookout for a performance upgrade like oh crap that's not the right stuff oh shoot like for example it's a pretty common issue to end up with an outline of your keyboard scratched into your glass so for 55 bucks you can get the thing as good as new that's freaking awesome okay hold on we may have spoken too soon is it a touch wider no it's the same okay what's going on here maybe I just didn't pay close attention to how this came out oh I think it just shifted a little yeah these just shifted okay so that's fine yeah if you want to hold that so you just want to make sure before you screw it in these little pieces right here to make sure those are propped all the way through so you can see the the frame like the brace thing here it's not quite aligned see now it's popped through we should end up with a nice flush mount now so we don't even have to put the bezel on or do what no way that easy [Music] dang all right so first thing we'll test is the brightness buttons then I guess right wait are they working it doesn't look like it's doing anything but let's go ahead and change it to 120 Hertz see if it works so this is a handy dandy little utility by toasty X called custom resolution utility and as far as we've been able to find it's the only one that allows you to actually set custom resolutions or refresh when you have Intel integrated graphics and an Nvidia dedicated graphics card running in like hybrid GPU mode it's really frustrating the Intel utility has an interface for it you can key it in and then from my experience anyway it just spits out errors for the most part yeah it just says like bandwidth not available or something which is ridiculous because you could even set something lower in some cases and it'll be like ooh maximum bandwidth exceeded mm-hmm Oh for crying out loud why always didn't even warn us either I just hit restart one eternity later quick quick get over here it rebooted once already but it's didn't what that is definitely 120 Hertz smoothness look at that isn't that beautiful it's beautiful so we can go ahead and pull this off oh that is a much much nicer display than what was on here before we should probably like fire up the game or something then right Oh for crying out loud oh I managed to walk into a trap already that okay gaming in 2018 ladies and gentlemen so there you have it there's not really much else to say everything that's good about high refresh rate 120 Hertz gaming is now officially good about this laptop and all you have to lose is 55 Canadian roubles about a half an hour of your time assuming that you're totally incompetent and well brightness adjustment which is sort of the biggest problem but something that if your use case is predominantly gaming I think you still might want to consider more RGB check it out at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider tracking outward the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there's our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join I can't believe how smoothly this went yeah it almost takes the fun out of it almost I mean this puts the fun back into it this is great
