hey groupies welcome back to former therapy this is the culture study i'm the channels video producer and your host you can call me pd and the culture study is where we check out music videos coming out of the kpop world I myself am a korean-american grew up in the kpop world my entire life since I was born and I'm also an aspiring filmmaker I'm a video producer I've worked on a couple music videos and I provide my critique and I provide some insight into how the production process works and we also try to figure out how some of these music videos are pulled off and made now today we are checking out 8 by iu produced and featuring suga of BTS this should be an interesting collab I know that suga has produced a handful of songs for other artists I know Hayes Hayes and Sudan Sudan and there might there may be some that are slipping my mind but suga I think seems to compose a handful of songs for female artists that's interesting so yeah this is I use comeback in a hot minute now before we or you can't we understand let's just get into this video this is 8 by I you and this is your form of therapy well there we go alright let's check it out oh not the vibe I was expecting okay more not the vibe I was expecting although it sounds like it's coming from like the video/audio I suppose the actual music well now that's the music oh oh [Music] kill [Music] a lot of the a lot of this music video in this and this quote-unquote simulation cheese in shot from a very Boyer istic angle the way she's looking at you is like [Music] cheep-cheep [Music] [Applause] [Music] whoa [Music] interesting transitioning into animations [Music] oh is it already over oh my gosh no it's not hold on to him that acting hmm okay first of all the song is great the song is great very energetic I mean it has that similar kind of vibe of being kind of similar to like a BTS song I mean I think it's a little bit more completely it's it's it's definitely completely changed by the fact that it's I used voice and it's a little bit more written for her voice but I can kind of see like the influences like I can see like how Sugar's hands in the production of their music usually works now but the song is it's very sad it's very sad but the song and the tempo and the rhythm it's very upbeat it's got that guitar that kind of like kind of keeps you going kind of keeps the song like on its feet and I love music like this I love music with songs that are inherently sad I you you know her character sounds like she is singing and she's shouting almost in the chorus where as if shouting and singing is going to make it all better you know it's like almost like she's trying to run away and deny the pain and I like that now we're going to watch this again because the one thing that kind of threw me off was the video the first watch through I kind of just like to just casually watch and then in the second walkthrough I like to kind of jump in a little bit more and get a little bit more intricate so I'll check this out [Music] so the immediate vibe I get from this is you know a very neo future black mirror esque inspired kind of environment where let's see record that's interesting it's reporting see I thought and okay so there's that little gecko chameleon whatever tunxi net hold on I think reading this will help I thought she was like reliving her memories or playing her memories but I think now given that it says record before we actually read what it says I my guess is I think now she has this pain that she can't let go of so what this brain is going to do is gonna it's gonna record her memories and by recording it recording those painful memories or whatever she will forget it and it's gonna be stored here so let's just go back a little hair hold on let's let's make a bigger job [Music] tangina Budhan Kyogre toda Naga Seneca taja so - Cho Chang means to save it says yeah and annual which is yes and no so okay let's let's let's keep watching she's saying yes so it's saying would you like to save all of your memories so I think that's what it's doing it's extracting those memories from Earth [Music] hold on interesting yeah so look at her lips her lips are actually cut up a little they're like cut up they're blistered they're little they're a little bit hard I her nails like it's like she scratched off all her nails you know it's all messy [Music] can't [Music] and then that little gecko thing is gone oh I see okay so then that animated part is actually her dream she's dreaming that the gecko disappearance that you know when you have some of those dreams so she wakes up and it actually is go [Music] what's that white light supposed to be I wonder okay so like I thought it was like a lighthouse so if you look there's like a rolling light [Music] so that I think what that is supposed to be is actually let's let's is it at the end let me see yeah so notice the ring around her I think that's supposed to represent the light that's going around her so even through her subconscious she can see the light passing by [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh is that supposed to be her little gecko thing it can fly now [Music] I love this shot coming up what a beautiful set by the way this right when she smiles she smiles it seems like she's at peace but then the subtle acting right here she's smiling but the smile slowly falters love that love that shot that is whoa that shot is powerful you know what this says to me is she's happy because she's forgotten this pain right this thing has extracted the memory from her mind and she's happy because she forgets that pain but like you can't you know pain is not just tied to your memory it's a part of who you are and so she she's smiling and then it begins to falter because the happiness is momentary it's not even happiness more it's more like relief she's like at peace but then something doesn't quite feel right and she doesn't know what because a piece of her is missing now you know when you remove and extract memories from something you are not making yourself happier you're not making yourself better you are only removing something and leaving a blank hole and you're you're you're making you're providing like an emptiness for yourself and that's what she feels like a slight emptiness now sometimes living with your pain is better than not knowing the pain you know that that's you know we're getting super philosophical there but Wow 8bi I you and Suga that was awesome a great song great music video but what did you guys think let me know in the comments down below I thought this was a very very fun song for IU I think this is both right up I use Ali but also something very different I love the meaning of the song the meaning of the song can be tied to love and pain and heartbreak but the music video takes it a different way it's about her losing this pet that was done in a very creative way and the lyrics do still fit but obviously if it wasn't for the music video it's not about this little pet right so I like that it works in both cylinders but guys let me know what you thought also remember if you would like to support us monetarily please head on over to patreon patreon comm slash form a therapy for its little list two dollars a month you get an early access to videos just like this and also for just a little bit more you get live stage reactions variety show reactions and all sorts of other fun stuff so head on over to patreon if you want to see that but guys thank you very much for supporting us you know what if you can't or you don't want to support us on patreon we understand why don't you go ahead and hit like down below leave a comment you know helping us out for free is easy it helps us out with the YouTube search algorithm when you do those things hit subscribe if you're new be notified when we upload a new video and go ahead and check out all our other videos over here and I'll see you guys next time bye
