today will be my third time trying svelt i tried it when it first came out and i went through like 10 of the tutorial it was great i really liked it but then i didn't really have a reason to continue until like a while later the second time i tried it this guy named vape jordan was like hey let me teach you svelte so he showed me how to do a to-do list and then i just haven't touched svelte since then i'm interested in svelte for two reasons number one i like just trying new stuff and svelte is kind of the hot kid on the block right now and you also just like watching me get outside of my react bubble and try these new things and then secondly which is more important that supposedly you can build smaller websites with this versus say using react but not sacrifice on the developer experience svelt now let's just go to the tut and just like with vue i'm just going to go through the official tut on the website i've actually tried a little bit of this but i totally forgot pretty much all my fault knowledge but it should come back to me pretty quickly but the tut is actually pretty amazing because as you can see it has like a little editor that you get to type and try it out as it gives you like lessons on the side and also it is just very comprehensive as you can see these are all the different things so i have quite a bit ahead of me because i think i'm just going to grind through this and try this all out and by the way i should probably mention for those of you that have no idea what tag this thing is it's just a front-end framework um actually i don't know if it considers itself a framework or not but anyway you can just use it instead of react for example this compiler doesn't have any chill as soon as i start typing div it's already barking at me before i even finish it i kind of just created a poor man's render function right here where whenever i call set state on count this bit of code runs so it's almost like a mix between use effect where the dependency is count and then for me to call set state all i do is i just mutate the count and then svelte handles it this is so weird i'm not used to things not having like quotations around them or for numbers not having curly braces like what it has nothing it's just working yay me i'm done i went through this really fast because i didn't do a lot of the typing portion where you like interact with it except for a couple of them and i did that on purpose because my main strategy is to just like go through all the topics and get an idea of what they all are and then actually go build my own thing now and then when i get stuck go back and go through the interactive part if i need to and get extra help so now i'm going to get spelled set up on my computer and then start working on my own project easiest way to get start was felt use the rebel use deckit belt setup typescript all right oof for tab spacing there we go much better what happened console nothing showing up oh do i have to do like dev oh i did so i did start not dev okay all right we're good we're good hello world we're ready to start coding some salt what do i what should i make who am i kidding i already know what i'm making there's a square and this is a board square that's a board solid one picks fff there we go can you guess what i'm making you're wrong i'm making the snake game where you go around and you bite things or at least i'm trying to make that but you gotta admit that board is looking pretty sharp already right a cell can either be empty a snake or it can be food getting all fancy with my felt logic like check this out i got my class that triggers the empty class if cell is equal to empty or if it's food it's food if it's snake it's snake but then like i'm just a scrub the cell name matches the name here i could just stick it right here like i don't know can i actually can i do this i do templates you know let's do like this and then i get rid of all this code i was getting too fancy as fault when i could just be doing this the entire time i'm doing some wonky stuff and we're about to find out if this actually moves the snake or not so i have this grid up here right and then i have a computed grid and the computed grid just takes the snake's position and puts it in the grid and then on mount i set an interval which you know what i should probably clear this on unmount so i don't have a memory leak but i don't feel like looking it up so we'll just let's deal with it and then i just decrement the snake's position and it should like recompute it i think but let's see let's see if it does it it went that way i actually wanted it to go up and eat but it looks like it did work let's see yes it's a little slow but it works so it kept the snakes old position so i'm just need to wipe the snakes position beforehand okay nice now it empties cool i think the algorithm to update the snake is i remove the last element in the snake position and then we append a new head on on it snake's out of its cage i'm a loser arrow left i added the logic so if you lost the game it shows an h1 you lost instead of showing the board but you notice like i wrapped the entire board here and else what i'd really like to do is if i was in react i would just like put this up here right and then i'd return early and then nothing after it would be displayed i'm not sure if there's like that concept in svelt where i can just like return early and have other stuff below it and have it on the same level because it's a little bit cleaner we need a random algorithm to generate food javascript random number all right turn the corner is it actually working no i ate myself a couple times there it's looking a little sluggish when it moves i'm wondering if tweening is the answer this is actually not tweening i need i think i just need a css now it's just flashing i'm not sure what animation i'm supposed to use to make this smoother so i'm just going to keep it as is and call it a feature so if the new head would collide with the snake body that also means the game is over now the game is over so loss is equal to true all right this is so slow i need to make it faster so i'm going to switch the set timeout n minus snake position times 10. all right they got super fast took the life so now i should get faster every time i eat a food or i get longer should we also have two foods on the map maybe let's go i'm really nervous because i don't want to kill myself against the wall there we go you lost by killing yourself so i just want to test running into myself kills me all right random food you get to do it twice i get real fat real fast oh i should have my high score at the top i ran into myself like a pleb i should still show the map so you can see how gross of a loss that was all right let's go all right we're starting to go a little fast okay we're going really fast now we're really dude it is so hard after 20. i don't think 20 is impossible we need to like i need like some logarithmic crap to make this a little bit slower for the purpose of this we will just do a max length of let's do 15. it was getting pretty fast see how long i can get this guy let's go okay we died wait this should be a men amend not max all right so it shouldn't get any faster than this but this is kind of too fast if you like like i can't even go for outside ones you know i'm just going in a gosh dang circle oh my gosh i boxed myself in there's no escaping oof as much fun as i'm having playing my crappy svelte snake game i think i'm going to end it here because why play the snake game when i could just be playing among us anyway which also reminds me discord people wanted me to plug discord because they want some more discord friends so if you're not aware i have a discord link is in the description if you want to check it out and come talk to me about svelt because i had a great time i really enjoyed it one thing i noticed is stuff just worked like i just like intuited a lot of how it worked and then when i tried it the snake would just work and just did the thing and i didn't like run into a lot of issues so that was really nice maybe it's because the project i picked was too simple and when i do more stuff i'll run into something but i don't really have any complaints so far everything went really smoothly and i look forward to doing more svelt in the future i'm thinking maybe we'll do some sapper and try out their framework and uh yeah it'll be a good time come on now you didn't think i was actually gonna end the video without giving you a little bit of a tier list did you okay here's the thing i don't know enough spell to be able to compare it against react so we're just gonna have react as our default winner because you know that's how the world works and i probably don't really have enough experience to compare it against vue either but here's the thing this is the vibe that i'm getting out of the little bit i've tried of both if i want to use jsx which i know you can do and view at least people are saying then i'm just going to use react but if i want to do like the template thingymabobber then i'm kind of feeling svelte i kind of like the temple thing was felt better than i did with vue but like maybe like small margins plus my understanding is with felt you get a smaller bundle size than with view which maybe this is wrong so please correct me below if i am but for that reason i'm giving svelte second place and there you go that is my tier list you
