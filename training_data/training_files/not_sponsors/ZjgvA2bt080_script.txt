so I'm Brady there was photograph talking to Mark Davis and I have inside sources saying that they were talking for about 20 minutes down there what could they have possibly talking about obviously they're talking about Tom Brady becoming the head the quarterback starting quarterback and possibly assistant head coach right for the Las Vegas Raiders Jon Gruden would absolutely love to have the greatest of all time in his building it's not just good for the offense it's good for everybody to see what it takes to be great I don't think he goes to Las Vegas Raiders but this is what Tom Brady is set up with his cerebral approach this year for every word that has come out of his mouth anything that he is directly approached or connected to whether it's a photo in Vegas with Mark Davis whether it's a trip to Miami or California or Indianapolis we'll stop by this conversation is gonna start this speculation is gonna start and that's exactly where you want to be if you're tv12 so in your opinion when something like that happens no matter what is said does that put pressure on these other GM's are they thinking like oh like the Raiders are in the lead right now like we fear is it more like anybody thinks the Raiders are in the league because the season doesn't end until March March nothing can happen well hello there and get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic but they definitely see like and then in his interview afterwards where he's like he's open to the process yeah open to this he likes he loves playing football not once in that interview did he say I hope I end up back at the Patriots right which is all anybody was waiting for him to say was he hopes he goes back to the Patriots he didn't say that he said loves supposed to has a lot left to prove I think all these things are making people go oh damn he really is gonna leave and I think that Mark Davis picture Tom knew exactly what he was gonna do so I'm Tom Brady knew exactly what that was gonna do I think I might have been the first one to tweet it out by the way shadow Gumpy for finding that photo but uh the speculation is real
