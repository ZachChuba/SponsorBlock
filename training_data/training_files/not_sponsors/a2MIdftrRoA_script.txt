Hello~ First, the time. It is 9:48 AM. I woke up at 9:30. Woke up at 9:30, brushed my teeth.. And lay down again.
Because.. The reason I lay down again: I'm going to
go out at 1PM, so I have some time left. I've become an early bird doing music shows lately. So, I'm going to go on my phone a bit Sleep again I'm going to do that and wake up again.
(Sleepy) (Sleepy) Today's vlog I'm going to start. Let's go! (Docking her phone) (YouTube~) (Browsing browsing) [Going to sleep more~] [Like that, Solar went to sleep again..] I eventually got up again. It's 10:50 AM. (Well-rested face) My mom slept over at our house yesterday So she made me kimbap. Kimbap shot.
[Yongddonie's mom's kimbap] [Mom's kimbap eaten for breakfast] [1 in the afternoon] It's 1 in the afternoon. I go out at 1:20 So I'm going to wash my hair, do some stretching exercises, And take with me the kimbap my
mom packed (Precious kimbap) So she packed it for me and told
me to eat it with the staff. I woke up so early today that I got
ready in a relaxed way. In a vlog, this is my first time being
relaxed at home this much. Every time I start a vlog, I'm like, 'Hello...' Hello~ [Past vlogs..] Then, immediately in the car, I'm like,
'I'm going now~' and stuff.. This is a kind of different vlog. I'm at ease.
[Vlog overflowing with relaxedness] I'll see you again at the (schedule). Bye~ Hello~ Solarsido~ (Intro again) This is Solar! Finally, I came out of my house. I'm in the car now on the way to the shoot. Today's weather is really nice. [to. manager] What time did you wake up? Me, about 9? 9?! (Quite surprised) Daebak! 9:30 for me. (Real laugh that doesn't care about the camera) I got in the habit of waking up
too early while promoting. I've gotten into a bad habit. (Happy having a like-minded person) Wah~ It's summer~ (Excited Yongddon) Let's hurry and leave~ I've just arrived.
[Arrived at the photoshoot] I'm going to start getting my makeup done~ (I love milk) [Makeup done! Hair time] (Chatting) (Chatting) [Giggle~] [Already 3PM!] [Now to the proper Photoshoot, leggo~] (Focused mode) (Solar pose) (Charming) [So pretty.....] [Photoshoot genius Solar] Ta-da~ The second outfit, start~! [Staff waiting in front ->] [Second photoshoot appreciation time] (This is the same person) [Blank~] (What might she be thinking about..?) (Hair staff) They said you're a photoshoot master (Feels good) The process of making it.
[Next outfit setting up] [Complete] (Slightly tired) We're starting now.. [Mission: smile brightly] Ha.ha.ha.! Ha.ha... (Embarrassed) It's quite embarrassing.. [Playful facial expression number 1 kekeke] (It's funny for me) [Finally, the photoshoot is over] You worked hard~ You worked hard~ (Solarsido tone) You worked hard~ Good job, everyone~ [Switched over to vlog mode kekeke] Today, the shoot ended and the interview is left. So I'm planning on changing and doing the interview. 1, 2, 3. Hello~ I'm MAMAMAOO's Solar.
