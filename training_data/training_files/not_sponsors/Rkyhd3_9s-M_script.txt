ladies and gentlemen I would like to present to you a brand new goldmine of content for this channel which will be known as Stack Exchange the workplace it's a place where people go and talk about the office and work ethics and professionalism and a bunch of other things we already address on this channel but in today's episode we're going to be addressing boomer bosses and corporate simps this video is sponsored it supports channel I'm gonna add more content as time goes on okay that's it the first post that I have to show you is from a certified corporate simp the title of the post is how much can I get away with making management happy but irritating my coworkers so basically he's a brown-noser he's a guy that is doing way too much work raising the bar for everyone else which isn't too bad I guess if you have a really crappy dev team but when this guy is doing overtime let's read the post I'm a software developer on a scrum team and my actions make me a favorite of upper management on both seemingly frustrating my coworkers yeah don't be that guy now I don't really care if they are unhappy but rather I am looking for a strategic risk assessment here's why I'm having issues with my co-workers number one I'm not really a team first kind of player now I can understand that but there's issues when your coworkers don't respect you they might not have to like you but they should respect you and if you lose their respect you've done messed up ay-ay ron now he says this has yet to cause explicit problems I'm not one to consult I'm not one to wait for a consensus if I have an idea I just throw it right up to the decision-making level so he just goes over everyone on the team and just goes straight to the boss this guy is the kid in class that raised his hand and said excuse me teacher aren't you going to collect our homework excuse me teacher please collect it and everyone in the class is like can you STFU please please like we're just trying to get through we're just trying to get through our day number two in eight months I have never missed a sprint goal I work on a project considered to be critical for the future of my company my company this guy says my company bro it's not your company you just work there as it is the flagship software we sell and those eight months I am the only person to never miss a sprint goal when I say that something will get done I get it done even if it means working a few extra hours up to ten a week if you work extra hours that are unpaid and you make that the default working regimen you're going to make everyone else have to start working unpaid hours because you're gonna make them look bad just for doing the job that they're paid to do and that's why nobody likes you sometimes I will take additional tasks off the backlog and do them as well others don't work those extra hours so they often have to report that their tests are not complete that's that's life that's work work is always gonna be there the next day buddy you're never gonna be on your deathbed wishing that you spent more hours in the office I'm sorry that's just the reality of it well the other the other colleagues that I work with after report that their work is incomplete they couldn't get it done because they didn't work those extra hours no don't be this guy please don't be this guy nobody nobody will like you nobody will respect you which is the key component there it doesn't help that the project owner will often hand their tasks to me and I get credit for finishing it this is this is the type of guy that's coming he's gonna end up going to his car one day and he's not gonna have any inflated tires for doing this I'm not saying that you should do that but I'm not saying that it wouldn't be funny if it happens you know hey number four I did something very visible that made every member of senior management know my name he's just gargles just all the way ball sack included you just put it in you know just it's very hard for me to say exactly what I did without it being revealing but I'm learning to toot my own horn and do the tasks which people notice this is the definition of a corporate sim in particular I did something that meant that a company-wide email was sent out praising me I'm the newest developer at the company so many are feeling underappreciated I can't wait for the comments on this video by the all the all the other corporates imps that love to comment on my videos Josh he's just doing good work and he should be appreciated for doing good work don't be this guy don't go in because everyone else on the team is gonna be like look man works always gonna be here they're always gonna give us something to do and if they don't they'll just fire us so you're all just you're just gonna make all of us end up not having a life because you want to get a pat on the back I don't have a need to be well-liked sure I can understand that I don't need infantry level allies see this is the part so he's putting his other co-workers down he's calling his other developers infantry level I'm just wondering what risks might exist for me going forward yeah probably that your tires won't be inflated one day when you go out to go home or that you won't be able to log into your computer probably a bunch of things like that you know I'm not saying that's right that's you should do that it's definitely but I'm not saying that wouldn't be funny if it happened I am not necessarily competitive but rather just extremely sensitive to incentives oh boy this commenter really gets it right he says the person who wrote this post isn't really better than the others he's actually worse than the others because the point of a sprint in software development is to estimate the amount of work doable and then do that work given the allotted hours that your work consists of usually 40 hours whereas this guy always overestimates his abilities just to do overtime to compensate which is unpaid so that he looks better than everyone else now at this company this kind of corporate simple might be rewarded actually most companies it's rewarded but to every other team that has to work with you everybody will hate your guts no one will ever want to help you out if you ever need them no one will ever vouch for you no one will ever do anything for you and you are just basically throwing that away by throwing everyone under the bus this question it starts off awful what can I do to make a co-worker's lack of effort more visible so straight off the bat I'm trying to throw my coworker under the bus for being a slacker I prefer to do this in a way that does not appear to be me throwing him or her under the bus or making it obvious that this is my intent see that's the problem here you just go address and be like hey bro I can't do my job if you're not doing your job but don't throw them under the bus it's your manager's job to manage not your job I fully agree that co-workers managing other co-workers are the worst kind of co-worker let's look at another post from a Boomer boss that just doesn't get it the question starts off with why do developers quit without letting you retain them nobody negotiates anymore how can I retain them one of the things that I found out frustrating as a manager is that I get no meaningful attempt by employees to negotiate a way to stay at our organization I randomly get noticed that they are leaving in two weeks later they are gone nobody seems to attempt to negotiate anymore and the vast amounts of disruption happen and we lose a ton of knowledge I don't want to just give raises willy-nilly but if someone wants an extra five percent then I might be willing to give it to them if they have another offer certainly I'll give it to them but they would just rather leave Wow a whole five percent so they can stay at a company that they're unhappy with oh man then you might give them that five percent maybe the reason that you move jobs is because you want more than five percent why would I negotiate to stay somewhere for five percent when I know that I could just switch jobs and get 20 percent or even double my salary this boss just doesn't understand he sees developers as like property he won't let me retain them what what that's kind of possessive which they won't let me retain them because they're not they're not yours to control like that they're individual people with their own personal goals and objectives and so if I knew that I had to negotiate tooth and nail for a friggin five percent you know that just says a lot about this manager here's another one from a Boomer boss that I hope it's just not a boss any more how to get employees to trust you I lost out on a promotion because I'm not trusted by those who report to me the comment says I wanted to get a promotion and in my company that is a very formal process where they have a committee which interviews you asks your staffs questions I got a zero out of five score basically none of the five recommended me and the feedback on the formulas does not inspire trust and staff fear her now I don't think this is at all relevant as to why employees need to trust me they just need to obey but that's not my call so what can I do about this I gave my team a stern talking-to about what they said about me but management won't share the interview notes for each of them and nobody would admit to sabotaging my promotion they don't need to trust me they just need to obey what are you a dictator you're a Boomer boss that just expects blind loyalty blind trust and you're managing based off of fear I gave my team a stern talking-to because of what they said about me I can't tell maybe this is a troll because the account is called no promotion here we have a corporate symbol the company cuts my salary immediately after I sign the offer letter and you think that this post would be about being upset and being like oh this is terrible should I quit should I leave no the person goes to say it's not about the money for me and I don't really care if I have to take the pay cut first of all most jobs are about money and you should care if you have to take the pay cut especially if they do it right after you sign the offer letter I can bet you that they knew that they were going to cut your salary right when you sign the offer letter which to me displays some malevolent intent from the company side he says I want to make it known that their failure to disclose it isn't okay but I don't want to get started on the wrong foot at this company or risk losing the offer because I complain I don't want to get started on the wrong foot they started on the wrong foot the main problem here is that if you accept this sort of behavior from a company the company is gonna think that they can do it to other people and get away with it oh we can just offer them 100k and then like right when they sign on we'll just offer them actually 70 K so that'll look good for the job applications but we also save money because we won't actually pay the money on the job applications wow this is genius this is big brain a lot of times companies will cut your salary and say we expect to be back to normal in X amount of time and then X amount of time goes by and they say what we're actually delaying this because people aren't quitting they might start quitting but probably not because they don't have anything else lined up and they trusted their company to reinstate those wages and you'll just suck it up most likely 99% of people they're not gonna quit they're just gonna be like it's not okay I'm unhappy but I don't I don't want to lose my job I hope you enjoyed this episode of boomer bosses and corporate simps on the
