description to find out more about the fascinating content they have to offer it's often said that there's nothing new Under the Sun in a way this is true the appearance of our world changes with time but at its center we follow in the same basic footprints as our ancestors altering just enough to fulfill our desire for superficial change and nothing exemplifies the cyclical nature of our reality better than jazz despite having left the mainstream decades ago jazz lives on in the music of some of our favorite popular artists from rappers like Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Pak to legendary producers like Flying Lotus in this video we're going to explore where jazz and hip hop came from how they met and how they coexist today [Music] jazz was born in the early 20th century in african-american communities of New Orleans a city in the southern United States the genres musical roots come primarily from southern blues music which was itself a hugely influential vehicle for african-american expression in the late 1800s and early 1900s [Music] European influence in New Orleans quickly led to the incorporation of brass instruments within the genre trumpets saxophones and trombones are now considered ubiquitous with jazz jazz quickly took on an identity of its own despite being largely instrumental jazz became a valuable form of expression for black musicians who due to their social status had no access to proper musical training because of this an emphasis on improvisation and originality grew over time musicians like Louis Armstrong became incredibly popular for their solo work while big jazz bands went on to define the sound of the 1920s over time as racial segregation loosened its grip on America musicians of all races were able to form jazz bands together and build off of their heritage to enrich the music before long jazz was seen as a musically progressive and avantgarde genre by the mid 50s right around when the first hip hop artists were born jazz was evolving at an incredible rate rhythmic and melodic complexity were some of the most important characteristics of the genre as time went on jazz only grew more complex subgenres like the heavily experimental and avant-garde free jazz or the deeply atmospheric cool jazz were growing across America infiltrating almost every corner of music [Music] in the late 60s and early 70s while Frank Zappa and Miles Davis brought jazz to the masses with rock and jazz fusion records something different was brewing in the Bronx marginalized youths from immigrant and low-income families were coming together in the then dangerous New York City to combine their cultural heritage and make a new kind of music DJs at block parties and clubs began isolating for cus of breaks from funk and soul songs noticing that hard-hitting percussion excited dancers more than anything else they took this further and further slowly building on the percussive based sound that still defines hip-hop to this day similarly to jazz hip hop quickly became a way for poor youths around America to transcend social inequalities and escape from danger within just 10 years of its invention hip hop had spread around the country who become practically mainstream many early rappers and producers grew up listening to jazz and it shows rappers began sampling jazz songs in late 80s and early 90s in 1988 the duo Gang Starr sampled songs from Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker two of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century a Tribe Called Quest is another important jazz rap collective having released six critically acclaimed albums over a period of nearly thirty years throughout the 90s and 2000's rappers like J Dilla MF DOOM and even NASA sampled jazz in their music the Jazz rap offered something that jazz never could themes of political consciousness in explicit terms this of course is inherently impossible in instrumental genre like jazz jazz rap was seen largely as a reaction to the violent gangsta rap that was popular in the 80s and 90s it brought hip-hop to critics college students and rock fans but jazz rap began to fade from the public eye as time went on and the aggressive commercialization of jazz made it turn stale it will be many years before Kendrick Lamar and his peers came along to revive America's first great musical tradition in 2015 jazz was the second worst selling genre behind only children's music after extreme commercialization in the 80s and 90s jazz was considered oversaturated for many years Shadid only by diehard enthusiasts too huge as in a new context cutting-edge mainstream hip-hop was exactly what the genre needed to be considered interesting again when kendrick lamar arrived on the scene everyone knew he would change the game the narrative structure of his sophomore album good kid maad city was unprecedented in just three short years later he somehow topped himself with what might be the most musically dense and conceptually rich hip-hop album of all time thanks in part to Kendricks creative direction on to pimp a butterfly not only are rappers sampling jazz they are now producing original compositions as well today's jazz artists grew up listening to hip hop and with so many connections between the genres collaboration comes easy many different contemporary jazz musicians played an essential part in the creation of to pimp a butterfly to pimp a butterfly and its subsequent b-sides release untitled unmastered are perhaps the all-time best examples of jazz within hip-hop Kendrick managed to pull it off with an emphasis on collaboration and a determination to do things differently in an interview with billboard the records pianist Robert Glasper talked about how Kendrick felt it was important to collaborate with underappreciated artists popular rappers often limit themselves to collaborating with other popular rappers it builds more hype and boosts sales but like I said Kendrick wants to do things differently tea pav is about artistic merit it's about musicianship and presenting a sound that no one else was listening to at the time and the list of jazz musicians involved with the album is too long for this video but there are a few particularly important contributors I'd like to mention from three-time Grammy winning pianist Robert Glasper - Flying Lotus John Coltrane's grandnephew - pimp a butterfly brought together almost every cutting-edge idea present in both hip-hop and jazz at the time Terrace Martin a famous jazz performer and record producer helped bring the record to life having produced for Stevie Wonder Charlie Wilson and Snoop Dogg he was able to provide exactly what Kendrick was looking for contemporary jazz stars Kumasi Washington and Thundercat played important roles in the production as well contributing string arrangements BAE and production too much of the record Kendrick released an even more jazz focused album just a year later untitled unmastered is a compilation of songs recorded around the time of to pimp a butterfly the record has strong themes of social and political commentary while the music is heavily influenced by jazz with instruments like double bass and saxophone featured front and center critics praised untitled unmastered unanimously for its self-awareness and musical cohesion other jazz rap artists worth checking out include Anderson PAC Avondale Bowling Club and no-name a new wave of jazz rap was exactly what jazz needed to re-energize itself for the 2010s having long been considered America's first original musical tradition jazz had unfortunately fallen victim to commercialization for a few decades in the early 2010's there was a whole generation of music listeners who had no experience with jazz as a form of genuine artistic expression Kendrick Lamar and his peers were able to not only bring jazz back to life they elevated it to a whole new level of political consciousness and musical experimentation jazz was built on the idea that social boundaries could be crossed with music and a hundred years after it began in New Orleans Kendrick Lamar has in a way perfected the formula it's hard to tell if to pimp a butterfly is a jazz record or rap record first and in a way that's what makes it so interesting [Music] slash Volks Geist [Music] [Music] [Music] you
