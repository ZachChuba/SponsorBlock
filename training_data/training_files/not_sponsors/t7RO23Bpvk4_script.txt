[Applause] this video is brought to you by Squarespace so spider-man ps4 has been out for a while now long enough to take the crown of the fastest selling PlayStation exclusive ever right off the heads of Kratos and son so I think it's safe to say that there's gonna be a sequel in fact it's pretty much been confirmed already with the game's creative director basically saying that he views the game as insomniac sired man which of course really implies a new video game Marvel Universe I guess people are already calling it the mgu like Marvel gaming universe personally I think that's kind of lame I think we can do better like the movies aren't called the Marvel movie going universe I think I like the Marvel interactive universe more but whatever it doesn't matter whatever you want to call it it's happening but what should this new universe look like well I had a really good time this week coming up with a few ideas I'd like to see so I'll dig into them here before I start though I do want to say that obviously this conversation will be building on the end of the first game so I'll just give you that spoiler warning now got it okay cool so I've seen a lot of chatter online for the past week or so about how the game is actually the best spider-man movie ever I just can't really get on board with that video games are definitely their own thing but if I was gonna compare the structure of the game to anything else I'd probably say it has more in common with the well-plotted season of television than with any movie and that's one of its biggest strengths as it allows the player to follow spider-man through both the big life-altering stories and the small friendly neighborhood stuff to giving us more of a three-dimensional look at the character then you can really get from even multiple two-hour movies which leads me to the very first point I want to make no matter how big or expansive this universe gets I hope insomniac never loses their focus on the small stuff in fact I loved the side missions in spider-man I hope they really expand on those and give us more unique little glimpses into insomniacs New York and Peter's chaotic life inside it so just throwing that little rant out there more side-missions equals good I guess but come on we all want to talk about Venom's so I'm gonna try to do that in the context of the sequel as a whole insomniac sven 'm from the very very little info we have looks like it's gonna be a completely new beast from any previous version in the character we've seen before so lately I've been reading through the game's art book which is really great by the way and if there's one common through-line about how that book talks about creating villains it's that they approached every bad guy from the point of view of how do we make this feel grounded both in the look of the costumes and emotionally which makes me wonder if Harry Osborn is gonna be venom like it kind of seems like you will be what would his motivation be especially since it seems like he left Peter and Mary Jane on pretty good terms obviously we have no idea what the symbiote or whatever this thing is will do to his body and personality so it's hard to tell but since Harry has been friends with Peter and MJ since childhood I think there's a lot of great material they could draw on their terminal illness and weird experiments aside Harry did just experience the loss of his mother and I'm curious to see if that will play into things and also where Norman fits into all this like who knows maybe that thing will escape the tank and wind up bonding with Norman instead thanks for telling me your weakness but of course in games as big as these venom isn't gonna be the only villain to make an appearance I'd especially like to see Mysterio who we know is cross paths with spider-man already in this universe as well as maybe Morbius who I'd really be interested to see insomniacs take on the Hobgoblin Alistair Smythe jackal big wheel yeah you heard me oh and maybe carnage too although that would have to make sense with the main narrative of course these are just some of my personal favorites I picked them because they're kind of less well known by casual audiences so hopefully that means that it insomniac can really reimagine them however they want I definitely be interested to hear your picks too though another lingering thread from the first game is the other Marvel heroes sure you can swing around the Avengers tower or there were Condon embassy but you know good luck tracking down an Iron Man or black panther it's not gonna happen a sequel would be a great time to introduce some of that but maybe not too much well I'd like to see more appearances from other Marvel heroes I still want the game to be a spider-man story first and foremost so I don't think you know introducing all the Avengers is a really great idea I'd like to see more street-level heroes maybe just pick one or two Luke Cage miss Marvel daredevil The Punisher I think those would all be really cool inclusions and some of them could easily carry games on their own in fact The Punisher already has a really underrated game I think someone should give him another one and who knows maybe insomniac really will do something with the Avengers down the line but that seems like it'd be a weird situation since apparently Square Enix is making their Avengers game 2 or something I don't really know that project has always seemed really clouded in mystery now I've covered this in past videos a bit but I think there's a ton of room for different types of Marvel games the open-world action works great for spider-man but it'd be really cool to see them explore other genres as well I'm especially obsessed with the idea of a Doctor Strange RPG the way he fights the way he travels his magical items he would just fit that format so well and I'd love to see it plus we do know that he exists in spider-man ps4 so while it might be a little far-fetched it's still more believable than I don't know was spider-ham kart racer you're responsible for that yep either way though this seems like it's only the beginning for Marvel and insomniac and as good as spider-man ps4 is there's tons of room to expand on it and make its New York City feel more real and as overused as this word is more immersive I don't know what new things insomniac will bring to the table and spider-man 2 and beyond but judging by this game and maybe even more impressively by its story it really seems like the franchise and this new version of the Marvel Universe is in really good hands you know when insomniac first started it was just a few guys making a little doom all one word to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain already
