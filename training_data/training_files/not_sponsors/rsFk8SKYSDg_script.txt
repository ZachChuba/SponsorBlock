thanks to brilliant dog for sponsoring this video it's exam season and the very best of luck to you who are taking exams now this video is I think gonna be particularly relevant to you guys and it's a video I've been meaning to make for a long time it's about this two-word phrase that I've stolen from my dad dad what's that two word phrase that you uses your philosophy active serendipity proactive serendipity is the phrase that summarizes my philosophy on life for the past couple of years and I think it's particularly relevant to those of you taking exams at the moment but before explaining what it means let me tell you a story in December last year YouTube flew me to New York to take part in the first global creator camp which meant I got to meet a bunch of awesome youtubers including Lucy moon Chris Ramsey and binging with babish it meant that I got to see New York for the first time in the snow and it meant that this I got to meet Tom Hanks and yes he was incredibly lovely had a great handshake and was like everyone's grandpa and it was a high point of my life so far meeting one of my favorite actors who's been in some of my favorite movies of all time so why did this happen I was selected out of all the people on this website to go to New York because of this video well and this video and these videos and these videos I've been making videos on YouTube for a long time since 2010 and since that first very amateur video I've got on to make over 300 on this channel alone that's not even counting the hundreds I've made for other people and from a baseline of no video knowledge whatsoever I've gone on to make videos which I'm genuinely proud of over the years and through the grind I gradually built up an audience and eventually I had enough of an audience to apply for YouTube Nextup which I did and from YouTube Nextup I was selected to travel to the global creator camp the point is while I didn't upload my videos to specifically travel to New York and meet Tom Hanks one day I invested a bunch of time and effort into something trying to make videos that we're gonna help people and from all that hard work an opportunity presented itself even if the opportunity wasn't exactly the end goal I was striving towards so what does proactive serendipity mean then it's putting yourself in a position where you can be lucky yes absolutely there are times in life when you have a definite goal to work towards like your exams you know you can be assessed on certain things so you study those things you sit the paper and you get a mark but not everything is in your control proactive serendipity is the idea that the best you can do in any situation in life is to work and put effort in to get yourself in a position where good things can happen to you so in the case of an exam that means opening up the exam paper and finding questions that you can answer the choice of questions is completely out of your control and the best you can do is work to the point where you're very likely to get questions that you can answer but it isn't guaranteed you might open the paper and get a bunch of questions that are all in areas you're weakened the thing is pretty much all situations in life rely on a little bit of luck and often that luck is only accessible to you if you've put in a bunch of time and effort beforehand in other words people who get lucky are lucky if and only if they have put in a bunch of time and effort before to make that luck accessible to them so for example people who get good grades in exams got lucky that questions that they could answer came up but they were only able to be lucky because they put in all that time beforehand that maximize the chances that they would get questions they could answer so a significant part of your exams success is dependent on luck but what happens if you plow all of your effort into exam preparation and you get unlucky or something goes wrong I imagine a lot of you watching this video preparing to sit exams and you're terrified of the idea of getting a bad grade in your exams well you know single back grade is gonna ruin my life you might be thinking no it doesn't have to sure getting a bad grade is incredibly disheartening it's not what you wanted but a single failure doesn't mean defeat for one thing and remember if you put a bunch of time into preparing for the exam you put yourself in a position where good things could happen to you in the exam but not just the exam let me give you an example when I was finishing my undergrad I had the offer to do a PhD in hand I just needed to get more than a 2:1 overall in my degree which meant getting more than 50% in my final exams when it came to the final exams though I basically had a complete mental breakdown see my draw my life video for more details I completely bombed the exams and ended up missing my overall to one requirement by less than a tenth of a percent my supervisor wasn't allowed to take me on and give me funding because of my grade but because of my academic record up until that point as well as a summer research project I'd done in their department the year before they were able to sort me out with funding with a different supervisor on a similar topic at a different University Exeter the cumulative work I put into my degree as well as the work I'd done to make myself known to the department had the angle of trying to get a PhD placed there and when that didn't work out the work had still happened I was still known as a competent scientist and as a hard worker and I was still in the position where good things could happen to me even if the stuff that happened wasn't quite what I've intended in the first place the point is that working towards your goals doesn't guarantee success sure sometimes it does and the probability of success definitely increases the more work you put in but putting the work in investing the time in my experience has a funny way of eventually paying off no matter what no this isn't karma I don't believe in that kind of thing I don't believe that by uploading videos to YouTube I earned the karmic right to meet one of the greatest actors of all time or by working hard karmak right to a PhD place my philosophy is simply that you need to work hard to achieve your goals but in order to achieve them you often need a little bit of luck look that's only accessible to you if you've put the time in beforehand and if you don't get lucky despite the amount of work you throw at something it doesn't mean that that work was wasted good things can still come of it so if you're taking exams the very best of luck to you and definitely work your absolute hardest in preparation maximize the chance that things can go your way in the exam but know that if things don't go your way it's not the end of the world your work will still count for something you just need to be open to the opportunities that life presents you with I bombed a bunch of exams at the worst possible time but moving to AXT if my PhD was the single best thing that's ever happened to me and it wasn't even an option I considered when applying for phd's I got really lucky but I was only able to be really lucky because I'd worked really hard practice serendipity but it also needs to be taken into account with Clark second principle which is handled screwdriver ring if you're preparing for exams then one of the best ways you can do so is to do pass papers from your exam board but personally I found that by answering questions on the same subject matter in different formats in different environments men I got so much more out of my revision so as well as past papers I recommend if you're preparing for exams test yourself on you so much brilliant for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching I apologize that there was something of a dry spell on this channel for about a week which apparently is enough for some of you to think that I retired or died but rest assured I'm back I basically had to take some time out to focus on my thesis Corrections which fingers crossed at the time of recording are basically done now and so I'm back focusing on making content for you guys full-time incidentally if you're not aware I've started live streaming on twitch TV /dr Simon Clarke where if you're preparing for exams I've been going through pass papers for physics and maths in an attempt to sharpen up my somewhat rusty skills and also show you guys how to tackle problems and how to make the most out of revising with past papers definitely follow me on Twitch if you haven't already and thank you again for watching this video do give it a like if you enjoyed it and share it with people that you think might enjoy my I don't want to call it a philosophy but like view I guess anyway thanks for watching I'll see you in the next one
