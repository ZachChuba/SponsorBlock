website or online store make it with Squarespace to everybody watching this video I have a challenge for you guys a challenge that has absolutely no reward whatsoever the last person who watches this video in all of human history will be the last person who watches this video when all of human history - all those who accept it the challenge begins in three two one you lost I again fellow shrubbery enthusiasts today I want to talk to you about a bit of an interesting trend I've been seeing kidnapped small children on YouTube in the last few weeks what did I found to be a bit Wow I'm sure you're all familiar with mr. beast at this point that guy who orders water than tips someone $30,000 spends 24 hours straight in the weirdest places he can think of and he finds increasingly weirder and weirder ways to donate to twitch streamers nowadays he just bypasses twitch entirely and just visits them in person to give them the money okay well recently he's had two videos in particular that have done pretty well for themselves both in the format of last a new blank Windsor gets blank challenge the title of this video is kind of the same idea except I'm the only one in this box of mine that I so happened to be trapped in and I'm probably never gonna get to leave drop a like to potentially secure my freedom I don't expect you to agree with the two videos I'm specifically talking about that mr. beast had on the subject our last two leaf circle wins $10,000 challenge and last to remove hand gets Lamborghini challenge I've watched them both and they both end up getting pretty intense with psychological warfare being at play the entire time between the contestants - discounts yes this gets yes there will be the harder challengers trying to cut deals with the ones they view was weaker willed trying to convince them that they'll give them part of their winnings if they duck out and just quit the challenge there and then so what on the street is you're trying to quit Chris so Tyler said that he thinks that I'm his biggest competitor they said he would give me $1,000 if I walked away now that's if he won well a rather doesn't when you get nothing the point is is that the stakes are high and depending on who's competing the people are hired now mr. beast has come up with all sorts of weird fuck off challenges like you guys all remember that time he watches it's every day bro 10 hours straight or that time he said Loken Paul's name a hundred thousand times in a row but nowadays it seems like Jimmy has figured out how to get that same video content of watching other people suffer for our entertainment while at the same time devising a method where he gets to offload that suffering on to someone other than himself of course that's not what he always does as he still tries to spend 24 hours underwater occasionally but if this specific instance Jimmy's method to incentivize other people to suffer for him was money and I respect it so we all have a prediction we think that Jimmy is gonna break before us because he misses us so bad I want to take a look at one of these videos specifically the last to leave the circle why because that one involves tents and people getting eaten alive by ants so it's some quality shit let's just jump into it virgins this is the circle before your torture begins let's go over the rules this white line is the outside of the circle you can step one foot out but if both feet leave you're out you do not win the 10 grand see this purple line don't cross it with your feet you can reach across it with your arms don't cross and other quadrants with your feet you can step on it you can't do like that any other questions can I throw my poop ah such a classic concept clearly derived from the minecraft PvP survival map the walls just like the rest of us it seems like Jimmy was born and bred a made of Minecraft mr. B's truly did never forget his roots this is a minecraft mod that adds emerald armor to I missed the old mr. beast the scary minecraft pigskin mr. beast the drinks and minecraft mod mr. beast remember the other day I was playing Minecraft with shrubby and Cyrus and who were just sat on hypixel for over an hour but they've made so many new game modes on minecraft since I last played that fucking game I feel like shit and I just want to go back now mr. beast was kind enough to allot each of his little lab rats for this experiment $100 each and there were a couple of themes and what all of them thought the first was that they all bought snacks and food a must have if you to be stuck in a circle for who knows how many days and the other was that they all bought some kind of item to sleep on or in two of them went all out and bought some tents epic style another brought an air mattress to properly sleep on and a fourth guy in a stroke of what the fuck were you thinking bought a lawn chair sealing his face ever I didn't make the decision that is offered and no one said yes there's another man who's lost all of his money to one of his primal sins gluttony and arguably lust if you're into that stuff Chandler here is in a position that I think many of us could see ourselves falling into the trap of but let his mistake be our lesson if your mate offers you $10,000 if you're the last to leave a circle you might have to stay overnight be sure to buy something comfortable to sleep on that's within the budget they've given you if they have given you one very good stuffing now somebody's trying to get someone to fill in for him his job what off my dad's calling me is that Chandler's dad doesn't want his son to dip out of this challenge because $10,000 would be a pretty nice thing to have on him so he's doing his absolute best to motivate Chandler or terrify him depending on who you ask into staying in the game for as long as possible and I must say this is one supportive father because it takes up that you better not leave that circle roll in this video as well as the you better not take that hand off of that fucking Lamborghini roll in a Lamborghini video he's so supportive that if you tell him you want to do something he won't let you quit even if it's no longer something you want to do he'll be passionate in your place when you're fired for something white jailors dad exact words if you leave I'll beat your ass in epic also that bit where I mentioned a dude got eaten alive by ants here's that part because it's really funny it's funny to be at least garish praised silly string on my tent now there's ants everywhere so I'm never leaving again hey I bit everywhere no paparazzi I have to pee so immensely badly this video is for me before anything else entertaining for sure but I think what it really breaks down to is an examination and study of the human psyche it makes you realize that the basic necessities that you use every day and don't even really consciously think about are so volatile we take them for granted and we never really think about that if you're made to stay in one place for so long that you have to start thinking about all sorts of stuff that you never have considered before like these guys in the beginning of the challenge had to factor in what part of their budget they would have to set aside for container hold their poop it's an exercise in the fundamentals of survival and I think that the primal ways of the human are no better on display than in these kind of challenges while at the end of the day these challenges may be friendly there can only be one winner is the one with the most stamina and what a person is challenged too strongly they may get ruthless and I think this is very well demonstrated in a different last a new blank video specifically one created by a Tanner Fox when a video were the last person to leave the pool wins $5,000 when it comes down to the final to one of the contestants actively sabotages the other though it wasn't a way that was sanctioned by the contest told us themselves so this might be cheating so I told him he could pop Mateos floaties twenty six and a half hours in right now I think that's fucking cold-blooded dude but that's the kind of shit you have to be willing to do if you want to get a cool five grand sometimes that means blood might be cold but so is this world and it sure as hell ain't gonna hesitate to pop your pool floaties when you're just trying to relax on it but anyways back to our circle game friends and calling back to the issue of poop containers let's see how they've chosen to deal with this particular issue yeah tell us what you're having for breakfast there milkshake pop-tarts so me and Tyler and you're in on it too right we are not gonna be eating our strategy with not eating if you don't eat you don't have to poop if you don't eat you don't have to worry about pooping in your poop container and therefore you don't have to deal with the smell flowing around your nose and chin when you just want to fucking sleep though it seems like only three of them are in on this whole not eating so we don't poop there if even one person takes a shit that's not in that pact the entire thing could fall apart the whole place is gonna end up smelling unless that load shitting wolf has devised some kind of way to keep the poop stash contain I'm making my first sandwich I've got two pieces of bread tape bananas and cut them into little slices and then on the other piece of bread you smeared peanut butter on it and it's a peanut butter banana same [Music] god we really are taking ourselves back to the basics of the year 100 million BC when we had to resort to such savagery as making only peanut butter sandwiches the banana that he's added to that sandwich of this video would have been considered a luxury by our ancestors who took part in this same practice millennia ago on a sidenote watching this whole video while baking all these drug comparisons to humanity getting back to the roots it kind of makes me think of those YouTube channels that have primitive in their names where some guys make poles or moats or buildings or some shit from scratch with their hands it's kind of epic bro but they dead eyes just like make whole ass pools like with just their hands by themselves building all that stuff in the way they do has to be a massive hassle at least from my first world trapped in a box perspective but first link in the description but anyways I'm gonna wrap this video up here if you guys enjoyed be sure to drop a like
