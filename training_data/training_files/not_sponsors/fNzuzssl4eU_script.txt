when I say 3d sucks I'm not talking about the three spatial dimensions that we live in I'm actually a big fan of those I think it's just the right number four would be too many too wouldn't be enough when I say 3d sucks I'm talking about 3d experiences like theme park rides that are 3d or 3d movies or virtual reality and to be fair I've always really enjoyed 3d stuff like that since being a kid mainly for the novelty value of like how is this thing I'm floating in front of my face and I can't touch it with my hands also I'm a geek so I'm trying to think how does this technology work it's really interesting but for that old technology from when I was young at least you wouldn't want to be immersed in that experience for longer than about 10 minutes because it's really disorienting and nauseating and it's gonna give you a headache and all that sort of stuff more than 3d movies on the other hand you can happily sit through two hours of it most people can some people don't like it at all but the reason it's okay now isn't because we've fixed those issues with 3d technology it's because directors of 3d movies have worked out how to work around the shortcomings of 3d technology so there's certain things you can't do in a 3d movie which it would be nice if you could but you just have to work around it one of the shortcomings that I really want to talk about in this video is the vergence accommodation conflict and I love this because it's to do with how our visual system works and and it gets into the technology of 3d so when you fixate on an object in front of you two things happen and I mean at least two things happen but the two things that we're interested in for this video the first thing is you focus on that object so you've got lenses in your eyes that are squished and stretched by muscles which change the focal length of those lenses and it means that you can focus on the thing that you're fixating on the second thing that happens is that your eyes converge so they swivel in your head so if you're looking at a distant object then your eyes are going to be pointing almost straight forward like parallel outwards from your eye sockets if you're looking at something close up like if you put your finger in front of your face your eyes are gonna converge you're gonna go cross-eyed essentially but crucially these two events aren't independent of each other so when your eyes converge on an object that's giving your brain information about how far away the object is it's like your brain can calculate the distance to the object based on the angle of your eyes and that information is then fed back to the lenses in your eyes the things that control focal things it's like your brain is saying look I know how far away this object is so stretch on those lenses until you get the focal length right for that distance and this is really efficient because it means that you can very quickly focus on roughly the right spot and then do some fine-tuning once you get there but what does this mean for 3d experiences well if you go and see the Terminator ride at Universal Studios in the early 2000s like I did then there's a point in the ride when the t1000 reaches out from the screen and tries to touch your face this is very common for 3d rides at theme parks and museums because it's a very quick visceral shocking experience to have something come out at the screen the problem is it sucks because if the 3d display is telling you that there's something right here in front of your face your eyes are converging on that object and your brain is then telling the lenses in your eyes focus on something that's that far away make that the focal length the problem is this object that seems to be in front of your face is being produced by a screen that is still several meters away the screen hasn't moved so if you set the focal length to here so anything here would be in focus well the screen is going to be out of focus which means the virtual object will be out of focus and if you've ever been to one of these rides your experience this you can converge on an object here but you can't focus on it and it's really unpleasant which is why if you go and see a modern 3d movie now like if you're going to see more one on or something like that you won't have objects coming out of the screen because directors know that it's not fun and they shouldn't do it but in a way that's a shame because there are certain situations where it would be good to have an object close to your face like in virtual reality it'd be nice to be able to pick something up and take a close look at it but you can't do it because of this vergence accommodation conflict so how do you fix this how can you do it you need your display technology to more closely match reality and it's all about light rays so if you think about the light rays coming into your eyes from a distant object from far away those light rays are gonna come in almost parallel but if you have an object that's way up close to your eyes the Rays going into your eyes they're more kind of fanned out there they're less parallel or less close to being parallel should I say so all that information is lost with a traditional 3d display because the light rays are all coming from the same distance you need a display that mimics the light rays of the real world and these are called light field displays and similarly you get light field cameras that are used to capture this information and there are a few different companies working on prototypes of light field displays right now there's nothing commercial available and I didn't want to explain light field displays but I think it would make this video too long I also think it deserves a video of its own right it's really cool by the way if you're a company that makes like field displays and you would like me to feature that as part of my explanation then get in touch but in the meantime if you just want to get rid of 3d like if you're not a fan of 3d movies but you're forced to go to 3d movies because your friends enjoy them then you can enjoy a 3d movie in glorious 2d with a special pair of glasses that are easy to make I'm going to show you how to make them now alternatively if you would rather have those instructions in book form then pause the video now and buy this book the element in the room written by me and Helen Arne we are festival of the spoken nerds along with Matt Parker it's a comedy show about science this book is the book version of the show so it's a comedy book about science and it's lovely I'm very proud of it it's so shiny yeah Christmas present why not links in the description anyway what you do is you get a couple of pairs of 3d glasses from your movie theater of choice and you pull the right lens out of one pair and the left lens out of the other pair and you swap them around so you now have one pair of glasses with two left lenses and one pair of glasses with two right lenses put either of those pairs of glasses on when you go to the movies and both eyes will receive the same image from the screen and it will be flat well we're on course thank you to brilliant dog for
