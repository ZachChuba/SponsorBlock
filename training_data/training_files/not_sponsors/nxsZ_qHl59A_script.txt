their link is in the video description down below so with the random number generator I'm going to be selecting one patreon supporter at the beginning of October to play a full life with me you're going to be featured in some videos that I record during the life if you would like to have a chance to play with my team and I and be in a couple of my videos check out my patreon you can choose any tier of support on my patreon to be entered into the random draw my patreon link is in the description below so I wanted to express that I'm done playing with the big group now and I'm focused on a smaller three to five person group of which one of the members will include a patreon supporter I had fun with the larger group but I have more fun playing in a smaller one and I think that'll be properly translated in my videos lately I've recorded some pretty amazing content so I'll be sharing that next KCMO appears in more of my coming videos so look forward to that as well so we've rated our allies in this finale video to season six we had no idea it was them because we didn't know all the names of the members in that group sometimes this happens in rest and sometimes you might even get rated for it so let's get to the story I hope you enjoy it the following is a vanilla rest [Music] [Music] yeah that's beautiful I'm third dude of course Gumby's first yeah looking good bro you guys find it's a lot cheaper to keep yeah oh my god okay all right you guys got these turrets we were so [ __ ] rich it's been a wildly insensitive missile it like we're so getting ready to all this [ __ ] people are so happy you talk so much [ __ ] to us this gonna be the biggest jackpot ever [ __ ] party but be easy to offline it considering how late we are into the y+ o mynah can't for sure that's why we just go [ __ ] rate everything he's all our food I'm blaming them sure he's not very good taking fuel to get turns I thought yeah and we can still make so dark like in that ake a box [ __ ] I hope when I get back we can read some bases get like hit a base this which make another 76 Rockets right now what are you wearing there at all there's feces everywhere right now you're a cute Rockets non-stop and just open up I'm not even joking we held onto the roof last night Ethan and I we went into their base they came up on a ladder hatch and we dropped a full kick guy and grabbed their fish not the best thing is he talked [ __ ] and you guys want to do it it's like gates and everything oh yeah so we went over to this basement group and scouted before I logged on we had no idea who lived there and to ensure we didn't hit an ally I sent them a message they didn't reply to me despite the large furnaces being on so we went ahead with the raid what if we just rocketed their furnace that's three furnace those were [ __ ] lives here did why don't we hit these guys quick at their first base we don't need to read for profit so these guys might be easier just these guys there's only one turret each so yes I can see if anyone off lined our base is these guys I got c4 rockets and it's gonna be I think when we start booming they're gonna come out of the caves just watch the hockey puck and I think the door is below that turret we could go through the side but it looks like it's honeycomb with triangles leave that wall there someone comes up if they're gonna be really this gonna be [Music] okay the Sam tower rocket boom boom boys break it open like a [ __ ] sardine can watch out for that Auditor oh right there right here right I don't even know what that is it's

[Music] [Music] so we got one m2 in here there's a little bit of stuff to lead to another I'm confused uh it's gonna that's gonna be expensive that would be a way of stealing that rocket randomly shot fire yeah TC why is this awesome oh my god dude every box for I got the reply to my message but a day later saying they moved up near us they were rated a couple days before by a larger group on the server but that group left the server shortly after the raid so I figured they'd rebuild down in the desert where they were and take over the area and if by chance they moved up near us to at least inform us of being our new neighbors I went to go see my family for a couple days after raiding them and when I returned I was pretty sick so I apologized a bit my voice from here on out so upon me returning we went on more raids to hit random basis for loot [Music] goddamn dip t3 back there all this components dude it's good to see you're all good oh all the low-grade we ever needed to unravel oh my god I'm not we got on there boom basically in their components that's a lot of [ __ ] place a lot of lowering you want the pipes we can make more than our conservation [ __ ] mushroom bass but just wake up and your legs I just want to build a [ __ ] mushroom yo you talk [ __ ] you get head dog holy bud oh my god do you flew do you see that oh the goose oh my god what the [ __ ] Vinnie over

so after we got home from roaming and raiding a bunch of us logged out for the night later the next morning our allies tried to raid us we didn't know it was them at first and unfortunately I missed

did an excellent job defending our compound online I would have loved to have been there defending as well base defenses my favorite thing to do in rust after this experience we decided to check out their compound one last time so we went over to give them a message not to mess with us anymore by raiding another one of their bases inside we couldn't resolve our differences after we mistakenly raided them everyone apologized after we did raid them and they seemed out being okay with it but I guess not hence us not realizing they were the ones raiding our base in the previous scenes oh you rated them two minutes when I rated them they hit boxes all four three boxes of stone as if they took this American alright I don't see turrets so I'm gonna just do this okay oh right [ __ ] it you guys want to do it where you at Murph no I'm gonna go through doors cuz we have a expo and there's no [ __ ] turrets so just watch the cave for us let's get rid of their pets okay let's have a feud

to remember where the [ __ ] T C is this whole group is talking [ __ ] today I'm stuck in here you guys fully read this one let's go read that tower we got there in front of space since grief welcome
