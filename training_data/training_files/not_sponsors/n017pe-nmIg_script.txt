we are leaving New York we have an eight-hour drive with no stops to Toronto now we're gonna be meeting up with Chris and ran who we will be traveling with for the remainder of this trip but we have to get there and we're super late now we've been trying to get last-minute supplies cameras and yeah of course this is how you have to do it this thing I feel like this is the camera to one-handed drive-in vlog so the months leading up to this trip I was just praying that I wasn't going to get sick for the flight it's a 14-hour flight and it was looking good until all of a sudden last night around 10 p.m. I started feeling sick out of nowhere woke up this morning feeling like complete crap who might notice been running like crazy looks like we have a really rough flight [Music] want to put soft shell stuff through check baggage so normally when we travel our style is to completely wing everything like even when we went to Europe we booked the rental car in advance and one hotel room for the night we landed in advance and everything else was completely on the fly and that works really well for us because when you're doing urban exploration you don't have a set itinerary you don't know if you're in one city and then all the places there aren't doable you just move on to the next city whenever you want with China it's been completely different in the planning for this has been way more intense than anything we had to do before first off there was the visa process now in order to get a visa to go to China as an American citizen you need to have your entire itinerary planned out you need to have your plane tickets purchased you need to have everything completely set up and that was tough for us because that meant we had to plan every single abandoned spot we wanted to go to in advance now after getting our visas we still had other challenges like figuring out how we were going to get around between the hotel's of the cities that we booked and at first we were thinking we could do a rental car but it's looking like that might not be possible because the International driver's permit is not honored in China and you would have to get your license converted into a Chinese license which we could do but then there's even questions if we can find a rental agency that will rent a car to foreigners and having a car for this type of trip is nice because you can leave your camera gear that you're not using in your extra luggage in the car while you're exploring here we're gonna be travelling by train and taxi most of the time so we might end up having to stow our bags and the bushes somewhere or I don't know if maybe find lockers or something it's gonna be something that we figure out as we go like it's probably the most challenging trip that we've ever done so far yeah so earlier we said we wanted our last meal in the States to be something really good and how that we're running late has become really shitty Villa pizza and checkers I mean I'm sure your check is probably good yeah this piece of a shitty though so I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of people watching this that since we're going to China it might be upset that we don't touch on any of the political aspects but given that we have a Chinese host taking us there we can't say anything you know we don't want to I not to do any political stance yeah it doesn't really have to do it but we're just documenting abandoned places in our travels through China right dead stop that's it right so [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are aiming ca√±edo looks just like America so far so we just met up with Chris and ran who are going to be our fellow travelers for this China adventure want to say hi hey and she speaks fluent Chinese so she is going to make this trip a lot easier than it would have been otherwise artifical no say that in Chinese all right we're gonna do what's in my bag with the property well this is the moment of truth or if I out I could actually close this saw lens sensor cleaning this full-size is like nine days of clothes that's all that's on this side and this side I've got - that all the way down the bottom a bunch of camping gear gloves sleeping bag boots rain jacket and some other stuff like toothpaste that's pretty much all it's in my checked bag oh please wait enough but this thing should close gonna see some pretty nice spacious bag and I'm struggling do you have the expansion to reopen no well this is gonna be in kilograms so so they weigh two pounds it sounds perfect alright we good forty three point two pounds we're bored good this is great actually the way of it and how it's still way under way I put more in here and be good I'm actually impressed like I'm seriously impressed that if that easy we had some issues packing for our gear up trip so that was really easy basically the same chute is my bag but his stuff what give us matching luggage 40.8 yours even lighter than mine we got actually about 10 pounds in yours still free we're gonna end the vlog here for tonight we're basically all packed up tomorrow we're waking up heading to the airport and flying 13 hours straight to China so we need to get some sleep so we are leaving Chris's place in a few minutes you're heading to the airport and this is it we are leaving this continent this hemisphere and toured to China I'm also still sick so this is going to be a fun flight let's just say got Chris blogging to you now 20 seconds the service blog ever is the way to do right going train to the airport the trains already here we have our own train guy we're on the train and it's right now it's 12:30 what time do we have to be there by 150 it's pretty 12:30 and we're almost there we have one more stop we are the next time yeah well we should have to get to the check-in counter like quick this is gonna be about so should be hopefully security oh yeah this is a bit long so to manage oh sorry boss yeah it's 12:30 so we are just getting to the airport now send me a close one this is an international flight across the world and we're getting there barely enough time you can see we're so close and you can see the skyline in the background it's really travelling so slow we are at the airport we are going to get to the gate as quick as possible because we only have about an hour and a half ish so let's just use one of these kiosks it didn't let us check our bags through the kiosk we have to wait in line now and we're already running late so we have to wait in line instead we need agent assistance to check these bags the problem because we're not from Canada okay so we have to wait in this line that's not bad so we have about an hour till the doors closed okay yeah I should maybe just good it'll be closed but any delay we'll make it like it's a risk if there's any delay from here on yeah we'll meet you over there hopefully it's the last time we'll see these bags and so we're on the other side of the world we made it past security we were like minutes till they start boarding but I think we're gonna make it they pulled us aside just to touch my laptop a bit and they're like oh yeah you're good just just because we're late that's the reason why things kind of cool whoa this is cool yeah this way we made it really ever like they pulled one of my trade aside I'm like we're already close we made it on the plane we are set all that up [Music] [Music] we just landed and I didn't really sleep this entire flight so I'm exhausted I just opted to go through the border so our luggage made it hours waiting for ran and Chris's so we got all of our bags finally and it's now time to get out of this Airport we have plans tonight we have to check into our hotel we're all exhausted [Music] [Music] so last night after getting to the hotel we all kind of just passed out and now it's like 3 a.m. so it's safe to say we're all pretty jet-lagged right now you
