what's Apple in B's and G's and welcome back to upgrade and unlock the series where we have a chunk locked hardcore Ironman and the only way to unlock chunks around it are to complete quests get total level get yourself some upgrades enter new guilds to achieve and diaries all that good stuff but we can also lose chunks by losing our hard crime and state as we lose 10 chunks and by dying after that we lose a chunk every time if this sounds interesting to in the description and it will take you straight to episode 1 for those of you returning to the series I lost a load of clips early on they got corrupted so we're starting here from 40 range and we're on a slayer grind so we can get more total levels but before we get all free-to-play give it a go alright so seeing as we got that 40 range we're gonna head on over here and buy ourselves some green D HUD chats angering D hydrants these are gonna give us a seriously nice boost to our range accuracy because at the moment we weren't even using studded because I didn't think did we have access to it probably did a [ __ ] Vic or something but yeah there you go a little upgrade I should probably go and get a studded body from [ __ ] Vic now that I think of it but I'm voicing this over right guys so last episode we actually did open the chunk up afford [ __ ] ritual and we didn't open a chunk up for getting 775 total while we were at ankus so I'm gonna go ahead and use those now and see if we're gonna get any good unlocks [ __ ] sake what a dead chunk okay more of the desert more of the dead desert so the kalphite layer has been unlocked there and our second one oh what's he got to be [ __ ] me what the [ __ ] two squares next to each other well okay there we go so there are two our logs that we forgot to do let's jump back into it that is where our Slayer grind ends unfortunately we got assigned to earth warriors and obviously they're in the wilderness and we can't get a new task from toriel because we don't have burthorpe unlocked I am gonna try and go over the Canopus and just have a chat with the Slayer master there and see if we'd get a new task from him but this could be where Slayer ends unfortunately for now at least right let's see are we able to get a task please still hunting come back when you've finished talk hello what you after then I need another assignment this isn't gonna work is it No so until we unlock burthorpe Slayer is now locked at 34 oh that is painful right so we're gonna go ahead and start doing an achievement diary we're gonna be able to do the lumbridge and Draenor I just checked and we can go ahead and do all of those things and then we'll probably go on a bit of a quest grind because we need to unlock some chunks to be able to start doing things I'd love to get back on the Slayer grind so that would be the absolute pinnacle of things going well if we could get birth of unlock but we'll see I'm gonna go ahead and yeah as I say complete this diary and the the chat just said link preparing to kill a cave bug is the same as someone preparing to kill Bandos but you know what I don't want to die I don't feel like dying that is also going to be all the tasks completed and the nature road thank you very much congratulations let's go and get our reward and then we can grab ourselves a chunk as well I believe we have to talk to rich bloke I've completed all the easy tasks in lumbridge and Draenor achievement diary quite you wanting a reward then yes please I love that and a [ __ ] chunk please mate might go for crafting here just sing as we're we're approaching that crafting guild it probably wouldn't be too bad of an idea to start putting XP into that so yeah that's what we're gonna do 2500 crafting XP which takes us actually 233 crafting which is very very nice indeed here we go guys are we gonna get lucky on this one literally [ __ ] off with the desert what what is this obsession with the desert junk picker that literally 11 episodes you've been giving me good [ __ ] and we've been we've been travelling towards content and now you just want to [ __ ] go sandy on me right so we're doing recruitment drive and this is where we need to become a female character for some odd reason we will get some XP for this that will be helpful towards prayer herb-lore and something else as well and of course we get the chunk for doing the quest so this is pretty much a quest filled with puzzles and riddles and things like that it's it's not too interesting there is one point where the hardcore can die where we have to fight a level 20 but seeing is this is what we are we're gonna be out so you find in this quest I believe prayers are allowed but we only have one prayer anyway so whatever but yeah as you can see guys gonna absolutely find hit there we go yeah excellent work please step through to the next port on cult we are going to smash this quest there we go guys I think that is gonna be the end of the quest yes it is one quest point 1000 prayer hub or an agility XP that are useful gaze of saradomin I'm not really sure what that means Tamron eyes initiate helm as well which is gonna be good for a prayer bonus please allow me to reimburse you for the old generous swap yes thank you very much we got the makeover voucher 21 herb-lore coming in 24 jealousy coming in as well five levels away from a new chunk and we also have the the mouth voucher to get us back to a male and we got our 3k back and of course we got our initia salad as well which gives us a three prayer bonus so you know if we want to be doing some you know overhead flicking light or in the account maybe that's gonna be the route to it but let's go open up a chunk here we go please no more desert no more desert unless it's one if it's one I'll sort of take it because then obviously the shanties unlocked and we can start actually getting into the desert but uh right let's see where we are going honestly it's been it's been so long since I've actually unlocked a chunk that has content in it like all of this open this up open this up open oh that's painful more will be really really painful right sir I believe if we mine these rocks we're gonna get ourselves limestone and if we use that that's crafting XP I'm wanted construction XP [ __ ] right guys so we're just talking about a few things on stream at the moment but I came to do the kudos here and we actually have 48 and we need 50 and then I'll be able to do oh my god yes I'll have to do some quests or something if I can get one quest done that gives me kudos I'll then be able to do the easy varrock achievement diary that's the only thing in here that I can't do is get 50 kudos oh I didn't think I could do so if we can find something that gives me two kudos or more then we can get the the achievement diary done as well also got given a antique lamp so I'm going to check that back into can we chuck it into a runecrafting now no 20 level yeah we're gonna go with crafting and that's another K in crafting right guy so as I was saying that discussion we were having earlier with the chat so for example the giant mole as you can see the only unique some giant mole are the pet the mole skin alcohol now obviously the mouse key and the mole claw are guaranteed on the kill so the discussion we're having right now is should I get a chunk for these obviously it wouldn't happen after after I've got a chunk for the mole skin in the mock law that's it no more chunks because they're guaranteed it's not like I get a chunk every time I kill mole but should I get the chunk for the unique because there's no other way of obtaining these on a hard core I'm now voice over ring but I put this on my community tab 89% of you said yes I should get a chunk but only once so one chunk for the mole or one chunk for the mole skin and that's it because it's part of the collection log is what you guys were saying it should count give this a go and see if we can grab ourselves that is the wrong room and see if we can grab ourselves a mole killed 43 range is what we got obviously got the bone Cross boat as well got ourselves a teleport a one-click teleport here and also there just because I thought might as well have both pretty average gear to be honest and a few lobbies and a dragon dagger now the only problem is do not have any of the protection press so this could be a little bit dangerous I also obviously don't have the ephod or shield I also need to grab myself a light source it's all going on and we're on the hard core let's see if we can get this done right here it is let's try and get it safe spot first I think this might be a safe spot here possibly yeah it is cool so we're gonna get to start off health and then obviously we have to run around and shoot at it are we gonna be able to hit though just realize we only have one prayer as well so I'm just gonna be flicking this just realized I've still got the link cam and timer up because I'm mid PvP challenge but I had to get this video done so I do excuse that guy as you can see I I stopped the PvP challenge at one minute one hour 36 we do have a hundred HP now and I'm pretty sure that's when it starts to dig and these kills are going off this kill is gonna take a [ __ ] long time should be doable if we get it into some decent spots but the problem is it's gonna dock every like time we hit it after this goes down past this 100 HP we go to the first bar oh I see it's regenerating health so quickly guys I've been a fat half an hour nearly 40 minutes now we're getting through the food so slowly it's I think what I need to do is go and get the range up and come back because the problem is every time you hit it when it's a low HP it has a chance of digging and then going somewhere random and then I have to look through the whole cave with no run no energy pots nothing and then hit again and because I hit so many zeros I'm pretty much hitting zeros it's then teleporting to the other side of the whole pace and so on and over and over again so I think I need to get 50 range maybe 50 plus and then go from there right now it's just not gonna be doable I'm gonna run out of food I'm gonna eat everything I've died I've nearly died a couple of times because it can help to a 21 and that's that's pretty dangerous running around so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is probably train it up a little bit and go from there okay so I've looked into it and getting fifty range it's not going to change anything the bone crossbow just is not strong enough against the model it's got far too much defence so what I need to go ahead and do is get myself 54 fletching which will unlock the myth crossbow now with the myth crossbow it's a lot stronger a lot more accurate it's not as quick that doesn't matter because we're gonna be safe spotting them all for most of our hits we just want to be able to hit and we can also inch arm mithril bolts II and what that will do will it will poison the mole as well which means added DPS it's how I got the kill on my boss only account and I just think this is gonna be the way to do it so 54 fletching is what we're gonna go for that is 45 woodcutting coming in which means we can now chop maple trees it also means we can now open up a new chunk cuz that is 8 to 5 total coming in are we gonna get lucky here let's have a look oh another bit of canif is opening up I mean it doesn't actually open anything new but it does start pushing us towards the active hunters which could be very useful animal magnetism as well starting to open up a little bit so I yeah I guess that's a it's a semi useful one here's the overall view of the map if you did wanna have a look at it guys I'll just zoom in a little bit there because that's all dead squares and that is pretty much the map we have unlocked at the moment that's also gonna take us to the end of the episode guys just because I'm gonna have to grind fletching and we're coming for quite a long time to be able to actually get the myth crossbow so there's not much point in delaying the episode any further and might as well get this out and get the myth crossbow in the next episode guys thank you so much for and subscribe if you haven't already these are the stats if you did want to have a look before we do close the episode out there you go those are the stats for those who you wanted to see thank you so much for watching guys and I'll catch you in the next one
