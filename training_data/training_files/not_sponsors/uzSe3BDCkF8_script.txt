which can sometimes lead to hysteria or uncontrolled laughing some people really like this feeling so it's often used recreationally at higher doses and when inhaled continuously it acts as an anesthetic and is commonly used in dentistry and for minor surgeries however it also has a whole bunch of non drug related uses it's a good oxidizer and it's often used in rocket propellants and cars to increase the power output of the engine another major use is as an aerosol propellant most notably in cans of whipped cream nitrous gas is very soluble in fatty compounds and under the high pressure in the can quite a large amount is dissolved into the cream when the can is opened the cream is pushed out but it's no longer pressurized this causes the solubility of the nitrous to decrease and the excess gas escapes from the cream causing it to puff up this effect is very similar to releasing the pressure in a soda bottle and having it bubble over the specific reason why nitrous is used for this is because it works well and there aren't many other alternatives air and especially oxygen can't be used because the cream would quickly become rancid carbon dioxide is acidic in water so it would curdle the cream and nitrogen is just not soluble enough to work anyway my goal for this video is to make some nitrous gas and then use it in the barking dog demonstration which gets its name from the cool sound that it makes these are just a couple quick examples that I got from around YouTube to make the nitrous there are a few ways the major industrial way is to heat the fertilizer ammonium nitrate which decomposes into water and the nitrous oxide the problem with this method though is that it can be dangerous as it breaks down it generates its own heat which can in turn cause more to decompose in a positive feedback cycle for this reaction to be done safely the temperature has to be carefully controlled otherwise it tends to go crazy this can overwhelm the system that is contained in which can build up pressure and sometimes lead to an explosion ammonium nitrate is the cause of some really bad industrial explosions and these are just a couple examples [Music] you [Music] to be fair these are completely uncontrolled disasters happening on a massive scale but still I'm pretty sure I'd be fine doing it but considering there's a much safer and easier method I decided to go with that one this other method involves reacting sodium nitrite with hydroxylamine hydrochloride which would cleanly make nitrous oxide and only sodium chloride and water as side products it's also really easy to control so there's almost no risk or danger involved on top of this both of the chemicals are easily available online and are often easier to get than ammonium nitrate as a side note this preparation is just for fun and to explore the science if all you're looking for is to get your hands on some it's much easier and cheaper to just directly buy it anyway to get things started I add 30 grams of hydroxylamine hydrochloride followed by 45 milliliters of water then I turn on the magnetic stirring and wait for it all to dissolve the dissolution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride is quite endothermic and the solution cools down a lot this can really slow down the process though so it's a good idea to turn on the hot plate when everything disappears I take it away and I move on to making the sodium nitrate solution oddly enough this procedure is almost identical I use the same mass of sodium nitrite the same volume of water and the dissolution is also endothermic when it all disappears I'm ready to set up the actual reaction the hydroxylamine solution is added to a three necked flask and then I put together the rest of the apparatus at first it might look complicated but it's actually quite simple the addition funnel in the middle is filled with the sodium nitrate solution so that when I open it it will drip into the hydroxylamine they'll react together to form nitrous oxide water and salt but it'll also produce a decent amount of heat the nitrous oxide will be pushed out of the flask through the tube in the back and it'll make it to the valve right now it's just open to the air but I'll soon be attaching a balloon there because of the heat that's generated here I need to cool things otherwise a lot of water vapor would come over with the nitrous alternatively it's also possible to just set up a gas bubbler that's filled with water because I'm going to be building up some pressure in this thing all the joins had to be sealed with grease to make them airtight and held together with clips anyway when it's all nice and cold I start to add the sodium nitrite and immediately you can see a whole bunch of bubbling occuring which is the nitrous oxide being produced before adding a balloon though I need to generate more nitrous to completely flush out the system and remove any air when I feel I've added enough I go ahead and attach the balloon then I adjust the funnel so that it adds at a decent drop rate and I wait for the balloon to be filled in terms of the reaction one important thing here is that the nitrite is added to the hydroxylamine and not the other way around this way the nitrate is continuously consumed and it's never allowed to build up if the concentration were to ever get too high like if I added things the other way around I might start to make some higher toxic nitrogen oxides like nitrogen dioxide when it gets to a decent size I take it off temporarily seal it and add a fresh balloon then I just continue the addition of the nitrite until it runs out when this one is done I just closed the valve to seal it and I take off a stopper to make sure that no pressure builds up the rest of the apparatus is dismantled and this is my final result to get an idea as to what the yield of this reaction is I just measured the diameter of each balloon and calculate their volumes from this I do a little bit of math and I get that the approximate yield was 8.2 litres of nitrous oxide which is the percent yield of about 80 percent now to see if I even have nitrous oxide I'll just do a quick burning splint test the first one is just to control and nothing's been added to the beaker so it's just a regular burning piece of wood in the next run I open the valve slightly to continuously flush the beaker with nitrous this time when I add the splint we can see that it burns a lot better this happens because the heat of the flame breaks down the nitrous oxide to nitrogen and oxygen gas the extra oxygen is then picked up by the burning splint anyway now that have more or less confirmed that I have nitrous oxide I can move on to trying out the barking dog' demo to do it I only need one other chemical called carbon disulfide which is a highly toxic and smelly solvent I was luckily able to buy it locally from a friend but unfortunately it's generally hard to get ahold of anyway to set it up I just feed the tube from one of the balloons to the bottom of grad cylinder then I open the valve and fill it up nitrous is a lot denser than air so putting something loosely over the top is enough to keep it inside I then add a small amount of carbon disulfide and I wait for it to evaporate and fill up the cylinder after a few minutes I turn off the lights and I try to light it the match burned a lot better at the top because there was nitrous there but not much else happened because the carbon disulphide didn't diffuse far enough when the match is lowered it eventually hits the solvent vapor and the reaction takes off what this tells me is something that I kind of already knew which is that passive evaporation isn't gonna work and I'll need to help it a little when I turn the lights back on you can see that the grad cylinder is dirty and it's because sulphur has formed on the walls I couldn't find an amazing reference but it seems like this is the overall reaction the nitrous oxide reacts with the carbon disulphide to form carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide elemental sulphur and nitrogen it of course also produces a lot of light as well as heat anyway I went ahead and tried it again but this time I used more carbon disulphide and I shook it around to get it to evaporate I added about a milliliter but the slow speed of the reaction tells me that it's probably still not enough I did it one more time just to make sure and I got the same result I also tried it with some water at the bottom which can help mix around the small volume of carbon disulphide for the last runs I did it with about twice the amount of carbon disulphide to see if it would make a difference what I find interesting is that the sound it makes each time is quite different another interesting thing is that the reaction oscillates which you can sometimes see when you slow things down you don't really see it with my footage though and I think it's more obvious when a longer tube is used the YouTube channel periodic videos goes over this effect in much more detail and I suggest checking out their video I'll put a link in the description anyway I think that's about it in the future I might dedicate a video to this demonstration where I go into a lot more detail I'm already working on a lot of projects though so unfortunately I can't make any promises as to when it will actually happen
