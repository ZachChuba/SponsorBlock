we've got a handful of laptops all set up here for a big old-fashioned Cinebench run which is pretty much the CPU equivalent of a drag race we've got the top performers from Intel over on this side couple of core i7s their latest and greatest mobile core i9 and then this weird one from Alienware with a desktop eight core processor that's our current king of the hill and then over here we've got AMD's desktop eight core muscle car equivalent this was only dethroned very recently along with something really really special the asus rog Zephyrus GA 502 is the first laptop to hit our studio that features an AMD mobile Rison processor the Rison 737 58 to be exact meaning that was actually made to be used in a laptop unlike this one so without further ado gentlemen let's hit it and see if team red is able to regain its place at the top of the Cinebench leaderboard three two one go device use offer code blindness to get 25% off at the link below [Music] okay so our to eight core Intel's are done our eight core AMD is done our first core i7 is done over their second core i7s done everyone's done but then oh boy is this supposed to happen yeah okay it's not about finishing first it's about finishing together so the GA 502 isn't super fast but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't consider it for your next gaming notebook because it has two really big things going for it power consumption and price let's dig into the specs a little the Rison 737 50 h only features four cores and eight threads with a maximum speed of four gigahertz that's kind of surprising given the way that Intel has been pushing up mobile core counts recently I thought that was kind of AMD's Jam the thing is though for a gaming machine there's actually very little benefit to going beyond four cores so AMD's approach ends up giving us way more bang for the buck so this laptop that we've got right here equipped with a gtx 1660 TI max-q and 16 gigs of ram comes in at only $1,200 dang and in our testing the cpu performed admirably i mean by admirably I mean I wouldn't have paired it with a more powerful graphics card or anything but we still managed to get Triple A games above 60 FPS at high details and we comfortably reached 120 FPS which matches our 120 Hertz refresh rate in lighter and eSports titles as for use outside of gaming we generally saw similar performance to the Intel Core i5 8300 H so nothing amazing but our Zephyrus GA 502 stayed cool and quiet even when it was under full synthetic load that doesn't mean a soos didn't make some compromises though moving from the inside to the outside compared to the others emphases is that force AI doesn't matter the Dino 502 doesn't quite have the same build quality not that it needs it it lacks visual accents like an RGB keyboard and the chassis has a slightly plastic ear feel but all of that is pretty easy to forgive since most zephyr as's cost two to three times as much also when compared to similarly priced competition like the Dell g5 the GA 502 easily takes the cake for overall look and feel like there's basically no chassis flex furthermore it's impressively thin for a gaming laptop and the metal on the back of the screen and the really thin bezels give it a very modern look now the screen itself is merely pretty good but once again for the price it's more like pretty darn good it's of the 1080p IPS variety so no fancy retina branding here but it gets bright enough for comfortable use in a well-lit office and it sports a 120 Hertz refresh rate making it generally very enjoyable to game on and even acceptable for watching movies and shows with the above-average speakers adding to the experience as well as far as connectivity goes the Zephyrus has four USB ports one of which is Type C along with full-sized HDMI headphones and Ethernet which is better than most modern devices there's no Thunderbolt 3 mind you but you're not gonna see that on any AMD devices for a little while while Thunderbolt 3 makes the transition to becoming USB for one shortfall here though is the Wi-Fi with just a one by one Wi-Fi five card this thing chugs during large downloads like it's its kind of thing you wouldn't think would be noticeable but it definitely is and you're gonna want to plug into the wall whenever you're installing a game or copying files over the network now so far the GA 502 has been faring pretty well but where most gaming laptops faceplant is the trackpad and this one actually seemed like it was going to at first like for whatever reason my finger kept kind of getting stuck on it and skipping around but then after using it for a day my hand grease actually made it pretty nice and smooth to use so so that's pretty gross but I guess it also goes to show that a little lubrication is never a bad thing and the usability score keeps getting better the keyboard is downright excellent no finger Lube required it's got a snappy short throw that easily beats out the Dell g5 and Asus Helios 300 while still being both comfortable and quiet now as I mentioned before it doesn't have an RGB backlight but it is still backlit which is a lot of help if you're working on assignments at night and you're not a comfortable touch typist and there's more good news for the slow typists out there the 76 watt hour battery gave us close to five hours on a single charge in our standard test now that's not an amazing result compared to a low-power ultrabook but it's way better than similar gaming laptops and well beyond the threshold of usable so I can't really complain what I will complain about though asus is where the holy hell is the webcam i really hope that you guys figure out how to get a webcam in a small bezel laptop sooner rather than later I mean Dell did it I'm gonna get real sick of telling you guys that no webcam at all is in fact worse than having a bad or even a poorly positioned webcam the thing that makes this really difficult though is that you guys are never going to learn if I don't stop recommending your bloody devices like honestly even even this would be better I think actually no I'm not sure that that would be better back to the recommendation there's no getting around it for me if you guys are looking for a somewhat budget oriented gaming laptop you should go grab a zephyrus GA 502 so that's all there is to it and a video right no not quite yet cuz here's a big question why is it that AMD was able to so effectively crush the Intel competition in this market segment well as it turns out this is less of a win for AMD and more of a colossal screw up from Intel so when OEMs are specking out their systems Intel will offer kickbacks if one of their higher-end processors like a core i7 gets used even if that processor doesn't make a ton of sense for the rest of the configuration so if you were ever wondering what is up with those weird laptops where the CPU power vastly outstrips the GPU that's what's been going on here because in many cases a quad core Core i5 is gonna keep up with a 16-6 TTI or even up to a 20 70 max Q and it'll do it at a lower price but Intel's branding strategy is leaving this giant hole in the market that AMD has filled quite tightly here simply by allowing laptops with their processors in them to be Specht in a way that makes sense for gamers this just in at Computex 2019 laptops are revealed from Dell and Lenovo featuring I 5 processors and 1660 T is seemingly in response to an B's pressure at this price point now this news does not change a recommendation of the GA 502 but it's still very exciting and gives consumers extra options now back to you Linus so once again AMD's return to competitiveness is a win for consumers so I say why not celebrate by picking up a sensible gaming laptop at the link
