hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with laryngitis no that's not the recipe that's the condition I just got over so I lost my voice it's just coming back but I didn't want to keep you waiting for this recipe so I'm gonna do it anyway the show must go on today I'm gonna show you spaghetti alla olia which is the most popular pasta dish in Italy by far and all spaghetti alle olya means is spaghetti with garlic and oil so we're gonna start by slicing thin six cloves of garlic now we're not mincing we're not chopping we want to slice it just like that very specific cut for this dish and there's my prep garlic I'm also going to chop about 1/4 cup of fresh Italian parsley and then the other ingredients are really good olive oil and a really good Reggiano parmesan the real stuff we're gonna add our olive oil and our garlic to a cold saute pan turn the heat to medium and we're gonna slowly toast that garlic now the beauty of this dish is while the garlic's toasting we're gonna cook the pasta the sauce and the pasta take about the same amount of time so make sure you're doing these two things right next to each other so our pastas boiling our garlic is in the pan as soon as it starts to bubble turn the heat down to medium-low and then we're just gonna watch this slowly toast okay don't walk away this is only gonna take about five minutes the garlic should just be barely bubbling like that and we want to slowly slowly toast that to a beautiful golden brown so basically what we're trying to do is infuse as much of that toasted garlic flavor into the olive oil without getting it too darker bitter see that that's just about where you want to be okay as soon as that gets to that stage we're gonna quickly turn off the heat and add a half a ladle on 1/2 a cup of our boiling pasta water and even though we turned off the heat you need that water in there to stop the Browning process because that's perfect right there by now our pasta is cooked and we're gonna drain our spaghetti we're not going to rinse our spaghetti do not rinse your spaghetti never rinse your spaghetti please do not rinse your spaghetti all right we're gonna dump that into our pasta bowl we're gonna add some black pepper red pepper flakes and salt to taste at that point we're gonna pour over that unbelievable garlic oil if you could smell this you'd be like man that smells good or something to that effect and there you can see all our slices of garlic so well there's a ton of garlic and this is actually pretty mild because of how we slowly toasted that in the oil okay so don't be afraid all right we're gonna dump over about two-thirds of the cheese of course all the amounts will be on food wishes as always we're gonna dump over our telling parsley and then we're gonna toss and serve so after it's all mixed up really well I'm gonna bring it to the table topped with the rest of the cheese and that's it classic or at least what I think is classic spaghetti alley olia spaghetti with garlic and oil ironically and I shot this video before I got the cold that calls to laryngitis I wouldn't have the laryngitis because as you know garlic is like a superfood that prevents almost everything so not only does this taste fantastic it's just really really good for you body mind and spirit so I hope give this a try once again I apologize for the voice but like I said the show must go on all the ingredients are on the site so go check it out and as always enjoy [Music]
