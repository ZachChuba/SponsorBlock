all right everybody welcome back to another episode of Exodia as always know well you know what's really exciting is really exciting since last time we've learned everything there is to know about future pack totally and through legitimate means absolutely just went and did every possible combination of every button here in this here stupid do Hicker machine no I'm just kidding we were like we don't we make freakin progress here like it's getting absolutely ridiculous this is absolutely ridiculous so progress is gonna be made now and I'm not going to be just pressing buttons in combinations for the next 10 years 10 years yeah yeah after after last episode I messaged him and I was like you know face in hand like brah I can't take it anymore like I'm ready for a sky factory something else please this is killing Nate do you think that's gonna happen with Dungeons & Dragons and rockets and and rabbits or whatever its called yeah very possible yeah we already like last this last Monday when we were supposed to record we already were like let's do that or alternatively we could do squirrel and and so the I'm gonna do something else has already begun gotcha it's you know like again we've talked a little bit about this and and without you know like some people really love this file my pack and that's fantastic but there's a line between where difficulty and challenge versus just grindy and yeah and pressing random buttons pressing Brant random buttons it's its grind that's cool yeah all I'm gonna say so it's it's a yeah I get what we are taking authoritative action - yeah combat this travesty that has befallen us okay travesties a little strong I'm like not to insult anybody you know kudos to the mount you're over here it's a gosh-darn travesty yes fair enough it'd be what it'd be okay also I don't know I didn't see the data on this but I saw someone mentioned in your subreddit that a analysis had been done about our videos that and you talked about three times more than me I don't I don't know whether that was scientifically done or not but I was a little amused at that I don't really have anything to do with that like you know in terms of there's there's no actionable item there but just thought you should know so now every time I'm gonna go ahead and amuse now and catch up on an app being subject thing okay hey thanks root pcs for the 25 sub gifts that was very generous of you to do and I'm also wondering why it didn't trip off the hype train because I set the hype train setting specifically to be that 25 events in a short period of time would set off a hype train not wanting to over saturate it because the previous setting was like five things so that should have set it off which is weird now I have to maybe it doesn't count sub gifts maybe a sub gift no matter how big it is in one batch it has to be separate instances which is a strange thing to do which means I'm gonna have to rework that system because 25 separate things from separate people in a five minute window is quite quite a lot so okay we're gonna be revising the hype train settings after we're done today shadow deity cats thank you for the one year of sub ik preciate it and heather the clever thank you for the three months I feel like twitch should realize that system though like the fact that somebody gifting a hundred subs has the same weight as someone Rhys upping sighted I feel like they need to wait things don't you think I think twitch needs to repair the hype train well yeah now not exactly fair comparison but anyway just wanted to thank route pcs cool I'm here trying to minimize my talking sorry man it's fine it's fine or maybe I maybe I just need to you know babble more that's never that's never the answer death I take that back like I immediately rescinded that your honor I hated liquid power though we did we did we just completed an achievement Wow that is very exciting ages and ages to put together and then everything unlocked I couldn't then I couldn't make it in the refined storage and I was very scared but then it made it oh but did it help having everything unlock affine unrelated as dad that's dope well I'm glad that you were able to just knock that out of the park a sample app I guess two and a half episodes later yep got it maybe you just got a here boom bing bang boom Bing bong Bing Bing boom Bing bong okay well we got that one you only need to complete one of those and next up we have support research I just want to knock these out dude you should want to knock these out and crush it you need to make an eon generate or two for power power capacitor advanced generators so this it needs a turbine but what runs it how does this work I don't know how anything works research module supports like I don't know whether I want to like try and learn this or if I want to just be like yep that's unlocked moving on ya know that's exactly what we should be doing have learned nothing diesel and dust do we have oh hey an assembly table I do not think we wait we do have an assembly table didn't we see a bunch in the in those portal areas oh you might be able to get now or you know in the on the moon and the bases if assuming it's difficult to make if it's easy to make then why bother but in what new that I have seen this before oh do I already have the logic chips in here oh I do already have logic chips how noise in here very nice indeed I like that quite some time but I still need an assembly table right in or make a diesel I need to have the turbine I I kind of do enjoy it it's a little bit of a pain but I kind of do like it I don't it's not it's not hate cool we need how did you make that wait concrete stuff initially are the white metal or what have you whatever it was Wow yeah wait colored metal I guess can be known that has to be like colored metal maybe he can be any that'd be cool um you you make a metal block and then you airbrush it right uh-huh what do you mean research this yet lies you said I knew everything I thought you did it said I couldn't research it I can't make it yet I it's alright you're the one working on it I'm burying my sand in my head you should do that it's good to bury sand in your head yes exactly so if I wanted to make a distillation towers that wouldn't yeah yeah oh we need to make tanks though I searched this civil machines it's not even a machine it's just basically I need neon power whatever whatever whatever dog machines forget what they're called I know it's a lot of aluminum in a corner but I can't remember the exact blue reservoirs okay so that's all going good things be doing what they do hey motorboat hey hit this Diller the loot our boiler I know there's a this is my life in this engineer's manuals it's like I know you in here how I can search there okay got it it's fine everything's fine yeah yep yeah there's a fly flying on my freakin light right now and it's distracting me I just sneezed my nose out all right there mate we're good it was just there were there was an there was an incident with a with a sneeze and a nose uh-huh you've been there you understand I have sneezed my nose out before oh good you can't make a black assembly table nice bra all right so just treat would friends in iron achievement Oh got it okay we need to have this neon generator crapoly over here apparently neon generator crap Olli yeah let's start putting this stuff on a wall over here or something like that seems like a plan do don't it it it does not it do that's just wrong aluminum sheet metal I here you see that doesn't look right at all I like just cheap metal are you mininum how many was it 24 was it really 24 34 oh it sighing - uh is that what we need a freaking neon engine Oh neon engine live a life they you're just over there obeying waving like it's okay yeah dog you I'm not researching anymore so I can I can eat these into a frickin void yeah get the Frick out of here dude you're trying to avoid get the Frick dude I give the e scanner I eat the e scanner back get out of here dude get out of here you are the weakest link I'm so stoked don't have to deal with any of that crap only anymore neon and gin okay say what I need to do now it's a ventilation slab no ventilation slab you got to make it you got to keep them separated so we have this guy up here well and but how is it now burs is supposed to be it oh my god you fool you fool supposed to be how it works what Oh a frickin tech table tech table is dumb so it tech table is dumb yes no you're saying mm-hmm well I'll take your word for it we need an iron stick hey the tech tables just gotta fill up so fast I don't know if I actually need to use this style of tank but you know we're keeping it in the mod family cool dude yeah it's pretty cool Oh alrighty and now neon generator was in the unburnt no that's probably not it I don't think that's it yawn engine and the on the engine okay is there we do I do like we never went back to hip rags again yeah no fourth of these dude rammer please confirm this is correct before he wastes resources confirm please is that what makes power that's why need a skin oh my god brah I thought grammar doesn't no era doesn't know what I need to do makes uh Scotty doesn't know yeah that Fiona and me do it every whatever in the back of her car or something wow I can't believe you would say that Fiona sounds like a little bit of a an unfaithful person if that's the case uh-huh she was otherwise spoken for then that's just you know I mean if they had an arrangement than fine which one I don't know which is the right one neon engine they discovered a form of energy that fundamentally differs from mine and that that of the unreachable this unfamiliar form of energy is called a redstone flux and uses an unstable form of redstone wait we already know that right redstone flux yeah RF is Norma frick it's not the neon engine though it's just a generator all right yeah this is easy peasy lemon squeezy dude easy peasy lemon squeezy yeah you okay there dude I did but I eat back in just a minute it's fine explain no that wasn't fine all right I have created a generator congratulations it is excites generation Girls Generation yeah yeah okay I don't why don't we hook this up to double things at once is the question I can't plug this into there because then it'll know that I needed to pull them like the main line nice I know right I just barely connected it it's pretty great we're off we are off we're doing it we're doing things are we poppin off you best believe it nice things they are a happening oh my god it's terrible nevermind it's terrible come back come back me just stand here do you hear it you hear the droning I actually don't you don't hear Wow lucky you yeah maybe you'll hear it if you walk over here a little bit little bit more now wait really you don't hear anything you want some yourself settings all weird no I can hear the bubbling of things like you don't hear no nope but I can hear the bubbling of over here yeah you block sounds turned off it sounds like music it sounds blocks a hundred percent the only thing I have turned off as friendly creatures well okay well lucky you lucky you it's real obnoxious also the friendly creatures are really loud I didn't realize we had that many cows I turned those off that I did a while ago maybe it's like a dog whistle and only certain people can hear it I'm one apparently there's certain people that can flex their ears and and and hear a high-pitched sound and when they do and their way they can flex their ears yeah I could do it wait part what it's like you you you flex your ears and you can hear a rushing sound in your ear define flexing your ears I don't know use a muscle how do you how does one how do you define flexing you haven't I don't know what that means I thought to see you lifting weights with your ears bud it's not like whip ting wait okay why is this not have enough power to run we don't have enough like our power problems our power problems you know what I mean like we've got we've got major power problems we've got 99 problems and power is one of them maybe D can you come sleep with me oh yeah I can do that give me a momento it's basically it's one of those things like people who know what it is like they're like yeah of course why can't and then there's people like I have no idea what that means I don't understand etc does anybody here know what it means to flex your ears no also is it still night it's still night so can i when i when when i tend to do it like instinctually what I'm trying to sneak which I don't know why but like if I'm trying to be quiet then I end up like you kind of I can flex my scalp or I can I can wiggle my ears and stuff like that like yeah we can you flex your scalp I don't know I don't think so I'm flexing my scalp I can flex my ears you hear it yeah no it's it's some people can some people can't [Laughter] what's up kid what's up I just slime slung myself in the wrong direction so I just flew off into the the heat the great beyond anyway everyone running chatting super headphones without touching them yes now you can you can see hunched on the screen hahaha boy it's great anyway this is fun but anyway yes I think some people will know exactly what I'm talking about and our power problems are legendary I don't understand why maybe I should look into upgrading our solar like the thing is is I'm trying to make stuff that I could then turn into power but I need to do the distillery and all that and then the presser like it's a whole line of things to get that far oh if you put that we reckon to what ok decided to work it's freaking weird breath frickin weird bra das freaking no weird bra so with future tech is turning off block sounds I'm turning off block sounds farewell goodbye sounds I did bye I did I bid to them a farewell adieu get the Frick out has the digital whip I don't see the digital work in progress besides there's nothing wrong if you like whips and your personal life like have fun mmm-hmm get thee to thy good times interesting so how did they literally remove the guide yeah just make this stuff and hope sounds like it you're not you don't you don't even you don't know what you're talking about stop talking when you don't know what you're talking about it you just yammering there's yammerin three times more than I'm Jana in your theater shut the Frick up where'd my scrunch go mus Grinch mus miss Grinch okay so avoid a solar cell to is made with does this take more space to build or is it the same amount of space okay I guess let's build the I think if I build the tier two then it'll tell me everything I need so I need the one and then let me guess this thing has to do with research which you don't need to do anymore mm-hmm I mean if you didn't need to do it anymore than why are used to having to do it because I have to complete challenges oh I should go check on my star motel yah dude I'm gonna do dad's my star Matthau yeah dude any for those okay so that gave me - okay so I needed for more wait what what is it that I'm missing the two corners which are the is this chai cake it's the chunks working surprise alright there's that why would it actually need iron ores okay you want hmm hmm how would I even get how do I get an iron ore how'd I get a regular old iron ore uh you go to the Twilight forest yeah good there isn't even it's not it doesn't even exist it doesn't even exist in this modpack you can't get iron ore rammer you there literally isn't iron ore it does not exist his anger is legendary his angry is a gringa dari oh look at that it's not even like doesn't even have much on it anymore that is the only iron ore and you cannot craft it you cannot get ahold of it you guys think I should just break this and go with it try and build up try and upgrade everything and come back to it and obviously it's providing some power but is it providing much power or but I need more power getting rid of I'm getting rid of half these things just to see if it's a speed issue or everything is forked up issue there's no way to see what's up there was a way to see I guess I can just 16 sure okay [Music] hmm I'm gonna mute so that I'm talking less than the triple one sec I need your help though what do you need I need you to come see if you can break the the solar array if you can break blocks on it where ad on the roof yeah you break a block here is it just trying just try and break it yeah okay so I can't take it down oh now I can okay cool will you throw me the one you've dropped thank you why you break my solar array I upgrade make better make many people yay you're gonna make many people yay people yay although it does occur to me that perhaps I should have gone with an alternate route given that this is you know it's never day time here but we're just far now so let's just carry on looks like the controller I can't break I'll need you to help with that I got em bah it's so needy I didn't make the mod not be able to do stuff here I'll tell you what I'll keep talking through this to offset our ratios to help with that there you go thank you very that was the correct item there you is thank you you're welcome preciate it I appreciate you Oh ballsacks eggs or you man disabled this way of getting star metal so you have to build like a tier 27 altar in order to do it so that's exciting yeah that's exciting thanks for you man why why would he have done this but I can't believe you've done this why would you just disable something that's already fairly difficult to set up and just make it even more difficult I'm set zoria man has upset me eggs Oriya man is like Florida man except I was gonna say he's like the boogie man like he's becoming like you know something to scare children I mean Florida marries like the boogeyman isn't it if you know that that actually has a lot less to do with I mean the crazies in Florida and more with though what do you mean like you the whole Florida man thing is that you know there you always read about these weird stories in Florida but if it's actually believed that it's there's just that many crazy people in Florida but Florida actually has interesting find the stories that from Florida they're actually happening everywhere like goofy people it turns out are all over but Florida like publishes it for some reason okay huh interesting all right it's a little interesting no I had no idea they work that way anyway I'm gonna mute so I'm talking less yeah yeah all right where we at boys Casa Cara thank you for the 300 bits I hope you and your Olive Garden breadstick arms are doing well thanks we're doing great we're doing doing just great look at these look at these breadsticks right here dude captain Teemo thank you for the sub root pcs thanks for eight months of subbing marty mcfly thank you for the 13 months of sub inch of ivation thank you for the two months silence our dude thank you for the 15 months see papa thanks for the 3,000 bits very very generous of you to do that deadly doorknobs thank you very much for the sub very much appreciated captain breadsticks at your service breadsticks sounds good so rammer just said that apparently apparently we can choose one or the other in terms of progression in order to get the higher tier freakin void minor because merrily we need higher tier void miners because we don't have annoyed miners yet because why is exhilarating to take the long way home thing is that like a finale and exciting finale where we just get to cruise along and then we're done and then we beat it and then we can go to Sky factory 4 or is that even more grindy okay so it actually is it actually no what what is it what is it better or more grindy grindy or less grind ear trying to get to the bottom of it here so I can read can relay that information to zine basically a little bit more quest okay the less grinding we're gonna figure this out I want to do the minimum amount of quests needed in order to complete the mod pack so if I can just to do one of these rows here then I'm gonna just do one of these rows here at gayev but I need astral sorcery I'm making myself a freakin telescope good yes so hey apparently apparently we can just do one or the other when it comes to tech table or astral sorcery basically our goal here is apparently we need another tier of the void miner this is not enough tears yet any more tears no not the void miner because I'm doing stuff that's using all those resources every tear every tear I am of the void miner is another tier down my face your face read the first quest I found two ways to do things okay technological and magic you'd use both ways what we only have to go one way we do need to go both yeah I don't know I don't get it I don't get it I don't get it why it says both ways tell me what to do I just want some dragons up in here dude you just want some what some dragons dragons dragons make things better I like dragons mm-hmm they're they're like they're like mood risers dragons are pretty dope ruski well anyway we'll just um no we'll work on future pact so I need to make a telescope that's easy that's the easiest challenge I've gotten yet very excite much excite mm-hmm would you say yeah okay no I'm still getting it over my sick in fact my sick really hasn't progressed into like what sick would normally be so yeah it's an allergy type situation no definitely genuine sick no definitely not oh yeah absolutely not this man does not get allergies no but it's it's it definitely feels like instead of sick I have felt onset of sick before believe it or not according to you me being the most sick person on the planet okay now you're just getting hyperbolic okay no one's impressed by your hyperbole whatever finally I can to make a simple rocket that leads me one single new planet let me explore it hopefully I will find a way to fly to any planet soon 24 so that means I need eight more of these cool and then BOOM I really out of gold I am out of gold I'm ma let it go I'm so lost with that huh what they do here oh nice I was thinking that was nougats but it is not allow me okay if I need to find rocket on tech tech table rocket on tech tip okay so the indian immersive engineering stuff is on hold for a minute while we spend time wasting on other things these being imported no no no they're going here ah no hey stop whoo yeah it's my fault I blame me me that oops alright so there's some iron or some gold there's a difference boom 24 of them puppies alright so now we need I have to make a spaceship I have to make a spaceship I have to make a spaceship right now and I do not even know where to start spaceship I feel like things have taken a turn you see basically what happened here is is I made telescope it did you familiar with subreddit the rest of the for King owl because this is what happened here what I did know as I said that make telescope telescope cast one glass one copper one iron the next one is says go to new planet and in order to go to do planet is a guys they draw the rest of the forking out yes it's like what the way what does happen here is it said challenge one look at the moon next step land on the moon you seem upset why are you upset Jesus Christ oh you're making the belly hurt you're giving me the belliard's magnetite is a very useful resource okay voice is mean 16 times 3 is 48 I've got to magnetites apparently - Wow I have 11 cool he 11 out of 48 catches you go you make rest look at moon go to moon Hey magnetite tho yay well done no looks like this thing is just so slow it's really bothersome maybe there's some old Criswell inserter maybe I'll make another pair of those and some fluid ducts and we do it up right we do it nice make it look real nice for pretty for you chat says they love the two of us so much we love you too chat uh crew cable inserter and pull him off and a crucible okay I don't care that much how's it going I'm so close to doing it I'm so close to doing it I've I have /gamemode creatives typed in the chat right now I know trust me I am NOT arguing at all it is okay in order to just one component of the rocket the thruster I need to get I have everything other than these four gonna heat protection plates but in order to get the heat protection plate I need to do a recipe inside of a freaking furnace thing in order to get that furnace thing I need a chipset that requires doing a recipe inside of another thing and I can't do any of this with the emmys system why would you do all in the separate freaking check table and then you would it what about the fuel tank whatever I need rocket fuel oh my god the heck is a [ __ ] repent iam hey you need bits must repent hear bits Deidre Pentium and then I need a centrifuge I need a centrifuge to make the the bits repent excuse me to make rocket fuel this is the most rest of the forking owl that's ever existed ever yeah yeah I need fire that's actually simple that's a simple one that's the first one that's actually simple okay now also imagine if we had to research out to getting all of this stuff oh my god dun dun dun oh my god okay alright so I can just use ash or the fire and ready for our guerrilla crafts at anytime still got 20 minutes bud I feel like I'm 5 years old at an adult dinner event and I feel like I'm like baby I'm like baby the baby Yoda mean when he's looking up and I'm next to my mom's chair I'm looking up at my mom like can we go now I'm bored but other than that you're going well it's all coming together yeah yeah yeah feeling good feeling good all right so that goes there and then this can go there and turn that on and then that can go there this can go here what that do I need teleport there apparently so in theory this should all be working so if I turn that off that stops blinking this starts filling with are you still go are you do I turn you off do you fill up with things I might be able to actually go build a a real rocket and get us to the moon before I can do it here have you ever thought that the technology involved in me building this rocket here is actually infinitely more technology than actually got us to the moon in the first place because of the computer that I am playing on is so much more powerful than anything that sent us to the frickin moon well I would disagree with this assertion of infinitely but it is significantly it's many orders of magnitude I have no argument there many orders of magnitude but yes we basically went to the moon on a coffeemaker all right I needed 48 right it's a rhodium and then for each of these I need two more in addition to those three so I really need five for the 15 or 16 so that would be what 80 how anything you just said gives I'm having a crisis it's 16 times 5 80 um yeah yeah it is cool okay neat I'm at 30 I need 80 are you uh are you making interconnects no I'm not making it no I'm not making interconnects are you clicking on creative things to give it yourself I wish I was doing that but I'm I'm close to it I'll tell you hey I am not far no I do this is this is hard this is way gnarlier than subject way gnarlier God said hey I didn't I think I said that didn't I yeah no I just like I just intercept right now I'm just just saying it's way gnarlier than subtext it is this is way gnarlier subtext sab deck just got really tedious when it came to like you need to bake the rocket again I didn't order to make the same the decks here rocket you have to remake all the tiers up to this like no no no let me use the existing rocket okay that's that's garbage yo dawg I hear you like making Rockets so I'm a dad you make a rocket ten times yes and more than that more than that it would have been ten times if we were just straight through going each tier but no no no it was you would have to make it one plus two plus three plus four plus five plus six black write that many times but nonetheless the point being there were it was that was tedious this takes it to hours hey that's a good idea we should do that okay anyway I'm guess I'm gonna be making this heat stuff and then when you see us next episode we'll have a rocket well have done a lot of work offline yeah and now there's a rocket there yeah let's not estimate it's gonna be pretty it's gonna be pretty cool why oh my god I can't find basalt all the things I'm wandering around looking for is frickin basalt okay and all I want to do is fill in a single hole and I'm like often never anyway it's it's fine a little bit of squirrel äj-- alternatively I could just take one out of here boom got it let's move on wait I already had one damn it oh wait oh yeah what am i hearing that through you what I hear cranky noises now or is that the noises that you were complaining about did I don't think so the ones I was talking about was no no no it was right this drowning just drowning it's just the drone äj-- I could do that for the rest of this video and it would probably contribute more if I'm being honest okay I got this good I missed I got it nope wait wait okay fine how about here good wait the industrial furnace does that have to be does it I hope it's an upgrade not like I don't even freaking know do you even freaking know bro no no oh hell naw I can reach that come on man oh oh you're probably talking about the recycler I bet the recycler was making the noisy here now yeah yeah okay so recycler okay it's just a recycler Planck listen to the clanks bra all right so I think we have kind of doesn't look like we have everything cuz it's right there that doesn't look right oh those are solar cells okay all right so how many did I have I had nine didn't I I needed sixteen more because I needed 80 of these which means we need more lap ease which we should be making down here I just want real I know you want to download it I just want to download it so that I don't have to go through all this crap you want to download Ram I do why do I love you all you would love to mate no crap probably out of that goes twice as fast when you have twice as many burners goes twice as fast when you have twice as many RAM yes true true that my friend he's losing it guys no he's a donkey on the edge no he's not he just wants more RAM Bert was sheepish lion all right so if it's four per and I need 20 poof and we needed a stack and a little bit more than the stack otherwise known as a tea we're getting there though oh we're out of we're at know when I was end okay if you're out of crystals and you can definitely blow more oh you need that means that this needs coal coal get ready for clang keys Clank why you got a clink on me bro and just do it I can't I just I mean I can't explain it I think I can't think of anything but yeah I think you want to want to do more than clink on me I like clanking yeah that makes sense really I didn't need the RAM I needed a freakin other thing muffler huh we're just make we're just making all the noise right now though oh yeah you better believe it brah oh I believe it and then oh that's not what I want how do we end it in a very is external killer kill kill kill I made it I made the industrial nyan fur nice congratulations you want prize now or do I do want a prize now all right well that was like 1 out of 50,000 components and machines that I'm gonna need okay yeah this is the weirdest process to get these crystal shards though why you know get power you idiot why is it not getting power we have a lot of stuff taking a lot of power and our power manufacturing is a little no no no I generator here it's it's generating power but it's just not passing it where it oh it actually needs to oh it as a particular power input side that is mm is it carbo tell me it's carbo is garbo got it ah no it isn't doing it either cool cool does it sound like you solved the problem it's not it's not getting power it's nice come on there we go okay all these gets power they snow gets power that's nice our Girl Scout cookies really good they're delicious which kind I mean most of them are good but which kind in particular I they didn't clarify because they weren't sure they hadn't had him but what you're gonna want to get is you're gonna want Tagalongs because they are the best no thin mints mints are a good time you don't want to avoid the Samoas they're garbage garbage for thin mints Oh worst why are you what is wrong with coconut the flavor and texture mainly why are there so many coconut haters out there dude because of the flavor and the texture why are you so many coconut haters I ordered an entire box of Tagalongs last time they came through the neighborhood and I demolished it in not like when I mean like a box like you know like not not like a single box but like a case of the boxes and are you where two box of boxes yes in like three weeks they were like I was like how much for like a box of boxes and they were like oh that one's like I was like it wasn't and I was like okay I'll take it and you know like the little girl scout which she was like she was like christmas came early you know like it was she was very happy that i had shown up that day it's my story about how cool I am anyway cool yeah I'm trying to figure out this stupid industrial neon furnace and why it doesn't work so you've made something but it doesn't work I need 16 of these there we go and then here 16 boom apparently right click dee dee dee dee doo doo doo doo doo it's just done and then it would like right as the Sun went down we saw briefly for the glimpse east of moments it generate power of the glorious kind but we have a little bit more power generation during the day at least so that we have that going for us which is nice looks like different cables only make it transport more stuff right yeah I don't think it needs different cables as these aren't doing nearly enough all right let's uh the Sun just went down with let's let's sleep it back to daytime for so go to sleep 14 times are you are you ready - you ready whine it down I I want to see how much this makes it peak or at least during the day but then yes okey-dokey come sleep with me I'd love to okay I'm holding your hand right now oh yeah but basically the plan is that in between this episode and the next yeah we're gonna it's it's crazy how much progress is gonna get done you'd never imagine it in a million years look up not cool solar array D how much pow pow that's the that's the question in it I've done that like like a half dozen times whenever you've been like are you okay I'm like I'm just swinging away don't worry about it uh here it's let's take a look how do you tell actually you can just look at the oh you can right click with the assembler looks like it's mm Fe partake I don't know whether Fe is equivalent to RF or 2025 2025 you don't even need to do the assembler you can just slime sling up and be like grasp it firmly grasp it Oh 2025 nice firmly grasp into and and and squeeze and twist yeah but here's hoping that that helps to power all the things that are where we're running out of power on and that may be my pump Jack can go for more of Jack and over here dude oh yeah nope there goes the 50k might be that way I little jittery if I can get to a point where I can pump oil and then distill it to diesel and then run it through a diesel generator then I'll be able to generate all the power we need that's just I need 14 more machines and all that so which part of the mod pack is this this is immersive engineering I know which which section the diesel one dust in tech progression oh I see I kind of get the feeling you were going down
