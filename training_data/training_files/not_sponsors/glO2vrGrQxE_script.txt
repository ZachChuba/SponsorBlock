with pon banya
that's right i'm going to show you how to make the world's most famous tuna
sandwich which is really the world's most famous
tuna salad the nicoise stuffed and pressed inside a whole loaf
of bread and according to people who consider things
this is considered the ultimate picnic sandwich since it has to be made ahead
and the longer it sits soaking in its own juices the better
in fact the name actually means bathed bread but before we get to soaking our
loaf let's go ahead and get started by
reviewing the rest of our ingredients and for me that begins with a whole
bunch of olive oil packed tuna oh yeah we got to use the good stuff
here sorry charlie and what makes this sandwich so amazing
is the play between that rich oily tuna and then our sharp intense salty briny
bits like capers anchovies and of course some olives but
before that happens we have to prep what's probably the most
important ingredient and that would be some beautiful extra virgin olive oil
into which we will stir a couple cloves of minced garlic and by the way extra
credit for using something from the south of france
all right something from near nice would be nice and what we'll do is stir that
garlic in and then let that sit steeping on the
countertop while we prep our bread and for this we're going to want to use
a nice stale loaf of crusty bread and what we want to do is slice this
lengthwise about 2 3 of the way down and by the way a loaf like this is fine
but i really do prefer using something a little flatter
like a ciabatta bread but they were out so i ended up with this fairly standard
loaf of french bread and then what we'll do once this is cut
open is go ahead and pull out a good amount of bread from the top
especially down the center as well as a little bit from the bottom
and you might have heard me say earlier that this should be a loaf of stale
bread which is just going to work better
because it's more absorbent but unfortunately mine was not quite as
stale as i thought it was so that's my one and only regret here we
really do want this bread fairly dried out
but regardless once that bread is prepped we are gonna bathe that very
very generously with our garlic oil like what seems to be a ridiculous
amount but don't be scared this really is the key
and then what we'll do once that's been thoroughly and thoughtfully saturated
is we'll set that half off to the side to continue absorbing the oil
while we move on to top our bottom which i think we should start with a layer of
our beautiful vine ripened tomatoes all right did i mention you should
probably only make this in summer when the tomatoes are perfect
and since i want complete coverage but only a single layer
i think cutting those slices in half makes them easier to place
and of course anytime we're using freshly sliced tomatoes
we always want to season those which i'm doing with some freshly ground black
pepper which is optional as well as some salt
which is not all right definitely hit these with some
salt and then on top of our tomatoes we will go ahead and place the rest of
our veggies which for me will be some thinly sliced red onions
some green and black olives as well as some thinly sliced fresh banana pepper
although any fresh roasted or pickled pepper will work
and i should mention some other commonly included ingredients here
would be things like artichoke hearts or sliced fennel
or maybe some blanched green beans all right pretty much any vegetation is
allowed and then on top of our veggies we'll go
ahead and pile our tuna and i do mean pile and we will really
try to go all the way to the edge although it is fine if we have it piled
up a little higher in the center and as i mentioned we really do want to
use a very nice olive oil packed tuna or even better yet we would slowly poach
some tuna in some olive oil and use that and if i'm not mistaken we actually have
a video for that but no matter what we're using
once our tune is down we'll go ahead and top that with some anchovy fillets
which i know not everybody loves or at least that's what they say
but here it is absolutely critical so please go ahead and add them
and if you happen to forget to mention they're on there to those people on your
guest list that claim not to like them that's fine
there's a really good chance they'll have no idea
and then after the anchovy we will continue on with their good friend
capers and we'll apply a generous sprinkling of
those followed by some sliced hard-boiled egg
but i'm not trying to make an egg sandwich here
all right i just want enough so i get a little bit in each bite
so i'm going to space those out pretty well which is going to work out nicely
because into all those spaces i'm going to place some freshly picked basil
leaves which is going to work so well with all
these ingredients especially the ingredient we're going to
finish with which would be one last layer of freshly sliced tomatoes
and of course when we get down to that last slice we will turn that around so
it fits the shape of the crust perfectly and just like the first layer of tomato
we're going to want to season that with salt and pepper
at which point we'll go ahead and drizzle all this with a couple
tablespoons of white wine vinegar or the wine vinegar of your choice and
then if we happen to have a tablespoon or so of our garlic oil left
we will finish up by drizzling that over the top
and that's it we can go ahead and place our top half over
and give everything a nice press and if anything falls out which it will
you can just go ahead and tuck that stuff back in or of course eat it
and at this point we can go ahead and wrap this in two or three layers of
plastic and if you're thinking man that looks
good enough to eat i think i will skip the wrapping and pressing step
and just enjoy my tuna french sandwich right now
don't do it okay you're not even gonna get close to the same experience
unless this is wrapped and pressed properly okay especially if you use
stale bread like you're supposed to as we really do need to give it time for
all that olive oil to soak in as well as all those incredible juices
the salt is pulling out of those vegetables
okay it's our bread being saturated with all that that really makes the sandwich
what it is so we will go ahead and wrap that in
plastic and then in a couple layers of heavy duty aluminum foil
and one small tip here for the foil i like to make sure the seams end up on
the top so that none of that olive oil and
juices can leak out of the bottom into the pan
speaking of which once that's all been correctly encased in foil
we will transfer that into some kind of large roasting pan or baking dish
and then somehow someway weighed it down which i like to do by placing a sheet
pan over the top and then i'll use something heavy like
this cast iron griddle to weigh it down but you could also use some cans of food
and that's it we can go ahead and transfer that into the fridge
and we will let gravity work its magic for at least about 8 to 12 hours
okay longer is better and it's not mandatory
but if you did want to flip that over once during the process that would not
be a bad idea and that's it the next day we'll go
ahead and unwrap that preferably at a picnic
and we will slice in to see how we did and you know what
that looks pretty nice or should i say pretty nice
and even though as you're building this you might be thinking you're putting a
little too much on as you can see if you weight it down
properly it should all compress beautifully
but anyway i went ahead and cut off another piece to go in for the official
taste which i did way too small okay you need
a certain amount of bread around this stuff to hold everything together
so don't make that mistake but portion size aside
that really was an incredible bite of food okay obviously all those
ingredients we included work so well together
but what makes this so good is that it's all delivered in this beautifully
compressed package held together with what's hopefully a
severely soaked bread in fact i heard the late great julia
child say one time that if you don't have stuff running down your arm as you
eat this you did it wrong and while it wasn't
exactly dripping down my arm my bread really was nicely saturated so
for a little skinny piece that really was amazing
but i did go ahead and cut a bigger one so i could plate it up and take some
pictures oh and if you are going to bring this to
a picnic you could if you want to cut these pieces ahead of time and then wrap
them up individually but for a more impressive presentation i
would probably just bring it whole along with a cutting board and knife and
then just cut it to order when you're ready to serve
but both ways work fine so you decide i mean you are after all the tanya harding
of your pan banya partying but no matter how you serve it
this will be getting rave reviews but anyway that's it
my take on pan binya or as i like to refer to it around the office
ponbon a hell yeah right there are good tuna sandwiches
and there are great tuna sandwiches and then there is this
which is in a whole class by itself which is why i really do hope you give
it a try soon so please follow the links below for the
ingredient amounts a printable written recipe and much more info as usual
and as always enjoy you
