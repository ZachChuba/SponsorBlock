link at the top of the description what is going on YouTube soda coming at you what nah rust video holy [ __ ] today we are gonna be taking on the giant excavator now I just want to make sure that I don't have god mode on there we go god mode falls we are going in to the bowels of the beast we're skinned up we're looking fabulous hey you know what I need though I just need a little bit of food all right we've got some pumpkins alright first of all before we even head over there this is the closest I could build to it it's over that hill look at it on the map it takes up a huge amount of building area it is quite large on the map bigger than military tunnels it's as big as silly as big as Lord slide I'd say it's just a different shape but alright let's have it over I've got a rad suit as well because I've read on the rusta fied blog by the way I'm playing on their test server I read there that there's deadly amounts of radiation so I'm thinking maybe maybe it'll be like the roof of of the launch site where like everybody wearing a red suit you'll slowly right back up rads but I'm not sure yet so we're just gonna we're gonna take it on the ground and see what happens apparently they're scientists so we are going to try and tackle the solo and see if it can be done and we'll also you know if I can if it can't like well obviously it can but like if if I just like suck that much all damn that's impressive oh I'll put up good mode and go through it and whatever alright there's a run on down what would be the first part we tackle it looks like there maybe there's another way across over there I think that might be one of the conveyor belts of jobs or resource or I'm already seeing scientists probably sit out here and sniper huh I wonder if they don't heal like the ones on launch sites I know it's like oil rig oh okay this is this feels like oil rig can't really get close to it without being shot at hmm no Sam sites though it looks like now you gotta remember as well this stuff is all subject to change this is on the staging branch nothing is finalized but this is like the nearing the finalization of it let's climb up here see what's going on so I think this is one of the dumping zones holy [ __ ] Thank You rusta phi guys for leaving that in there not that I'll use it so this thing fills up it drops from a conveyor belt up above this one right here then it drops down into this looped container I feel like okay so they don't heal up that one just dropped that's a good good tonight that's a good meatball all right um so let's just waken them a little bit you see them actually I think there's quite a few scientists on this all right [ __ ] it let's push so this probably a way to boost up to this all right now what's what's this right here I'll start climbing on up [ __ ] this thing looks awesome got food boxes here okay come on that was right on his head something's wrong here see this is right on his head guess we'll just push him with an L arm I think this is where I saw the scientists walk off oh [ __ ] [ __ ] them look at them all so this almost feels like the way a lot of people will be doing at sniping the scientists from afar holy [ __ ] there are so many scientists [Music] so oh they have like kind of like oil reglued okay this is good I mean you could tackle this solo but it sounds like you're gonna be making a lot of noise it's like lowering but on land honestly so I'm just gonna stop picking up all the loot that we can find and we will see what type of [ __ ] we end up with towards the end here five signs they just destroy sort of green box over here try and get that these doors open no weapon attachments more food boxes it's kind of looking like this is gonna introduce a lot more PvP guaranteed it's gonna be cool where besides us away that just a lion dude wait is this the control room yeah the control rooms down below more this thing it's so [ __ ] big there's gonna be so cool to fire from this I'm not saying many loot boxes actually feel like something should be sitting on that this should be looting here probably so maybe this just isn't finished yet perhaps maybe it is like this alright we're gonna go down further into the belly if I can find the way down so this is one of the two conveyor belts I heard a footstep and I immediately went into combat mode one of the two conveyor belts that will so like I said the resources drop over there for that one and they think they might drop over here no this is the grind up the conveyor belt goes up that way I might drop into the center we'll say that at the moment I think for 20 minutes it looks like high-quality metal is your best bet to go russified said it's like 400 high quality metal 420 diesel which is pretty damn good and also they said of you walk into this thing while it's going yeah dead what's the what's the diesel barrels I haven't seen any diesel barrels they're black we got rid of it alright now we are actually heading down further and do it this might be the other collection tray down here oh well we can't go down there so it falls down there holy [ __ ] what took me by surprise he's dead I keep pressing Q for auto run but it's on stage it's not bound what was that big pile of them that I killed I reckon you could stripe jump that sorry we have to go this side where I yeah it's climb on up still haven't seen diesel can you stretch jump this hey you can't holy [ __ ] alright so is this the machine itself it yep I'm sorry little thing here no fuel okay so I guess we need to find some fuel yeah I use the recycler there's a backpack so just gonna mince up everything in here that going we'll move around a large excavator yeah I think up same what to loot boxes Bram one and a green one maybe I think there's got to be more added maybe that's why I'm not seeing any crude around at the moment but that's that's a [ __ ] sulphur deposit and a metal deposit who's this sleeper ever you will get wickets morning diesel anyway here we got here it's bugs he's got diesel perfect fuel for the excavator stacks 220 okay so it looks like a barrel but it's not possible dude these are cool I wonder I wonder hold up let me get a jackhammer out damn that'd be cool okay let's do a little loop around and see where see if I can find anything else on the outskirts likely bird and stuff like that otherwise that mazes just doesn't spawn Dean yeah big Tonka trucks jerking that triangle is not to be an a I'm more a more exa more ik so I'm erect sir well it doesn't look like any diesel is around right now so what we're gonna do okay let me pause right here apparently diesel can be crafted for 300 low-grade fuel also apparently it'll spawn at oil-rig junkyard and the dome but again nothing is finalized so we're just gonna run over here to the excavator we're gonna know like power it on see how it works all that stuff so this honestly feels like a baby version of the of the oil rig even the small oil rig it doesn't feel like it yields that much loot at the moment it might in time like I said none of this shit's final no fuel so where would I put the fuel in fuel tank here bizango only holds one stack of 20 but that will last 40 minutes I think it's two minutes per one then turn that on alright we got the engine started and we're gonna dash on up to this area up here down towards the end of the big arm the big excavating arm saying go see the conveyor belts aren't going yet what a mad dash our way here mine hates QM we're gonna hold it in check wide metal fragments stones sulfur and short metal fragments let's try that one let's see what that does we're moving right this is sick all right now we're gonna put it to mine high-quality metal ore alright let's go up the conveyor belt let's follow this mechanism all falls down that let's see how badly it hurts ok maybe it's not gonna hurt there maybe it's gonna hurt it the other one alright run across now I mean next should run for 20 minutes with 20 diesel in there we got a guy ok so metal fragments is just a metal law so this will hurt okay alright over to the next one it's a bit of a run let me just speed it up for you [Music] [Music] honestly I don't think people will use it to farm stone that much because stones that easy to get now as is I reckon people are just going to use it for sulfur and high quality metal log but honestly this is this is pretty much it this is an early look at the excavator I'm pretty sure it's coming out this dispatch this next update and she's a ripper look at that guy I love it I love the idea I'm glad it's been added it's got to encourage more PPP because if oil rigs honestly we're a land there'd be a shitload more PvP and loot getting pushed around you know and this is gonna be the next big thing I think the people to go and find out especially people want that HQ embalmed I think ATMs the best one honestly I think it's 400 hqm for 20 minutes or [Music] 4,800 sulfur or something next best thing yeah it's cool anyway guys this has just been an early look at the excavator hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll catch y'all in the neck vigilance [Music] stories of joy [Music]
