along with the ingestion rework an assortment of new items and secrets was introduced in noises recent east update today we'll be taking a look at all of these in this one video I will not be looking at all the new spells in this video but trust me there are some fun ones ah oh my god Wow crossing the lava lake east of the mines in order to grab the orb has always been a pretty popular way to increase HP early in a run now however there are a variety of events that can happen to make think twice about this strategy such as the roof collapsing and making your return to the mines more challenging or the spawning of a variety of difficult enemies of the assortment of enemies that may spawn I have to say that the hell gazers might favor it because if manage to kill one it drops a lot of gold especially for so early on hint there weak to water there is also an extremely low chance that a sheep will spawn here instead of enemies of course I've not yet seen this because it is very very rare next we have the secret / which is obtained from the new elusive or very rare enemy the leggy minute oh my god it's the new thingy oh no I'm glad I have melee immunity when killed it drops the leggy mutation perk which is a more interesting version of the lucky mutation have some human legs and even a fist nice now for the first of the new items the broken wand which can be found on a pedestal or in a chest just like anything else after being thrown this item will fire a series of shots from a selection of low-level spells such as bubble spark spark bolt arrows magic arrows or disk projectiles which are obviously the most useful the spells fired from the broken wand will damage though so make sure stay far away now this is where things start getting really interesting the cue skivvy or brimstone holding one of these not only allows to burn things but it also makes this than very passive though they will not attack other things for and it makes completely immune to fire as if that wasn't useful enough these can also be used to quickly of evaporate water which is very nice for traversing the dark cave especially since the area now can have up to five different layouts depending on the sea the thunder stone or echo skiddy has also been improved it's much safer carrying one of these around now and they also make the echos passive as well as making immune to electricity though not immune to explosion damage finally we have the KU a miniature moon with a strong gravitational pull can use this as a gold attractor or as a defensive tool against normal enemies or even the balls however its greatest use is perhaps as an easier way to trigger two secret events the first of these events is the worm rain which becomes far easier to accomplish with the use of a coup still have to be a little bit careful though that the worm crystal does not escape the gravitational pull of the coupe the second event is newly added in this update and even with the coup this was mind-numbing ly challenging and I present it to now the chess train that's right have to get a chest up to the mountain altar much much easier said than done first I tried doing this with the circle of buoyancy spell but that did not work very well that's an understatement it was actually horrible the coup also doesn't have much of an effect on chests in normal circumstances so how did I manage to do this well slowly and painfully see chests submerged in water are far more easily pulled by the coup so I had to basically flood the entire spawn location yeah lots of fun eventually I managed it's an interesting event but it requires a lot of patience to put it lightly and now we have one last thing to look at far to the east past the pyramid might find this strange contraption that I call either the tell a harmonium or simply the music machine unit kicking it will cause it to start playing music oh my god I've tried several time consuming experiments with this curiosity such as bringing the horror monster here or playing a bunch of songs on the ocarina however I've not been able to determine if it has any other use at all if figure something out please let us all know down below in the comments thank I hope enjoyed this video and I hope you're having a fantastic day and I'll see next time
