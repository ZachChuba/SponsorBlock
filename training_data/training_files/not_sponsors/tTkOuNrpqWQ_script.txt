- [Man] Can you get up? (laughing)
- Nope. - [Man] Are you sure you wanna do this? - No! I haven't cut it for 18 months. - [Man] How short do
you want us to cut it? - Oh, as short as you want. - [Man] You want us to get it as close to your scalp as you can.
- Yeah, I always trust the barber, you know. Barber's choice. - [Man] You trust this guy? - This is gonna be good. - We're matching.
(laughing) We're gonna match once it's cut. - [Man] Hop up in the barber chair. We're gonna, just to make sure, we're
gonna screw his hair down. - [Man] Safety is the number one priority. - [Man] (laughing) Which
is why we're doing this. - [Man] Is it pulling? Okay, let's do the reveal.
- Don't move yet. - [Man] (laughing) Oh boy. - [Man] Oh, the hair's like,
wedged inside the board. - Oh man. - Can you get up?
(laughing) - [Man] Nope. All right, who--
- Is your hair stuck inside the board? - [Man] Yeah like, pulled the hair back and just wedged it in the board. There's no hair there. (laughing) - [Man] I'm like pulling
with all my strength and I cannot get this piece out. I can't get that out. - Oh my god.
(laughing) - Okay, leave him there.
Let's get the garnet on. - Okay. Round two?
- Round two, I guess. - We might need a new business idea. (laughing)
- Garnet, we'll turn the garnet on. We got it, we'll save it. (machine whirring) - [Man] There we go. - [Man] Okay can you sit up now? - [Man] Yeah you might. - Oh. Oh yeah! that's like--
(laughing) - [Man] Mitchell, look. That's our first product. It's beautiful. - It does look really nice.
(laughing) - [Man] See how much of it
is underneath the board. - [Man] Oh! - It's all under there.
(laughing) - [Man] It like impregnated
the wood with hair, like in between the layers. See that? Like it's in between the plywood layers. - [Man] Yeah that is weird. - [Man] Here's the bottom
side and it just like... The water didn't cut it at all. It just forced it through
the layers of plywood and out in random places, like this one. There's just hair growing out of the board right there. So obviously this is probably one of the stupider things that we've done. - It wasn't that bad. The water jet wasn't
gonna go over his face. It was like a two danger. I've done more dangerous
things here than that. - [Man] Is this a try at home, or? - Like, still don't try it at
home, but not that dangerous. His life was not in danger. - Definitely do not try this at home, (upbeat techno music)
