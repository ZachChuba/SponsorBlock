will lose 10 of these squares let's hop into the episode what's a Plan B's and G's and welcome back into another upgrade and unlock episode today we're gonna jump straight in and do priest in peril we've opened it up we've got kanafeh son locked I'll show you the map we currently have unlocked we'll go through it quickly and then we'll get into the quest so we'll start from the bottom here we have Quran just slowly opening up we got the Musa point in the last episode bit of the desert coming together as well pretty much all of free-to-play is now unlocked which is pretty nice pretty nice it means anything free to play we can get done realistically there are a few things that are still a little bit locked but yeah other than that pretty happy and a bit the women are starting to open up as well but the main thing that starting up here is canna fish and of course that has the agility Roo it has the Slayer master it's got a good few things there and obviously this is gonna be our route to barrows once these start opening up a little bit obviously because it's all random we can't you know guess when that's gonna be but I might as well get this all done get the quest done get a new chunk there's another quest that we can also do which is a pirate's treasure thanks to Musa point being opened up so we will go and do those two quests which would be another two chunks and then from there we'll we'll see where we want to go [Music] there we go quest complete priest imperiled done 1400 prayer oak speed the wolfbane dagger and of course access to cannabis which is gonna be massive this 30 prayer coming in as well very nice indeed getting an extra level towards the next chunk 23 gilepsy at the moment obviously we need 40 to be able to use the canvas course but the caliphates course is where we're gonna get ourselves graceful together so that's a really nice unlock and we'll be able to go for that whenever we want really just waiting on burthorpe to be opened up so that we can actually go into the into graces and grab ourselves the graceful but yeah very nice I'm gonna go and venture into canna fist see if I've forgotten anything and we'll go from there so let's go ahead and open up the new chunk for doing the quest oh okay it's the crafting guild we got useful in the future right now obviously our crafting isn't high enough to get in there but yeah useful for the future I will take that it's it's an all right unlock it's an okay unlock so we're just gonna go and start pirate's treasure as well now to get ourselves another chunk super easy question take long at all here we go this should be it we just got a speck out the guard well spec out the guard the gardener even and if we do this we should be able to grab ourselves the treasure there we go 47 quest points total now we get one I Hector's treasure chest which I haven't actually looked on the wiki what we get from my dau is anything great but you know I wanted a little bit of surprise but that is another chunk unlocked let's see what we get bid GP and the gold ring and an emerald that is an interesting reward there let's go and open up the next chunk please bless me yes yes that's exactly what we wanted juridic circle which is house hero's quest we can start a horrible on out that is literally probably the best unlock of the series I am so hyped oh yes odd okay so we're gonna get witch's house and druidic rich are all done at the same time so what we do need is we need to grab a few bits of cheese I'm just gonna buy three there just because in case I eat one by accident or something like that and so you get to quest unlocks in there we're also then gonna be able to start doing her boy it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be absolutely crazy the the the amount of content that Square has bought us is huge and I'm so excited Rhys we've got to help this boy retrieve his ball which he's kicked over into the witch's house but we are super leveled up and super like it all the gear we've gotten stuff is way over the top for this quest this is gonna be a very easy quest to get done yet just absolutely tearing things apart [ __ ] sucks emulator here as you can tell I put a [ __ ] load of time into that edit so you know drop a like and subscribe on the video if you haven't already hey let's have a look how much XP are we gonna get here thank you so much oh six the house and okay nowhere near what I thought it was brings us 6,000 away from 54 HP for quest points which is huge and a chunk to unlock surely we won't get lucky twice in a row let's see what we're getting yeah we didn't get lucky twice in a row okay a little bit more of courage on luck to be fair that is used in our monkey madness so we will need to use that square to get into the shipyard also the gnome glider there so yeah it will be useful later on in the account but as of right now not something we need here we go the quest I've been talking about for maybe six episodes finally unlocked here we go cake mix as we learnt from the PvP challenges thank you very much to everyone who let me know about that now once we do this it's gonna unlock herblore and as you saw from all of those flesh crawlers we have so many herbs to play with cannot wait to get my hands into those grubby hubs or grimy herbs and clean them see how many levels we can get right we got all of the meat we need and if we just dip it in as I said that idea how wrong Mel is gonna sound but there we go we have our blue meat now the blue waffle I need to get a grip um so it with your this is going to be it and it's going to unlock herblore here we go cake mix give me the cake there we go for quest but another for quest points quest points coming out of our ass right now 250 hub or XP and of course the access to the hub or skill boom that's gonna give us level 3 as well which gives us a bit of total level we'll take that and we can now make attack potion so let's go to the bank let's see let's get everything together probably go to Port Sarim to get some if' newts all that good stuff but we've got a lot of XP coming our way oh look at this there's gonna go ahead and start cleaning all of this see what level we get just from cleaning and then we will go from there so just from cleaning we got 7 nearly 8 herblore we've got a few terra mins at 11 that we can clean as well but we have all of this to work with to make ourselves the highest turbo we can get before we go into the rest of these just gonna an bought all of these from Jetix 500 of those and we'll probably grab ourselves a pestle mortar will grab 2 I have new packs and that's probably gonna do us for now there we go level 8 coming in and the attack potions well on their way which are gonna be useful as well like it's not just a [ __ ] thing we're doing here we are gonna use these to get up to 69 attack courses 69 this series is filled with 69 at the moment 9 herblore coming in there we are gonna get so many levels here that is level 12 coming in which means we can now make strength potions again another thing that's gonna be huge for when we're grinding up to 60 strength and even higher on these attacking and strength stats so you have really really nice also 11 levels away from a new chunk that is 17 coming in might be the last level we get from Guam's got a few more grams in the bank I think 8 so yeah this might be the last level we get but then we will have the tower minutes to go with and make some straight potions so maybe a little bit more we will see we will see so these are gonna be the first strength potions made on the account as well might just sneak in I think we are just gonna sneak in 20 or 19 even herblore coming in there which means we can now make Guam Tarr don't all that's used for I know I think you need it for a quest or something but yeah not quite gonna get the 20 herb-lore we might be able to get some levels with we need some more limp work routes for our Terra man we could go ahead and get some mare and Tails but we need to kill a load of unicorns for that so that's a little bit of a grind but as you can see we now have our attack and strength potions ready which is gonna help XP massively so I think it's time we started getting into Slayer now I think we currently have a task of an coos I believe let's have a quick look enchanted or do we don't even have the gem am I thinking of a total different account right here we go valleca assignments please still hunting Yankee I knew I had anchor on here what okay right we're gonna get our anchor task done I'm probably gonna do that in the bottom of the stronghold of security I think that's gonna be the place to do it thank you not a bad little task the Slayer XP is gonna be decent from them whether I range it or melee it I think I might range it with the bone crossbow yeah I think we'll go ahead and do that get a few range levels at the same time so yeah that's the plan here we go just behind here we can shoot the anchors out here and they also get stuck on this east panel as well so either here or here and that's where we'll be killing them so yeah I'll see how efficient this is see if it's worth doing it with the bone crossbow or not if so then we're gonna get some range levels we'll get some slayer levels everything's gonna be happy if at all I'll just come back and grab them that I get yeah okay this is just super slow so we are gonna go ahead and switch to melee there we go guys the melee is going a lot better just got a lowering drop which we are super low on at the moment so lowering drops are huge at the moment but yeah 775 coming in so let's go ahead and open up a new chunk so somehow after recording a clip of saying let's open up a new chunk I then went and didn't open up a new chunk so we'll have to do that next episode so we have a chunk to open in the next episode that is 15 Slayer coming in ran out of food and I actually forgot my pots as well so we're gonna grab those this time around but it looks like we're getting about 15 to 20 kills a trip that will probably go up sings I'm gonna bring the attack and strength pot next time but oh yeah it's not super quick but it's you know it's a grime we got to do we're getting some strength levels I think yeah we didn't get one strength level as well oh you naughty thing there we go we now have a poison dragon dagger thanks to the drop from the Anki there love to see it you absolutely love to see it great stuff there we go guys task complete because the Slayer thing was messed up it said I had 70 summon cave Krakens to go I thought I had like 70 anchors to do but I only had like 30 to do so we're actually done gonna go back to wanaka get another task and we actually got ourselves up to 16 nearly 17 slayer there so that's really really not bad at all the strengths coming in pretty close as well and hit points not too far either so yeah it's just gonna be pretty much Slayer just because that's where all the upgrades is gonna come from like the whips and you know etc etc so I that's the plan we need to get the Slayer up now I feel like we're at the stats where we should be going for it right let's have like what do we get 64 werewolves okay we just got the wolfbane dagger but I'm an idiot because that stops them from turning into werewolves right we're gonna go to California on that we can go and do that I think werewolves are actually pretty good XP so uh let's head on over and get this done so when we attack these civilians they turn into level 88 werewolves [ __ ] I didn't realize there in that high level okay I thought they were like way lower than that but we seem to be hitting pretty well maybe they just have high attack and pretty [ __ ] defense I'm not sure but there we go a bit of poison coming in as well looking like these kills are gonna be pretty easy a hundred HP as well do seem to be hitting very well and the banks right there so we can just restock this would be really good XP actually it's not a bad task at all to get we can also get a myth Square shield which will obviously be an upgrade and a room Med helm from werewolves so there are a couple of upgrades there that is 20 slayer coming in anything new there rock slugs we can now kill very very nice yeah coming on really nicely seven eight four total level as well so approaching that eight hundred total level to be rise I have this plan in the back of my mind I don't want to completely commit to it but if I was gonna if you tell me right now I have to tell you my plan for the next few episodes it would be get slow as high as possible and get a hundred and thirty total level between attack and strength which would then unlock the Warriors guilds now obviously we don't actually have that unlocked yet but you know I want to be in preparation of that for when it does come and that way we'd be able to get ourselves the other dragon defender which would be a huge upgrade yes there we go only eight left and I do get the room metal huge stuff [ __ ] I'm happy about that that is beautiful so a little upgrade for the account there doesn't look like we're gonna get this myth Square shield but I am more than happy with getting the the rune over that that is Rufus that's not someone we can attack yeah obviously I wanted the the room med home over the myth square shields are very happy eight more of these to go not going to get a strength of all we'll get ourselves twenty six Slayer though so yeah pretty good task very happy in the end yes just a few kills later and we grab ourselves another upgrade from the task love to see it two more left and we'll probably grab another task right let's see what wanaka has in store for us seventy-two cave crawlers okay we can do that this might be the end of the account I've absolutely [ __ ] up but no tele out I don't know where I'm going oh no is it up there he's out there is this the way out oh no no no no no no no no no no no no where's the way out is that it squeeze through hole oh my god please yeah okay court we're getting attacked by that thing yeah oh my god please please please please squeeze through hole squeeze through hub squeeze through the [ __ ] hole [Music] get back out of here oh my [ __ ] I really thought that was the end one squeeze squeeze squeeze go go go go go go go oh my [ __ ] I was like oh God oh my I was I was so upset I was so upset oh my god Oh okay okay okay bring a tinderbox we've learned Jesus Christ I'd sure would've got Ringel eye-for-an-eye I would have got ring of life I didn't think about that but I've read that was whirring whoa okay right so that crawler task is absolutely ripping me up with eight damage poison wise and they continue to poison you so I kept getting hit eights so I'm gonna kill a few unicorns grind their horns up and then make a few anti poisons just so we can actually go and do the task because otherwise I'm just gonna be going through food like it's going out of fashion this is gonna be 50 strengths coming in can't quite do it in style we do it there that we can beautiful 50 strengths coming in very nice indeed gonna get it to 60 I really want it to be up there and be hitting just a little bit harder the XP at the moment is pretty good but if we could get a couple more max hits that would be amazing go for that strength Tammy very soon as well we don't need too many magic levels to do that carnie at 39 we need forty nine to ten more magic levels there we've got a decent amount of money we've got a decent way of making money as well and also the Slayer go really well there we go task complete that is three we need to get five tasks done before we start getting points right banneker task a four what have we got 53 ice giants okay what take it well we just got a surprise upgrade the blacklight shield is actually better than the than the myth so there we go and you know we were on the task earlier and I was like oh [ __ ] we got the myth kite shield yeah we've got blows from this task that's pretty irrelevant but yeah we've just got an upgrade again we'll take that this is an imp and level coming up guys because this actually unlocks the prayer guild 31 prayer we can now get into the monastery the upstairs of the monastery and of course we get a chunk every time we unlock a monastery I am gonna quickly hold off on that because we do just need one more level which will take us to 800 total so we'll have another one to open and then we also have another chunk to open for goblin diplomacy a lot of you guys in the comments section let me know that I didn't actually unlock that chunk for doing the quest so as soon as we get 800 total here we're gonna have three chunks to open up which is really massive I don't think we've ever had three before to do in one so a real big reveal coming at the next level here we go guys three chunks to be opened can we get some good rng let's see first one that is [ __ ] [ __ ] that's really [ __ ] one down would have been nice because we would have had the Theodore T shortcut over to barrows okay there's the first of the three two more to go just a water square so we won't be counting that as a pick second one still more of karanji opening up the the nature altar and the mining in karanji and the last of the three opens up opens up great Jagan's in the wilderness which we won't go to cos we're at a hard core so yeah thanks very much chunk picker you've absolutely smashed that for me but guys I think that's a great place to end this episode we've got a load of chunks unlocked really looking forward to getting into this Slayer and pushing on forward with that it's been an absolute pleasure thank you so much for watching if you would be on Tuesday at the PvP challenge thanks very much guys catch you later
