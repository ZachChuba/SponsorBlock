this week have a space to took a pretty large step in his development progress by going into closed down fur we also got to see a new trailer for the game that was released alongside the PC gamers show and we can see some of that footage in this video right here meanwhile we'll hide you in released an exclusive trailer for planetary combat so yep it's all a happening now now before I get too much further into this video the footage you can see on screen right here as I said is from the trader but that will come to an end in just a moment at which point you'll see some footage of me playing the game in the ever space to prototype form this isn't to be confused with the closed alpha which is something at different however if you do want to try out over space to the prototype build for yourselves then it is now available on Steam for free simply head to have a space to steam page and to download the demo is well worth taking a look ahead now the closed alpha began on the 15th of June but obviously we can't see what's going on in there as it is a closed beta however from the traders it's pretty clear that planetary combat is going to be a thing but I'm probably getting a bit of ahead of myself here for those of you who are new to ever space - what is it well it's a larger open-world a single-player space shooter the plan is to have a large number of different environments both in space as well as on planets and you'll be able to fly seamlessly between all of these and yes that also includes multiple star maps space stations as you - droids and much much more the game in essence is a dilute based RPG similar in concept to Diablo 3 but obviously a set in space oh well there's classes of ships instead of classes of humanoids players will be able to upgrade their ships as well as to spend to perk points to open up and develop styles of gameplay that are best suited to their own personal style this is all set against a beautiful backdrop of wonderful to space environments the recent trailer seems to be a great showcase for all of this so oh you've seen some of that on the screen here but if you want to have a another look at in a closer look at it then I do have a look at the link in the video description as it does seem to show an element of each aspect of the now how closely the publicly available prototype build will match the final release is anyone's guess however I do want to point out that the prototype plays extremely well there's a number of different ships to tryout weapons can be upgraded as can ship equipment such as shields and modules there's a number of missions to undertake and discoveries to be made it's generally a very very pleasant however you are about to go down to planets and you can't travel to other star systems but it does give you a bit of a taster as to what to expect now if the closed alpha looks like it's going to extend on for a while although it developer rockfish games haven't confirmed what other phases there's going to be if any what we do know who may is that they are aiming to release into early access in December of this year and that's pushed back from the original plan have intended to release into early access in September and without the virus and the requirements to work from home and an impact on that rockfish however appeared to be pretty confident and they can hit at the December date and after early access so in 2021 the game would also be available on consoles so talking about the availability of the game for PC apparently an epic deal was offered to rockfish the size of this still isn't known but what is known is that these deals these epic games of store her deals have a reputation for being a significant sums of cash the rockfish wanted to stay loyal to their existing customers so ever space 2 will be remaining with steam however they said it will also be available on GOG and Epic Games store as well in addition to steam so a good choice all around there then with things moving forward up my people are also wondering about the future of the game of course ever space 2 is a single-player game is exclusively single-player and this naturally at least two questions about multiplayer multiplayer is something that rockfish I really don't want to include in ever space - and one of the main reasons for this is because multiplayer the addition of that would add on a whole bunch of years to the development cycle another reason though is that they want to evolve the game series at one step at a time the original game was a roguelike so moving into an open-world game is already a significant stage however old I said rockfish you're very clear that they do discuss multiplayer frequently so it's something that they would like to include in the future maybe in a future version of the game perhaps so that's where things stand right now again just a reminder if you do want to give the game a try for yourself then do head on over to the steam page and to download that demo as a waser thanks for watching and I get you guys and girls next time [Applause] you
