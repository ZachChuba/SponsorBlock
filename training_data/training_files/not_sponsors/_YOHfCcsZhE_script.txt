what's Apple in B's and G's and welcome back to another upgrade and unlock way back to this one but pretty much for those you haven't seen the episode before we unlock chunks of the map by doing certain tasks this is currently what we have unlocked anything in between here is what we have unlocked at the moment and all of the numbered squares are things that we have the potential to unlock when we complete certain tasks if you'd like to know what and it will explain everything today's episode I want to kick off by completing the IMP catcher and I also want to go ahead and do demon slayer in the last episode we did unlock the chunks that allow us to do demon slayer so get two quests out the way and hopefully unlock two chunks now because I'm really unlocked anywhere that has a good spawn of imps I know underneath fala doors a really good place to do it Bobbsey we don't have that unlocked I'm just hopping worlds and just and just hopping worlds and hoping an m6 I know there's an imp spawn around here so I'm just gonna keep wiping worlds and hoping we can find this imp although we haven't found it two worlds in a row so I'm a little bit worried now okay so I looked on the wiki and apparently this imp spawns at the entrance of this outer it mine very commonly so this is the one we're gonna be killing there's a strength level as well how [ __ ] far is this gone okay not bad 23 strengths coming in which takes us to three five five yeah this seems pretty solid jump to two worlds now and it's been here both times and it's done that's me both times as well and we have our first speed there we go the red feed coming in beautiful and that is be number two beautiful no duplicate boom there we go yellow bead coming in thank you very much unfortunately these scorpions are actually aggressive to me not quite I think we need to be level 29 and they'd stop so I can't really venture any further down into the mind but luckily the M seemed to spawn like this sort of area we just need the white bead and we are done I have been here for so [ __ ] long and I just keep getting dupes so annoying I hate that they didn't implement but when you get one you can't get that one again hate that they didn't do that so annoying this little [ __ ] has gone all the way back here so go through here oh I'm fuming I hate this quest I hate it so much and the fact that we got those three just like perfectly was amazing for so much working for this guy come on be the one be the one be the one be the one [ __ ] off oh we got it the white bead Adam in sold in head there we go beautiful okay so we can go hand this in and we get the amulet of accuracy I believe it is which is actually gonna be the best in slot I've got at the moment because I don't actually own an amulet so uh that would be nice miss GOG big Matt I have your beads you go play with them enjoy yourself I'll be back you see 875 magic XP and a quest point and of course it means we get to unlock a chunk as well not gonna give us some magic oh it is 20 magic coming in we can now use the reci√©n armor very nice indeed here using that for a long time probably at mystics before we even go anywhere near that but the amulet of accuracy giving us that for attack bonus in everything which is gets massive absolutely massive especially at the level we currently are and it's far and over and open a new chunk up right let's see where we're off to in the next chunk where are we gonna go I'll box the anvil next to the bank I guess skill gets unlocked so we could go ahead and get that 40 cooking but there's not really much in there Gertrude's cat we're gonna need to unlock the lumber mill for sure cuz that's where you find the cat but that is Gertrude slightly opened up also means we can walk from pipe area and village through there now we don't have to walk all the way around which is nice um I'll take it I'll take it and obviously the bank there yeah okay we'll take that we are gonna go ahead and do Demon Slayer now so we can unlock another chunk and get that quest complete to get the silver light let's go ahead and do it while we are here in Draenor I'm actually gonna go ahead [ __ ] how I thought we had for money than that we're gonna go ahead and spend the works half of this just getting a cabbage cape off addy Ango I want I want the fashion scape you know I'm feeling I'm feeling fashion scape you there it is beautiful and that is gonna give a few bonuses as well if I'm not the holiday item beautiful and we can do a skill kit might even though it's locked I never knew that I never knew that even though it's locked you can you can do it but there we go I'm it we're gonna head on over and do this Demon Slayer alright speak to the gypsy and we are gonna get this done I've also realized with this square being opened up we can also definitely do shield of arif I think a few of you in the client section did say if I did Phoenix gang I would have been able to do it anyway but now I can do either the the black arm is it black arm or Phoenix one other two I can now do either one to get the quest completed so that's nice but we are gonna go ahead and do this first and I'll probably hop into that after I can find a partner right we got to get ourselves 25 bones together and then give them to the guy up top here so I'm just gonna kill some wizards and once we've got everything we will go and get this last key and then we can kill the demon and job done actually gonna do I'll buy Draenor because I can get all the bones from the dark wizards their lower level and we'll be able to grab ourselves food at the bank right if we talk to tribal and he is gonna give us the last key and then we'll be able to get the silver silver light and then we'll be able to kill this demon there we go give him the bones and there we go my man is gonna get his key out and that is all three case let's return back and kill this demon I think we just need to run in here with the silver light and it should start a cutscene yeah there we go awesome and I'm pretty sure we're you know where we should kill this pretty easily so it shouldn't be too much of an issue we're just gonna make sure we write in the the right incantation at the end but only level 27 does have a max it of 9 though which is why I brought a couple of stews just in case [ __ ] off wizard what are you doing he's not gonna attack me first is he I have to kill this so annoying I swear that's not how it's meant to be I swear that's not how it's meant to be what's going on over there don't ass the [ __ ] is is that meant to be there I don't even though I guess he's the guy who's summoned him but I've never seen that before doing this quest right here we go Oh [ __ ] hell yes seven eight points I gave a little bit over prepared there and there we go that is quest complete look at that what great little I love that it has that I don't think any other quests have that where you do some sort of animation after finishing it maybe you do anyone know of any anyone in the comments if you know a quest that happens that would be quite cool but that's a sick ending you know there we go another quest completed absolutely awesome Demon Slayer let's go ahead and open up the chunk here we go what are we gonna get okay that's just see and you know what we what everybody was saying in the comments was if we do pick a see it is just a reroll so whenever we do get something way it's totally inaccessible we will just real world so that is another reroll there and we will go and see what else we're gonna get and we've opened up falador but we can't actually get in there unless we had agility oh you bastard you bastard that is so annoying the only way we could get in there without unlocking obviously here it would be locking the door of a mine going through there and then popping up out here so I do what I'll take it because it does start to open that side of the map up but um as of right now that isn't gonna be helpful not gonna be helpful but I will take it because it is towards the progression of moving over to this side of the map I'm gonna go ahead and start getting this fletching level up I know I can make an alright amount of money I did when you know on my first hardcore my current hardcore I should say I guess I do have a current hardcore home on my current hardcore I made a lot of my early money through fletching and obviously it's gonna throw the levels through the roof so we're gonna go ahead and do that get ourselves up to 375 total open up the next chunk see where we're going and then we'll go from there but I think this fletching I might take this fletching to quite a high level but I haven't decided yet we'll see how I'm feeling right that is gonna be incredibly slow so what I'm gonna do is actually pick up logs here hop and get a full inventory because that way I can flex them a lot quicker when we get to 20 fletching I'll then be able to make oak boughs or short bows and then I can just go back to work eying because at the moment that we're getting XP so little anyway I'm not really missing out by not cutting those so I'm just gonna quickly get this 20 fletching up here and then we'll go back down and and make those there we go guys 20 fletching coming in gonna hop on down and start cutting some oak trees and making oak short bows this is going to be the fletching level coming in which does also take us to the three seven five so we do get to unlock a new chunk 21 fletching coming in there 25 wood cutting as well let's have a look at where we're going right let's see where we are going oh please say we can get in there No oh my god is there any way I can get in there somehow I could teleport to falador if I get the magic level I can just teleport there okay that's okay let's just open this up I can just teleport that I'm an idiot I'm a [ __ ] idiot okay so we can get into falador if I get the magic level so that's gonna be the bank gonna be the gem store we might be able to start a quest or two I don't know we can now go down to the mother lode mine when we get thirty mining we can also use the the guild when we get the forty mining I believe it is um okay okay I'm sort of happy with it I'm sorta happy with it as for what we're gonna get up to in-game I'm just gonna continue doing this I would like to get the fletching a wood cutting to a decent level and we can make some money while we do it we sell ten of these yeah exactly just a little bit of money here and there so I'm gonna hot wild sell these all off I'm just gonna keep on going I want something a bit afk at the moment that is thirty we're cutting coming in so we can now cut willow trees but obviously we need to get this fletching up before we can do that if we're going for the willow short boughs we're gonna need 35 fletching so probably we'll go to that that is 25 fletching which allows us to make okhla long bows and that doubles the XP per hour so big old upgrade there alright guys we've hit 400 total levels so we're gonna see where we are off to next here we go where are we going it is the [ __ ] jewel arena great stuff there we go guys 35 fletching coming in which means we can now move on to the willow trees and make willow short bows which is sick XP I'm gonna make a lot more money for us and that is 40 what kind coming in as well so um you know I'm actually talking to kins right now guys okay nose is here hey guys home and wasn't expecting a reduction what's up guys sorry we're planning a PvP right now and I know in the last clip I said I was gonna start cutting willows so that's what we're gonna go and do I'm stood at the oak still but there's 40 were cutting and a PvP challenge coming very soon B's already oh and like the video please thank you a big goal now is to go and get that 37 magic because that is gonna be massive if we can unlock falador obviously we'd have the squirts to actually get into Vallon door so the only way is to to telly in and we did make a decent amount of money we're up to 10k yet literally nothing before we started from the wood cutting and the fletching what I think I'm gonna do is just a little bit more fletching get ourselves like 15 20 K and then we'll go on over to varrock buy some rooms get this level up and see how close we get to with 1520 kg P and that is a medium task as well to cut a willow tree here in a lumber to drain off so that gets us a little bit closer I don't think we're really yeah hardly anything done at all I did look into both of these and we can't complete it as of right now but uh few of you been asking if we can play an easy of any diary that is a chunk if we complete a medium it's a chunk and so on so there's quite a few more chunks here to be unlocked but obviously getting some of these done is is difficult because we don't have everything unlocked that we need to do content wise that is a 41 wood cutting coming in which means we can now use the rune axe when we're gonna get that I have no idea but that is now a lot so you know got a push for that still using the steel at the moment so I should probably go ahead and try to upgrade this somehow I haven't looked into that at all so maybe a little have a little peek so I just got some junk out the bank and all of the willow short bows that we did and we will see how much we're gonna get for them and that would just shy of 14k it's definitely not gonna be enough to get us to 37 but it is a start and we'll see how much that money gets us and we will go from there if I unlocked low alchemy maybe I'll start killing some sub monsters that drop nature runes I know I've got a few in the bank maybe like 20 that way we get money back and we also get magic levels from the things we are like you know from the willow short bows so maybe that might be the way to go I know it's not that conventional to do but in this case I'm not gonna user nature you were runes for anything else so that might be what I go ahead and do but we're gonna spend this money and see what I want so I've got myself just over a thousand costs of firestrike I'm actually gonna go and kill giant frogs in the Lumbridge swamp because they drop nature runes commonly and they only have three common drops so nature runes are probably gonna be quite common from them and they can drop up to nine at a time so uh we're gonna hone telly that's we're off to that is 21 magic coming in and also they drop big bones which is a she could have been not bad for uh for prayer XP it's all Sammy yeah these frogs are the ones well I didn't count on is that they do have a chance of not dropping anything which they've done for the first two kills so maybe that won't be amazing but the prayer XP is sick to be honest that's really really good at home and the magic Spees really sick as well so I'm all round really happy if we can get a few nature runes together as well I'll be happy as [ __ ] I think the wiki might be wrong I've killed 15 frogs now and I haven't got one nature and drop I haven't even even got any Queen drop so I don't know if it's just super unlikely to get a drop or what but the pro XP is good but magic speed is good they have high hitpoints and I can say spot them so I can't really complain but again no drop it just seems like they don't actually drop anything that is 24 magic and to be honest I've just thought about it let's go and kill Hill Giants because they do drop some coins they drop some runes can get nature roads there could get all sorts of things they're helpful and it will reimburse us a little bit 25 magic coming in and teleport to varrock unlocked while Lauren's are dropped for us as well thank you very much yeah justice if the rest of these casts see how close we can get up to that 37 magic and and go from there hopefully the drops we get from these guys up to like close to 37 magic will give us enough money to then just go and buy a few more runes and then get ourselves all the way up and unlock falador right that is gonna be the first inventory might as well a beer we might need that for a quest or something super close to that 21 prayer coming in where am i off to gonna go up here and I guess try and sell a few things off that's actually an upgrade I didn't have a better thing than anion kite shield so that's that's an upgrade for the gear the rest of stuff you seed so when we start getting some allotments we can get you seeds together about 400-500 costs into the into the mind runes so we're about halfway just under halfway in what we can use ourselves to 29 so 30 isn't far off 200 XP off 30 so it's not looking too bad at all think this is gonna get this prayer level which it does 21 prayer coming in nothing new there but that does take us to 496 levels away from a new chunk and there we go there's 30 magic coming in so we're now five levels away from a new chunk that imagine anything new nothing new there there we go got our first giant key that is 34 magic coming in which does take us to 425 total level so we'll see where we are off to next chunk wise and we're getting really close actually you might get it within the runes to 37 magic right let's see where we are off to next we got London there yard with lumberyard what the mill would quit a mill before as well we've got a lumberyard which means I think we can do Gertrude's cap that's not bad at all opens up that bit I mean we could start pushing off towards cannafest maybe other than that not really anything too crazy there's the balloon transport but we won't be doing that for quite a while but Gertrude's cat sounds pretty naughty and that is 37 magic come again we can now teleport too far though that was the goal can I go now I need water rune so we need to go back to the bank I'm gonna kill this one we'll go to the bank and we will tell you over to falador here we go guys boom into falador pretty good I'm not gonna lie obviously because of the borders we would have been able to get into follow it out teleporting but this doesn't mean we can now use pretty much the whole of falador as you can see right here these are our two Fargo squares which pretty much unlocks everything we've got the mother lode mine and the Dwarven mine which we can go down in now I've also got myself back thirty mining so we can use the mother lode mine so there's a lot of opportunities there in terms of smithing and getting mining up and stuff like that really really nice and then we've got the shield shop here we've got a few other things and then a couple more quests to start over there and Rick is here to talk to us hello mate what'd we get coins I think something like that I'm but guys that is where we're going to end this
