all righty folks welcome back to another episode of RL craft the hardest mod pack ever conceived we are as for last time your first month of server hosting and you can have yourself a good time so I learned interestingly enough since last time that apparently the ferry that I was very worried about that was chasing me with fire it was actually trying to help me yeah and it just ran through the fire and caught on fire yeah it was trying to chase me with fire so the did you see the other part of that though and rewatching no what was the other part to that what you died and then you respawn in yours okay and when you respawn do you respond in front of a dragon which you didn't notice because you were busy complaining mightily about the about the the weather uh-huh and so that dragon wound up and you were playing with your settings and then it fired a fireball at you like was trying to kill you at which point right after it's it's like breathe the fireball at you i teleported you to me and you were like okay let's get going and didn't even realize like you were a quarter of a second from death really and did not even come close to noticing and I was so you I basically dodged the projectile with a teleport oh yeah 100% 100% oh okay and I was I I hadn't like you know I was like I wanted to see this fairy thing and kind of was watching and so catching up on it and then I saw that happen I was like and I was like he's about to and then you junk teleporting I was like I didn't it was just it was you got very lucky my friend that you survived that's good I'm happy to hear it because I was completely it was like a mr. Magoo moment apparently you had no idea what was going on and it was like you I mean and I I was used paused for a half a second it made me wonder if you saw it because you like stopped and then you went back to complain about the weather yeah like style look at it and it's just this pair of evil eyes just glaring at you and I'm gonna have to go back and re-watch I didn't even realize that it's it's only it's like three minutes and 40 seconds in like it's we're just but well I need to grab myself some water cuz I'm a bit on the thirsty side you're a bit you're a bit peckish I'm a bit parched I wonder if okay so it'd be great if we could get some iron we did have iron exposed in the first cave that we made what I'm wondering is if our mining level is high enough now to actually be able to mine that or we could just dig down here I don't really know what the best strategy is you want to make this into a mine or would you prefer to go check out the existing iron this back above something oh yeah something seems to have left but I'm a little nervous about going down deep right there mm that's true we make a chest or chest the normal recipe I wonder if you can shift pick oh you can you can shift pick up chest that's actually really nice what are you what are you what are you what is what are you it's like a dragon is there actually a dragon okay okay mm-hmm where where have you gone to you're just making the front door I'm at the front door and I'm not seeing you well be careful for giant floating orb of fire and death oh that over there that's a wild looking do Hicker dude that doesn't look like a dragon dragon it definitely breathes fire unto me so okay so you would not recommend engaging okay well then there were like some sort of dinosaur things over here there's another one okay all right cool well you know what I is gonna I'm gonna go ahead and run back to our initial kind of cave area cuz I know there was I in there and there's water around there so that'll be a good thing and then I'll be able to refill my thirst right so to go back to what you were saying and I apologize for being you know slightly interrupting with my impending doom but I mean we should have enough levels that if we need to we can level up our mining and hopefully be able to get into that those sweet sweet oh that's a chest you can make normal chests it's pretty excited actually that's actually really nice yeah I know you don't have to get iron through a whole round about process and trapdoors and all that stuff so it's pretty cool that's a reference to a the Exodia series that's yeah on a different channel for me for those wondering okay so how did we get here I'm trying to remember how we actually ended up here in the first place oh yeah I was through this way yeah wasn't that far oh there's another dragon looking oh no no no it apparently seems to be angry and I'm gonna let I'm gonna run now I'm gonna run now okay because that why are those spawning when they weren't a thing previously well I mean you know we might very well have been that we got really lucky we dude they're like multiple of them I see there's inside a lot of places now yeah there's a lot of fire guys too like there's a lot of fire there's a big wow hey I'm able to acquire iron though now that's exciting I am in possession of a whopping eight iron now did pretty excited yeah it's pretty cool it's pretty cool and also I'm in possession of a little bit more water in the belly I'm a bit less parched that's also cool um how do I get one of them fire starter fancy things and also name thing oh yeah mmm it there oh yeah a peck oh you may not rest now there oh why why why is that what are we in a haunted house excuse me I was able to lie down I was like I'm just it's bedtime now no no let's sleep I'm not okay with frickin did did I just did I see that are my eyes playing tricks on me cuz I got a you are now able to summon this cinder as a temporary minion how did how how what I don't know okay but but I do know the one one little piece of housekeeping is that they just today release a big update for it and it will reset some of the dungeons and stuff so it might be that that big name guy right below us only do that update will go away but it's a pretty important update so I see you in it next time understandable it is indeed I'm going to make sword but you okay yeah I mean we shouldn't definitely you don't meet the requirements to use this okay apparently there's a right-click on the sword but I can left-click it I was like can I not swing my sword does that would be a that'd be a pain I can't right-click on anything with a sword in my hand it just gets angry with me yeah oh okay okay it is fancy sorta bandages I'm just using my stone sword and not having nearly the problem I go make ironic pickax and then if you want to use those remaining to iron to make yourself an iron sword perhaps it's a good idea it would have been good to get a bucket but I think we're down one I mean I'm honestly I'm sure we'll be able to find iron pretty easily I'd say I mean do we want to just make a mine and kind of see what happens might be interesting to see what is down below if anything is different I agree cool you don't meet the requirements to use this iron pickaxe that's helpful I'm very curious right now if I attempt to hit something with a sword like a like this pig over here that is a cobalt are you nice bipedal rat dad have you done was it no it's this dude what it what the heck heck I'm in blood where did this come from oh how did you get to me come here out okay come here you come down come down and fight me like a spectral ghost what the okay we need a boat we need some range of weaponry because it here I'm gonna try to hit a pig you go and enjoy that guy can I use now I do oh my god it's a good thing I haven't gotten myself into a fight because I don't even meet the requirements to use this sword I'm getting dehydrated so am i we need to find a nice water source here like I'm at one who okay so my name god I need to be oh god we really have to level up some who attack and stuff my goodness oh yeah I'm not early nice job dude well that's that's a it's a big boy dinosaur yeah no those were those are what I was originally confused by is and they seemed like they didn't seem too angry but then I got attacked by the orange ball of death and they the orange ball of death did in fact seem angry so and I am like terrified I'm gonna lose my way oh there's a whole structure over here next to the the big boy dinosaurs yeah I'm in it right now what hi what's up I'm in another room there's only one room you know I think your infrastructure cuz no no turn around turn okay oh there you are hi there's there is yes right over here right over here this is just this part over here oh okay okay so we need to go ahead and get our social or mining levels and Mata alpha yeah they look nice they seem like thanks thanks boys don't hit it uh no I wouldn't dream of doing that that sounds like a poor decision yeah oh I found another way point though thank you I see you you're like out from the distance but I see you crucial murud sure that's that's cool I don't really know oh wait so can you just press right or forest oh it doesn't you just go back and forth that easily okay that's longer within 2000 songs within 2,000 meters of each other or blocks then and there's a mine right here to who you want they'll do oh whoa hey fairy what's up oh it's giving us regen that's nice of it I don't God very just wants to help frickin Frick we need to get to level 8 in our mining and attack skills so that we can use whoa that's a little dropper ooh hey through here there's a there's a deep dark dropper ooh also how do we make one of those things so that I can have the starter it's just a matchbox it's three paper and three wood I think and how do you get the paper again wood okay a war on paper is we don't want that's like freaking jousting the what did i do monetize it yes it died you okay I don't need to poop anymore how does it even have what do you mind if that's a risk of happening just spawn out of ruts oh yeah no I just dug out a rock and I'm just like boom bro what the heck what the heck indeed I mean I thought the silverfish is one thing but do oh my goodness I don't understand how okay that's why you have to be over level five and it only uses levels that are over level five how does the experience system work for leveling up the skills I really haven't tried that much so I don't know just well the times that I've given in an attempt it's taken some XP and put it in but I don't know if you have to be oh god no something's coming something that's movement creeper creeper oh it's okay chill it's not that big of a deal bro you can deal with a little bit of creepers you just it's maybe a little bit scarier to deal with the thing that explodes that a rock and like just shoots its drill at you oh hey it is a more iron oh wait this is that you're cobblestone or was that ya ain't like I was done okay oh there is a few creepy boys over here that's where I was when when the creeper I threw my sticks don't lose my six your sticks are still here hey I I saw the creeper and immediately tossed at my sticks in tribute yeah like why excuse me why what are you what's going on here I was in the middle of crafting some some more torches when it showed up and I panicked and listen I holy crud oh you know what I can make another crafting table and I yeah it's just it's easy everything is a lot easier to make here and that's exciting I have another crafting table too oh well I just made my own so I'm gonna go ahead and make that whole matchbox dealio yeah I uh do we have what it takes for a furnace is that just a regular cop yeah it's just regular cobblestone cuz I could what the No get this out of here there we go I don't know if I like that a regular work that oh oh hello bud careful Dean behind you behind you yep yep I didn't look behind I just ran broski oh frickin skele bro dude there's everybody is over here and it's annoying also uh could use water be cool actually to bring a bucket down here well that's okay height scale bro just take him out dude wait what wait wait what we have to start somewhere no wait no no no no we should be in our beds right oh oh yes okay oh I'm at the waist own that's my man too I might have accidentally stabbed you Oh cuz I was like pretty sure that you was that I did ID monetize like way too quickly there well they can the skeletons can one shot you cuz we don't have hello who do we get headshot well I double-edged shot at us killed you oh I stabbed you oh now alright that I I don't know oh that's that looks fun see how fine I got him here I got him I got him I got him wait hold on let me see that side Oh cavitus farkles was slain by zine I didn't yeah mm thanks for that thanks for that blood appreciate Jessa you got in my way I think you just you banged me in the head with a sword oh it's true I think that's what happened - I would agree with your assessment so what we want to do it sounds like then is if we spawn at way stones it seems like wherever we settled if we do so you killed it oh my lord is that a blaze right I don't know I got a blaze powder in a blaze rod what my rings are my rings I have tinnitus I don't know what's real anymore okay but this is iron I don't make the requirements - oh gosh okay that's that's that's easier I don't let you always all right no so I need to be able to dig up iron okay that's my name for how are you not are you kidding right now oh my god dude uh-huh take so many hit don't don't hit me please don't hit me oh yeah I just heard like some roof can you not even not do it though okay could you not what can I can I level you up now I don't know how it determines when I'm allowed to level it up there you don't think you have to be I mean I don't know whether it's just you need enough XP to be able to make it or if you have to be over five in order to apply anything so much cold oh I feel like that's kind of our way to get XP right now as coal yeah no coals I mean you know let's be honest you uh you you D monetize the enemies is necessary while I ran and scream oh oh I hear bad things up above what what is that no wait don't talk to me don't duck okay oh all right bad frog bad frog bad frog fat frog bad frog oh and why am I getting hurt now why am I getting hurt what's happening right now I have played I have the plague help I don't know why I have the plague I need a hazmat suit get me out of here oh I'm coming to you frog is killing me oh my god dude what the heck is I just breath the Frog dude oh that's why we have the plague yeah I was poison frog but I was I killed it I hit it like 800 times and then you're like oh I just killed it remember to meanwhile I scream and run what is that a squeeze to place a poison cloud wait so I can't tell of that plague thing that I was getting was just from the frog frog as soon as the Frog started attacking like it that was looking far away yeah but it puts off like a plague cloud right so how was day I don't know if it okay well we'll see I'm gonna go back into this little dungeon thing that I found over here and kind of see what's up bro you should join me here this is some nerdy stuff Oh scary freaky things stupid rock guy go away boy you got another Rock away I'm coming over to you I don't know why these all seem to spawn on you I'm just over here like everything's I'm fine I killed it oh my god that's gotta sound a little less than masculine for you but it's very disconcerting having the coal you're mining suddenly erupt into a giant crawfish trying to kill you oh I don't doubt it don't doubt it it's almost at mining level yes it throws a fella off you know it's good excuse of me Oh mining need to go up one ah poopy pants hey do you want to come into this surely not at all dangerous dungeon with me sure I just put some water here so that we came in oh nice okay well I am I guess again if you want to throw me the bucket I will go up and fetch more water I'll go get water okay shoot dude I need to really gonna need to get more hmm yeah I think I'm gonna need to go up and get more plant fibers anyway because I'm gonna need to make more bandages and if you feel like I don't know snagging any plant twine doing any of that what is that that way cool cool I was actually seeing it I figured you wouldn't be throwing stuff at me use your curiosity against you yeah I figured you were actually trying to be helpful and pass me something but why would you do a thing like that you know doesn't sound like me okay so I got sticks in oh there appeared if he some cave spiders here I see this appears to be a place where there are monsters oh yes there do appear to be monsters and they can crawl through one by one holes oh not good at all no no it's not it's not boy no it's not boy no I'm abandoning the mission the mission is being abandoned abandon ship alright I just decided to come back yeah here no freakin torches whoa dude this is weird all of it I don't know if this is a graphics card thing but sometime oh it's like I'm dehydrated what is the shaders doing no no no the hydration is weird weather you can't read any it's just okay so it does it does like a Photoshop filter looking effect on yeah okay remember when I was like something's going I got him just get them down okay I now I know I'm realizing because I'm like I this is weird dude yeah okay I'm hoping I'm actually I'm gonna go back in to here because I'm hoping that I might be able to get some XP from the monsters down here and also not get you monetize yes I know I know how you do I know how you do oh god they're fast they're fast boys Frick get in that place it'll be nice and convenient whoa whoa don't do me like that but then Vidya stopped telling you every new update ready to install I'm in the middle of the game got dang it it's not helpful but didn't you know that you have a new poop god dude bandages are gonna just be non-stop yeah pretty much holy crap okay but but the question okay god you're so freaking good doing it Frick so well no no no no not not well at all oh boy I got a scale one two well it's because we got we got a slight amount of lag and so it's uh making it difficult to get these boyos but I think I might be able to level up at least a skill er so yes okay thank goodness and now also I can't level of attack but oh the further you get in leveling the more expensive it is but now I can use my iron maker guests oh well at least I'm putting my iron pickaxe to use very exciting make sure that your leveling up your skill tree as needed because it will be helpful to you okay hey whoa no don't do it not like this hey why don't you take damage I'm in trouble I think I might be in trouble and he flies no oh my god sounds like there's a lot going on down there but yeah hey yeah my head was untouched though so that's good requirements too freaking I need to get defensive - oh thank you for the regeneration I was it was in a bad way and you're making me feel much better oh is the ferry being a bro yeah for sure nice dude plus she plays the pleasant wind chimes and that's nice - she wanted you to feel better and then you were like no I didn't attack her at least no she she came at you and then flew through that fire but I don't with a question to me is still I I couldn't see at all what was killing you like something clearly went laughs and was very angry with you and I do not know what has the ability to summon lightning but it worries you mean you made Spartacus himself mad yeah I did and that's worrisome so Zeus where have you gone - I just did the way stone to try and find our base but I don't I'm lost and confused okay would you like help because I know where our bases yeah I mean I can waste on back to that way stone okay I mean you want to just come to me is there do you need the base for something currently I don't I mean it's night time I guess I can come back downstairs or down into the mine yeah oh I need an iron sword those two um you're not gonna be able to use it until here quite unfortunately which I'm trying to work on myself currently I am at mining eight defense five attack five once you get defense intact eight it's just iron basically requires eight all around for any and all uses okay so that's the part that I'm trying to achieve right now using the help of the convenience mob grinder down here that's not really a mob grinder but just kind of gets you in trouble nonetheless tis grinding mobs yeah that's better and what are you kidding oh my god help they could go through half slabs they do not want you to be able to do whatever it is you're trying to do but how how how is that a thing okay is it the thickest putting the work bench we're sorry I didn't oh my god this is net hey why that looked uncomfortable like that was that was creepy for me to see how what is it it's not supposed to happen okay you can still attack me through this we have a serious issue with this modpack you can still hit the head help all right well we owed Eastham an iron we just need to get to level eight in order to be able to make use of it oh man we'll use it so you're trying to you're trying to kill those spiders and grind off of minutes just not well yeah I think they're better ways I think it's kind of gonna be a cold situation Kohl's probably gonna be the better leveling option because yeah those guys are mean I mean you know you've killed them when you haven't died and we're not wearing any armor so can you put on iron armor did you try nope lovely anything anything iron relay is level eight all around so really it's a matter of just mine a lot of coal enjoy yourself okay and have a good time treat treat yourself to have some coal yeah I'm realizing that rather than trying to level up so you get an iron pickaxe I really should have leveled up defense so I could wear iron armor but here we are I might be able to level up my defense a bit here oh god I'm still one level away and then I'll be able to use the iron armor I am I my defense is like five now four yeah for some reason when you're leveling it up in the menu it gives you one number higher yeah it shows you what you were if you were to click the button that shows you the level would give you there enough so it kind of it kind of breaks your heart just a little bit just oh yeah you open up me like yeah oh well we got a lot of coals so that's pretty exciting huh well it's the only thing that you know we're able to do to get ourselves silly gosh-darn XP dude these things freak me out every time Oh Frick what freaking dude got him got him got him got him god I'd actually just yeah what was he recording at the time that I was mining I was just like I'm gonna casually mine some coal and iron and then the dude just pops out of nowhere I know it's very disconcerting god that thing is freaking terrifying it do very very disconcerting when those guys pop up I understand exactly what your complaint is likes my heads okay but my body is a little bit worse for wear there how are you checking your health well you just click on a bandage yeah or I think there is another way to access the health area I'm just not exactly sure the location of it yeah is that found uh I found a deep dark area golden if bigness golden sickness does not seem very happy with me am I gonna be able to get up to level eight event you okay Simpson just grounded my ear and there's nothing there why would you do this that sounds settling it was just looking off into the distance at a [ __ ] and something's up with my ear like you again oh I'm sort of stuck right now all I have no sword wait I have another sword it's the wrong sword oh I hate them oh did you get those guys are just the worst whoops yes yes are you wear iron armor yeh congratulate see either the crawfish of doom was it actually helped it gave me a little bit of levels be very excited to have I got never burns oh we got a gold or two all right nothing to worry about here I'm just gonna run up and then we're gonna make a full set iron armor and everything is gonna be gravy I'm gonna stop getting demonetised left and right oh man I can't wait it's gonna be the best okay I feel like I haven't seen daylight in ages but you know what it's all worthwhile now I get myself back up in a full health you batch yeah okay oh that's a relief oh that's a big relief right so what was that ring collector cobble a bucket okay and that gathers I know purified water rain is good unlike some people I know rain is uh is a bad thing rain is always very bad thing is it's raining outside rain is purified water and no it is not hmm well then I should be coming on out don't you think I should be coming on out cuz I need to increase my health and then dude now that I have iron armor I feel like I'm gonna be in pretty good shape to just kind of chill and stuff yeah you're uh you're much stronger than I am it's okay you'll get there eventually young padawan I I believe in you well gotta be higher though Oh much more more rain of light than I do dude did we notice this crazy treehouse thing last yeah we did oh yeah okay but we could make requests you check that out dude so there's a little volcano over here and there's bad guys that are sitting in it just chillin ready to kill us so that's there oh this little mini volcano yeah oh but there is a structure do you see there's a structure on the other side of it but those guys a little like aggro like to that tree so they were pretty large right buddy a little farm here oh okay cool see you're you're thinking we'll just because this is next to the Waypoint maybe yeah like the way play it's very convenient rather than trying to figure out where we are right for sure a point everything so I mean I'd almost say let's grab our beds and move them down below or something okay yeah I'm down with that I'm down with that okay you just wow what's right in front of my knife my leg my little waffling right in front of a knight are you actually like are you bobbling now no no okay I thought maybe it did actually hit your leg specifically okay okay so I'm gonna need to get Lance string and a little bit more wool they're sheep here to be monetize or there's Benson around but they keep eyeballing them and they're all behind the the eagles volcano dudes you know it's chill because I'll just go ahead and fell this birch tree here you don't follow me don't follow me okay good good yeah with the slight delay the the falling mechanic makes it gives that a little extra yeah it's like what is it about to be on me it's it's a little extra oomph dude that tree house looks wild though I want to check that out dude that looks pretty groovy oh wait it's not from you I can careful I'm gonna I'm snagging some string out of this I think just keeps going yeah I don't know how deep it goes it's hard to tell what could go wrong everything seems fine to me I don't see why you'd be in any danger under any concern it appears that it branches off in a couple directions here but it does have strings they can make more bandages yeah so this might you wanna seem a little apprehensive up there yeah not wanting to come down I'm trying to make myself an axe so that I could make some match but anyway it's fine I'll be right though I need to make another ion that begins unfortunately you do not understand yeah I know you can't do any any right-click action if you don't have the particular set of skills unfortunately I still don't have the levels I need in order to keep ranking that which is a very very unfortunate oh oh I'm so close to folder ability though that's pretty sweet my foot was just a little bit worse for wear just go when it's daytime just like what I did is I just went and hung with the oh they will actually recover your body parts yeah like stood next to her and stared at her and then eventually I felt better like do they get you all the way up to full yeah oh dang I didn't even realize that why am I out here using bandages when I don't even have to also I why we have a lot of coal I'm just gonna put those to use really baby we have a little bit of coal I guess we could build a block it's got the echo in here yeah but no I think it's awesome oh the environments are cool like it's it's neat what they do give very atmospheric uh-huh and such all right so I have a couple we're out here feeling good Brown feeling then screaming like little children when we get a rock monster we're really you know controlling the situation here I'm gonna go see if I can snag some beds yeah and they don't want a bed recovery mission oh there's a spider boy I was I was going to wait until daytime but do the spiders getting rocked think you can think you can attack me bro you can attack me now attack me I'm too strong for y'all tell me more about how great you are no you know it's just when you get that defense leveled up you're out here you're out here crushing okay so I'm trying to see if there's anything the bones could be good for agriculture spectral bolt charge I'll take that otherwise I'm not sure all this stuff needs to seeds if you want that Flint chard and yeah I'll just uh get some of this stuff transported over you want to put your minecraft bed next to my sleep sub giving me night terrors Jesus man what is this send out my goodness this is unacceptable I don't like that keeps happening but not cool with it um so we're about time I would say this might be a good time to wind things down I'd agree so anyway a shout-out to our do that's what I was trying to say and everybody wins also in that same description we'll be setting up a playlist and getting you so you can find that whole one other episode that we've already created or watching this in the past but if you in the future I guess then we will record it more in the past and everything so finally uh sweet dreams everyone don't let the night
