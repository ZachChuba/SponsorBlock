there is the t-shirt shipped in a box it is radius one screen around Mario are one screen around the pow-pow radius yeah so the way that I thought it was was like if something hits a POW versus if you throw it it will it like will destroy different in like a different radius so what's this gonna do that destroys both of them which I don't want I don't want that so how do I make it not destroyed both of them like that if I pick up the bomb and then I drop it since Mario touched it yeah that's so weird so since Mario like actively drop the bomb the radius of the POW is different is it around Mario though I guess I don't necessarily know but like like if I stand over here what I would do still just blows up that one so like is it like acting like where the POW is versus where the bomb is or where Mario up toad whatever toad Mario same thing weird multi Powell you multiple usages I had like more trouble with the word usages than multi powell run jump and make the pouch float off-screen then you can reload the pack I almost want to not read this I want a puzzle good we need to get the key but so there's some way to respawn the Pow Wow so when you throw it off screen like that it responds for some reason hold on whereas if I just if I just throw it it won't respond that is weird so as long as the Powell lands off-screen it's like the poopsies I spaghetti bet it's like the POW wave will still go off and destroy stuff so it still destroys those but it also gets like it D spawns but still destroy something that's cool well I just spaghetti that burro but we only I think that's all we need this weird off-screen pals are apparently infinite completely all the different setups using tracks just Auto pop like 15 in a row wow that's weird it's weird so like I said only powers I wonder so you could just throw stuff off screen and then suddenly it'll respawn even though it gets used up it's weird alright guys this is gentle pal by atius a quick tech showcase that works at SM III with thousand-piece which so maybe it only works at smb3 what do we got I will say that this person I don't how to say their name Talia's was like super super super like one of the one of the people who just like finds all sorts of amazing tech in Mario maker 1 glad to see the back in Mario maker toon I think that this is what I was supposed to do yeah so I've actually seen that one before for some reason you can grab it when it's up there like that okay move them on sugar how do you move a muncher with a power blog we just ago while holding a pal blog [Music] I have to not get rid of oopsies so since I have to be holding the POW block I can't throw it in destroy it so [Music] there's some way to like do this I don't know what I'm doing maybe I put it under here how do I do this I don't know what I'm doing yeah I can like down drop the pal but I can't kick it or at all oh wait you can kick it wait you can kick it oh because when you I'm actually doing a forward kick oh because for some reason the one way is this is not like it was in Mario maker one for some reason the one ways allow me to like re grab the POW maybe I do this sooner than I have been yeah that is weird all slightly I'm pushing it the wrong way that is weird you push it the other way wait do I put oh I probably use the note clock the jump thank you yes I know how do wait how do I push it the one I need yeah I needed to go upwards don't iron [Music] well I can't throw off how is this gonna help me how is this wait can i I can't do anything with it here stinky cheese Oh what am I supposed to do Oh what if I do that wait wait what if I do that hold on how do I always there's a way to get to bounce off my head I guess I have to be do I have to touch it from the side all right I have to just not be having any upward momentum I don't know there's some way for me to like yeah yeah see that that's what I want to do I can like Boop it to the side a little bit [Music] it's weird I think that I think this must be what I'm supposed to actually do [Music] panic wait this is Fitness's cheese too well what am I supposed to [ __ ] do i just how about if this is an independent that's also cheese come on this is pretty good to me yeah this looks like a good strategy [ __ ] I like the cheese yeah that's actually pretty fun thank you for your home [ __ ] get cheese mother Cordero I just stand on the right of the note block and drop the pow wait really ha okay ha I need my cheese victory first all my cheese victory birth stand to the right of the note block and drop the pow how did I not do that already or just stand to the right a towbar why did that happen what was that it's like what why did it like lon hold on I'm gonna let the like text go in why does that just happen does that just happen is that just Mario maker 2 also that hitbox is outrageous why does that muncher kill me like that I'm not even moving it doesn't happen when I do this though it does it's not possible to grab this okay I mean okay I can't grab it why does it just like fly away to victory that doesn't make any sense well that's my kick it alright if I kick it and it lands into that will it still blow up and I just want to know physics make no sense to me anymore that actually blows up if I it doesn't happen if I'm in the air though okay it doesn't happen if I'm in the air this feels broken to me you could actually do a pretty cool trick to that you can definitely catch up to it and jump off of it huh it's really cool I have no idea why that works that's really mean let me just see if his speed has potentially anything to do with in oh wait while I was running it actually didn't didn't do anything yeah it doesn't actually work while I'm running that's weird it only works while I'm standing still potentially yeah it only works if I'm standing still that is very weird that's why I didn't work for me that when I tried it before so you have me standing still that is very very weird and I like it I like everything about it but it's latching to the ground and tile where the semi-solid is yeah because there is a semi-solid below the below the music block and I bet you that semi-solid isn't necessary let's just check for like two seconds here if that sentry saw is necessary but it probably is that just happens that just that just [ __ ] happens and I don't we do it and oh yeah wait wait let's get rid of get rid of the semi-solid oh you can see it like tries no I still know you don't need this heavy solid you don't actually you did but it needs to be on a solid platform I think though because I like go too far over here see it stops so he's like the POW slides off of something and then it keeps its momentum when it touches the music block does it slide more on ice or does only mario slime or on eyes what if i make this an ice block what if i just have a few ice blocks here the pull up house slide more across and ice no it doesn't yeah it comes to a stop huh it doesn't do anything didn't do anything different what happens what happens if a spring hits a POW like this will it break it so it actually does Boop it so what if we put this over here and it like is lined up so that it will Boop it into it this is janky in the first place how this spring interacts with the POW it like doesn't even go for a minute look at that it's so weird it doesn't even go why Sheva oh give me that words you can actually make you can probably make something pretty cool out of this so he loses its momentum when when it hits that you know it keeps going yeah that's kind of cool you could make like a p-switch that's going back and forth yeah you could probably make some sort of a setup so that a piece which is like going back and forth between two of these and then you could yeah you could ride it you could you could do path slope out rides confirm yeah there's a way to make it go faster it would be pretty interesting let's try it in low grab we owe ya yeah you could absolutely you could absolutely do some get kick stuff around and jump off of it you could definitely make a cool level lot of those just Yoshi gonna flying in his egg oh he he hatches yeah why bye mother man he sinks like a rock as soon as he hatches in low grab that sky no funny see the egg is like low ground but the other stuff doesn't have low grow we yeah it's lose that slows down when it lands and that stops that's weird so when it comes off a conveyor it actually doesn't work at all yeah it just comes to a complete stop that's weird so when you drop it or when the spring hits it it goes flying but not when not on the conveyor does it so that didn't actually go flying but I might have been moving a little bit hold on this isn't working at all in low grab yeah and low grab it doesn't actually work right it only works it only works with the spring in low grab is that the right spot can't remember yeah that works yeah we yeah you could absolutely so it does work in low ground with a cannon does it work in not low grab and does it do anything different in the water what happens when it goes in the water how is this well we can try the poison let's also try harder it just sinks goes through the water somewhat not that useful Oh does it even what are the physics like firing underwater it's pretty much like feet oh my god that is weird what what is that what is that that is just weird why does it go faster when it goes above the water this is weird I don't know why I would do that we actually I just got I'm pretty sure that the next if I make a troll level I'm pretty sure I want to make a poison troll level because of the deep potential to hide stuff under the poison is amazing so like we do with poison you can't see anything [Music] dang it doesn't fire see I don't know how like I don't know how the poison works I don't know how the poison works is it too high how low can it be and habits don't work uh I guess it doesn't fire under water right when you're in the poison it doesn't ah candidates won't fire cannons won't fire under water under the poison I think if this falls will it hit the note clock I'll actually know how this stuff works yeah I see it still that still works huh that's don't work one of this do oh it sings chin okay yeah it sings what I don't think it's the right position oh no it like it's stuck in it it's weird yeah I like it gets like super stuck in it oops can't spawn in the poison it's like my my mind mines in this is weird precisely throw what happens when you throw a POW in the bottom corner of a large muncher we might lower the clear rate on this one bottom corner so it wants me to throw the POW from here potentially is it not possible to actually get through that gap isn't it possible to get through this it's not possible to just win with this maybe it's not but you could okay we're done we're done I'm sorry III think it I would really be curious to know it's possible to get through that though feel like if my feeling it actually is where do i what do I need to do here I feel like this POW is alive you're like this place that it's telling me to throw from is a lie or maybe the town needs to be in that oh I think that's what it is because they said the bottom left corner of the munchers something will happen what line yourself up with the tip of the arrow in the box made the tip of one arrow Oh that era oh there's an arrow right there Oh what why did that happen that time why did that have it that time [Music] hmm that arrow was actually really good when I lined it up so that there was like no pixels of space between me and the arrow it just worked I don't understand why that happens that's weird to the power you know the thing about this game that's just weird to me is it just feels like the physics do different things like everything is not consistent it's very weird um all right guys I need to go to sleep so let's do one more mushroom magic by Skeeter 37 mushroom magic we have a pow I don't wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what now why does that happen wait oh oh I was gonna say how do I get in that door but it's yeah this will just respond okay well that's weird duh that doesn't make any sense oh we're gonna do it again wait we can just put we just put Yoshi in that no wait I didn't do it wait I didn't do something right I didn't do something right can I get it I'm just curious I can't hit it maybe I was supposed to get hit no I don't I don't know what I was doing maybe I go back to here and stuff and stuff oh I can go back through here and get one of these I don't know if that's what I'm supposed to do though mm-hmm all right well this is not good oh come on Ruby wait I can just eat one of these I'm so stupid I could just eat one of those see that one is gonna it like goes faster yeah I think it's cousin oh wow you can actually fall through that I'll be fine everything is fine oh my god you need me what if I just hit if I just hit it really all I'm gonna do is Boop this up now is that actually going faster or is the game just totally broken okay what is this gonna do all its gonna do is touch it what how it just carries it through it it just carries it through it that my friends is a well programmed video game yeah I wonder if it doesn't do subpixels okay neither one of these goes what what wait so the first time they don't go through they net these never go through ok those never go through does the mole go through the mole doesn't go through but if I get the mole like running super fast yeah what if I get the mole running like super slow I don't know happens the moles flipping out dude the mole is flipping out he's got a mind of his own yeah I just it doesn't go through huh huh does that guy just never go through he just doesn't ever go through but choppy face does okay whatever well that was weird and it's such a way I guess slopes are prank like hard to program I don't know slopes are kind of messed up they don't go through the first time because they never hit a flat block hitting the block must align the subpixel to get past the slope so at some point in all of those situations they hit a flat one except that the only time that that wasn't the case is when I spit it with the oshi but something about spinning with the oh she must align it or something part of me wishes the pivot the edges of soft water you should make more levels hmm it was kind of low clear rate running start check this one out guna mas running start by ruas of what was that wait what the [ __ ] miss then well I'm I'm holding right and it dogs I don't know what is going on [Music] maybe I actually should get a running start haha yeah that'll actually work hold on let's see if I can like I'm gonna have to like change my grip actually can I push I want to test something real quick I can't put the I can't push the shoulder buttons alright here's here's the [ __ ] grip Stratfor this [ __ ] right now here's the [ __ ] grip stretch for this okay I want to like I got I'm hitting both jump buttons at the same time if you could see that [ __ ] I'm holding run here and I'm using two other fingers to hit the jump on Zhai don't know the right grip for this but maybe this will work yeah I don't understand why this happens oh that was but if you don't run good question no that's not the answer for a second world record what the [ __ ] how do you tour second world record this duck intentionally good quit good good idea [Music] it does nothing it does yeah look at the look at the thumbnail there's like a look at that there's like a gap right there using both jump bones is recommended see that is exactly what I tried to do [Music] Oh rhythm rhythm was the rhythm was the key rhythm was the key actually didn't spam as fast I just spam more rhythmically between the two them so weird also [ __ ] world record on that and who are sat there grinding that out to get that down to four seconds it's crazy uno mas breakdance by Astro want to break that block you'll need the right then left moves toe your time to shine your time shine over big big boy toad wait what am i doing which block are we trying to break are we trying to break are we trying to somehow break these blocks I mean I guess that's gotta be it what am i doing brave dance harder toad I think it's like telling me that I jump here and then push back though I feel like there's some weirdness about jumping into the ceiling and then pushing left but I don't know what it is I don't know what I'm doing am I getting this right somehow I'm gonna like wall cliff something something something break this block I don't know what I'm doing I'm wiggling wiggling you just start small oh that's about the spikes here okay that's not intuitive - okay oh then we some somehow when I grab that it will [Music] what am i doing oh this oh this blog maybe needs to be there oh my what what what I won't be done streaming soon SPO we already played a ton of levels well how did that work how does that make sense haha why didn't that just have it that makes no sense game happens if I like get this while I'm in this block oh hey you can break that one to believe it what do I do hey I think it's possible to actually get through the end of that big I don't know who do anything for your business as weird so the hitbox just gets like kind of weird wire transforming it seems like giant Mary can only break things on first landing in sm-2 yeah maybe the brief frames for crying the mantra merica clip into the block and land on the lower ones I think that's it basically his feet like he gained heat in bigan eights and his feet are in the wall and smashes the block below you this is a minimis level by juju magic hammer do not oh I said something he said do not break blocks or something oh yeah duh what did it want me to do oh okay I can break that oh hold Kenny it would have to read what it told me to do here do not break Brown blocks go got it just the brown yeah the hiccups are wrecking me right now so presumably we can break these no wait what what am i doing right now what is my what is my life oh yeah I don't know what I'm doing I do something with this I oh maybe I have to break the hold on anybody to do do something over here where this can actually but I've already failed it right great but what was I supposed to do so that somebody break the brown blocks and that launcher spawns and then it screws me I do this I don't know where I'm supposed to like break it from that's the big issue that I'm having right now and it's just to go out here or not hey yeah what am i doing no don't kill that damn it you know how to do this oh maybe I'm not supposed to kill the flaw yet nope nope put a bar behind you maybe it'll push you in [Music] I mean I'm curious what'll happen I I'm so bad at the Builder I just like don't know any ideas with the Builder okay wait what if we do something like those this is like hell me oh actually that look promising that actually looked promising maybe I swung too soon or didn't put it over quite so far I couldn't swing though well I'm stuck in that I am like legit stuck in that that's interesting huh lava craters said do something with blam hold on well I can't get over there then though it was do this something like that maybe something like that that was cool I don't know what I'm doing I have no idea what I'm doing you get that one heartbroken I don't know no no crates needed oh okay yeah the two crates are really confusing because I just don't know what to do with the very much you're Patrick you a sub I was gonna shoot about your collision detection Nintendo like to have a word with you what okay then I tried it but I didn't stand quite that far to the right I think I had to stand very far to the right and maybe there was some tricky timing a little bit is a 4% clearing huh that's boots anything about yen it's weird wait am I said how did you do it okay I'm gonna do it on the first try and get world record just watch [ __ ] I maybe won't do it at all yeah I just I just swung the [ __ ] hammer [ __ ] I don't actually know how I did it I think the timing has to be just right maybe I don't know oh there it is no idea man I don't know what the record is probably better than this okay one more about one more I mean uno mas through the platform another one by juju use the stone block to clip the river [Music] did you did you blew the platform how do we oh so I can't get through this now but we can go in the reset or so there's some way to clip this house uh what if I land further over here now that doesn't do it I wonder if I need to get like running speed right when it like right when the platform gets low enough for me to get in there oh I can duck actually - ha I got an idea what if I just simply do this and then actually time it well II think this is the idea though we go in we talk in and up like that maybe maybe that's not it I didn't cut me shoot maybe that's not it I thought that was it that was really Clippy and I still didn't go through it might be precise and then nothing looks precise juju can you just tell me if I have to dock or not but don't have the dark okay do you not duck okay so there is some way to just get this to work oh you just won at the corner you just have to get it right when the platform goes past it that is pretty janky it's pretty janky for me today oh wait there's one more in Avast ever mind clearly broken by mega magic do clear pipes have one hole or two wrong there are three holes hot let's go clearly broken oh it's clear pipes [Music] [Applause] hold up what [Music] there's no way that that is that what there's no way that that does that [Music] that is so broken if the pipes suck is real that is so broken Nintendo has left the chat yeah holy crap you can make a level that would be so hard for people to figure out how to beat holy [ __ ] dad the hit detection is so weird on that cryopreservation uh reach the goal while riding Yoshi I can get another yeah she want more yeah she's wait uh can I spit the air she down there then something-something it stays as an egg while its off-screen down there it stays as an egg did I just spit it yeah oh oh yeah I need the oh she to win whoa so something about being off-screen makes the Yoshi egg not hatch that is really weird that's bizarre Oh oh this is the Rialto this is the reload yes I thought it's got delete it this is all I wanted to play earlier in this dream ha ha someone said this is amazing controls hold down alright I'm holding down Dan is being held Oh God Oh side down lulz wait it's doing the door glitch putting it upside down level what's that gonna do what's that gonna do what's it gonna do oh gosh what's gonna happen oh my god I'm holding I have to hold up to duck up Docs everything is [ __ ] up and I have to hold down to go off into the vine oh I held up wait is it gonna do the glitch again no way what's this I was just hard to go in the door oh my god my brain is breaking right now I'm right brain is breaking oh it's so backward okay but I have to think about what I need to push okay and then that's really funny what brain wow that's so messed up that's really funny yeah the whole theme changed completely - that's it really funny glitch defender all right well - wait you just uploaded this you literally just uploaded this right now stop taking my shell one shell of a problem I reach the goal while wearing it dry bones show all right we have key do I want another key doors or door I want to go in here first oh this the hint waiver by the way it is net Mulligan no I don't want then I didn't mean to do that so all the axe is down there okay so what's the trick here just reach the goal overhanging dry bones oh and this is gonna hit me right oh I didn't hit me [Music] wait what was the I was it a just holding job we did it hit me or did I do it already did I do it right I what did I I let me read the hand yeah I don't know solved it and didn't know how easy all right I don't know what I did so let's try that again I don't actually know what I did let's read the hint so that it tells me what I just did if you want to figure it out yourself turn back no no this just Patrol oh this is yeah okay here goes hold jump through the door that's what I did you mother sudden red-room flying back who's that oh we're being punished for reading the hand or being punished I love you the most you weren't kidding wait what did it I'm so blind I thought I was in a different door or something was that the same door the whole time I thought it was a different one I thought I was in a different spot but apparently I'm not what the heck how do you do that did you have to like make the screen take up the hole or did you have to like go through the whole thing to take up that much space are we at the top of a vertical okay you do have to hold jump though that's interesting huh all right I think I have one more broken lift by a llz reach the goal without landing after leaving the ground all right so don't jump and land well what am i doing okay what's what forget it is that not the glitch or [Music] what what was i what was there what is Dora where's the door hint I think I did it right on the first try again by randomly just running fast over there I don't know why it were it didn't work the other time when it didn't work that time either how does this work the first time like here wait if I go immediately I think that's the only way that it works oh that's just fine what happens if I do this yeah I can't do it now how did I do I'd imagine anything different I'm not a gentleman I'm not doing anything different I'm not doing anything different is this like orangey how did I do this the first time I'm holding run let me try we'll try home run again is it the way you face yeah maybe you got a face right maybe got a face right did I do that the other time our face and right that's what it is you have to face right so if you face left it blows you differently hot I don't even know that's weird yeah I'm like left yeah it's if you have to face the right direction that's weird read the hinge with some kids yeah let's check it out just to be sure that that's really weird oh it makes you die but turn back yeah it is that is what it is huh that's weird I just did it I didn't even think I wouldn't think about I just did it on the first try it's weird something I've noticed if I Omega 2 is it's very weird how there's a lot of things that just babe differently in different situations like which way you're facing I don't know there's a lot of like weird things that have this game uh yeah I want to check this out more x equals nine and now we're supersonic heck yeah I want that heck yeah I want that Sean jank not Sean hips alter-ego despite what it might seem like oh this thing again is he gonna be different oh so we did one of these before but I feel like this might oh I'm assuming it's gonna somehow be something different wait did I just I didn't try to time that I didn't try to time this it's just lined up like that I did try to do that I mean yes yes that was 100% log hold on did I have to do that though I want to see if I had it yes yeah the problem that I have at the original version of this trick is that it was jank yeah see it doesn't do it every time I do wish that there was a weighted oh man I do wish that there was a way to do it every time hey yeah how you supposed to make now what's with that [ __ ] low anywhere [Laughter] just have a little later probably okay yeah I'm probably jumping on it to earlier yeah there we go all right I don't even need the win I don't even need the win all right this is piranha box by Sean jank the hitboxes are a little off [Music] my oh don't do that what my trying to do why is this bad all this setup I'm stuck what is this setup why why oh it gives me the key and I don't want the key oh that's right so in that pre okay I think I need to do this without I think I get it so last time I I thought that the I Freddy could duck in this mode I forgot that you can duck in this mode so I'm guessing that we have to get this in here in the pipe without killing the piranhas maybe there's a way to throw it past it or something yeah I forgot that you can crawl into any world so we weren't actually blocked off but what I do need to do is not get the key not a hundred percent sure how to do that it might be like this though yeah no I don't know that was my idea I don't know if I want a Doug maybe or what hmm let me make sure I need to do what I think I need to do but I'm pretty sure that I can't win when I have the key okay so let's just see what happens if we do do this and then it go through here we are gonna we are gonna go through this and presumably die yeah so we need to find some way to not have to find some way to not get the key I don't think you can like you get this in the top pipe just trying to mess around here who's he can sort of bounce on my head like this but it never really goes into the pie okay I feel like it's gotta be get super close to the piranhas but I don't know yeah throwing it real cup does it oh no no is it does it right that was it no no I'm gonna give son he's gotta like oh there we go good boxes how do they work hmm yeah asked to do is how the piranhas like leans okay I don't we not [ __ ] yourself by the way all right he's have to go into this wait oh [ __ ] I forgot you were supposed to take damage oh I have to do the high jump I'm so dumb surely we will quickly get it again oh [ __ ] up no early in de mawnin yo let's go it's actually not that bad now that I have the timing down so we're not so bad at all okay or do not take damage yeah yeah well it's kind of neat hitboxes make no sense ever but hey how's that different than any other Mario game oh my god that's a happy cat is that only if only this was all it took for us to be happy it's just some there's some nice screeches oh I wonder what it feels like to get your neck scratched as a cat I feel like we will not we will never know the joy she's coming for you Chad she's coming she's coming well yeah we're going in she's rush she's currently rubbing the webcam all right that is a heavy kick he is here her burn she's rubbing my microphone now and here we go she's typing in check hi I'm Ruby oh I'm getting I'm getting can't look at this she just does this she climbs on me Oh bad habit jack it's a hat you can't write there Jack the bacteria into a plan to create a plant-based vaccine I'd love to explain how it works my friends but I lack the knowledge you need listen I've nothing working that vaccines are good sting okay
