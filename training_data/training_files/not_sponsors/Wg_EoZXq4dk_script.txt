hey guys so in today's video I'm doing a Copic speedpaint and for this one I wanted to focus on a specific type of light source because I watched this Skillshare video about different light sources and I wanted to try one of them today's video is creativity learn something new so as you saw at the beginning of the video I was sketching in my sketchbook you will get a tour of that one in about a month from now I just kind of want to beef it up a little bit more because I haven't had a whole lot of time to sketch the last few months but now I have some dedicated sketching time earlier in the day and it's it's much better than leaving it to the evenings as a maybe so anyway I was sketching during a livestream that's why you see my face in the corner of the video so sorry about that once we get to the lineart stage it goes away but I was just planning out what the heck I was gonna do it did some warmups and then I was testing out different ideas because initially I drew a person was very rough a person holding a shawl or something behind them because I saw something similar in that Skillshare video but then I decided I wanted it more close-up on the face and then I was drawing this girl kissing a cat and I really liked it but also not really what I want for this I had to keep reminding myself that I wanted something that would work well for the lighting I had in mind because this is sort of like a practice for me so I wanted to keep it simple in a way and yeah pretty much I just had very strict requirements in my head but I didn't know initially what those requirements were but I figured it out and I decided to go with this pose here which is a little foreshortened you're seeing her from a top-down sort of view and she's looking up her hair is blown in the wind yeah and I knew I knew I was gonna end up liking a thumbnail and then blowing that up larger and using it as the base for a sketch which is why I was recording this live stream I knew I was like you know eventually I'm gonna find something I like but then I'm gonna be mad that I didn't record it so that is why I just straight-up used the live stream footage so yeah I scanned that sketchbook spread blew up the image in Photoshop made the background white and then printed it out and use that as the base for the sketch and then I transferred it on to my card stock using my lightbox and for the line art I'm using some prismacolor pencils and I'm using yellow and then a warm brown technically it's Tuscan red I was trying to really think ahead with this and really plan out the colors the light that sort of thing which is why I did a lot of sketching there's stuff you didn't even see like the very very initial planning is not even in this video but you'll see it in the sketchbook tour but yeah cuz with copics they're not opaque so you can build colors to be darker and darker but if you get too dark there's not a whole lot you can do to lift the color and so I thought you know what I need to make sure I know what I'm doing ahead of time although a tip if you do need to lighten some colors you can use stuff like gouache acrylic paint pens stuff like that that can sort of be last-minute help especially if you want to just add some little details at the end or some flyaways on the hair but there's already a background stuff like that but yeah I just I really wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing before diving into this which is why the line art is half Tuscan red half yellow it looks really weird when it's not colored but it makes much more sense when it is colored this is why it's good to have photo reference for the lighting because sometimes I'll use it for the anatomy sometimes for a pose but I never really look up reference photos for the light source like this for this one I didn't have a specific reference photo but I did have one in mind from this Skillshare video that I watched I'll actually insert a screenshot that's the one I kept in mind while I was working on this so she's being backlit from the Sun so she's facing away from the Sun the yellow shining through her hair but also the part of her face that's not facing the Sun yes it's in shadow but not an extreme shadow because she's still being lit by the area around her like the lights bouncing off the clouds and then down onto her face and that's causing blue highlights and then the shadows are a warmer color so I did a sort of an orangey peachy tone for the shadows so those are my requirements the yellow in the back then the blue highlights and orange shadows at least for the skin that's where it was more pronounced for this one something I picked up from that video was that when you do have a cooler light source the shadows tend to be warmer and I don't know why that's just never clicked with me in the past because I always think okay shadows are cooler than the rest of the coloring and I never thought it could be the reverse it's one of those things you just you never observed it yourself and you were never told that in any kind of lesson so when I saw that I was like what wait what I feel like this is something I should have known by now so it just clicked but also I felt like an idiot so this drawing is sort of an experiment testing that out although not every drawing needs to have a crazy lighting situation it really this does not even that crazy the effect is actually quite subtle especially with the blues and stuff but you know I dropped pretty cartoony so it's not always gonna have something super interesting for lighting but it's really fun to try this out I don't know why that video just got me so excited about it I'm just thinking of all the possibilities I have this book by James gurney about color and light and I've read it but it's one been a long time and - I never really sat down and tried to purposely put that stuff into practice so I'm just I'm just thinking of the possibilities I want to bust that book out and try something else new - for another piece of art so yeah it's it's pretty exciting because I've I felt a little bit limited with copics but you can get amazing effects as long as you know what you're doing ahead of time so one thing I did wrong but I fixed later after completely finishing the artwork is the hair when it's whoop sup towards her part I didn't make it follow the line of the hair like it doesn't swoop along with the hair like the part of the hair that swoops over her eyebrow I almost treated it like that was where her hair was coming from like this the lines in her hair all converge there and I'm like why they should have swooped upwards towards her part so I don't know why I did that maybe because my paper was turned because I turned it because the vertical lines are much more easier than horizontal lines but yeah I fixed it later I didn't even notice I did that until I was editing this video and so I had to bust out the art again and fix it up so you won't see that fix here in this video but it'll be fixed if you get a print or something initially I was gonna have flowers throughout her hair kind of Rapunzel's style where Rapunzel has flowers in her braids I was even gonna include some skinny braids in her hair but I decided against it I just wanted it more free-flowing and when I sketching some flowers it looks kind of weird because I also have petals floating around her and so it looked like the flowers were just also floating around her like yes there would be shadows where would connect to the hair that sort of thing or the hair pieces could be overlapping the flowers but it would still look like they're floating around and just touching her he was a little confusing so I decided to just eliminate that and instead have a couple petals that overlap with her hair and leave it at that although she does have the one flower tucked behind her ear but that's it I'm actually really happy with how the hair turned out because it's not just simple rim lighting like I've done in the past if a character is backlit it's like oh just a yellow outline on the edge of the hair but this has the light shining through the hair which makes it just look so vibrant I love the look and initially when I was planning this I was gonna do some color in the background it was gonna be yellow by her hair and then more like blue on the opposite side but I ended up leaving it white because it looks so good like that it just gave it that glow that it needed like there is this super intense bright light around her and behind her this art kind of gives me old-school Bailey art vibes I don't know if it's because the level of detail and the hair is more similar to how I used to do it I mean it kind of changes from art art sometimes I do more simple hair shooting other times I'd make it more strand II like this but I think also color wise it's reminding me of this drawing I did I think that video was back on the dead Kitty's head Channel but it was that girl leading backwards and there are these little things shooting through her in the blood splatter that's what that makes me think of but maybe because the colors because the pink and brown but also the hair kind of flowing I don't know and it also kind of makes me think of this drawing I did way back in the day when I had I say it like that's even further back it's not back when I did the patreon videos I did this girl with purple hair and this also reminds me of that for some reason I don't know why it's not that similar but me yeah it gives me old-school Bailey vibes in a good way I like it I really like how this art turned out I think that's all I have to say about this so I'm just gonna leave you guys with some music for the rest of this and I just want to remind you about
