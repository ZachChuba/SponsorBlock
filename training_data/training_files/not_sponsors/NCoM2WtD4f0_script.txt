just like yeah I'm down for being sucked off no you did not I swear to God I did [ __ ] horny yeah so I said yeah I would like to be sucked off it sounds very cool and it's like very politely so I go to the arcade place to play Crazy Taxi and I'm just showing out I'm playing it and nobody's really nearby and then all of a sudden like they said like they'd be there soon and like the little thread there and the threads like totally anonymous and so I'm like okay cool just gotta I'll just enjoy this cool game til my [ __ ] it sucked off then all of a sudden like you know people wait behind each other to play our cave games but all of a sudden there's like this creepy [ __ ] like old dude who's like 60 years old and I'm like he's way older than anybody else at night and he's just there I'm like oh okay well maybe he wants to play and then all of a sudden I'm like checking the phone they're like I'm not seeing any response I'm like wait a minute I was like what if what if they're not actually a girl I'm playing the game in the person just kinda like licking their lips like me in their hand is on the chairs fire shooting on my [ __ ] I'm waiting so I'm sitting there and I'm playing

looked at weird and like the time on the counter is running down and it's just like really time's running out exactly I don't know what to [ __ ] do and then all of a sudden they'd like to have me on the shoulder and they're like are you talking playing the [ __ ] game yet like I've been waiting for my turn for [ __ ] forever I was like oh okay and then I checked my phone and they're like where are you and by the Crazy Taxi machine that's my Dig Dug and that's the one across from the arcade place that was like oh thank god I was like are you a guy or a girl they're like I'm a man baby I was

life are you going to associate Crazy Taxi with that from now on kind of I'm totally less is every time you play Crazy Taxi you'll see this a lot of pictures she says she took a picture and sent it said she's like oh you're gonna love this one I'm like okay listen as a kid because I'm a million years old Smurfs is very popular in TV and I dressed as a smurf is a little kid and I had a little

this guy has these kids that are like acting up and yelling and just being shitty yeah and so what he does is he starts yelling at his kids I don't know he was saying cuz he was speaking some other language but he takes them over to me and then he puts one on one side of me and one on the other side of me to like separate them but using me as a divider I was so [ __ ] taken aback like I couldn't believe that a human being would like do that intentionally to another human being just stood up and walked away okay wish I would have [ __ ] said something to him though like I wish in that story I would have been like dude you cannot do that to people what the [ __ ] oh that's really bad I didn't I just [ __ ] got up and left and that is that I [ __ ] you wanna hear something [ __ ] rude that happened to me today yeah go for it I ordered food and when the lady got to the door she definitely had OCD or some [ __ ] because she was really upset she saw that I had an Amazon sticker on the door
