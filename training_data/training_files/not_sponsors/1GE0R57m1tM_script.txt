hey guys masterco x here and uh april fools we gotta be dealing with a certain thing that people have been asking me to do and i've really been putting it off because it was incredibly dumb but this is the day of being dumb so why not we're doing what if broly turned good but marcico broly's a movie character how dare you make him cannon um i think you'll find it's april the 1st april fools says we can and so we are i'm going to be taking certain liberties with the script try and mesh the movie and the tv series into one so we can be a little bit crazy here and given the fact that the beginning of this story comes from the 10th movie's broly second coming the only dbz movie i have yet to watch and i'm planning to keep it that way picture this it's after the eighth movie broly the legendary super saiyan broly's been defeated by goku somehow it involved green goop broly somehow managed to survive find a pod he was incredibly injured though to be fair i mean you know green goo does that to you and it somehow took him conveniently to earth i mean to be fair it happened to baby goku somehow ending up on earth so i guess it can happen twice as i've heard and seen in clips broly gets entombed in tons and tons and tons of ice however in this scenario i'm gonna have it so that means when broly lands there is a massive avalanche so broly does try and escape the pod but he is met with head injury after head injury so you know what happened with goku but there's no time to think about that he is knocked back into the pod it closes it gets in tune stasis status so yeah he's frozen in suspended animation and that's him done for several years as far as i can remember it's something to do with goten crying about not getting any apples or being really hungry for apples it somehow causes the ice to crack revealing broly escaping from the pod and taking goten by surprise however unlike the movie goten's crying doesn't send broly into a whirlwind of rage and thinking him he's a young kakarot he reacted to it because it was potentially someone who could support him so broly instead of just shouting out he's just going help hours later goten never heard him he just went back to get some apples i don't know broly's still crying out for help and eventually it's just very weak hope the following morning the del consent something weird going on in the forest which is broly by the way and feels like goten and trunks should go and check it out because they could take on pretty much anything when goten actually concentrates and focuses on the weird energy going on the forest he recognizes it to be something like of a saiyan but it's very weak it must be someone hurt when he eventually comes across the injured broly broly looks up and spots goten goten asks whether this guy's okay he doesn't know that this is broly because he doesn't know specifically what he looks like and instead of getting angry at goten and going off the handle like in the movie he just looks up and just goes kakarot goten is aware of goku's name kakarot but isn't familiar with the actual background behind it he's just going no i'm go 10. go turn and then passes out goten then begins to panic not knowing what to do has this guy died is he just unconscious what's he gonna do he he could take this guy back to vidal but she might be all lame and stuff and this guy might not be able to be trusted or something like that so he's got to think of something else so instead of getting videl embroiled in all of this he rushes back to the camp at full speed and wakes up trunks going trunks chunks you gotta come help this is something really really happening in the thoughts you go check it out and trunks weird stuff ah cool i'm really bored anyway trunks is willing to go but he's kind of suspicious when goten asks him to grab a blanket some food and things that they could prepare a little fire broly is still unconscious at this point but he is breathing barely and goten wraps the blanket around him and trunks prepares the fire and they kind of get some food cooking broly briefly stirs from his slumber after the smell of food calmly eats some of it regaining some of his strength but then falls back asleep again goten thinks that they can't leave him here like this he might just freeze and die a starvation he doesn't know what to do so goten then suggests that maybe he should take him home and trunks is going like i don't know goten i don't think your mom's gonna be really happy about this guy suddenly going into your house i've got like a forest nearby our house and we just leave him there and i can bring in food every day they pick up broly and what remains of the food and supplies bail on videl and actually head to goten's place they safely make sure broly's okay and then walk back to goten's house and ask gohan whether he has any of those senzu beans knocking around during goten and gohan's training because they do do that from time to time gohan makes sure to have a small supply ready sure enough gohan does have some left albeit just a couple as broly regains his strength he's able to sit up for a little bit wrapped up in the same blanket all dazed and confused grateful for goten's presence but unable to really process what's going on goten and trunks are getting really excited because this guy can talk they're asking all kinds of questions where he is who he is what he came from all this kind of stuff is he good is he a saying can he go super saiyan and stuff like that broly doesn't know how to think about all of this he only knows two things as of this point he remembers that his name is broly and that he has to find someone called kakarot kakarot give broly answers kakarot help broly goten take broly to kakarot goten gets a little sad about this because unfortunately kakarot or his dad is currently dead and he's never met him before broly is saddened by this news because one of the things that he remembers is kind of fruitless but then goten thinks well we could bring him back with the dragon balls and stuff i suppose because goten doesn't really remember the fact that goku chose not to be here rowley like planned tiny kakarot goten in a fit of excitement then whips back to their house and asks gohan where the dragon radar is now gohan's getting really suspicious you know first senzu beans and dragon radars why goten doesn't like confrontations and immediately kind of gets all sheepish he then retreats from the room gohan thinks that he should start keeping an eye on goten because he's being really shifty at the moment and he wants to make sure that he and goten don't get in trouble with their mother however chichi begins to notice something weird in goten as well because he's really off of his food he's not eating as much as he used to and he's a half saiyan remember but little does she know goten is actually packing away in a small bag and then taking it to broly to feed it him in the forest as even more days pass broly regains his strength and eventually he is able to fend for himself so goten doesn't need to do that but a lot of this time chichi gets very concerned but that being said broly still appreciates the visits with goten and trunks they're his tiny friends and the recovery isn't just his physical strength either those senzu beans that goten gave him was also really good in helping his mental capacity regain strength as well so he will be able to improve his lexicon the way he speaks it'll come back to him however things begin to take a turn for the worse when gohan finds out that videl was bailed on by their kids when they went to natalie village why would they leave videl all alone in the middle of a village like that for no reason so he immediately confronts goten and demands an explanation like i said before goten doesn't really like confrontations so after trying to be all stubborn and ignorant he eventually coughs up and says that they found something and it's in the forest and they wanted to make sure it was okay and offers to take gohan to it when goten approaches broly broly can sense goten's presence and immediately comes into plain view thinking that ah goten you come back but when gohan strikes eyes bomb broly he's just horrified broly go ted what have you done gohan immediately powers up to super saiyan and broly cowers in fear gohan then prepares an attack trying to finish broly off but then goten stands in the way but gohan is extremely determined this is the same broly that he vegeta piccolo trunks and his own father tackled seven years ago he is not gonna let this guy get away with this this is the perfect chance he's weak he's feeble he doesn't know how to go super saiyan so it seems so yeah it they could be rid of him once and for all goten then looks to broly and then to gohan he's absolutely confused but resolute in protecting his new friend if he were truly evil like gohan claims it to be would he really allow goten and trunks to survive when they first saw him you know that kind of stuff gohan pauses for a moment thinking about this and then broly says his piece broly friend broly need to find kakarot kakarot has answers broly's beginning to feel a little threatened and this triggers some inner power inside of him he can feel it rising and rising goten consensus and begins to panic he turns around to broly trying to calm him down judging by goten's behavior gohan can sense that his little brother's telling the truth but remains focused and determined to stick his ground if this guy truly is different from the monster that i remember tell him to stand down now brody then looks to goten and then to gohan and immediately he powers down he reverts back to his base form and then walks calmly back into the forest goten then turns back to his brother and looks mad you scared him he was just afraid he was trying to protect himself how could you he doesn't remember a thing before he found him the only thing he remembers are his name and to fight dad dad after much debate and twoing and throwing gohan offers to keep the secret and not tell anyone else about broly's presence on earth because if he did tell anyone then the likes of vegeta and pretty much everyone else would descend upon broly and destroy him the pair settled their differences and then head home with goten just turning around one more time and going broly before walking back home for the next few weeks things remain pretty placid gohan and goten are able to keep the secret between them chi chi's suspicions calm down just a little bit with gohan coming up with the most ingenious idea saying that well goten is going to the forest because uh he likes to learn about wild animals yeah we're going on nature walks yeah mom broly's mental capacity increases further he and goten are now really good friends gohan that's gonna take a little while since you know he threatened his wife and all that broly trusts goten enough so when goten asks him to remain in the forest and to stay there unless there's an emergency broadly complies however goten doesn't bank on something quite big happening the 25th world martial arts tournament it starts off all right with everyone preparing for the event and stuff you know they're thinking it's pretty cool goten wants to take part in the junior division but then suddenly the news comes out that goku's gonna come down for the day and meet everyone goten is going to get to see his dad for the first time goten doesn't tell broly though because he knows that broly will get all jumpy and stuff like that so when goku actually descends to earth and everyone's at the arena broly then senses something remembering going kagarot kakarot but then he remembers goten saying to never leave the forest unless in an emergency but but this is an emergency kakarot's here this is really important broly chooses to break goten's promise and actually leave the forest to head off in search of kakarot it's going to take a while for broly to actually get to the arena so the tournament occurs as it would do in the original story goten so wrapped up in his fight with trunks and all that and all those escapades he doesn't sense broly approaching at all however since gohan's not really doing much right now he can sense broly approaching but before he can actually pull goten aside and actually tell him that why is broly coming here spopovich then encounters videl and that whole thing happens yay everyone is distracted especially gohan so more and more of the events that happen at the tournament occur so we get spokovic and yamu draining gohan and all that shin making himself known the gang having to head off to babadi and this is the moment when broly's about to actually head down into the arena area itself he then spots several key trails heading upwards and away from the arena they're all heading off to barbados spaceship so broly just thinks well that's where they're going and kakarot's with them now goku can send something weird approaching from behind them but they have to remain focused because shin's trying to tell them stuff that's important to the mission oh sorry i just there's a thing that there's no time for that goku listen as the gang lands a safe distance away from babadi and dabura broly then lands a further distance away witnessing the event he's trying to figure out when the best time is to actually talk to kakarot they all witness the moment when babadi collects the energy and then blows up spopa viciniamo as a result broly's really really excited now he can feel the energy just pumping up inside of him he's getting more and more impatient he doesn't like to wait he wants bobbity to stop his jabbering all of this hyperbole he's getting really bored of this he's getting angry eventually brolius had enough he powers up into super saiyan form and immediately charges at deborah and barbady just shouting kakarot goku immediately recognizes that voice and is going like broly what what the as gohan tries to fill in the gang about the situation dabura immediately tries to counter broly but for those of you who actually saw the movie you might remember that broly's super saiyan power could easily outclass super saiyan 2 gohan and since super saiyan 2 gohan could hold his end against broly then broly is going to pound de bora after a brief encounter de bora is gone and broly squares up against barbady you little potato head man you talk too much he fires a huge omega blaster which not only takes out barbady and the energy container but a good portion of the vessel that lies underground everybody is stunned what just happened well broly basically just stopped the boo saga from happening he's just standing in front of the z fighters wiped out the whole thing the ship's gone booze eggs been vaporized and they're completely in disbelief but thanks to all the general healing and the sense of beans that broly has consumed over the last few weeks he's actually managed to regain some of his mental faculties including the ability to speak and not just say the word kakarot and he can actually control his power to some degree i mean a bit more than he could before but that doesn't stop vegeta sending a punch in his direction you think that goku would protest this saying no don't do it he didn't do anything but goku kind of just lets him do it all the while vegeta is congratulating himself because he's got a punch on broly's cheek and he's thinking ha i showed him but broly does not react to this and screams angrily because yeah he may be a bit more placid and looser than he was before but dang man that punch hurt he immediately powers up and is about to retaliate against vegeta when goten and trunks having finally sensed broly's power after the whole mighty mask incident never happening come to try and calm the situation down in fact they get so stuck into the moment that they actually get hit by both broly and vegeta goten gets slapped by broly and trunks gets a whopped by vegeta vegeta is completely bemused as to why trunks is there in front of him and then broly is completely aghast that goten looks hurt and he did it broly would be very very aware of what goten is feeling and so if goten is hurt then broly is going to be going oh my god little goten are you okay yeah come on goten's the one that gave him a chance and kind of nursed him back to health vegeta then demands an explanation as to why the boys are here and why they protected broly it's at this point once the kids have regained their footing that they tell the truth everything broly arriving on earth him being want by sheet of ice then finding him not being able to talk them nursing him back to health the whole lot after hearing this goku rubs his head in kind of a sort of empathic way and not his head semi seriously yes and like going okay that kind of makes sense still with a serious expression goku walks up to broly and grabs broly's face but says nothing the two of them are staring each other intently nobody knows why goku's doing this but piccolo does he can sense what's going on he can remember read minds goku is trying to test broly broly's major reason for getting all angry is goku if broly's truly changed if he sees kakarot right in front of his face and does nothing then what he's saying and what the kids are saying is true and if broly does react and decides to fly off the handle everyone's ready to retaliate but nothing happens broly's just staring back at goku and he just says quietly kakarot i found you goku then asks what he means by that broly then looks dejected and just goes i don't know he doesn't remember anything else now and he's now got nothing to strive for because he's now found kakarot and he's not providing the answers so now what goten and trunks then walk up to goku and broly and say that not throughout the entire time that they took care of him did he fight back against them gohan then steps up too and confirms that this is true because if it had happened gohan would have taken him out piccolo then whips around and is shocked that gohan would hide this information gohan why would you hide this from us this doesn't like you gohan nods and say that it's true he would have acted like that but he trusted the kids they they seemed really serious about this so he wanted to have faith in them broly's may still not be trustworthy at this point he's got a lot to prove but right now he's not an imminent threat the next person to utter protestation is shin the supreme kai at this point he's just been standing there completely shocked and horrified that majin buu babadi deborah one of the higher up demon gods is just gone but he still states that despite broly taking them out he cannot be trusted because he was the guy that destroyed south galaxy that's indeed true but broly has no recollection of this gohan then asks is there any way to bring the people that died in south galaxy back or maybe the entire galaxy be regenerated well i mean it depends if a particular set of dragon balls were strong enough it might be able to do it if dende could train in some way to increase his strength and therefore the effectiveness of the dragon balls then it could happen in the meantime though they got to remember that broly is still a thing he's standing right there they need to figure out what to do with him and before goku goes back to the other world he thinks that right now broly is trustworthy enough to at least not have to live in the forest and given the fact that he's not in his bulky form anymore he should be able to blend in with the populist just fine broly is very thankful for this gesture but he feels like he would be imposing and that he doesn't deserve it he's caused so much trouble for the group that they shouldn't be this kind to him but it's at this point that vegeta stuns everybody around them and says that he will take broly in what but the prince has method in his madness he states that broly is a saiyan and therefore his subject if anybody should be responsible for whipping this guy back into shape and making him a loyal saiyan it should be the prince and besides if he goes rogue then vegeta thinks that he'd be more than powerful enough to wipe him off the face of the planet he could take him out in a flash a final flash after witnessing vegeta's stern gaze and serious intent shin is not one to question this and decides to allow broly to be under vegeta's care well i mean care i mean you know care in the loosest sense of the word he does weigh up the fact that broly did i mean inadvertently take out majin buu who was the greatest threat to universe 7 in existence in countless millennia oh he's gone now so that that's a good thing right and so this odd living situation begins broly takes up residence at capture court with bulma warming up to him quite quickly given the fact that when broly's in his base form state he's quite demure and polite and formal he kind of reminds bulma of future trunks in a way and i feel like given time and broly's mental state healing more and more he would actually turn out to be a rather nice guy and the fact that people have faith in him instead of his father trying to control him and suppress his feelings given his uncontrollable power the fact that paragus couldn't even try without using magic it builds confidence in the guy broly is becoming more and more at ease with himself kind of like how kale progressed in a way it just took someone to believe in them to become a better person yeah vegeta is also rather clever in how he talks to broly he's not going to talk about the whole fact that his father the king tried to kill broly as a child he doesn't want to reopen that chestnut in time broly begins to learn more and more about earth's culture and feels more at ease with himself actually going out into it he actually has quite a lot of clothes that future trunks had during his time there bulma decided to keep them instead of giving them away because who knows future trunks might come back for a visit sometime and if they're not being used then broly can have them and since present trunks is there goten comes to visit too which pleases broly greatly and this is at this point that vegeta hatches another plan another reason why broly should be there broly has this legendary power that vegeta never had so therefore if he could figure out how to actually attain said legendary power and actually use broly to his own ends then maybe vegeta could learn this legendary power too which could be even stronger than the super saiyan 2 power that he managed to learn and therefore he could be the true princely legendary super saiyan he'd be the true legend not this brat who got lucky by chemical chants vegeta can then be the strongest saiyan but little does he know about the whole super saiyan 3 power because goku never showed that in the end because he didn't need to yeah oh vegeta's gonna be crushed and another reason for all of this to happen is that goku is in the other world he's not coming back to earth in his eyes after they actually let broly out of hiding and he's actually become quite strong in fact keeping up with vegeta there's no reason for goku to come back and besides fortune tele baba they've used up that 24-hour time period and the elder kai hasn't been released from the z swords therefore he couldn't offer his life essence to goku so yeah goku is kind of stuck there until well they wish him back but he doesn't want to come back so yeah goku's not coming back guys so with goku deciding to stay away from the planet it's vegeta and broly becoming the true bastians of earth and protecting the world however bulma doesn't take too kindly to the fact that vegeta is using broly to his own ends and constantly insist broly that he should get out into the world and explore it you know experience life instead of being contained and trapped and caged by people because vegeta is basically doing what his father did and broly takes to this rather well despite being apprehensive and unaware and not street savvy he does go out into the world and he does enjoy it he appreciates a nice walk around the parks and streets of west city every now and again now that he's walking around sporting capsule called branded clothing he just feels like another guy he's just like everyone else he can just blend in he doesn't stand out anymore he belongs somewhere and where am i going with this you're saying i'm taking the android 16 route 16 was a big guy who felt like a misfit because he wasn't programmed properly he felt like an outcast he wasn't a full android but he wasn't a full human he was somewhere in between he like broly now had a clean slate in order to try and appreciate and figure out stuff on their own had android 16 actually survived the cell games and not been killed by cell i feel like he would have gone off into the world and become a zoologist and discovered all of nature he had just gone off to his own devices and discovered every single bird that there is out there broly is android 16 here he now has a planet in order to call home something deep down in his mind welcomes this feeling there was that disconnect between living and actually living that was there but it's not anymore he's got somewhere where he can just truly live they don't have to hide anymore he doesn't have to hide anymore he can truly live and i think that's where we'll leave things for now this has basically been an establishing part going forward into dragon ball super part three simply put because of broly's intervention the buu saga never happened other things to take stock in is that goku is still in the other world and gohan never discovered his ultimate power also vegeta never went through his margin stage his final atonement and capping off his character arc so he's still got a little bit ways to go now but i feel like he can actually get to it just it takes a little longer he also never went under the resentment that made him become margin vegeta and now that goku's not there anymore he therefore is the strongest on the planet which give him some comfort and catharsis any ill feeling that he had is effectively gone he feels pretty happy with his lot he can whip around broly whip him into becoming a good student and be subservient to him and also potentially learn a new power so it's all coming up for vegeta he is the top dog now we continue the story after the buu saga with broly being properly integrated into life around capture core effectively becoming trunks bigger brother and he's very much like an android 16 figure in terms of stature as well as his placid nature yeah because broly is a big boy he even managed to find an interest in martial arts he got all of this interest not from the prince but from the many walks he takes around west city he will walk around the parks and see people taking tai chi and wanting to really get into it but not really having the courage to actually go up there and ask can broly join in the class too eventually he'd realize that master roshi and krillin are very much into martial arts as well as meditation and stuff like that i think he would very much go to kame house and ask master roshi to help him learn the basics in that manner broly would much become like goku in terms of embracing martial arts into his culture and life instead of just relying to brutish tactics of just basic punches in the four years between the end of the buu saga and the beginning of super broly has now pretty much recovered his mind entirely on the diet of senzu beans and you know basic peace time he's even managed to find a job at capture club as a courier because you know he can fly he's really quick like that i mean that is when he isn't being trained by vegeta speaking of vegeta sure enough all of this training with someone who is quite strong almost as equally as strong has actually paid dividends for vegeta he is much stronger than he was at the beginning of super in the original story that being said we've got to turn our attention to the song family because right now they're feeling pretty dejected because you know goku when he had the chance to come back decided to stay dead so that's a real kick in the teeth you know despite all of the peril that we saw with babadi and dabura thinking hmm even with goku not around there was trouble and that was the reason why he chose to stay dead so it wouldn't matter which way he was oh none of that compelled to goku so he decided to go back to the afterlife and perfect his super saiyan 3 power in secret but that being said it does mean that he has been able to master the super saiyan 3 power thanks to the limitless well of power and the afterlife and he can now use it with very little stamina being used so it's kind of like a perfected super saiyan 3. apart from those things i just mentioned things are relatively similar to what they are in super right up to the point when beerus arrives on earth and actually wakes up trying to find the super saiyan god as can be expected beerus can pretty much go wherever he wants in universe 7. so he ends up going to king kai's world and finding goku through the prophecy and all that like in the original so that doesn't change he is able to find goku as the potential saiyan candidate that might be the super saiyan god that he dreamt about just a few minutes ago despite being stronger now than he was in the original story goku is still no match for beerus yeah he was able to be defeated in two punches let's just say maybe uh four he's still womped by the kitty cat who then goes off to find more saiyans on earth and this is when goku realizes that yeah i better go back to earth so you have to try and hatch a plan to get back there using the rules that are supplied to him things cannot be good at beeruses after saiyans and goku wasn't able to take him down on the matter of earth beerus arrives on the same day as bulma's birthday party like in the original story he does the usual thing of degrading vegeta telling him he's useless vegeta being scared and then bomber finding them all and asking beerus to take part in the festivities because it involves food so of course the kitty cat's not going to say no the only thing i'm going to be destroying today is the buffet selection come along reese broly then spots beerus but he doesn't put two and two together had he not received amnesia and he still turned good he might have been aware of beerus thanks to all of the things that paragus might have been mentioning paragus might have been aware of beerus because he was part of king vegeta's court everyone would know about beerus but since broly doesn't remember everything when he sees beerus he doesn't really twig that this was basically the guy who doomed planet vegeta that nugget of information is lost to him unfortunately one big thing in goku's favor though is that there is no majin buu to spoil the party without the big pink blob beerus is able to get his fill on pudding entirely thusly his time spent at bulmer's birthday party before goku arrives to try and save the day is pretty amiable and he gets on with everyone because you know he's getting food and he loves the food in fact the food is so good that he forgets about the super saiyan god entirely that is until said saying that he for earlier arrives to try and get his revenge wait wait wait wait wait massacre how exactly did he do this well it's all down to thanks to the heavenly world of dragon ball what they love technicalities since goku went home a little earlier back in the buu saga he hadn't used all of his 24 hours up so he went to fortune tele baba who then agreed to take him back for a few hours so he could save the day and then when they realized that beerus was about destroyed the only planet that had beings that could protect universe 7 from the likes of evil doers then you know this was a high priority king yama just fast tracked that one the saying is extremely perplexed as to why the god of destruction hadn't destroyed earth yet or hadn't taken anyone on yet but everyone else is even more mystified as to why goku just suddenly showed up he hadn't been planning an announcement or anything or coming they thought he was basically dead until they wished him back with the dragon balls which was never goku shouts out to beerusa he isn't done yet with the fighting that they had and he's ready for round two vegeta then runs up to goku and just tries to get him to calm down trying to say that beerus isn't here to do anything bad but all of this is distracting beerus from food thus making him agitated meanwhile broly is very conflicted in terms of emotions he's extremely happy to see kakarot again but at the same time he's confused as to why vegeta is being so cautious because he's never cautious so yeah broly is very very perplexed and puzzled and all the other hyperboles that denote confusion beerus is getting extremely annoyed with vegeta and goku bickering so he slaps the pair of them trying to knock some sense into each other because he's getting very very frustrated and oops he better not have done that this angers broly we all know what happens when broly gets angry he shouts kakarot and goes big and after all the training he's done with vegeta he's able to control this legendary power better than ever but right now two of his friends are in trouble so he must do something broly lets out a massive mighty roar that catches beerus's attention for a nanosecond then when whis is looking up from all the food that he's eating he recognizes broly the big legendary beast and goes like hmm isn't that the being that tried to destroy south galaxy all those years ago huh neat and then goes back to his food broly's power is now maximum once more and he then launches an attack on beerus which actually connects quite effectively it then sends beerus spiraling into the air before broly unleashes an omega blaster right in beerus's direction it envelops beerus singing his clothing but otherwise leaving the goddess destruction relatively unscathed this gets beerus thinking i see this power might this sin be the actual super saiyan god and not that little time waster over there the cat powers up a little to see whether aetherius is right and engages in much more combat using about you know ten percent of his power oh dear ah okay yeah broly probably goes down like them oh well false alarm you see the thing with godki being untraceable broly couldn't get a handle on the being's power so he just went in hell for leather was reckless and therefore you know he was done for he's been used to fighting vegeta who has ki and then fighting someone who doesn't yeah as that fight's been going on goku and vegeta are trying to figure out what on earth they're going to do pure strength isn't going to be able to win this battle so they're trying to think well he's going on about super saiyan gods they don't really know anything about them who might know um shenron to do so vegeta gets in the way of the fighter beerus and broly and says to beerus that they might be able to find the super saiyan god after all since beerus was mildly entertained by this big brute fighting him as well as seeing vegeta groveling much like his father he is more willing to actually comply with this request because yeah he's not as angry as he was in the battle of god's movie and arc everyone wishes on the dragon and they find out about the super saiyan god ritual they need six saiyans in order to enact it and luckily for them this time they do have six saiyans and thusly videl's pregnancy remains a secret well a secret to everyone except dende the ritual goes off without a hitch because broly's heart is purified over the years of recovery goku then becomes a super saiyan god has his fight with beerus but it does yield better results than the original this is all thanks to goku's much more intense and less interrupted training whilst he was in the afterlife it means that beerus has to use more of his power to actually fend off goku in the super saiyan god form even when the saiyan falls down to super saiyan he still has to use more power the fighter is actually a challenge for beerus and he has to use about 80 percent of his power instead of the allotted 70 as was actually sourced in the original this leaves beerus even more passionate than he was before this mortal who's only just discovered god ki could actually give him a run for his money him a god of destruction perfecting his craft over hundreds of thousands of years and then this guy just comes along and almost beats him and had that other being become the super saiyan god then he might have been able to actually beat beerus and he can't be having that he's got to make sure that these guys are on his side having immortal best of god of destruction it'd be total anarchy so in that regard the cat got extremely lucky he calls a halt to the proceedings and says to them all that he's not done with them yet and once he returns he will figure out what he's going to do with them and with that whis whisks him away take out in hand and everyone collapses to the ground tired as hell once everyone's been able to recover a little bit broly looks to cakra and asks in the big question are you going to be coming back to us kakarot goku looks to everyone and then up to the sky where beerus had just been he nods and says yeah i'm coming back and this is only because there is a bigger challenge in the real world other than the afterlife so he thinks that he can come back it's time to gather the namekian dragon balls and that's where we're going to leave things right now with broly's inclusion in the story beerus's introduction into the group is much more cordial and less disruptive than it was with march of buu there because you know pudding plus it means that everyone in the same party becomes stronger including goku all of this extra muscle is rubbed off on everyone else i think too so that's kind of cool we continued the story right after we did in the last part with wiesenbeerus heading home discussing the events of what transpired when dearest slightly wakes up because of all the buffeting going through the speed of light throughout the galaxy while they're talking we still actually remember something that went down not that long ago maybe just like a few years ago but well i mean a fused relative with a god and an angel but they remembered that south galaxy was just not there anymore and it was very very odd that that would just suddenly disappear and beerus had nothing to do with it there was talk going around that it was a saiyan that actually did the deed so when beerus finds out that all of this destruction came from one mortal he's even more interested to get these saiyans here but you know he's obviously got to play coy you know he's got a he's got a reputation to keep up meanwhile back on earth goku and broly are catching up after lost time and goku is absolutely mesmerized with how strong broly's become in the intermediate time but at the same time vegis is kind of resentful that this punk just showed up and kind of just made him the third strongest saiyan here but at the same time vegeta's are kind of grateful that earth wasn't destroyed and that beerus suddenly disappeared and is no longer a threat at least for the time being nevertheless goku is determined to help make broly fix what he did before he actually became a good boy and that is to bring back south galaxy why am i talking about this here well i think that broly now needs a new goal not just to get stronger or to control his power but to right the wrongs that paragus kind of almost instilled in him and that is to revive south galaxy back to the way it was you know before the cell games they know that the earth dragon balls can't bring back a whole galaxy but the namekian dragon balls might be able to do that so goku and broly head off together via instant transmission to try and ask the namekians whether it's even possible perunga is then summoned and goku makes the wish that he wishes for south galaxy to be restored along with its people but sure enough perunga then says larger's beyond my power and that comes as a shock because at this point in the story peronga has never denied a wish based on the fact that it was beyond this power shinran does that all the time it's become a bit of a meme but for perunga the only reasons that wishes haven't worked with him is because either people didn't need the wish or goku was just like no i'm good i'm good goku and broly are left disappointed with the latter being particularly bummed out he thought he'd be able to atone for his sins back when he was just considered a monster and was completely uncontrollable or paragus at least didn't try and stop him when peronga asks if they have any other wishes that they might be able to consider goku then actually uses this point to ponder for a moment there might be something after all he then asks perunga whether it would be possible to transport the both of them to where beerus and whis are located beerus is pad perunga like shenron is kind of nervous at this proposition why would two mortals want to go and actually disturb the destroyer god of all things it's basically something he could do but why would he have to do it the namekians are absolutely stunned at what they're hearing and perunga is just like going uh he doesn't want to hear anymore yeah fine whatever you go and do it i'm just gonna leave now he doesn't want to be sticking around and having beerus come to him saying hey you dragon were you actually responsible for disturbing my slumber looks like i might have to destroy you yeah perunga's going like out now goku needed this wish because at this point in the story he cannot sense divine key so he wouldn't be able to use instant transmission in the typical way he's going to need a bit of a help reese's cordial and beerus is happy to see them but he's got to keep up appearances so he is irritated that they dare actually come to the world of a destroyer god unannounced and uninvited all things yeah goku is completely unfazed his eyes are on the prize so he actually says oh yeah i'll be able to give you a free supply of earth food for the rest of your life just so on the condition that broly and i could train with whis and you beerus ponders for a moment making this seem like it's the biggest decision of his life but on the inside he's elated he didn't even have to go back to earth to ask them they came to him oh so convenient he can sleep for a little bit longer whis will come for them when he's ready just as long as they've got some food ready to go when he gets there everything should be fine goku and broly are indeed excited but broly feels a little bit guilty about all of this for a sudden he then asks weeks two questions first whether vegeta would be able to come and join them because yeah as saiyans they want to bond and make sure everybody's strong and not to mention for the fact that vegeta and broly did train a lot if broly went behind vegeta it would be really unfair and secondly is there any possible way that south galaxy could be restored and whis is just going oh that's easy we can use the super dragon balls yeah i think because of all of this and broly asking the revelation of the super dragon balls comes slightly earlier than it does in the original story but at this point these aren't your average size balls they are planet sized and there is no meaningful way of being able to track them at this point bulma hasn't made the radar yet whis will look into it after earth food is given to him it's a very big important negotiating chip with that the two saiyans then head home and prepare for training with vegeta being told about this and included and he is jumping on the opportunity months pass and gohan and videl give birth to pan and goku broly and vegeta are well into their training with whis like in the original frieza is brought back to life thanks to sorbet and tagoma and they are ready to bear down on earth with frieza wanting to get revenge on goku and completely unaware of the inclusion of broly in the proceedings the thousand soldier battle takes place like it does in the original with gohan leading the charge right up to the point where he reaches his lowest step in the story at least narratively speaking with the unleashing of his power this sends a message to the three saiyans on beerus's planet that it's time for them to come home and face up against frieza sure frieza is surprised to see vegeta and goku here all of a sudden but who's this other punk and monkey he's completely unaware of broly's existence broly having been told about what frieza is like is aware that he needs to actually big himself up he states that he is the legendary super saiyan the one who destroyed south galaxy even though it's a bitter pill to swallow he's not exactly proud of it but he's gonna make it seem like he is it doesn't exactly work on frieza but it does work on sorbet between the time that frieza was offed around the future trunks saga to where he is right now sorbet and the rest of the frieza forces what was left of them was scattered about and they would have heard about south galaxies suddenly disappearing and it had something to do with the legendary super saiyan or some kind of big entity so sorbet would be well aware that if this is the guy who took out a whole galaxy oh dear this makes sorbet absolutely petrified he is then going to freeze lord frieza you better not mess with him he is the legendary superstar galaxy at this point in the story he's basically resurrection frieza very one-dimensional and very ruthless he's not the freezer that we currently know from the broly movie and in super frieza is not gonna take this insubordination and despite the plan that sorbet and frieza have frieza is not gonna hear any more words about a monkey destroying a galaxy he takes out sorbet with a hit and i think frieza would do that because at this point he would not want to hear anyone challenging his opinion goku then decides to take frieza on first and showcases the power of super saiyan blue with frieza retorting with the power of golden freezer goku is determined to end this fight quickly because he knows that frieza will stop at nothing to try and get revenge on him and destroy his home world of earth with frieza's plan gone with sorbet trying to take goku out surreptitiously goku is able to take freeza down to his final form again and frieza is completely on the ropes it's basically instead of vegeta and frieza it's goku and frieza goku is about to do the deed frieza then does his deed and takes out earth instantly with whis only being able to take everyone else in the vicinity away from the planet and leaving goku and frieza completely gone and decimated this affects everyone especially broly he's lost his master again he cannot cope with this happening and he is absolutely devastated flickering with the legendary power again but we slowly soothe the beast down after having months of training and knowing what he's about to do he says it's okay broly we've got this i'm able to reverse time vegeta is absolutely relieved because he didn't want to face a legendary super saiyan broly again so they go back and broly and vegeta know exactly what to do vegeta and broly team up and fire a blast telling goku to get out of the way and he doesn't need telling twice they jointly show off the power of super saiyan blue with broly having a slightly tinted variant and show the power to frieza vaporizing him almost at once goku is absolutely surprised to see this happen he's kind of disappointed that he didn't get to finish frieza off again but vegeta is having none of it because goku got to do it once it was about time that vegeta did it and he's completely unaware that probably helped as far as he's concerned vegeta is the one that took out frieza i think this would be very good for his character and ultimately from resurrection f it was totally deserved for vegeta to get the win so here vegeta gets the win sure he did get some help from the punk but he was able to get one over kakarot and that's what matters either way goku's not particularly fuss about it and he's just more focused on how broly was able to use the power of super saiyan blue so efficiently but frankly broly's just happy to see kakarot alive again and goes in and gives him a big bear hug while still in super saiyan blue and goku's in base form so goku has to power up to blue again just to make sure he's not crushed now about those super dragon balls broly states that whis hasn't gotten around to actually finding them yet and what with the whole thing about frieza it kind of put it out to their minds and goku agrees that now frieza's gone for good this time they should now focus on finding the super dragon balls so they can bring that south galaxy whis then remembers this request and chuckles awkwardly that he did go trying finding them but he wasn't able to actually locate them they weren't where they were originally based this is when beerus curses saying that oh that blasted sharper took them i bet he's going to wish on something selfish this leaves the saiyans non-plus because they were unaware that beerus had a brother and i think this is a good point to leave things for right now so there we go with sorbet taken out of the picture by very stubborn and arrogant lord frieza goku was able to get the win over frieza for the longest point he wasn't bested by a laser beam and we got vegeta and broly taking out frieza in any case broly did play his part in this story by instilling fear in sorbet which ultimately meant that goku was no longer harmed and he could do his thing despite the fact that broly didn't do much fighting he did help vegeta though and i think this was a really good way of trying to really call back the fact that vegeta was the one to help broly train and focus his power we're going to be heading into universe 6 with broly determined to find the super dragon ball so what is he going to do exactly when the three saiyans return to beerus's world and train some more after the resurrection f arc shampa and vados arrive to discuss arrangements for shampa to take universe 7's earth for himself because of the food and his earth is broken beerus doesn't want that and this ultimately leads to the five versus five tournament that we traditionally see at this point in super story the winner of this tournament gets a wish on the super dragon balls that's it broly now realizes what he needs to do he's just got to win a tournament well that was easy with five days to gather challenges for the tournament universe 7 are looking for members well i mean i i i say looking they actually pretty much already have the crew that they need you know it's just a formality broly vegeta and goku are already in which leaves two spots remaining piccolo takes spot number four like he does in the original with gohan then declining because oh you know oh i don't want to miss my conference conference this conference that all right so much for that then off we go find another thing ah no it's not that easy gohan you're not getting out of this one this whole thing actually really ticks broly off quite a bit when broly first discovered gohan just after he had his amnesia he viewed gohan as a serious fighter whom controlled broly when he was a loose cannon back in the day that's a lot of respect to have now in a way the legendary super saiyan here had begun to view gohan as a bigger brother of sorts sort of aping how goten saw him now to see him reject this opportunity and reject all the values that he understood gohan to have all the while promising to improve after what happened recently this is really going for broly this is him welching on that promise how dare he at first it's pretty calm broly steps forward and pleads with gohan to reconsider but gohan is insistent that oh no i have to be at the conference but broly isn't listening this is making him angry this is something that vegeta has been seeing more and more of lately and this is beginning to worry the prince broly losing his temper it seems that with all of this new power coursing through his veins the god key having more and more of it overflowing it has been giving the young man a lot of trouble the only way that vegeta has been able to control this is to train him harder to manage it all not having to use magical collars or amulets no just straight up training unfortunately but also fortunately they have been getting extra training from whis and now they've been getting stronger and stronger at a much faster rate with a key that vegeta is relatively new to and so therefore things are getting a little bit out of whack broly is losing more and more control and this is what the prince fears might happen possibly regressing back to his evil past and what they saw on that little fate with the comet komori broly then launches himself at gohan transforming into a super saiyan leaving gohan on the back foot having to transform himself in order to defend what follows now is pretty frightening broly going slightly berserk and gohan desperately trying to not get himself or broly hurt goku all the while is just asking what's going on it's almost like we're seeing the original broly here and vegeta is looking really concerned but it's also curious to see how gohan deals with this because after all vegeta did say in the original timeline at this point that gohan had the most potential out of everyone present if only he just decided to utilize that potential he could have done great so now is the time to do so broly is besting gohan at every turn with piccolo figuring that he probably should step in but vegeta does so first that's enough broly cease broly stops and powers down in all of this training the one person he had come to take orders from always was vegeta he collapses to the ground and catches his breath he then apologizes to gohan and remains quiet for the rest of the time there vegeta then turns to gohan and rolls with what just happened as if it was meant to happen you see gohan you have potential to handle the legendary super saiyan in battle why won't you wish to squander such a talent as this but i already told you vegeta i have a job and a family to support i support kid you are the son-in-law to the richest martial artist in the world you live in a mansion with a staff and everything taken care of for you believe me i know what it's like sort of you are hardly in a state of squalor like kakarot wait what the point is gohan you want to support your family really support them you sign up for this team because if you don't this world may cease to exist as you know it and then there will be nothing left for you to support now this is what gets gohan's attention it's true he did wish to get stronger to protect his family it just took the right person to try and convince him after some soul-searching he then agrees to take part in the tournament now okay why does he do this massacre well you see it was a two-pronged approach first off broly's resentment for gohan's disinclination to fight was one reason to take part but at the same time vegeta needed to keep broly under control and in good standing with everyone else because otherwise it will all fall apart making this out to be some kind of plan was the only way for everybody to still trust broly and not let on that vegeta has been beginning to struggle with the saiyan ever since then both acquiring the super saiyan blue power and therefore god ki god ki had not mixed well with broly's mind now with gohan in tow piccolo and gohan continue with their training with the other three saiyans retiring to the room of spirit and time for the remaining three days that they have all before the tournament takes place now inside the room vegeta focuses on strengthening broly's composure in the blue form and it seemingly goes very well the team then gather gohan in tow for the tournament on the nameless planet where universe 6 is ready to go also on the way gohan and broly reconcile and the former actually goes out of his way to say thank you thank me why you gave me a kick up the backside broly i need to figure out what my priorities were and they're for my family i mean if i can't protect them the way i know best then what good am i i need to do this to remind myself of how lucky i am to have this life probably doesn't know what to say to this but a simple mod does the job as for the entrance exam all the universe 17 pass without too many issues goku and broly scraped by with gohan understandably getting the highest score out of everybody which then impresses both whis and vaados vados going would you look at this brother a saying with brains to match their brawn i never thought i'd see the day coming from universe 7 of all things understandably whis doesn't take this too kindly but he's classy enough to not retort at least not yet the tournament then begins with the order and matches all the way up to vegeta and hit playing out the same way as they do before goku piccolo and vegeta successfully blitz their way through botamo frost despite his cheating magetta as well as kaaba with little stress i mean except for magetta's sweating out stint of course kaba though with his interaction with vegeta reminds the prince of his relationship with broly and thusly he does treat kaaba with less bluntness than he does in the original recognizing therefore the young boy's plucky attitude like broly had at the beginning and the willingness to learn this is just like broly was but without the risk of going berserk ever playing out in his mind kaaba he's a con boy we then get to the fight between hit and vegeta and as expected it goes pretty much the same way as it did before with vegeta not being able to anticipate his time skip ability oh the days when the time skip ability was genuinely unbeatable i miss those times with vegeta out for the count broly is next up to try and figure against a seemingly unstoppable man of hit at first broly is trying to figure out his actions much like how kakarot would but it's not going much better than when vegeta tried to do so and it's getting broly a little frustrated he tries again and again to outwit hit but it's no good hit is always one tenth ahead of them and whatever broly tries to do meets with nothing broly's mind is too transfixed on his movements much like his master and it's causing him to play out his movements like a book but there's one thing hit didn't count on and something vegeta didn't have and that was broly's explosive temper with each miss and each strike on him broly is losing his cool the super saiyan blue power may be easier to control than before for him but broly has rarely been bested by anyone since joining the z fighters i mean think about it when was the last time that broly lost i mean apart from beerus this is the first time that he's truly been put on the ropes and he does not like it fighting beerus he was in a form that he was used to yeah with the berserk legendary super saiyan power that was fine but now with god ki it's harder and when hit dodges him one more time broly snaps broly lets out a scream and the arena starts to shake his eyes white out and he bogs up something major like he did back in the day vegeta is shocked and scared oh no broly's blue hair grows outwards more and more getting spikier and spikier his pupils gone and i look up mania across his face it doesn't know what's going on but he will soon enough things aren't looking today are on broadway and his mind beerus and whis are witnessing broly becoming more and more erratic and beerus isn't liking what he is seeing saiyans what is going on with your lackey don't tell me i bought a pub of a fighter i backed the wrong horse or whatever kind of hyperbole is that you earthlings say goku isn't sure what's going on either broly seemed just fine a second ago but vegeta has an idea about what might be happening and he isn't sure whether he should share it with the group right now broly's mind is being torn apart by the frustration of not getting his way and it kind of makes sense up until now broly have been relatively more powerful than any villain that they come across with him there as part of the team which upon reflection wasn't that many villains boo boo was nice before he had the chance to escape the sealed ball remember that you know broly just pointed his hand at barbados and they were blown away in an instant you know the bus didn't even happen and frieza when he came back he was taken out as part of a double act with his master so they were able to succeed they got what they wanted now i know what you're thinking beerus bettered him in the previous part so yeah yeah broly's been defeated before but that was really comprehensive broly had been beat without even processing what had happened so he couldn't even get frustrated he didn't have the time with hit though this is the first time since broly came to earth or indeed actually ever even before he lost his memory that he'd fought someone who was nearly on his level and yet he couldn't face it was beginning to get to him and his mind was also beginning to melt now vegeta's own mind is firing on all cylinders what does he do does he interfere and risks disqualification of universe 7 but trying to interfere and interrupt a battle or does he wait it out and just see what hit tries to do after a tense few moments beerus and vegeta are looking at each other and back to broly with a look of nervous tension across both of their faces however broly he's beginning to tire but not before he lets out the ultimate example of frustration a scream which shakes the planet he then lets out a huge mouth beam of green energy like you tend to see in the burly movie and in the original movies which shoots up into the sky and shatters the sphere that protects the arena from the harsh environment outside and with varus and whis quick to repair it though that is something that goku and vegeta have seen before you know key overflowing but hit has seen enough with a blue aura he improves his skills and knocks broly out cold universe 7's broly has been ko'd the winner of this contest is hit of universe 6. vegeta collapses to the ground absolutely exhausted and terrified they've gotten very lucky broly's body is on the floor of the arena and covered in bruises from all the times that hit had gotten him goku and vegeta then gather around broly heading on down to the arena and helping him up and then back to the universe 7 area to then kind of recover and regain consciousness when broly comes too he spots vegeta and apologizes for his behavior but when goku tries to talk to him probably doesn't say anything he just looks at goku's hand and doesn't do anything you know not at all it just kind of just stays there but then broly gets up and walks over to the other side of the green area away from everybody else blanking goku in particular what was that about vegeta i i i don't know kakarot go bother someone else it's your turn next anyway oh yeah cool see you when it's over cheats he goes back to the arena getting ready for indeed his match with hit but this time hit starts off the fight by actually talking talking to goku unlike in the original saying a word of warning before we begin our match wow you talk cool i didn't think you were the talking type so yeah what's the warning about oh oh oh don't tell me are you gonna warn me about your strength that you're the strongest being there ever was because you know don't bother i don't need a one your friend is in great danger i know what he is he is the being that destroyed your south galaxy what how do you know that i have lived over a thousand years i have seen many things heard many things words of a whole galaxy disappearing in a matter of seconds it's not something that you hear every day that monster is not to be trusted goku is now looking a little nervous but more serious when he responds i don't know where you got your facts from but you're wrong broly isn't like that anymore he's changed he's on our side are you sure about that look to me that he was one scream away from blowing this planet to kingdom come and everyone with it if i hadn't stopped him who knows what may have happened be careful saiyan now shall we get this over with it gets into his stance and the match begins with goku even more determined than before to win broly watches the match play out from a distance and it goes like it does in the original with goku and hit going all out getting kaioken times 10 and then beerus and champa bickering to the point where basically hit grows tired of all of this and just forfeits the match out of sheer contempt now remember there is no monarcha here because we got a full team since goku got the win and won the tournament for universe 7 it means that that team gets the chance to make a wish on the super dragon balls that is until after zeno comes down and does his thing with everybody spooking the heck out of everyone and then being inspired to do the tournament of power after meeting goku but more on that later once goku recovers enough to walk he walks over to broly and pat's his shoulder to which the other saiyan recoils and looks angry whoa broly calm down i know it's been real ten something now but we won that means we can wish for south galaxy to be restored isn't that what you always wanted self galaxy yes that's what broly want uh you okay everybody you seem a little off no broly is fine let's go wish galaxy back it's been ages since broly talked that way just what did hit do to him the time has then come for the wish to be made with wise and beerus ready to make the wish indeed and vegeta orders broly to request his wish broly wish for south galaxy back wheat looks a little puzzled you mean you wish for it to be restored yeah that very well and then whis makes the wish to super shenron in the traditional godly manner which is basically japanese backwards if you want curious and with also pretty peas and carrots the wish is made and as if by magic south galaxy has been magically restored to its former self before broly had evaporated it immediately king kai can sense that the south kai is over the moon with his home back and ready to go back to it and that they kept his word oh king kai oh this is marvelous be sure to tell that broly boy that all is forgiven uh yeah about that you might want to keep the receipt on your galaxy dude what i don't know what's up exactly but that boy might be heading down a slippery slope i just hope my own boys can do something about it before that happens back on earth vegeta has begun to breathe a little more easily now that they've had a chance to recover and just chill out for a little bit back to their routine of training and whatnot broly's mind has actually since calmed down a little bit since coming back to capture court and also his speech has returned to normal he was even more willing to engage in conversation with goku again something which the saiyan was very glad to witness when broly is having a break and playing with trunks and goten goku and vegeta are then having a conversation something that doesn't often happen which makes goku think that whatever vegeta wants to talk to him about it must be something serious i didn't want to talk about this in front of broly but i think we may be in trouble there's something about that super saiyan blue power and his fight with that purple man that set him off for some reason that power isn't mixing well with his natural power even when he's fine his hair is a different shade to us can't you see it something isn't right he's like a time bomb ready to explode okay so what do we do do we just bump him on the noggin again and hope he forgets it all vegeta looks at goku with incredulity i'll give you a bump on the noggin in a minute you don't what we do is have broly avoid any confrontations for the time being better yet find those dragon balls and wish for broly's mind to be manipulated so that he never remembers his past if he remembers what you mean to him it could spell doom for us all we might be seeing more than south galaxy disappear soon goku looks intense at him and then broly who's casually drinking a fizzy drink as if nothing bad has happened at all they really don't want to have to deal with him again at full strength sure they have beerus and whis to help this time but there is no guarantee that they will indeed help and take their side they may be on their own and so for the next couple of months goku and vegeta do what they can to make sure that broly's life is as calming as possible even with the patofa arc they managed to distract brawley by asking bulma to ask him to help out with chores and carrying important rocket parts around for the engineer you know just help out around the factory and the workers are looking pretty astounded that this one guy is able to carry around hundreds and hundreds of tons of equipment like it was just a bag of groceries or something but dr bulma we we've got the latest technology and transportation craft to do that we've got the cars to do the job what are you doing but those cost money retorts bulma if i could save a few hundred zennies worth of fuel i'll take that opportunity thank you and so we then come to the beginning of the goku black ark as we know future trunks escapes to the past after his future timeline has been cut to pieces and when he comes to with his past mother in front of him he then spots goku and the stakes in for goku black but that misunderstanding pales in comparison when trunks then spots broly and now he's really on the defensive broly recognizes this boy but from where then he begins to click something in the back of his mind has told his waking mind that he has met this guy before and it wasn't on good terms broly starts to get angry the feelings that his brains are fueling him with they're not happy feelings this guy did bad stuff to him and vegeta's plan to keep broly calm has failed broly's rage and anger was stemming from the connection that his brain was making with this person that had just come from the future trunks that name was something his old life remembered well i mean it can't be though trunks is the young boy that he considered one of his best friends the little one with the purple hair like with goten but this trunks was older and more like one of the lingering neural firings from his time on the planet that was being rained on by comet komori this man was bad news and so therefore broly's already fragile mind was preparing itself to power up and he does so going super saiyan blue i mean wow trunks has only just arrived here and now he's being shown the powers that the present have managed to present to him and it's something even greater than goku black's power that trunks has just run away from vegeta then shouts to bulma to get whis's butt right here pronto as soon as possible as he has to go super saiyan blue himself just to counter broly's power and even though vegeta should be strong enough to be able to deal with this kind of broly we simply can't broly's fury is out doing vegeta's power and even with goku leading in to help the two of them just can't stop broly's onslaught that's enough broly ceases madness says vegeta trunks then also realizes this person's identity broly are you serious that broly what's he doing here the last time i saw him he nearly destroyed us goku shouts back no time to explain get your butt up here and help trunks complies with goku's request and then powers up to super saiyan 2. this seems to only make broly even angrier as the memories are now flooding in even more of multiple people fighting him at the same time a sudden spark of green energy envelopes the group and the trio of super saiyans fall back as broly begins to bulk up and fire off green energy blasts in all directions broly's old mania is returning and his blue hair begins to lengthen and his muscles expand exponentially trunks you heard broly many years ago now i'll make you hurt vegeta is thinking the only saving grace here is that he doesn't remember the significance of kakarot if he did then this may be the end of them all the entire universe broly is gazing hysterically at trunks and trunks is powerless to stop him an omega blaster is being prepared to strike the hero of time directly but then suddenly it disappears broly's eyes shut and he falls to the ground in a heap whis appears from behind broly who was hovering right there at the time and the angel has a far too pleased smile upon his face you rang oh my what happened here everyone is exasperated and turned to whis as if to say what took you so long waste retorts what i got here as fast as i could i had to stop for a food run for lord beerus on the way though so apologies if i took a couple of seconds longer than i should after broly has been subdued by whis thanks to a handy-dandy trick he learned to calm beerus down so we know it works and quite frankly with whis you can just stick in any old power and all work the gang informing about what has happened and the events that transpired at the time of movie eight whis takes this all in and then recalls something happening with komori a long time ago which caught his attention back in the day i see so that's what caused that comet to change course i was wondering that that thing was huge the question is though what do we do with broly for now they don't know there's no telling what he might do now with his mind seemingly to be unraveling with every passing minute for a moment there it was like he'd regressed all the way back to where he was back then that their time together being friends allies never happened and that the nice and friendly ally that they once had was lost forever one thing's for sure trunks can't be around him at the same time not right now but trunks isn't convinced i knew he was bad news look how quickly he snapped the moment he laid eyes on me he was faking the whole thing trunks that's enough but she just snaps back vegeta is not going to tolerate his son's lack of faith in broly this is hitting vegeta the hardest of all he had spent the most time with broly and to see him fully revert back to his old ways that was pretty heartbreaking for the prince it was like he'd lost a family member right now broly is not like the monster we fought back then this broly is someone i can trust he is someone that i care about right now i want to help him i must help him vegeta looks serious trunks recalls a bit before looking away for the next couple of hours broly's kept a close eye on beerus has now arrived after noticing we said vanished and is lamenting the dragon team's decision in taking on this maverick in the first place he always knew that that one was trouble he shouldn't have been given the god ki vegeta is getting sick and tired of all this doubt but that's when goku black comes into play and with broly out of the picture for the moment the scene between black goku and the rest of the dragon team pretty much plays out as per normal now you may be asking is broly in the future or not massaco well i don't want to say right now future trunks came from a time when broly didn't exist as we knew him as that occurred right before the buu saga movie 10 when he came to earth you know the broly in that timeline remained entombed in ice and after all this time it became very unlikely that he would ever be revived and remember i know that some of you may be saying well probably wouldn't have existed in the first place they wouldn't afford him or something like that he wouldn't have known about kakarot well he would have known about kakarot for a start and also this is an april fool what if so he can be a little bit crazy so let's just wait a little bit and i'll show you what i'm cooking up later for now though goku black is pulled back into the future and the gang process what just happened with bulma unearthing the other time machine she had from the time of the cell saga just to lift and trunks waning spirit that his own time machine had been destroyed soon trunks meets up with gohan and the two of them talk for a while over some ice cream naturally the conversation then turns to broly and gohan simply falls silent well gohan what do you make of all of this can this broly be trusted father seems to think the world of him he can be trusted however his mind has been affected by paragus during his childhood it's left in more damage than we may have suspected also the amount of poverty is unlocked in such a short space of time yeah that may have sped up the deterioration and undone all the work we had done to try and help him gohan then looks down retrospectively i think to myself what might have happened had i just destroyed him right the moment i first saw him here but then i remember that majin buu would have been around so for that reason i trust broly he's done more good for us than bad soon the time comes for the gang to head back to the future in the repaired time machine for the first trip it happens like it does in the original with goku vegeta and trunks heading to the future you know encountering rose black and then having to retreat back to the present again after getting their butts kicked and realizing that despite their power the power that the future exhibited at the time is just simply too great whis is present as kid trunks spots the others return almost unconscious when the three of them awaken recovered we debriefs that he has managed to put some kind of mental block on broly for the time being that managed to remove or at least obscure trunks's true identity for the time being it's not a permanent fix but if it can just hold for the time that this future trunks is around it should buy them some time to try and find a better solution for fixing broly's brain broly walks out looking very hazy as if he'd been asleep for weeks and greets trunks cordially oh hello i didn't introduce myself my name's broly forgive me for my absence earlier trunk shakes his hand but thinks oh trust me you introduced yourself plenty goku and vegeta then informed brawley about what happened and are very apprehensive thinking that whis's block is going to give out at any moment this has not gone unnoticed broly can sense something is wrong what's the matter master vegeta you seem a bit off vegeta is looking very pensive but masks this with his usual bravado that's no concern of yours broly i'm fine broly now seemingly onside for the moment they can plan another venture into the future broly wonders if this future has a version of himself in it but goku says well doesn't look it buddy but broly has a plan to verify this with president zamasu being wiped out like before the gang are now ready to go into the future for the second time this time with broly with him there as well bomber is really scrunched up and has to sit on vegeta's lap so as to not be crushed by all the big sailing bodies in there and after getting out the gang assess the situation and realize that the future despite their efforts of getting rid of prison zamasu has not changed at all this version of west city is just as devastated as it was before where city then that must mean broly sets his gaze on a location in the distance and probably flies away broly get back here too late he's gone trunks is angry i knew it i knew which plan would fail bully's turned his back on us he's going to go and team up with goku black i know it no boy said vegeta he's not so worried he's got the bit between his teeth what has he figured out that we haven't now after a while flying broly lands in a dense undergrowth of forest which has seemingly been left untouched zamasu and goku black probably felt no need to tarnish this place as animals weren't part of their plan broly looks around and nods it's just like how i remember broly walks through the woodland for a while and discovers a massive patch of dirt which wasn't there in the present broly thinks for a moment just going through his head going back through all the memories he can remember and promptly starts to blast the ground dozens of times which vaporizes the ground until he suddenly comes across a patch of ice which has now started to melt due to the fact there's loads of key and key produces heat broly is looking curious his suspicions may be right and after breaking some more of the ice he discovers something amazing there staring back at him is himself with more care broly melts the ice around this other broly and warms the air using his key for a few minutes broly just stands there waiting for some movement to occur i read some of the comments and people were really surprised to see this thing happen as well as being very confused how would this broly get here he never went bonkers and saw kakarot so he would have ended in a pod and then entombed an ice still well that's the beauty of the april fool what if we can get the same conclusion as the original timeline whilst changing the origin slightly however i'm not going to make it totally arbitrary let's just say in this universe paragus had pushed the boy too far one day and basically the collar that had kept him in check failed and his power overflowed so much that broly went crazy and the only way to subdue him was to turn the collar off and on again and overload it with his own key to the point of knocking broly out magic works in weird ways as a result of this paragus then loaded his son into one of their pods they had been using to travel around the galaxy with and set a straight course as the crow flies not to land on a planet in particular just keep speeding through space where he cannot pose a danger to anyone or even to himself if he was able to escape the vacuum of space would do its thing yes dark i know but this boy could end up destroying whole galaxies out of anger which is exactly what he did in the present timeline so probably one day broly's course got deviated by cosmic weather fronts and he landed on earth and got buried in ice all bit younger than his present counterpart mind you saiyans pretty much remains similar in appearance and stature between the ages of 18 and 80s so there is not much of a visual distinction between the two our broly has noticed that the future broly has begun to twitch and judder in the now large puddle that was once hosting a glacier it worked says our broly as he floats downwards to land next to the other version of himself what what happened who you the future broly is looking absolutely out of it and spots a being who looks similar to himself this may be hard to explain but i am you from another time you broly on me broly we are both broly you were frozen in ice just like i was you're alive where's my father i don't know but you are on earth there are more saiyans here and right now we need your help i hate to bother you after you just woke up but it's important the world is about to be consumed by an evil power sailors who meanwhile the gang have headed to the resistance base to find that future my was out cold and we have the same thing happening as it did in the original but this time vegeta is a bit more preoccupied with his own thoughts and the whereabouts of his apprentice instead of whether or not goku had kissed chichi before then he looks to his saying counterpart kakarot what could broly be up to oh no vegeta immediately gets up and tells kakarot to stay where he is he has to find broly why can't we just teleport there it's too risky kakarot you know why before goku can figure out why this might be too dangerous and why vegeta's so concerned the prince is out the door and running out of the city trying to evade the gaze and energy detection of a potentially nearby goku black then it dawns on goku this future broly might not have had the same state of amnesia as their one had but might have had the same initial rage spark oh dear back with the two brolys and the relaxed one casually states prince vegeta's son and kakarot you know what's coming here the now awakened broly immediately looks wide-eyed and stands up straight kakarot kakarot's here wait how do you know kakarot the future broly twitches again and it's getting more and more aggressive what's going on why are you so angry at me saying kakarot the future broly screams before looking intensely at his past counterpart if you are broly too then why doesn't your blood boil at the speaking of his name why would it kakarot has been nothing but kind to me he's had the answers for me as long as i can remember what can broly remember or are you imposter our broly is starting to look very confused and a little bit worried had he done the wrong thing he can feel this version's key starting to bubble and boil sort of like his own key when he gets all fired up this can't be good wait stop i know what you're doing listen to me kakarot is not the bad guy here he's done nothing wrong you gotta believe me broly broly is starting to scream louder and louder and starts to attack his own version if you are helping kakarot then you are enemy broly then has to be careful here he can't attack himself too much or else this whole exercise would have been in vain he'd look stupid in front of his master you think this would be easy for our boy to handle but the unpredictable key is not helping his efforts to keep this whole thing in check luckily for him though vegeta arrives to assist and together they are able to knock out the berserk saiyan vegeta turns to our chap and looks horrified broly what do you think you're doing this version of you is out of control that and black is far stronger than him what makes you think he can help he's of no use to anyone our broly is feeling a little bullish right now and decides to push back i have a question for you master why does this version of me hate kakarot so much i don't hate kakarot what's the difference between him and me vegeta stops his charade and begins to look solemn he hoped that this day would never come as it could doom them all there is something that i need to tell you broly something that happened to you and why you think the way you do i will tell you but that we'll have to wait until after we get home right now we have unfinished business to attend to and a future to save broly looks absolutely nonplussed master what's going on you're scaring me all that you need to know is that as far as this monster is concerned black is kakarot while we are here refer to our kakarot as his earth name got it why just do it he may be weak in comparison but having something unpredictable to read can only stall their rampage vegeta and broly take the sleeping broly back to base and rest him down on some cushions and inform goku about what's going on this guy hasn't been to the meeting where screaming kakarot is not a bad thing kakarot what's going on why is he like this it's a long story broly i'll tell you later when we're done with all this broly doesn't like this stalling that's what master said i don't like the secrecy trust me this is for your own good broly promises to go along with this for now but he does want answers when they get home it's a necessary evil and there is no hiding from this guy's past anymore when this future broly wakes up he is surprised to see everyone and faces looking back at him but thankfully his mind hasn't remembered the previous engagement in tussle from earlier where am i the name's goku i'm a saiyan and these are my friends who will also say it as well as humans we need your help broly how do you know brulee's name vegeta strongly steps up that's not important right now what matters is that we have a favor to ask of you saiyan and something that you're looking for a certain person outside goku black makes his presence known by blowing up a nearby pile of rubble come on out saiyans i know you're here up there is kakarot kakarot broly stands up straight and runs outside to see goku black or kakarot to him looking around for people to destroy kakarot goku black looks down and acts drooly oh you're talking to me forgive me i don't talk to simpletons kakarot broly's eyes white out and he screams out in rage his body swelling up and his power increasing exponentially from the doorway the rest of the saiyans are watching this unfold and are terrified are broly looking especially scared as well as ashamed is this what i look like master when i get angry vegeta isn't responding he's watching this other broly like a space hawk goku black is not particularly bothered by this new specimen he's seen tons like this before who think they can be the one to stop him but this one won't be any different his energy may be increasing yes but it's still pretty feeble when in the presence of something beautiful like himself he does not need to whip out the british accent transformation just yet does this little animal want to play fine come and face me broly lands a punch to black's face taking the powerhouse by surprise kakarot broly then manages to get a few more hits on black before the balance realigns itself and the two of them are locked in intense combat down on the ground trunks and mai are marshaling the resistance to get out of the area as things could get very bad if this broly is allowed to go all out like a whirling dervish like it seems that vegeta wants him to do our broly is watching this all happen and is mesmerized bizarrely at this overflowing key it feels practically identical to how he feels sometimes he's putting two and two together does saying kakarot really make this change in power happen did it used to work on himself he's starting to think the wrong things but meanwhile goku black is getting more and more frustrated at this lack of respect for a powerful god as he as well as wondering where all of this power is coming from it's coming out of nowhere seemingly for the first time ever he hasn't got a clue and this is getting under his skin and he screams enough he lets out a pulse of key which sends broly flying backwards into more rubble there's a lot of it trust me i will not be made a fool off by such a filthy animal cowards face me instead of hiding behind this freak of nature vegeta lost to himself excellent he's getting angry this is our chance to turn this around so long as the green man doesn't interfere broly looks to the rubble where the other one landed and is not appreciating vegeta's attitude like this version is some kind of tool or object and not worth his time really that could have been him if things happen differently that's what it's for you vegeta who originally wanted to face black alone actually then shows up by powering up to blue and launching himself a goku black the latter still raging and fuming against this impertinent interloper and bizarre creature he has not enough time to transform and he is winded severely before regaining his composure and transforms into rose at last a fight where i can converse with someone with half a brain vegeta is not responding to these remarks and chooses to get the job done he charges forward again but from behind an explosion of key erupts and the broly that we are very familiar with emerges and speeds past vegeta and begins to charge and omega blast that famed attack at black who thinks that this power should be nothing but it's still troubling him all the same it's so new and erratic that he can't just simply overpower it it's going to hit him and it does black is engulfed in green energy and is feeling considerable pain vegeta chooses not to dwell on this and relies on this further distraction to overwhelm goku black even more with a barrage of his own and as that's happening this is enough to attract the attention indeed of future zamasu who is personally wondering what is causing his partner so much trouble his key is fading and all over the place i don't remember there being another saiyan around here this one is new it seems and he's certainly a challenge but not one that we guards can't handle with this goku black is now looking very ragged his clothes completely torn to shreds and his eyes looking manic with fury at this key that he can't get a handle on despite him being theoretically stronger than this beast vegeta is smiling you see black you may be stronger but you are no match for pure unbridled energy this guy's not going to stop goku black is starting to look fearful goku black even with his british rose powers is unable to get the upper hand from these mortal fools despite forgetting that this body he is in is also mortal that's convenient that zamasu hasn't jumped in yet feeling that his colleague should be able to continuously improve his way out of this problem this was nothing he had faith in him but the thing is though goku black can't you see as we know from the movies the original broly and sort of the new one as well is relentless when it comes to the likes of seeing kakarot and that who he is focused on is basically goku black assuming him for the other one sensing that black is on the verge of exhaustion the rest of the gang then try their best to get into the mix with the future broly's rampage going on around them together they join their ki blast together and aim a blaster goku black and it connects the saiyan kai hybrid self is damaged severely by this and when the light dissipates he is collapsed on the ground out of his rose power no longer having a british accent and totally on the brink of passing vegeta walks over to him and kicks him into a pile of rubble nearby he wanted to do that for so long for two reasons in fact first how dare this monster destroy the future of his son and secondly it's because this fool looked like kakarot and so in a way it was like a bout of indirect catharsis goku black can barely lift his body up off the ground and he is totally broken how how how did this body fail he starts to tear up and slam the ground out of frustration where had his partner been throughout all of this why had he abandoned him the son of vegeta is amazed with how everything has gone so smoothly in terms of relying on a berserker for the win too amazed suddenly a flash of flesh and greenish yellow streaks past the group father look out before vegeta can turn around fully the future broly scoops him up as well as goku black and launches them into the air kakarot is mine vegeta is left vulnerable by the surprise attack and the person to revel in all this confusion the most is zamasu he claps softly as if he intended all this to happen i've got to hand it to you mortals that was very clever relying on pure energy wrapped around flesh and blood to do your dirty work go to the top of the class however you forgot that pure energy on its own has no master you got what you wanted yes but it's not over yet and now you'll have to face the consequences that's why you mortals cannot be trusted with power such as this you have just simply given me the proof that i need that what we have done together was the right thing to do he watches burly pummeling his comrade for a little longer not in the least bit worried for the safety of him our broly is sickened by this coldness this may be an alien melding of peoples and these two are bad guys but how can he be so cruel still to what is his ally zamasu turns to burly on the ground and can sense what he is thinking and raises a finger wagging it now i know what you're thinking that i'm being such a bad friend to that one up there oh this is all part of the plan my new plan i'm not worried for i have this he takes off the potara from his left ear and dangles it in front of broly he doesn't know what it is but goku does he immediately knows what he is planning on doing but before he can leap in and stop it too late now i bet you're wondering how goku knows about this because they never needed to rely on this potara fusion or any fusion for that matter well goku still knew about all these kinds of fusion from the afterlife and also knowing about it from the old kai and all of that kind of stuff i'm sure there's been constant communication in that regard i mean goku was away for a good long time so yeah i think he would have met some people including shin whilst in the mix of vegeta and future broly goku black can feel a warmth from his right ear it is time he starts to laugh knowing what's about to happen he had been saved and now all these mortal freaks will pay for their impertinence the pull of patara grips him and he as well as zamasu are drawn to each other at a fantastic speed there is an almighty flash and out of this we get few zamasu the power is incredible much more than any individual being there but there is a difference to the version that we got in the original this version of few zamasu is a little bit weaker than before due to the condition of goku black upon them fusing he hadn't been left much time to recover or indeed any time to recover actually and it was very rushed so thusly he isn't as dominant as before but right now he is still the top banana frustrated by having his prize taken away from him future broly takes out his anger on vegeta for just that little while longer before trying his luck on fuse zamasu kakarot had been taken from him and this green man had been the one to do it in his mind therefore he should be the one to receive broly's justice vegeta is left in a freefall before being caught by trunks who gets him out of the area as this is all beginning to kick off future broly fires on a mega blast refuse zamasu but it does nothing the deity turns to him and has venom in his gaze he's got a score to settle with this one he remembers the pain and fury that goku black felt just now i commend your power simpleton but i cannot allow you to live any longer kakarot where is kakarot youtube kagarot the fusion chuckles and says yes i did i can show you where i've sent him if you like as well as his kind soon enough or maybe right now he then rushes future broly and slams a punch in his stomach winding him and then doing a similar thing to what happened in movie eight future broly can feel the key inside of him rupturing his skin and he cannot contain this anymore he is writhing around in the air and a few seconds later he explodes in a sea of green energy few zamasu doesn't run away from this or fly out of the area instead he just simply basks in this blast and takes in the feeling of satisfaction oh that felt good the green key bathes the green man and he feels on top of the world our broly is left horrified by this his plan had failed and not only that that could have easily happened to him in fact it sort of did in the original but right now it's best not to tell him that him witnessing this is more than enough to break him and have him collapse to the floor all of this he has even more questions left for his friends when they get out of this if they ever get out of this when the light fades feud zamasu turns to the others and laughs out loud i'm sorry that i broke your pet devil mortals he was a true freak a genuine demon even one that i could not let live must like the rest of you now that you tremble at my feet and majesty he spreads his arms and prepares an attack ready to wipe out the world below blades of justice goku knows that with all of this they cannot counter it right now especially without the future broly there to act as a deterrent as zamasu is charging up this attack goku instant transmissions to broly and then as many people as he can gather and teleport them out of there before zamasu unleashes his fury merely to act as a last act of fear-inducing i think he got that point across quite well goku couldn't think of anywhere else other than where he had since broly earlier and honestly this was actually a good distance away to provide time but time for what with vegeta getting his bearings back he is pondering about the idea of heading back to the past to regroup and then try again once healed up however trunks and broly round on him and say that they don't have time ironically to try and do this because this power of zamasu's is so great and his will so strong right now that it was lucky that he hadn't just wiped them out already like he let them get away he was toying with them and so something had to be done right now meanwhile goku was pondering about something something that he remembered when he was in the other world he remains quiet he then makes his idea known for the first time in the series fusion if zamasu had fused then they could too goku vegeta stops himself in the midst of his pupil how can we fuse like them we don't have those wretched earrings to hand he talks about the metamorm fusion vegeta is perplexed by this a fusion of two beings without the need of earrings he's interested but he's then not so interested when it comes to the fact that it involves a little bit of dancing vegeta is just oh oh as you may know and it's just so predictable right now but goku says it's the only thing they can do in the here and now and yeah vegeta ultimately as you can imagine refuses to do it and despite goku's pleas he does not budge so much for gogeta i'm sorry you're not gonna get him however there is one person who does step up i will do it kakarot you see i can say that name it seems that my master has lost his resolve as well as his faith in me and my fortitude he scowls at his master who is surprised that he had been so perceptive and that the name had no effect the mood is bad between them right now i wish to prove myself so i will fuse with you for my future self he didn't deserve to be treated like an accessory he had a chance to live and now it's gone stolen from him i will avenge him it's clear that he isn't doing this solely for his friends this time but also for himself and his future self realizing that they don't have much time for bickering before zamasu finds them the two have no choice but to start practicing the routine broly is picking this up quite quickly remarkably so too which goku notes trying to ease the tension a little but it doesn't work broly is far too focused on the task at hand the time has come for them to fuse for their lives they perform the dance and a light similar to zamasu's just now erupts and consumes the woodland when it settles we get a fusion of goku and broly karoli that's right we are bringing in the fusion from the 3ds game dragon ball fusions it's a very good game by the way you should check it out it was bonkers then it will be bonkers now without a word karoli instant transmissions himself into the battlefield in the presence of fuse zamasu the green fusion immediately recognizes the garb well well i didn't expect that the metamorans would ever share the secrets of the saiyans this will be very very interesting futile for you but interesting for me corolla's focus still the nerve from broly reigning supreme as he gets into goku's signature stance and powers up to super saiyan karoli's first strike against you zamasu is enough to surprise him not hurt him but give him pause for thought my the pet has claws too bad that you caught my attention that will be the last time that you strike me zamasu then strikes karoli down back to the ground but the fusion isn't that flawed you're nothing special zamasu all that buildup and for what just some pompous fool with a giant frisbee on his back zamasu is getting a little ticked off by this shut your mouth mortal you wouldn't want your last words to be so vulgar now would you crawly shrugs i can wait you out i know that the stronger you get the shorter you have to even come close to my majesty i don't need that long now that i have an idea of what makes you tick karoli gets into position and then powers up into super saiyan blue that super saiyan thing oh that was just a test the jump in power is very apparent soon enough zamasu doesn't wait to find out he unleashes his blades of judgment technique down on the ground to which karoli disappears amidst vegeta and the others can sense this going on from afar back in the forest miles away and are wondering if they should actually go in and try and help karoli trunks wants to be the one to end things so desperately himself but he does know that he is in the midst of something that he cannot win on his own vegeta then looks to the horizon and sighs i let him down what who did you let down father broly i should have fused with him together we would have been mighty a culmination of all the training that we had done instead i let kakarot get the upper hand i fear that my tenure as a master is compromised trunks can you remember how that stupid fusion thing works trunks goths and tries to recollect the situation he ponders about what his father would mean by that meanwhile back at the scene zamasu cannot sense karoli amongst his blades and he is feeling rather victorious but then he gets a vicious double-fisted head slam which then catapults him into his own attack to which he can barely escape from in fact he actually does get nicked by one blade but only just it's enough to get his attention up in the sky is karoli resplendent in his blue aura careful sammy you almost ended yourself that attack isn't that practical if you move zamasu is getting more and more frustrated with this pest far more annoyed than he ever got with vegito he launches himself at the saiyan fusion and the proper fight begins with the pair of them fairly equal in power but with the composure and confidence of the latter karoli not batting an eyelid zamasu's integrity is starting to falter much like after goku's kaioken blue attack the kai's visage is starting to corrupt on one side and eventually his bulked-up rage form is apparent to which karoli takes great murth from he's got under its skin wow i didn't think angelic beings could be so ugly zamasu is just fueling his own downfall at this point he is just making it harder for himself he's berserking out more and more at being denied his victory by such an annoying entity just a little longer zamasu mutters to himself thinking that the fusion is going to split sometime soon given the power that was being outputted what's the matter getting scared you started this zamasu end it i don't care how zamasu looks up and sees if that's what you are saying zamasu screams to the skies on a huge surge of energy exude from his body i will make you regret your posturing i will wipe this world out in an instant before finishing what i started you should never have angered me mortal you have doomed your own world karoli is actually getting a little worried right now uh the goku inside of him remembers this happening before with the likes of semi-perfect cell and frieza they've got previous so this guy too was having a big hissy fit at not having his own way but having said that he knew that the kai was right time was running out on many levels but there was something odd though he couldn't feel his body running out of time like fusion usually does what's going on was broly's overflowing key perhaps keeping this fusion together i mean there's no time to figure this out right now i mean obviously you've got a very angry kai that you're trying to calm down or better yet try and destroy the guy karoli then in that moment decides to unleash a counter-attack planet geyser it's risky but this should be enough to try and cancel out what zamasu is trying to do in one go karoli gets into position and the geyser connects with zamasu's surging attack now granted it's a struggle and karoli can feel his body starting to reach its limits by now but it needs to keep going sure enough the attack is enough to try and disrupt zamasu's anger and there is a huge cataclysmic explosion which eliminates the surrounding half mile except for the combatants when the smoke clears karoli lands down on the ground to find traces of zamasu's clothing had had he done it well i mean right now he could not sense his energy like before yeah victory got him to quote another fusion that is until zamasu shows up he grabs caroline in a full nelson and is raving about how he had enough of this forget his plan now he just wanted everything to stop so he could finally get some peace being halted by this being right at the final hurdle was enough to tip zamasu over past the brink of insanity i don't care about my plan anymore all i care about is ending this plastic torture crowley's getting unsettled despite knowing the fact that broly's output is helping elongate his time in the battle it can't last forever he tries to escape but he can't zamasu's power is surging like crazy again but suddenly zamasu stops he turns around to see vegeta and trunks looking on he particularly is shooting a glare at trunks trunks why won't you die i'm not gonna give you the satisfaction you freak vegeta i shut out of sheer determination and sort of embarrassment initiates the fusion dance samus who tries to drop crowley but karoli stops him no you don't you wanted me you got me we now see the arrival of vegetanks on the battlefield in one instant the second fusion launches itself at zamasu and together with karoli they then pincer zamasu squashing the kai together pinning him down this pain as well as the pressure is seeing an even more advanced degradation of the kai's fusion that we ever saw in the original the left side of zamasu is starting to melt even further and he now can no longer muster power from his left side with it writhing about what is this why can't i move veggie tanks pipes up it's because you rushed into this you forgot that your friend wasn't immortal like you that half of you can no longer cope and well i think you can feel what's happening thomas can indeed feel what's happening his essence was unraveling his spirit starting to dissolve this wasn't going to just be a simple diffusion this was him coming apart he could feel his mind going being replaced with unbridled fury he was basically turning into into a mindless mortal he was scared no he was petrified it can't end like this zamasu's body was contorting itself as was being squeezed by karoli and vegetanks before boom an arc of energy explodes around the fusions and nobody can sense what is going on when the light clears zamasu is gone not a trace was left not even those weird little sparkles that we saw in the original after trunk sliced him in half but wait massaco how come his essence isn't there does that mean that this future is saved yes you see the arrival of vegetanks meant that zamasu's mind was being undone and his drive was compromised by the sheer frustration of karoli and thusly the spirit of zamasu from both ends was damaged beyond repair thusly he had become a monster with no mind to speak of and with a ton of energy where is that energy going to go well we saw in broly upwards and outwards bathing the earth with a healing force which removed the green clouds from above and left the world basking in the clear night sky for the first time in years zamasu had truly been removed from this realm the two fusions gaze at one another for a split second smile before karoli splits back into broly and goku vegetang stands there and bows to broly you did well broly i am proud of you i am sure the vegeta in me would wish to express that himself broly tired and exhausted smiles back and feels satisfied with his lot in time vegetanx diffuses as well and the four of them then start to assess the situation mai regroups as well with trunks and together they then inform what was left of the people around as well as the resistance that it was truly over goku himself is looking around in case zamasu would then return in some form well he needn't have worried this time that kai had been expunged all thanks to his own madness when things did become clear that it was seriously going to be all right goku vegeta and broly then start to make their goodbyes to the resistance and together with trunks head back in time to then collect themselves back into the present and then once everything had been refueled and was ready to go trunks was ready to head back to start the reconstruction effort for the second time vegeta then tells trunks that there is a capsule located in the time machine that could be of use this should help speed the process up find new nemec if it's still out there and heal your universe well done my son trunks smiles and promises to do his best and to not bother the past again i apologize trunks for my impertinence broly says to trunks having calmed down tremendously but he still has that headlock that whis had placed on him no problem broly i'm glad this is all over and that you're in peace my future needs to heal once again take care all of you and with that trunks heads back into the future and ready to start anew for the next few days broly tries to repair his relationship with vegeta and vegeta feels the need to do that himself he had lost faith in his pupil and that it hurt broly immensely it would take time but the prince knew that he had to regain trust in both himself as well as his pupil having said that though broly was having to deal with something else he had something to think about whilst the act of fusion with kakarot was pretty awesome and it was amazing to have that kind of power and confidence behind it it left him with something weird it had left him with something just at the back of his mind something he didn't like he had actually without realizing shared a mind with goku kakarot we're not quite sure how fusion works when two minds become one per se but i feel for the sense of this story it would be thematically intriguing to say where this might go broly's mind had reformed quite nicely since being discovered by goten but there were still gaps in his memory from before being discovered by the son of goku gaps that were never replaced or filled in or completely gotten rid of but fusing with kakarot had started to do so he was beginning to remember from prior to his bump on the head kakarot's influence had begun to resurge broly's mind was potentially beginning to relapse with no hope of being able to fix it the crying young kakarot by his bedside king vegeta trying to end him with a blade paragus his father it was all coming back to him slowly but very surely he had begun to resent kakarot once more now he knew why kakarot had been so important to him for so long it wasn't because he would bring understanding or solace quite the opposite in fact kakarot had initially ruined his life and for the longest time they had lived in destitution the only thing that had kept him from wasting kakarot right there and then when he started to think about it was the light he had after he needed to get away from here one night broly took a ship from capture court and set off into space before anyone knew what happened or where he went he was long gone and attempts to contact him were met with silence we resume our story a little bit after he left earth vegeta was trying to figure out what had happened to make broly vanish like that without a single word to anyone it was very unlike him he was clearly still in sound mind because apparently when he took said vessel nobody was harmed and nobody saw him looking suspicious irate or crazy he'd been quite civil in fact i'll be a little bit snippy with his words a bit short but that could happen to anyone there was no trace of resentment or anger in him hence why nobody had reported it until the morning for hours he was racking his brain vegeta trying to figure out the cause of this disappearance then it dawned on him kakarot he remembers he gets out of bed leaving a pregnant bulmer to her slumber in the morning light she rolled over without sensing her husband leaving and he was on his way to mount palsu when the prince arrived there he found kakarot training on his own as per usual but also looking equally baffled at the sight of vegeta kakarot vegeta stomps over to his rival and looks at him with a serious expression oh hey vegeta what brings you here you don't usually come here to train actually you've never come here to trip i have no intention of training with you right now i figured it out figured what out goku blinks why broly's gone he remembers everything from when we first met on that wild goose chase paragus laid out for us he knows why you are so important to him the real reason but he can't take it goku thinks for a moment and can't explain why he could know nobody had told him that's the point it's probably because nobody told him that he's gone rogue i'd be the same if i were him all the lies and deceit for so long that affects him greatly i imagine goku is now getting curious as to why vegeta is getting so worried why would he even care he didn't seem like the caring type for such matters vegeta then looks at him with an evil glare i care because he's my responsibility i took charge of him kakarot when you wouldn't or didn't offer yourself what matters is that we need to find him and set him straight as the two of them talk piccolo arrives having heard the conversation just now namekian would you cease your eavesdropping for once all right i guess you do want to hear my idea anyway idea mentions goku well any idea be great right now if trying to calm his mind is what you're looking for then maybe you could take him somewhere where he can do so set his head straight you mean tell us to give him another dose of what he did in front of trunks mention vegeta piccolo shakes his head no that would only be a small bandage or a gaping wound it will last piccolo looks up and then brings up yardrat goku what was that training like did it help you focus it all goku thinks for a second trying to recollect his time there all those years ago well yeah it did but it was really boring though i had to skip most of it when i since frieza was heading for earth but you know trunks saved the day yeah well i guess it could be handy but we still need to find broly though and convince him to come with us for training vegeta crosses his arms and offers to go look for him i'll go like i said he's my responsibility he can see goku putting his hand up offering to go with him as well but the prince shakes his head you're the last person who should go remember one look at you might make him blow up wherever we stand you stay here now we just need a lead king kai then decides to interject for the first time since broly left i can help you there prince king kai goku stammers why didn't i think of asking you before yeah says the king with indignation why didn't you am i really that forgettable these days did you forget that you killed me is that how it is goku huh enough shouts vegeta if you've got any leads tell us now broly is a danger to the universe king with the power he's learnt with king kai calmed down he then informs them that he could sense broly's energy drifting across the galaxy with no real destination in particular he was just drifting around towards south galaxy wait south galaxy mata's king kai why is it rigger oh no we need to go no the gang assumed that with his mind so broken right now he might be regressing back to his more recent memories prior to his arrival on earth and his most recent core memory prior to that and that was the destruction of south galaxy was he about to decimate it for a second time goku transmits piccolo and vegeta back to capture corps and the prince orders one of the remaining space vehicles to be primed for launch goku offers to go with vegeta one more time but the prince ignores him insisting that he be the one to bring burly back when the ship blasts off vegeta starts to work the control systems and scanners locking onto the codes and serial numbers of the ship that broly had taken that was a little bit of a help and luckily since leaving earth's atmosphere and with perhaps hints from king kai along the way he was actually able to get a good lock on and he was now on autopilot in hot pursuit with everything in place vegeta turns around and spots kakarot what the hey vegeta i knew you would take no for an answer so i decided to answer it for you i'm coming along vegeta is shouting expletives at goku for minutes on end but in the end goku honestly and sincerely responds as to why he's coming along this is all my fault vegeta i should have been honest with him from the start because of me he's losing his mind and he might end up losing more than that if he's not careful we gotta bring him back and get him to yardrat it's our only hope of getting his mind under control for good please believe me vegeta i want to help no you don't want to help him you want to fight him don't you that's why you're here mata's the prince getting the real reason goku is here no this is important i'm serious vegeta let me help you he offers his hand to vegeta to assert this but the prince turns away but that being said he does finally accept goku being here just don't get in my way don't do anything stupid you got that kakarot nods and the two now set off for broly's craft together they get closer and closer to broly's ship and after what seem like days they find it but instead of landing exactly next to the craft they decide to land on a nearby planet and transmit to broadly from there when they get their resolve going they nodded each other are you prepared to do the dance vegeta he blushes and grudgingly nods at least nobody that we know can witness it so embarrassing with that they arrive to find broly screaming at the top of his lungs green energy spewing from his person in a marvel-like fashion up into the sky its length is as far as the eye can see its limits beyond measure whatever he was doing it was certainly dramatic what is he doing ponders vegeta but goku can make a very solid guess he's trying to siphon off his overflowing key sending it out into space he must know that his body can't take it or he's trying to keep himself from losing it maybe there's still something left of his fortitude after all let's hope that it doesn't come to anything life-threatening says vegeta vegeta carefully flies towards broly and calls out his name the ark doesn't cease and broly turns his head amidst the green energy the gita what are you don't do this broly you've come so far don't throw it all away do not descend to the depths that your father led you all those years ago you're better than that we can help you let us help you please broly which either looks stern and resolute despite his emotive words broly's face starts to soften a little the shaft of energy starts to shrink a little bit as his expression relaxes but yeah goku immediately misreads the situation thinking it was all done lies interview before he can even say a word broly's face can torts into rage again kakarot you imbecile what are you doing get out of here the cheetah you tricked me kakarot the ark instead of shrinking expands even larger than it was before it explodes in brilliant white light and we are met with legendary super saiyan blue broly at full power its eyes white out and its frame is larger than ever damn it what did i even agree to incoming kakarot come and fix your mess kakarot is looking worried but he promises to help they both power up to blue and together they try to stop broly by force something they hope they didn't have to do the ground around them is being torn up second by second as the battle intensifies the pair of saiyans do have the upper hand against broly but only for the first few moments of the tussle because it was very clear that broly's body was pumping out key faster and faster by the second instead of pushing it out of his body like he was doing before the green energy was now surrounding the saiyan and being used within its body against his teachers he was completely and utterly out of control goku then pushes into something he had been working on he hoped it would work kaio-ken blue does it work no broly is still beating him down focusing on him more kakarot vegeta is getting very vivid flashbacks of the days of that time before comet komori decimated that farce of a world that was reportedly new planet vegeta he hoped he would never have to relieve those days again but here he was kakarot he shouts we have to do that stupid dance it's the only way to save him goku was surprised to hear vegeta offering to do this and in a fit of enthusiasm kicks broly out of the way enough time to transmit to vegeta and then fuse into gogeta gogeta gazes of broly and the latter stares back without recognition however the battle is now pretty conclusive this gojita instead of the one in dragon ball super broly where he's basically a carbon copy of vegito was far more methodical and to the point like confusion reborn instead of blustering around like a carbon copy of vegeta like i said gogeta quietly powers up to blue and starts to overpower broly which in turn makes broly push even more with one final attack broly pulls out an omega blaster against gogeta's stardust breaker the two attacks connect but the breaker surges through the blaster like a drop of washing up liquid surging water away that cool science experiment it hits broly and is enough to make his body shudder and shake with pain before sending the body to the floor in a heap unconscious but alive for a few seconds gogeta watches over him looking for any signs of movement after a minute it was clear that he wasn't going to be getting up anytime soon gogeta lands in front of him and places a hand on his forehead really he mutters to himself don't give up when gogeta defuses goku transmits both vegeta and broly back to their ship and they head for yard rat directly when they get there broly is still out cold thanks to all the energy that he'd used up he was injured too which made him less likely to blow up again the two saiyans exit the ship and rushed to bibara's chamber the guardrations are surprised to see goku back again but they make way for the pair of them to carry broly to their masters quarters when pibara sees the three of them arrive he hails goku ah son goku what a surprise it's been so long since we last met have you come back to finish up your training another time perhaps mister but we got something we need your help with our friend's mind is in danger danger you say bibar looks down at broly whose face is calm and in a state of sleep that is until his white eyes open suddenly and stare back at bibara broly was awake pibara and broly's eyes met the white and empty pools laying down on the mat were filled with rage despite being devoid of character it was clear that broly even with his energy and key at a relatively low level he was still recovering from all of the output that he exerted earlier he was still quite dangerous though to anyone on yardrat who wasn't goku or vegeta however pibara didn't flinch despite the saiyans bracing themselves pibara get back broly's out of control vegeta shouted it pained him to say that though saying that not only his pupil of many years now had lost his cool but also that he had failed at his own personal mission to better him after all this time it seemed like it was all for naught he'd done nothing to improve broly's condition it sickened him to utter those words even to himself no need to worry my friends this shall not lead to harm pibara raised his hands over broly and the saiyan's face eased and his eyes closed sending the hulk back into a deep sleep well if only we knew that earlier things would have been way easier you don't want to talk kakarot if you hadn't buzzed in when you did i might have succeeded at calming him down then we wouldn't need to be here gentlemen please calm down do you need a nap like our friend here he motioned to broly this was enough to stop the two bickering so tell me goku what seems exactly to be the problem is this a case of insomnia for your compatriot no mister it's a lot more complicated than that have you got the time pibar nodded i always have time for you friend to explain with that goku explained the whole widget the saga of broly to his former master he told him everything the events with paragus and the comet at the beginning the arrival on earth entombed in ice losing his memory the struggles with god ki and then up to the revelation of his amnesia slipping away and revealing the truth of kakarot and his reason for seeking him out all this time it wasn't admiration something broly thought for so long it was revenge pibara took everything in without flinching or seeming disinterested i see this is indeed a very somber affair so do you seek guidance from myself they both not is there anything you can do to fix his memory or make him better if you're asking me to wipe his mind up your influence vegeta then that would be immoral huh immoral why look where that has gotten you all today wiping memories granted he would never remember the truth about you but really could you live with yourselves knowing that he had been tampered with in some way to make him what he will become afterwards he would be physically healthy yes but his soul would ultimately be clipped what makes him him would be compromised from its full potential it might even curtail his power and that might not be prudent given how everything seems to be getting more and more chock-filled with power these days right goku looked a little put out but he understood ultimately well what can we do then if we can't erase his memory then how can we stop him from lashing out again said a rather concerned but annoyed vegeta there is plenty we can do i can take him under my wing and assist him in balancing out his mind without the need of amnesia it did work up to a point but with my help we can eliminate that worry of going rogue for good does that mean you can focus his key and stuff pibara like he did with me said goku with excitement in his voice kakarot please this is not the time for you and your desire to fight strong people to show up this is broly's livelihood we're talking about pipbar looked serious siding with vegeta indeed you're right to a point from what i can sense his mind is so riddled with trauma it would either take many years to fix entirely or or such intense training in such a short space of time it could make things worse if it doesn't take this shocks goku and vegeta even worse how could it get even worse this decision needs to be made by broly and broly alone i understand that you both have his best interests at heart but this one here also has a say in the matter before he wakes up i do request one thing that you depart yard rat this gets under vegeta's skin what leave him here are you crazy we've had to deal with his outburst first hand and barely came out of it with our lives oh vegeta i thought you had every faith in your pupil is that no longer the case after seeing his true self debara was right he just questioned broly's fortitude despite backing him up just a few seconds ago he remained quiet but pibara understood the impact of this revelation i promise you i will take care of him now please for this to work to the fullest i must ask you to leave when broly is ready he will come and find you only then will he be rid of his demons forever goku and vegeta look to him and then to the master goku pat's probably shoulder take care broly i hope we meet again in better circumstances vegeta turns away and doesn't say anything vegeta are you sure you don't want to go say goodbye of course not this is not the last time we shall meet what is the point of saying goodbye now goku looked stunned as vegeta headed back to the ship he turned back to his master feeling worried don't worry goku i can tell that he's worried let him calm down now go we will be fine the saiyan nodded and followed the prince when broly came to he looked around his surroundings he wasn't angry or out of control or anything he had calmed down to his base self he spotted a yard dration tending to his bedside he thought he would have been shocked to see the strange thing but he felt oddly assured by his presence the attendant then looked up and saw that broly was conscious and smiled oh good you're awake i shall go tell master the good news wait here broly nodded cautiously and sat up in bed thinking to himself how did he get here pibara arrived a few minutes later and greeted broly with a warm welcome glad to see you are awake my friend we have a lot to discuss tell me how do you feel i feel odd like my body's been through a lot that i can't explain how long have i been asleep since you got here about a week a week wow whatever happened must have been intense the master smiled good the rest was sufficient enough to expunge the negative emotions as of late that had been building up he was now at his most docile for the time being you are here broly to learn something rather insightful your master vegeta requested the training vegeta right i don't remember him talking about this with me are you sure what you say is true positive we attractions do not make up such things brutally nodded to that statement well okay so what do we do all in good time for now get to know the town i shall have my assistant here escort you around with that broly got to know the yadratians very well and they in turn became very good friends with him he quite liked the calm nature of these people it all felt rather tame and quaint this was crucial in aiding his recovery and over the months that followed he and pabara would focus on his basic training in fortifying his mind pibara did have to admit that this task was probably one of the most difficult that he had to undertake in a very long time however he was still open to the challenge and soon enough he was getting results broly's aura was getting far less muddled and much more pliable soon enough the time came to discuss the k word broly how do you feel when i say the name kakarot broly's arm tensed up his teeth gritted slightly and his aura started to boil even though it wasn't visible pibara was a little nervous but he dared not show it any sign of faltering now and all this training would be put back weeks or at worst he'd be back to square one the rest of his assistants prepared to sedate broly but it wasn't necessary broly calm down and sighed kakarot that name brings me pain but from a long time ago pibara smiled of course it would you have been through a lot my friend in your time it is okay to feel sad about certain things there is no point suppressing such things it'll only make it worse burly smiled thank you master what does this mean it means pibara said that we can move on now to the real training real training oh yes now that you don't feel as worked up about kakarot anymore broly's fists clenched slightly but he remained focused we can start to refine your energy to the point where all of your output is under your total control total control you possess great power broly if used to its fullest at all times you could be the strongest force for good in the universe broly was blown away at this news to hear he could be stronger than anyone in the universe if you put his mind to it maybe even more so than beerus perhaps well this excited him and so began broly's proper training the kind that goku did back in the postnemic saga now i bet you're wondering actually what's happened to the tournament of power in all of this well it still happened but without broly it took a lot of quelling beerus's temper but they had to explain that including broly in the team roster at this stage might not be beneficial and in fact it might lead to the team being disqualified goku being killed if he was provoked instant disqualification with that in mind beerus grudgingly relented and instead they went with the same team as they did with the original series since their powers differed very little in comparison we had basically the same outcome from the tournament as we did in the show you know ultra instinct goku and all of that so there's no need to retread or ground here if you will however since this is an april fool what if we'll include a little easter egg we don't usually do for what ifs or at least not yet we shall throw a nod tomorrow here so let's go it's been about a year or so since broly arrived on yardrad and his training had been going rather well he was in the latter stages of his initial meditation training and was more determined than ever it had been a snowball effect the more relaxed and focused he became the further he wanted to push his boundaries and resolve which then meant he would focus more and relax more he had become a whole new person and with the gift of patience on his side as well as distance from goku for a considerable amount of time and from the battlefield broly had never felt better it was put to the test when out of the blue vegeta arrived on yardrat when he was up on the plinth he turned his eye to the plinth next to him and saw his master right by him regaled in the same uniform as he master vegeta turned to him and shushed him shh this little time to explain broly soon i shall tell you he turned away before turning back again it's good to see you friend broly smiled yes you too vegeta resumed his own training and chuckled at last some good news broly finished his meditation at the same time as the prince albeit broly had a few months head start obviously and the two caught up the latter realizing how much karma broly had become and strong this was of course put to the test when morris goons arrived led by yuzun to capture vegeta and yard rat however with broly here too yeah that was no contest yusun and his men were often seconds both the prince and his pupil were stunned at their brand new focused key remarkable broly you pack as much of a punch as you did when you yeah when i got angry yeah i do but now i can do it all the time i see we could really use your help on earth broly there is a terrifying power terrorizing not only it but the rest of the universe nowhere is safe broly did contemplate this but he shook his head no master i'm not ready i've only just started my proper training like you if i leave too soon this might all be undone i can't risk blowing up in front of kakarot anymore you you said to say your name yeah i can do that now without getting mad i remember everything from my youth but it's all right where i am right now it's a good place blowly nodded and a firmed his stance he wouldn't help it's like i said vegeta when broly is fully ready he will return i promise vegeta i will vegeta scale but understood soon enough vegeta transmitted out of there and went on to do his bit in stopping morris rampage years passed the 25th tenkaichi budokai was approaching and goku and vegeta were keen to test themselves in this time of peace but they then saw somebody somebody who honed into view when the two saiyans have caught up themselves a tall man with shaggy hair and scars over his face and body but the smile was warm soft and familiar it was broly he looked at peace he felt normal and he was happy and that's where we end things with broly finally all good so what did you folks think do you feel this was an apt way to end broly's struggle with his past are you happy that he is happy with his lot leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and i shall see you in the next video catch you later
