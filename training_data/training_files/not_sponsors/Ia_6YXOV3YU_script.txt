Ep.2 of Yerihan Bang with TWICE Nayeon! It's time for Yerihan Photo Box~☺☺ Time for a hearty cheer! (Alrighty, let's just clap👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻) Heard through the grapevine(?) that Yerihan Bang wrote a Signal Song...? Is it ready? (Of course)
Actually, I~ (DJ Yeri always keeps her promise)
have the Signal Song with me today Shall we take a listen? Yep! Let's go ahead!👌🏻👌🏻 (Super excited)
Great! Oh! You even recorded it (by yourself)? Yeah... But it's very short though..😅 (Hehe... I did it..😏) "I'll always stay by your side like that" "As always, I am" "waiting in this very room" (Never seen DJ Yeri's Shy Face🤭)
"My room, your room, Yerihan Bang*"
*Bang = Room in Korean (Did DdooDdoo* do a good job?) How is it?
*Yeri's nickname (My DdooDdoo is the best!)
It's really good! Really~? It feels like a legit radio broadcast! (Our easily-influenced DdooDdoo's mood improved by +10💗) (10,000 points for the lyrics)
It's really good~ Like the lyrics are so smooth too~ (10,000 points for Catchiness)
Plus, it's short and catchy so it leaves a solid impression! (Genius Rim* - Approved💗)
(~By Production Staff~)
*Genius + Yerim (Yeri's real name) To have Yerihan Bang stay by your side forever, there's something we need, right~? I've never done this before! LOL (That is none other than turning on the notifications, subscribing to and liking Yerihan Bang)

Since it's embarrassing, we have to jump through swiftly! Talking about Nayeon's All-time-best Photo! We'll begin! (📸'Einspänner' that she had with Yeri) This seems incredibly familiar... Right~ We've had this not long ago We've had this together~ (📸A 'waffle' that she had with Yeri) (Looking at it) I'm craving it again... (Gulp...😅) Next time, eh...? (📸'Watermelon juice' that she had with Yeri) In that cafe... (📸'Pork belly' that she had with Yeri) Look at that gorgeous steamed egg... (DJ Lovelyim*'s sentimental eyes)
We don't really come up with plans~
*Lovely + Yerim (Yeri & Nayeon destroyed 4 menus in a flash gathering) We always eat like this whenever we meet up, right? A lot of people are surprised by this~ (All those Nayeon's photos were taken during a single meal!!)
We only have food photos lol...😅 We always... (I mean, doesn't everyone eat like this...?)
eat like this! Eating goodies and sharing the photos with my friends, and seeing them being jealous of us (That's the truth of life right there!🤟🏻)
OHHHH! RIGHT! I LOVE THAT~😂😂😂 Simply looking at the photos... Somehow... (Super proud)
gets me full LOOL Right right LOOL We usually eat like this whenever we gather! (Eating-mate)
Can we briefly try a food pair test? (Although we eat well) I think our preferences differ! Come on~ Why~ So, I know what Yeri will probably choose I'll just be honest with my opinion, ok? (I, Nayeon Lim, pledge to be honest before the test✋🏻)
I mean, there's nothing really good about matching preferences, right? Nope! I mean, the only way to order various dishes is by having different preferences! Ok ok! Let's go! I'm going to be brutally honest! (⭐⭐Food Pair Test - START⭐⭐) (Q. Jjajangmyeon vs Jjamppong)
*Black bean noodles vs Spicy noodles with vegetables and seafood - Jjamppong
- Jjajangmyeon LOOOOOOOOOL (Q. Sauce for deep-fried food : Pour vs Dip) - Pour
- Dip AHAHAHA MY GOSH! LOL (Q. For Tteokbokki* - Wheat rice cake vs Rice cake)

This is kind of tough... MEAT!!!! Ooh, got it~🧡 (Q. For pasta: Tomato vs Cream) 🍅Tomato🍅 I knew it!! LOOOL (Questions) 3 out of 7 means... (Our positive Nayeon rounded it off(?) to half~🧡)
We got half of them~ (DJ Lovelyim is a math police though)

Remember to prepare a hefty amount of compliments for Yeri❤ Ugh... I know, right? I mean, I've been making you talk about good things about me...😅 (💛Promoting TWICE's new song isn't over yet!💛) (Was Yerihan Bang a great platform for promotion~?)
The broadcast isn't over yet, but do you think we helped for the promotion? (Of course!)
