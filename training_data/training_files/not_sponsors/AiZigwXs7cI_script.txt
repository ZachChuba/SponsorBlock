hey guys welcome back today we're looking at the horrifying disturbing yet ultimately sad life of halos most disturbing character Faber the master builder if you want to dive believe me just heavier self or audiobooks I bought in a hundred and ten thousand nine hundred and sixty two BC favor of will and might was a foreigner that would ultimately leave one of the darkest marks on his species history during the human foreigner war Faber attained the rank of master builder and was originally a more conventional foreigner he supported the died acts more humane plans to not entirely wipe out the ancient humans but instead just destroy invading forces and exile all the remaining survivors back to their home planets so they could abide by the mantle and responsibilities in 98 thousand BC he in the Didact also worked together to create the infamous artificial intelligence mendicant bias that would ultimately go on to wreck the entire foreigner civilization as well as illegally helping the Didact create his warship the mantles approach the builders most prized creation however was his most destructive one hailer rails constructed after first contact with the food was made during the human foreigner war the Halos would act as an ultimate failsafe should the flood return a method of self-destruction that would cost the galaxy of all of its life just so the floods couldn't succeed Weber did faced a lot of opposition when trying to build the halo array as he would imagine it was seen as a direct violation of the mantle of responsibility and everything the foreigner stood for his most prominent opponent was his old ally the Dai dice of whom went into exile when faber got his way and ended up building the array the die ducks wife the librarian that life shaper also put up a pretty strong opposition to the halo rings and only let construction go ahead when the council allowed her to create another plan known as the conservation measure this entailed storing samples of all life-forms in the galaxy on the halo ring us so that should the array be activated and everything dies the galaxy could be repopulated by the stores on the halo rings and life could continue relatively close to how it was before just this time with a lot less flood however the return of the flood and the onset of the foreigner' flood war sparked Faber's descent into madness driven by a lethal cocktail of fear desperation and power he began experimenting on the librarian samples to try and find a cure for the flood and as we know one of his main focuses were the humans when the flood first showed up they didn't seem to attack the humans so faber assumed there must be something about them as a species that makes them immune to the flood so he began desperately experimenting on them in the most sickening ways possible humans were shipped from earth to the Palace of pain on installation o7 to have their gayish forcibly removed in acts directly violating the mantle little did Faber know however the humans perceived immunity to the flood was just a strategy on their behalf and it meant Faber was chasing a dead end in the most disturbing way possible when Faber ordered mendicant bias to test fire installation o7 he accidentally freed the primordial the last precursor now part gravemind he ordered mendicant bias to interrogate it which led to the turning point of the entire war the primordial infected mendicant bias with the logic lead converting it over to the flood while also gaining control of the ring and ordering Faber to continue his futile experiments on the humans for nothing but the pleasure they all gained from it some years later faber travelled to the homeworld of the ancient prophets to seek information to help defeat the flood seeing as they'd managed to somehow defeat them with humanity in the years prior but still Faber didn't know that that was a plan on the flipper half in what could be best described as a deal gone wrong the prophets rebelled causing Faber to fire installation oh seven wiping out most ancient sunshine meanwhile as the war raged on Faber managed to capture the Didact the leader of the foreigner military and his old ally and enemy after failing to extract information from him via interrogation he left the Didact for dead stranded on a vacant ship in a part of the galaxy known as a burn one of the most terrifying areas of the galaxy a region totally consumed by the flood these actions against the Didact and the use of the halo against the mantle angered many of the foreigners as he could imagine who led a rebellion against Faber to bring him for justice for his sickening crimes Faber security force managed to suppress the physical rebellion but politically fever lost and was put on trial at the foreigner capital of may thrill ian having his rank as master builder taken away however during the trial flood controlled mendicant bias appeared above the capital with insulation oh seven allowing Faber to escape his persecution with the help of a former Promethean who he ultimately exiled to the same burn as methide act so the moral of the story really here is to never trust Faber now on the run from the foreigner council Faber began a new life in exile as a fugitive he survived in an isolated region of foreigner space remaining relatively active in the war against the flood with his security force accompanied by exiled warrior servants fighting beside him continuing his disturbing ways Faber would capture food controlled ships claim to decon Hammond ate them and then sell them to warrior servants only for them to be consumed by the flirt pretty much as soon as they got on board by the flood that was stowed away in doing this he found the ship somebody on board but he never thought he'd ever see again somebody he thought was long that that died died after faber had left him stranded in the burn the gravemind had found the Didact and tortured him for decades giving him a form of the logic plague and sending the most powerful foreigner in charge of the entire military insane not only this but the die that came bearing a message from the great mine that would absolutely destroy Faber his wife and children had been consumed by the flirt he used to create the grave mind that sent him this very message given the dialects insanity caused by the grave mind and what Faber had done to him in the foreigners he took great pride in revealing that all of this his family dying was Faber's fault had he not testified installation o7 and released the primordial his family would still be alive Faber distraught with his actions took the die back back to the capital and when they arrived they discovered the foreign leadership had been evacuated to the greater Ark and the final survivors of the council laughed at me thrill ian did something truly desperate despite interrogating Faber and him admitting to all of his past crimes against the foreigners they were losing the war against a flood so badly they had no choice to reinstate all of Faber's power despite all of his previous misdeeds it was here where the council laid out their final defense plans with the halo rings most of the council were ready to put their faith in the Didact and whatever he deemed the right choice for the future of the foreigners but Faber insisted that this wasn't wise the insanity sowed within him by the grave mind meant that he was unable to make a decision as as large as one that would dictate the future of his species Faber convinced the council by telling them how the Didact enjoy telling him about the death of his family and their consuming by the flood to which they were sympathetic and all in agreement that the Didact words were tainted fast a much desperation the entire council agreed favours planners in one of the final great battles of a flood war mendicant bias assaulted the greater Ark which was a bigger version of the ark that we know in the current Halo universe that existed back then mendicant came with flirt and precursor artifacts which he used to quite literally shatter the greater art into pieces Faber was stationed onboard Ommegang low above the greater arc with plan is to fire it directionally at the path cathode a galaxy one rich with precursor artifacts and one infected by the flood born stellar who had become the isodidact in the earlier years of the war which is basically where the Didact imprints his personality on to another foreigner thus creating the isodidact was also on board omega healing most likely so he could see what happened when a halo ring was fired prior to firing Faber gave Bourne some of the coordinates for the lesser arc which is the arc in the current healing universe so he could travel there distribute the new halo array which is again the halo array in the current healer universe and activate it ending it all when he asked Faber why he had to do it Faber told Bourne mostella that he was to share the same fate as his arc and the last of his halos his creation is that started this to send him to madness and ultimately shaped him as a foreigner for better or worse in the final hours of his life Faber had finally gained a sense of humanity for sake of a better word he showed regret for his sickening actions and saw staying on Omega halo and going out to try and save the species that he must treated in so many ways as a way to repent his sins and make up for the acts of horror that he'd committed throughout his life with the ark and the heavy attack Faber fired Omega Halo but the precursor star owed that mendicant bias had come to attack with hit the ring tearing it into pieces and destroying the control room thereby ending the life a favour of will and might the master builder Faber was a twisted character and doubtedly the most disturbing character in the entire Halo universe but to see him come full circle at the end of his life and go down trying to save everything that he dedicated his life towards for better or worse was honestly a fantastic ending for the enigma of a foreigner throughout my life I sought power and profit for myself for my rate now at long last I think I understand the meaning of a crime against the mantle after this no need to seek balance I will await my penance here thanks a lot for watching guys I want to give a big thank
