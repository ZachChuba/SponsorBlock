there it is malibu-ish pineapple old-fashioned how did i how did i get here what happened holy [ __ ] [Music] hey i'm a fan and a friend of the mover and shaker and company guys they make very cool pins that you can get if you join my patreon and also we're gonna have some new pins that we're gonna be selling on their website so you should check those out too i put a link in the pinned comment and stuff right there anyway they've got a really fun instagram and they've been doing this series on their instagram which you should follow where they share these impossible awful head scratcher drink receipts that people have turned in from customer requests so we're gonna call this episode the customer is always wrong and today we've printed out a bunch of those receipts and meredith threw them in a bowl i don't know what's in here and i'm gonna pull him out and see if i can make him on the fly you know i'm just gonna take it like we got the order and we gotta make the drink that's what this is about that's it that's it that's the whole setup let's make some drinks what is this one table 23 four guests they want a bullet rye old-fashioned with an egg with an egg white what hand's a mystery i'm gonna need a bottle of bullet rye some eggs thank you hands of mystery i don't want to make this drink this is bad zombie this hurts my brain there is no earthly way to add an egg white to an old-fashioned this presents a conundrum an old-fashioned is a stirred drink it is not a sour it shall not be shaken but yeah i didn't even think i guess i guess if you're adding an egg white to an old-fashioned i guess you shake it maybe it'll actually be good i don't know maybe this maybe the customer's right maybe this guy's on to something crazy let's find out i got my simple syrup here i'm going to add a little bit like a little more than a quarter ounce you know you don't want to be too sweet still want to be an old-fashioned on my two dashes of ango part of me is thinking like what if you go more but no we should keep it like an old-fashioned and two ounces of bullet rye which by coincidence i happen to have probably bought this for the manhattan matrix i'm gonna add an egg white yeah yep okay that's it that's it let's just shake that drink dry shake it frothy might work as nice yeah it's old-fashioned right so shook egg white but big rock scoob i'm gonna double strain this one not very appealing looking this is a bad looking drink just doesn't look good but that doesn't mean much maybe this is a good drink and i've presented it poorly yes i need an orange i don't know maybe this is gonna be good i'll give it this one i'm giving the benefit of the doubt peeling orange peel white old fashion for table 23. let's see how it is [Music] it's weird it's like it's not as it's not as horrible as i expected it to be it's not good i don't love it i don't like it at all it's not like huh it's just kind of huh the more i think about the more i hate it it's lost all of its snap i think that shaking it has over watered it i really think that's kind of what it comes down to and then we further diluted it with the egg white because that's like an ounce of non you know spirit that we added there and so it's missing a lot of the qualities that make an old-fashioned old-fashioned it's not anymore really spirit forward it's not like a showcase for the rye anymore it is neither a sour nor an old fashioned sort of dissatisfies on both fronts without ever becoming a new thing that is good i suppose one could drink it but i choose not to in conclusion i will say that the customer table 23 is wrong and that this drink is bad it is also unattractive it is ugly and just terrible it's terrible let's do another customer and now back to the show next receipt here we go table 203 has requested a paper plane no april sub cranberry what uh magic hands i need yup i need that cranberry juice oh yeah there's ocean sprays good stuff hey le man yes this and that thank you very much thank you yeah i mean it's got the potential to be okay it's all equal parts so cut a lemon in half i'm gonna go one ounce of lemon juice paper plane is invented at milk and honey i think it was invented by sam ross but i'm not actually sure off the top my head in our weirdo version that does not have april we're gonna do one ounce of cranberry juice i don't know why you would do that i understand not wanting campari but i can't understand not wanting april one ounce of amaro no nino a nice maro but i frankly only own it to make paper planes and one ounce of uh strong you know cast strength bourbon bakers would be fine shake that up with some ice strain away then we have the order for table two 203 a paper plane with the april swapped out for cranberry juice oh it doesn't smell good it's amazing how much one little thing can throw a drink off oh oh that's bad wow it's amazing how bad that turned out oh man it's just so tart what the hell it's crazy how powerful cranberry is because that is the flavor of this drink and just enough just enough bourbon and amaro come through over the cranberry and lemon that it kind of tastes has like a note of rotting carrots just like rotting putrid carrots like a pile of rotten carrots yep god damn no i hate this drink oh yes the peanut the peanut in the bourbon comes out um but in this profile combo kind of tastes carry i'm gonna pour this out now i already poured it out but the customer was wrong two or three wrong wrong let's pull another one of these recipes out and see what i get seat one midori margarita i'm a dory margarita doesn't say with salt or without ha ha ha i'm a dory margarita hence the fate we're gonna need a few things thank you hands of fate is this the fortaleza blanco yeah okay that's perfect that's great this is a top shelf margarita oh the very finest midori one ounce of lime juice for midori margarita god i do love the smell of lime juice it's just unbelievable powerfully transported the smell of lime juices it's just like where's the vacation love it i need an ounce of midori you know if i just see midori margarita i think you swap out the modifier you swap out the the um the curacao the cointreau whatever you want to use in your margarita and you would make it the midori i've never had to make a midori margarita so i don't have any idea what spec to use i'm just gonna do this as if i was making a margarita but not using cointreau i'm gonna use midori so i've got one ounce of midori which is probably a lot and i've got two ounces of my blanco tequila using fort eleza which is a good blanco tequila available from our friends at curiata where many fine spirits are sold and we're gonna put some ice in here and shake it up one ice cream goes in one ice cube gets cracked shaky shaky shaky oh a real margarita glass even better than a coop green whoa that is green i gotta tell you if this is halfway drinkable you garnish that with a chunk of watermelon look good i don't think it's gonna be halfway drinkable let's see if the customer over a table one with his midori margarita is on to something no they're not god that's bad oh it gets weirder too no it's a bad drink that's a bad one very few drinks are bad in that way it is just so bitter um and just bitter and not bitter it's just so tart it's so tart i mean it is so tart oh my god and or herby in all the ways you don't really want anything to be it just kind of tastes like skunky and tart sour skunk it's a skunk sour that's what i'm gonna call this drink you know the one thing i do have to contemplate although midori is pretty sweet it should be sweet i really expected this drink to be sweet i'm gonna try something stupid i'm gonna throw it back in my shaker real quick and i'm just gonna throw in like a drop of simple i know a lot of people add some sweetness to their marks maybe maybe when table one was making these guys at home as if maybe when they were bringing it home they made it a little sweeter giving them really the benefit of the dab oh my god though it's absolutely luminescent it's so green i swear to god this drink is actually glowing well it's way less tart it is still terrible it has no goodness it has no there is no goodness in this it has a soul that is made of just vile filth it is a bleak abyss of despair this drink is worse than any drink has right to be considering what a simple combination of ingredients it is it's not like i took a bunch of tabasco sauce and mayonnaise and egg whites and vodka or something like that and threw that together and made a joke of it like this is an honest attempt at somebody making a drink and it it's unbelievable how bad it is given all of those things being true for a single substitution the smell of rotting hay that is a very specific smell that is so bad just the foulest smell if you've ever been a couple of times they've used hay bales around like when they were doing construction and changing an interchange and then they left them out in the rain and they got wet and then they rotted in the sun that hay bale rotting smell it's in this drink if you've ever wanted to have that as a cocktail the midori margarita is the luminescently neon green drink for you and with that i conclude that the customer at table 1 is [ __ ] wrong and that this drink must be poured into the gutter of history and sometimes it just like surprises you with this very like surprise mint mint hello you know it was like you you you've just grown accustomed to the nightmare of rotting skunk piled maggot infested hay bales and then i think i can stomach one more receipt let's see here oh this one was right on top what's this uh from the patio well table 322 in the dining room a malibu pineapple old-fashioned what the [ __ ] what the who would do that why would you do that malibu pineapple old-fashioned not malibu not the coconut rum liqueur but the pineapple variant of the coconut rum liqueur i don't think i've got pineapple malibu do i have some kind of a pineapple rum bring that in mysterious hands oh good in the plastic jug parrot bay pineapple caribbean rum with natural pineapple flavors only 21 alcohol by volume look malibu is not a rum it's a sweetened highly sweetened liqueur with the parrot bay pineapple being at 21 proof 21 i have a regular bottle of malibu oh yeah mysterious hands bring me the malibu i think it's i think it's got to be in the same ballpark oh 21 look at that i think we're in business i have a funny feeling this will be really good analog to the malibu you know it's not a perfectly scientific experiment but let's see how a quick taste a little nip yeah that's what i like once a while a little nip of the parrot bay pineapple rum yeah top of the morning to you here what the [ __ ] it tastes like pineapple it does not taste like rum it tastes real bad there's a an element of that that does not taste ingestible like i always joke that malibu tastes like drinking suntan lotion but like the smell of suntan lotion i assume that drinking suntan lotion would taste like your body rejecting it because it's made of poison that's what this tastes like just as soon as it hits your throat your body's like get it out get it out of me so we're going to make an old fashioned with that okay get yourself a nice big piece of ice there there you go add to it your couple dashes of angus store bitters i think that with a malibu pineapple old-fashioned you can go three or four actually you know normally just two but i would go a little extra on the bitters maybe i don't normally do this kind of thing but like i'm going to put in the smallest amount of simple syrup i could possibly manage a drop boop that's it not a bar spoon but like a dash a dasher of simple because this is all sugar and adding more sugar will be a mistake and now two ounces of plastic bottle pirate bay pineapple rum not a sponsor of this episode by the way i don't want anybody to think that we're showing favoritism there it is one malibu-ish old-fashioned just stir that in the glass until it's done feel your soul leave your body no i'm just waiting for the glass to get cold there it is the icy embrace of the void perfect and a twist of orange as an old-fashioned should have that's very important to this the preparation of this drink so don't mess around with that yeah you want to make sure you get all those oils i like to drop it right in the glass there it is malibu-ish pineapple old-fashioned how did i how did i get here what happened holy [ __ ] that's a smell pulp mill yeah like it's got straight up cabbage fart smell okay let's see how the malibu ish pineapple old fashioned is that was ordered for table 322. what what the [ __ ] oh god you have to track down who ordered this war will spring up in this person's wake nation will rise against nation the seas will turn as blood this person is the antichrist what had to be wrong with your mind come up with this a non-diseased soul could not have come up with a sentence such as malibu pineapple old-fashioned it just ain't rad i don't know how else to express to you the wretchedness of this glass oh it's all pulp mill it just tastes like drinking a pulp mill like rot and decay tinged with slightly spicy bitterness and fed pineapple notes it's plenty sweet uh my it was the right call to not add sweetness oh good lord this drink makes me want to quit the show this drink should be a meme i swear to god i i defy you to come up with a drink worse than this that's a real drink that's not just like i put together some motor oil uh horse jizz you know like like that would be worth sure but like that's not a thing that you could actually do go into your bar and invent a worse drink than the malibu pineapple old fashioned you cannot it cannot be done i there should be a [ __ ] x prize for this oh my god i didn't know that flavor was possible via known organic compounds my lord holy [ __ ] that's bad there's no part of you when drinking this that screams uh oh you drank ammonia or bleach or something like that like it never manages to fall outside of the imagined range of flavorable tastes i don't know how to explain that but like this is like a color out of space you know it's just a taste it's just a flavor but it burns so this customer is both very very very very wrong and also very very dangerous the person who invented this drink is a danger to all who surround them no customer could be more wrong this customer is very wrong oh my god i can't do any more of these damned receipts but as you can see there's quite a few more of these left so maybe we can revisit this idea when i've recovered if you really want to see more of this let me know shout out to mover and
