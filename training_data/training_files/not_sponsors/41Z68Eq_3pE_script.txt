what is going on everybody welcome to another ultimate beginner's guide to bossing in this video we're gonna be checking out two ways to safespot the wilderness ball tsveti on before we get can pledge to support my channel and if content alright so vetti on is a wilderness boss and he is a pretty serious wilderness boss because he has two forms ready Anna's a combat level of 454 in both forms of him have 255 HP which means you will be doing a total of 510 damage as max it is 46 he is aggressive his weakness is a crush and a Salva amulet and he attacks with a melee stabbed medium ranged attack and a magic attack which is range you can easily get out of the way of this we won't have to worry about this too much as for vetti ons more specific combat stats both forms remain the same attack level of 430 strength level of 430 defense level of 395 magic level of 300 in a range level of 1 as for the defensive stats + 201 to stab + 202 / negative 10 to crush + 252 magic + + 272 ranged now not only will we have to deal with vetti on himself vidiian will also spawn 4 hellhounds the first wave which comes at the first form half HP is going to be the skeleton hellhounds these have a combat level of 214 and a hit points level of 110 there is 2 of them you must kill both of them as for the greater skeleton hellhound vetti on will spawn this in his second form at half HP these have a combat level of 281 and a hit points level of 190 killing these is the only time that we will need to use protect from melee all other times you will be safe spotting vetti on if you are looking he killed somebody on and get that sweet pet or maybe a ring of the gods drop you can find vetti on roaming around south of lava dragon Isles somewhere around 35 to 36 wilderness there's going to be a couple ways to get here actually three and I will cover two of them and say a little piece about the third way the first way and my preferred way is going to be by using the game's necklace teleport I will use a teleport to house tablet go to my house use the game's necklace in my jewelry box and head to the corporal beasts lair from here I will exit the cave and run pretty much straight north to find vetti on this way I will have one open inventory space just so I can pick up my loot and put it in the looting bag as for the next method it's going to be by using the wilderness pond you can catch the canoe from edgeville you will need two acts for this I suggest just taking a bronze axe and dropping it once you get out there once again you'll have an inventory spot open to your loot in looting bag without using any supplies or dropping anything and the last method is going to be by using the wilderness teleport obelisks you can do this if you have one in your house and then you can run east to find vetti on I don't really suggest this because you're going to be running through a lot of higher-level wilderness at least with the corporate beast teleport you'll be starting low and working your way up giving you ample chance to escape if you start out a little bit deeper it might end badly and as always I do have some recommended stats for you guys first that is gonna be level 70 prayer now you can use the piety prayer and the protect from melee prayer at level 70 and this will speed up your kills significantly but don't get me wrong if you do have an alternate account or a peer or a lower level prayer account you can do vetti on just fine with just to protect from melee prayer incredible strength and ultimate reflexes as we're attacking strength I'm gonna recommend that you have an attack and strength level of both 85 now these skills are very long so you want to try to get them done as fast as possible 85 will allow you to do a decent amount of DPS if you have less than this well your kills are just gonna get longer and longer and you're gonna be out there risking your life just a little bit too long sometimes up next we will jump into the gear setup now I usually try to keep these cheap but for this one it's gonna be a little bit more expensive as for my gear setup I'm gonna be going with the helm of knits not a myth scape which you get from the completion of Dragon Slayer 2 this is best in slot for crush but if you don't have this you can use a fire Cape you can also use an RT Cape I will be using a South amulet EW but you don't actually need that what I do recommend that you have is the South amulet II which will give you plus 20% to undead creatures and this will be plus 20% to attack and strength it will speed up your kills by that much more I'm gonna be using a Radha's blessing because it is free and will increase my prayer by +2 the vicar's chain mace is gonna be my weapon of choice here and this does run for somewhere between five point five and six mil at the time of this video but because of its passive wilderness effect to do 50% more damage to wilderness monsters paired with the Salva amulet this thing will crush Betty on I will also mention right here that you can do Betty on on a skeleton Slayer task or a hellhound Slayer task because they both count depending on which task respectively I'm going to be going with a proselyte plate and legs but if you don't have this you can use a monk's robe top and bottom Sam Rock book for the +8 to the attack stats as well as the +5 prayer barrows gloves climbing boots and an explorer's ring for an additional +1 prayer now with this particular setup here I will be protecting the vigorous chain mace myself emulate a I and my barrows gloves assuming that I'm not scold over in the inventory I have one super combat potion 3 prayer potions a stamina potion to run to the Vettii on spawn and to help get away from P cares one super restore to saradomin brews 17 sharks one house teleport a looting bag and a royal seed pod the royal seed pod does work up to level 30 wilderness and luckily we will only be two levels away from that making an easy escape if possible now in my Venna natus guide i had a little bit better of a setup as for getting away from PKS but for vetti on we will always be in the multi combat zone so if you get caught you're most likely gonna die so I wouldn't be too worried about trying to survive but there is a little extra survivability built into this inventory setup alright so I think it is time that we jump into some kill clips I'm going to be showing you to kill clips of two different lures and one is going to be the lazy way and one is going to be the safer way so let's go ahead and into the lazy way first alright so starting out with the lazy way you can see here that I have a bunch of tiles mark this is 19 tiles all in a row marked I'm going to start marking them from that little cave entrance there on the western side and mark the next 19 consecutive tiles now this is gonna help us lure vetti on and get the lazy way safe spot setup so from here what I'm gonna do is run over and I'm gonna make sure vetti on it attacks me or gets aggressive towards me and what I'm gonna do here is walk it's very important that you walk here otherwise you might lose his aggressiveness now vetti on will occasionally throw a magic attack at you and this will hit in three spots very easily avoidable very slow moving what I'm gonna do once I get to that first tile by that cave is I'm gonna walk all the way to the very last tile here and this is the end of his aggressive range after I reach the end in vetti on stops moving I'm gonna walk back up towards him walk under him just about two tiles and now I'm gonna walk to the east once I get to the east vetti on will literally just stay in there and alls you have to do is just wail away with your vigorous chain mace no I will admit I totally derped here and entirely forgot to charge the Vigoroth chain mace with enough revenant ether to actually do the bonus damage the skill is gonna be pretty slow don't be like me remember to charge your weapon now here is where the hellhounds come out and for the hellhounds you can just back away put on protect from melee and go ahead and kill both of them it will take a little bit of time here because well once again i derped and forgot to charge my weapon up so I'll go ahead and speed up through this part now I will say here that if the hellhounds do spawn behind vetti on all you can do is just move to the north or south and you will unstick them and they will just come towards you the hellhounds are done and I am back on vetti on has got about 100 HP left and once I take this hundred HP down he is gonna turn orange and he is gonna go into his second form I want to talk about the safe spot real quick this is the lazy way because you don't have to move like you will be moving in the safer way that I'm gonna show you next but I also don't really recommend the safe spot either because of the chaos stores they always come around and can damage you over time it's kind of annoying to deal with them alright so I have gotten vetti on down to half HP in his second form and these are the greater skeleton hellhounds once again protect from melee kill the hellhounds and get back on vetti on and from here you are home free to finish your kill all right so moving on to the safer way now what you can see here is that I have four tiles marked here on the ground the first one here is gonna be right next to this tree stump which is pretty much directly south of Vettii on spawn point if you mark this you can hang out here and we'll use it in just a second so from here I'm gonna go ahead and run up to my north and get vetti on aggressive towards me once again after he is on me I'm just gonna wait for him to get a little bit close to me run down to this first tile and I will stand next to that until vet Eon stops moving one savetti on stops moving I'm gonna run over towards the west and go to my second tile here next to this outcropping of rocks once again I will wait for vetti on to get close to me once he stops moving I will move next to the third tile I want to note here that on these third and fourth tiles they are one row of tiles south of that second spot so make sure you don't mark the same row once again they're one row south of that second tile that I moved to now once I get to this third mark tile here what I am gonna do is I'm going to hit Betty on once and then move to the eastern fourth tile and hit Betty on twice after I hit him twice I'm gonna walk back to my third tile that I went to hit him once and move back to the East tile the fourth tile and hit him twice I'm just gonna keep doing this over and over again until vetti on gets down to half health and sponses hellhounds once vetti on sponses hellhounds I'm once again I'm gonna protect from melee and kill both of the hellhounds and same concept works here if the hellhounds do spawn to the north side of Vettii on you can simply move to the east or west here and they will get unstuck and come towards you now I want to talk about why this is the safer way if you see over there under my mini-map I am now in level 31 wilderness which puts me one level closer to being able to teleport and if you can see there on the screen that tree stump that is at the bottom of the video that is level 30 wilderness so you only have to take a few steps to get to level 30 wilderness use your grand seed pod and teleport to safety if you didn't bring grand seed pod or you don't have one you can actually replace the explorers ring with a ring of wealth and that will also work as a level 30 teleport out of the wilderness so pretty much from here you're just gonna be going back and forth between these two tiles with the one hit two hits all the way to the end of the kill I want to note here that if you are doing it this way whatever you kill the hellhounds always start on that third tile because you might forget like I do which number of hits you're on and the reason that we only do two hits on this most eastern tile is because if you do three hits vetti on will uh nag row and he will start to walk away from you so we always want to start on that Eastern third tile once we kill a hellhound or once we start the next form of Vettii on all right everybody that is gonna wrap up this guide to vet Eon I hope that it can point you in the right direction to getting a pet or one of those sweet ring of the Gods
