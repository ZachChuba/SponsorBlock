welcome to beer and board games folks as you join us on a dungeon crawling adventure of discovery as we play the dungeon the dungeon not to be confused with any other dungeon a dungeon or that dungeon yes or that dungeon i think is what it is right as a matter of fact right now i'd like to drink that beer [Music] that beer for tonight is foggy geezer hazy india pale ale oh um happy hoppy for poppy just jumps in your mouth i'm trying to identify that overriding flavor in there i can't quite get it pineapple there's lots of fruit flavors but it's not sweet at all all right well let's play this game we start out in a room a dungeon and we're all in this room together this game is going to explain it all to us via an app so i don't even have to i could read the book and read it all myself but why do that when a pleasant english man can do it for us you wake up from an uneasy sleep and search around in the dark your eyes wide open you still have goosebumps all over your body weren't you just walking through a torchlit stone passageway and then there was a noise or was it a scream that's what woke you now all is quiet again almost how did i even end up here you ask yourself trying to remember makes your head hurt though so you decide to take a look around you first in the moonlight streaming in through the barred window you slowly begin to make out details you're lying on the stone floor of a dirty cell a dungeon you quickly look back to the window indeed it's barricaded with solid iron bars one name remains clear in your foggy brain biringar maybe he's locked up somewhere within these walls too you resolve to find out what happened to you who imprisoned you here and above all how to escape this dungeon take mission card a1 read entry a on page two i'm glad that escaping this dungeon involves beer and gar now we're going to find out what's going on in the specific room that we're in as you look around the cell a huge locked wooden door 101 with several scratches in it 201 immediately catches your eye in front of it there is a grating in the floor 401 on the bunk you see a box 701 and beneath it something may be hidden in the shadows 601 a brick juts out of the wall to your left 501 while a skeleton clad in heavy iron chains hangs to your right 301 moonlight floods into the cell through a barred window 801 i'm just going to try to send you guys the the uh game board because i i believe i can do that hold on this is going to make everything awesome i've heard that before yeah i heard that the night i went out drinking with berengar this is gonna make everything awesome he said he hated me and benadryl benadryl huh it was a kirkland brand he's a costco member then yeah you know a good man and he bought the card he didn't use a friend stand up guy all right well we have to choose characters first erif the knowledgeable okoro the strong we've got cassandra the attentive or haruka the skilled knowledgeable i was going to be haruka i was going to be uh the attained the attentive attentive yes all right dion you're cassandra the attentive i'm okoro the strong i want to investigate the skeleton all right i hope it's got a pouch full of gold coins and not a scorpion in it you can explore that location you can combine an adventure card with another adventure card which you have none of so you're not going to do that or you can combine an adventure card with a location number listen up i'm knowledgeable i want to explore here we go matt this is what you find when you look at skelly a creepy skeleton is all that remains of this prisoner his arms are still chained to the wall with bronze shackles since he won't be needing his belongings anymore you decide to search the half rotten tunic that still hangs from his chest groping around you managed to locate a pocket do you want to reach inside if so take adventure card 15. oh yes it's a coin great for buying stuff yes first item of the game this is so exciting i love exploring this dungeon now i pretend that i'm [ __ ] the skull of the skeleton just to be funny yeah i'm gonna look out the bar window the bunk creaks as you stand on it to examine the window the bars are too close together to squeeze through when you rattle them you notice that one of the iron bars is loose though take adventure card 11. a solid iron bar give somebody a beat down that's right and we can trade our objects whenever we like so if anyone if matt at any point you feel like someone else will be benefited by a coin you can just give it to us during uh their turn never going to happen all right cassandra where do you want to go can i look in the drain on the floor is that 401 yeah the drain i was thinking about the whole time i want to get dirty 401 i love this game it's pretty fun so far i like it i'm with the shits it looks like the iron grating in the floor runs into a drain you try lifting it out but it's heavier than it looks for an instant you think you see something glittering far below you're not sure whether your arm is long enough to reach it though do you want to try anyway hell yeah then read entry one two two you feel around with your hand there's something moving in a flash a snake wraps itself around him in fright which causes the snake to fall off and dissipate back into the sewer what you saw you'll need something longer to reach it you lose one health point i am turning one of your health points to the uh opposite side of so we're going from that side to no more health how many health points do you know you got three health total can someone try to suck the poison out of my arm right quick no not it jason just open your mouth you got good sucking powers jason i believe in you man yeah [ __ ] her up it says you're skilled jason so maybe look you're the best sucker on the team baby all right haruka the skilled what would you like to do kind of want to put my arm down that drain [Laughter] i want to check the box that's on the bunk on the bunk is a small metal box unfortunately it's locked and there's no keyhole at first glance you can't see a way to open it beat it with the bar oh should i okay all right well it's not my turn it's a refs turn a loose brick 501 underneath the bunk 601 the window in the door 201 and the door itself 101. gotta be loose brick i can't wait to find out what's behind loose brick yeah it's better because the loose brick might be useful for take adventure card 10. all right it's a loose brick now you have a coin and a loose brick i wonder if the brick could be used for smashing open that thing yeah or smashing open the head of an enemy i have a solid iron bar so maybe i'll try to open the chest with it 11 701 let's see if this works i'm combining an object with a location first time the iron bar causes a few scratches and dents in the metal box but it doesn't have enough power to do any real damage cassandra um which are the places left not explored yet under the bunk oh i'm gonna get bit by a [ __ ] poisonous rat under the bunk we go baby let's do it wait do you want to take anything with you hey matt can i get that brick right quick yeah you can have the brick and can i get the coin just cuz no okay why do you want to hide the brick under the bunk dan you shouldn't you shouldn't have tried to hide the brick i thought i'd maybe have to bludgeon some yeah you reach under the bunker and feel something small and metallic in the dark it's a bronze key that's gonna open the door gonna open the door now does it open the door of the chest though because it probably opens the chest the chest has no keyhole right i still say we should try the brick on that [ __ ] hit the the box with the brick yeah brick it give it a try yeah why not the brick is strong enough to damage the metal box after a few blows it's so dented that you can now remove the contents take adventure card 14. it's a used condom it's a strange map a part of an old map showing several rooms [Music] sean henry says thanks for the substitute foxconn online the other week you all do so much for so many people and it was great to get a sense of the community you inspire so please raise a toast to

tremble with excitement as you try to put the key in the lock unfortunately it doesn't fit well that's not how we're getting out of here maybe somebody else should try wiggly hands hey i'm not that we're going to call matt from now on a ref wiggly hand my trembles don't mean that a key doesn't fit you were too excited to put the key into the hole that sounds just like me i take a peek at the door with attentiveness the upper half of the door is more damaged than you first thought if you were to hit it with something sufficiently hard you might be able to break it i whipped the iron bar over to ivanka that's you jason oh okay okay all right haruka ivanka oh i want to take you to the door with the iron bar the iron bar doesn't have enough power behind it to damage the wood maybe you can attach it to something to give you more force and speed to do more damage the brick we have to attach the brick to the door attach the brick to the door the brick to the bar there's a hole in the brick oh son of a [ __ ] okay we gotta combine 11 and 10. iron bar is going in the break the iron bar fits in the hole in the brick almost perfectly this makeshift hammer will surely have some power behind it return adventure cards 10 and 11 to the box and take adventure card 12. makeshift hammer so now now you now you take that and attack the door with it break it down with the makeshift hammer please hammer hurt door you repeatedly swing your makeshift hammer with all your might and smash it down on the weak spot in the door the wood splinters after a few strokes and soon the gap is wide enough for you to squeeze through your tool is no good for anything anymore though return adventure car 12 to the box place room card c to the right of room card a and read entry 901 here is the new room i'm going to show it to you guys i broke open the door so cassandra you get to choose first however let's find out what's in this room real quick everybody you find yourself standing in a hallway with four more doors two have golden locks 105 and 205 one of the doors is open 305 a sign hangs above the doorway to your far right 805 a symbol has been etched into the wall above the stairway leading up 405 between the doors there are three levers sunk into the floor 505 605 705. yeah yeah i'm gonna do 705. 705 is lever number three or lever as we say here in america you pull down firmly on the lever but it seems to be stuck is room card d already in play if so then read entry 165. otherwise nothing happens oh something tells you that you might be able to make progress here later court kuruku explore the rune above the door you go up the stairs of the middle passageway and find yourself in a long corridor you spot a mighty portal take room card d and place it above room card c then place your character figure on room card d and read entry d oh [ __ ] you're out of there already the massive wooden portal is secured with three bronze locks 109 to the left of the portal is a pile of wood 209 a large stone mask casts its gruesome gaze down on you from above the portal take adventure card 80. this is exciting when you took your last step you already had a hunch that the mask was watching you as you want to continue your way you hear a whistling sound coming from the mask's mouth an arrow shoots from it if you are haruka read entry 259. this ought to be good i am haruka you are it's got different entries for all of us thanks to your quick reflexes you manage to throw yourself onto the ground in time the arrow whistles over your head and smashes into the wall behind you i am reading the sign above the door the sign above the doorway says guards quarters you gingerly try the handle and find that the door is unlocked you listen out briefly for sounds but can't hear anything i wonder what's in there do you want to open the door quietly and carefully take a look inside if so then read entry 141 or do you want to rush into the room ready for battle rush in for battle i don't want to do that i want to quietly look in you carefully open the door you catch sight of a man in the next room you immediately stop opening the door and are just about to close it again when you hear a friendly voice don't be scared i'm not a guard and going by the way you're sneaking around here you're trying to escape too just like me my name's edric you found edric upon entering the guards quarters you see a table 107 oven 207 shelf 607 and cupboard 307 and an oven 07 in a cell 7-0 oven and an 0-1107 i'm going to go to door 105. wait a golden lock on it i bet i can't get through the golden lock i guess i'll go to 305. the door to the second cell is unlocked you notice some melted metal on the floor in front of it are these maybe the remains of the lock that must mean that someone else has escaped too unsurprisingly you find that there's nothing left in the cell of any value so now dion's going to do 705. the jerk you finally managed to move the lever down it seems to have triggered a mechanism because when you pass your ear to the wall you can hear a soft hum and the cluttering of gears the stone mask above the portal in the room across the corridor finally closes its deadly mouth fantastic you found a way to deactivate the trap jason you're now safe because dion disarmed that mask that was shooting at you how do you feel about that i love cassandra queens only baby all right a ref well edrick and i are just pals you can explore edric 407 i guess i should get to know edric so i'm going to explore edric you approach the man warily he smiles at you broadly all of the guards suddenly fled the dungeon in a panic last night and here i am now searching for something to make up for my imprisonment before i make my escape you eye him with interest so what have you found so far edric pulls an assortment of items out of his bag see for yourself maybe there's something you might find useful if there is then i'd be happy to sell it to you after all i have to think of the time after my captivity don't i need a wink to purchase a medical herb return one coin to the box and take adventure card 18. to purchase a ring return two coins to the box and take adventure card 19 to purchase a bronze key return one coin to the box and take adventure card 20. i think i want to buy the bronze key a small bronze key who knows what this bronze key might unlock we're not gonna find out because we're out of time [Music] the dungeon remains a mystery but if you'd like to see us continue exploring the dungeon just say so in the comments or something and you know we could do it again it's pretty fun
