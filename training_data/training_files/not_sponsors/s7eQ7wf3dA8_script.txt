yay this is no winner not my efficient capitalized on more than just quests although although though we last left off home teleporting to lumbridge so now we just need to head up to the castle and pull out the stuff for another cook's quest as well as the first part of RFD 8 and fishing contests unfortunately I don't seem to have any fishing bait which is needed for the Gaul and sub quest of RFD I updated my route to include where I should have bought it in Port Sarim but I have no idea why I didn't purchase it until this point so I'm going to run to Port Sarim to just body the fishing beat so that I can get back to Lumbridge and continue on there is an alternative that I figured out you could try to kill muggers behind Lumbridge Bank and the maggots have a pretty good drop rate however after killing 6 nothing worked out so I just decided to run to Port Sarim anyway hey we're back it's like it never even happened so now we need to pull out these stuff for the another cooks quest as well as the RFD goblin sub quest and fishing contest I don't believe we need the fishing pass out just the trophy but I'm gonna bring it just in case now let's head downstairs to start another cook's quest after handing over the items we can walk right through the door watch the cutscene to start the recipe for disaster quest and then talk to the Galvan generals to be on our way all right let's continue on with the other quests while mini-game teleport to bertha run south to start to death plateau run further south to finish fishing contests for another 2400 x fishing experience and a locking access to the tunnel shortcut which we use for recipe for disaster dwarves sub quest after that we're gonna head south east to the Lady of the lake to continue Merlin's crystal and finally North East to college to get the slop of compromise for the first sub quest I forgot the charcoal okay I'm gonna go grab that and we'll pretend like it never happened see what I mean back already so all we have to do is give him the items get these flop of compromise home teleport to lumbridge and use it on the goblin generals to fulfill the quest awarding us with one quest point and a thousand cooking crafting and farming experience each as well as a little more access to the colon romancers chests which we happen to need in just a moment so we've got level 9 farming now and we need 13 to be able to plant a jute seed for the ik and are an easy diary looking at quests I imagine the way things will go is will work a little allotment planting into our route because I don't think we'll be getting Fairy Tail done by then but we'll have to see all right before leaving we need to start the mountain dwarf as well as the pirate Pete sub quests of RFD though we're not going to do them just now especially since we need at least 41 crafting to make the fishable helmet for the pirate Pete sub quest however now we're going to go downstairs to the colon romancers chest in order to purchase an egg bucket of milk and pot of flour as well as a bowl to fill with water for the mountain door sub quest and I always like to buy a couple of grates when we were down here as each crepe is only one coin and ideally becomes 200 cooking experience when turned into a wine that's a damn good deal remember to fill your bowl with water and then bank again pull out ten coins boots of lightness maybe a bucket a meal for the cat and then head over through al kharid into the shanty pass okay well actually be in the alt card and desert area late but for now we're just passing through to prepare for that ahead of time and then utilize the shanty pass to teleport us to Port Sarim so before leaving pull out your coins and buy a few Shantae passes full desert robes for a diary tasks as well as I have a clue scroll step that requires the shirt and of course for desert protection and some water skins as well after that pull out your major gear as well as your runes cakes and a piece of bread to continue Merlin's crystal and then have Shantae throw you in jail to get sent to Port Sarim maximum-security prison which we're just gonna lockpick our way out of all right after that we're gonna head north if you need to go to the fishing shop and purchase some sardines for your kitten by probably our next or maybe two kittens after this one will be able to have car bomb G which are stackable so that'll be a lot easier as we don't have to keep buying sardines but for now this is what we've got after that head north to the jewelry shop to continue Merlin's crystal and get excalibur alright after that we're gonna head north if you need to go to the fishing shop and purchase some sardines for your kitten buy probably our next or maybe two kittens after this one we'll be able to have car bomb G which are stackable so that'll be a lot easier as we don't have to keep buying sardines but for now this is what we've got after that head north to the jewelry shop to continue Merlin's crystal and get Excalibur alright after that we're gonna head north if you need to go to the fishing shop and purchase some sardines for your kitten but of course we've got over 40 attack meaning we can wield a rune scimitar and at some point before shadow of the storm in Dragon's Lair I'd like to get my magic up to 41 or at least 40 to be able to use wind blast on these stronger monsters during those quests in order to do so I'm going to train my magic at the zamorak warriors at outside of the Orani altar because they have a 1 in 50 drop rate which is way better than the one in 128 drop rate on fire giants which is what people use to mage in the past they also have a very common chance to drop a hundred coins which will help in recouping at least some of the room cost however what I just discussed isn't actually gonna happen for some time and in the meantime we need to focus on lower level things such as killing these elemental wizards for their respective talismans we need one or a talisman which we were lucky to get when we killed men in Edgeville for the Vorik easy diary task and we need one water talisman for the Lumbridge easy diary tasks that's the bare minimum now we likely need at least one more because after we do the Lumbridge and varrock easy diary tasks we need to try and make a mud rune for eyes of glue free and when binding runes you only have a 50% chance of success without the binding necklace so we need as many talismans as we can get however I'm only gonna use about half my runes since I don't want to run out luckily within 250 casts I was able to get one water talisman but unfortunately that's it so luckily in combination with the earth talisman we already have we've got one chance at making the muder and post diary tasks so if it happens to not work out I guess we'll be back here at some point so now we need to head back into Port Sarim and talk to Bao's to sail to Corrin because now that we have the bowl of stool and we're near Corrin we are going to finish the queen of thieves quest because it gives a little bit of money a little bit of thieving XP and unlocks the first teleport to core end via Koretz memoirs back at the docks head all the way north to port Pisgah release bank and pull out your boots of lightness sardines and stew to continue the queen of thieves quest while in the Warrens trade the shopkeeper to satisfy an easy diary task I will note that I'm not going to focus on the core and caboose easy diary right now because it requires almost 10k level 25 construction and favor and two houses so either I have to sacrifice favor in Pisco Elias or I need to get that 200% and lock it in which is a much better option this just in remember to read your patch notes everybody I didn't play at the time but apparently in February of 2019 when x marks the spot came out they made it so that you no longer lose favor which is awesome because now I can use the certificate on Pisgah Elias can get 15 Hunter then come back and % favor and also we can start getting Chazy in favor up so that we can do till the righteous sooner and get that sweet sweet 8k what'll also be nice about getting Chazy in favor is being able to kill lizard-men which can drop the Zarek's talisman which will allow us to get several more unlocks around zaiah making it easier to finish the core end and caboose ez diary also the Lizardman can drop Zarek's fabric which we can use to make salad robes to finally have a little more magic attack bonus than just wearing nothing upon finishing the queen of thieves quest we get one quest 2k coins 2k thieving experience a favor certificate and a memoir page this is the favor certificate I just mentioned a bit ago and instead of putting it in the bank like I am because I was under the impression you could lose favor you can use it right away because you don't worry about it boom second cat now we can trade that in for 200 death runes can have to fit that in somewhere soon how about right now we'll take the RT cape teleport to the monastery go to west rd turn the cat in for 200 death runes Chronicle go north purchase a new cat and then go west to follow door if my kitten didn't happen to turn into a cat what I would do is pull out my magic here again and my coins and my rooms and some food go back to Port Sarim to kill more elemental wizards to try and get one more talisman because we just got two K from the queen of thieves quest I would go to the room shop in Port Sarim to buy some more runes and then after that head north to follow door to meet up with what I'm doing in my route I do decide to get some runes on the way however we will be in vark again really soon without needing any ruins before them so it would have been better to do that then oh well now we need to run all the way west to follow door or use the mini-game teleport to the games room and then run south from birth or continue the rft dwarves sub quest in the bar and before we leave make sure you have your pot of flour bowl of water bucket of milk and egg as well as a pair of gloves because if you do not wear a pair of gloves when you go to pick up the rock cake that we have the dwarf make it'll hurt you and you lose all the items and have to do it again after that head north west to follow door to the tunnel under White Wolf Mountain have the guy make you the rock cake I'm choosing to pick up a few dwarven stouts as for the career Jez diary task it requires level 40 mining we currently only have 36 so we can get 39 used the Dwarven style for a +1 boost to do the diary test so that we don't have to grind out that last level head on east to Ice Mountain to kill a nice teen in order to cool the rock cake then head north through the monastery to talk to dad bog and Daddy I mean Jose AK to continue dragon slayer after that we're gonna head to the bank pull out only a slash weapon and then take the lever to the south back into the wilderness hey everybody I know this video is a few minutes shorter than the past ones have uploaded but I'm testing something out where they're gonna be a little bit shorter but I'm hoping to have them out faster so that way there's gonna be a more regular schedule of content let me know what you think and things again for watching
