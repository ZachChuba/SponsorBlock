play the last few wipes have been doing big things large raids and even more intense defenses but this swap I decided to tone it back a little bit and play with a smaller group of friends however sometimes it can be hard to be a part of the massive raids what's being the little guy out geared and outnumbered but all the takes is for you to shift your mindset from raiding the biggest bullies on the server to just annoying them enough to piss them off so that's just what we did or they come they're gonna recycle in our boys one guy solar Lesage yeah oh [ __ ] hiding in [ __ ] with my mom my one yeah running up and actually he's going to he's right here oh yeah he said it's nice nice nice I'm wounded on one of you left right here here it's these two guys that live in the basement [Music]

and give it back oh [ __ ] they're outside I think someone's outside yet you reckon the path has come read us they must have [ __ ] [ __ ] to read us probably I can take down guns around rude thank you very much enjoy man now these guys were part of a pretty big group and at this point they knew where we lived so it was pretty important we found a new place to live we decided on living in a small rocky nearby and if you ever find yourself at the mercy of larger groups rocks are an excellent way to deter them from raiding you because you never really know how expensive a rock base will be and a lot of the time it's not worth it after we had set up our base we headed out to our first cargo run a problem nothing too eventful happened on the cargo ship but we did end up getting some essential guns plus our first a count for one which would help us achieve our plans in the future she just tied to him by the way you should touch him and be him to cross over and then we just came she just like everything they can all stop swim across their branding Davis number one we'd not run into them too much this wife but they were about to fall for our trap our bases were directly opposite of each other over a small water inlet so we're hoping by me dying up on the hill they would swim across and try and loot me and at that exact moment would spray down on them from the hill above the water and it worked out better than we do yeah they're all swimming all of them too right should I'm sure if you see them what no this way this way follow me right up ahead of me yeah once or 500 times okay I want a cannoli gar gar gar Ludo ëletís one [Music] what I saw when she died at Tesla oh my god they have all the cards everything after successfully securing more guns and gear sets we decided to put it all on the line and try to contest the military tunnels we're firmly five people a clan had been running this all day and we knew we'd have a fight on her hands it was pretty importantly one it is [Applause] pushy they're pushing out Ryder door in there that one mm did that once it three times auntie auntie I say I killed three kill them kill them kill them if I did it down and let you know I killed him I killed him yeah yeah you're right you're right IQ a blue hey you guys able to live run I know you're there yeah we should be goners yeah faster push yeah I'm going hopefully they honestly come back that was fun yeah they're holding X on it you might be dead papa train now there's one holding this one holding the puppet back one day above you above e5 yeah I know I'm looking I'm looking that book that book that nice monster there for a second ah that that's that's like IP Bob because you can't sit at the doors check it out it Chrissa after killing the people inside military tunnels we decided to run with the guns we had gained before they had a chance to come back and kill us and some time had passed and later that night Angus and I decided to go out and see if we could find anything happening around the map and we ran into something quite interesting yeah about 250 oh yeah there's another guy there there's another guy down here though I've left oh yeah it image that yeah I'm so nice I don't fall I was trying to get I'm good as well stay low don't die don't die yeah yeah why I think there's only one more Oh Mike you know why he picked the right I was trying to get it I did it the wrong way I'm down so we had died but that was not the end of it all for Angus died he got a chance to see one of their dead bodies they had explosive him on them and enough materials to set up a small Auto type base now through process of elimination we could determine who they were raiding we fought them here and they lived over here just below launch they took the path along the coast to their Road chugger and there was only one real possible raid target around us and that was the base where he just killed someone so we headed back fully kitted with one extra person and waited on the mountain nearby wait I think they've just got a heli I think they're gonna write it with a heli on Anna yeah are they gonna land on the top of the heli and start raiding it surely not you know some maybe let's go cut the crash they're not sure oh I'm dead from behind yeah both of those guys I think as they came from the other direction I'm down okay yeah there's one dead but I'm Angus I'm nearly there you're just gonna trade it's them yeah he's you know that watchtower he's below the watched okay can I see this I see this body I see this water I'm going for it yeah I see you going through it I'm gonna go for a different one I'm gonna distract him to the right where is he where is it shut up I'm looking I'm looking [Music] he's dead he's dead the birth dead there is I got okay sitting up on the rock yes Amos Amos in it starting you curve up to the right of them coming toward me dead dead dead forget what's the chances they come yeah I know you have to come in the other way that's all look all my let me see it let me see it I'm not gonna tell you about look it was worth it inclusion us our first day however since the second day of our white rolled around it was now time to put our plan into action now before I explain what that plan is you first need to understand how clans roam generally roam start on day two of the wipe and they go around the center of the map with around eight to ten people fighting each other now we didn't have enough people to contest them nor did we want to so that's where our plan comes into play our plan was to make a small base in the center of the map and bring a generator and an auto tire with us we would set up the auto tire and a bush outside the base and park a mini helicopter between the base and the auto turret as a sort of bait the idea was we would shoot inside the base and the groups would be baited toward the shots then they would notice the helicopter and quickly take the bait and consequently died of the auto tyre a lot of things needed to go right for this trap to work but we really just wanted to add some fun with it and we definitely achieved that [Music] and a little crispy [Music] [ __ ] stop I'm dead I'm dead up dead I've been emptied on the only pure external goods to the store understood [Music] [Music] [Applause] Yoshida throws just so many values is it full clip yeah okay DeSoto turd this is honestly [ __ ] like imagine you're on the room and [ __ ] so many what it's a snowy boys kids Oh everybody knows in a second with this cliff he just sent in the second team in this five and say ha okay okay I believe it there's five and seven this is a heli Scout the Klan is using to try and find other people on the map to kill so we decided a little bit of Top Gun combat was needed maybe the m2k soul won't die we can chase it welcome to the rim playoff yeah I headshot the driver you'll have to learn go go get it you know just take it off ready no he's dead I just want to loot him and I'll bolt them yeah there's so much now you can't do that you can't be done it's suicide to come either is wrong not a trumpet let's hold over here not a [ __ ] my god decide don't daddy Pete we can't even take off the team behind up on the right so that's my headshot one I think it's on the left one that's it they're leaving again they're leaving a yeah I'm gonna take off wait I have to put the husband on and like wait for the [ __ ] wetness the hallway right so I'm just gonna go for called running Oh snowy what we seen found who should've should've should've it just says do the FFT can't the kid I'm gonna know record again again zero is lazy solar room hey was it snowing voice again if exaction kept up and that was the end of our life no big raids no big defense nothing too special but what's amazing about this game is there's always fun and challenges to be had you just need to find your own
