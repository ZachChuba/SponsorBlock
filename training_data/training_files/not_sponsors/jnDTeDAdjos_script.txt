you guys what up this video is about my three worst rhyming mistakes you probably knew that from the title worst intro ever these three things probably held me back the most in my playing which is why I'm so stoked about making this video but first he's got to say links are in the description below so first things first mistake number one worst mistake I ever did thing that had the most effect on my playing in the worst possible way was my grip I started off playing drums gripping the stick all the way at the back like that I basically never had more than three fingers on the stick at any time just looking at this now and feeling what this feels like feels strangely comfortable and strangely familiar but it also feels like the crappiest grew up in the existence of the human race when you're gripping the stick with three fingers like I did you literally have this much leverage that's it so I'm controlling all of this weight and all of this leverage with this little bit of the stick and three fingers so this is like the prototype of crab grips the crux came from me when important guys have might have seen this video I did this video with Adam Willard who at the time still played with Angels and Airwaves which is one of my all-time favorite bands I did this video with him and we had one chance one tag to record the video and in the middle of the recording I dropped a stick because I got excited I tensed up and because I had basically no control of the stick and only three fingers on the stick I dropped a stick in the middle of the recording and that's still in the video that's been seen by millions of people and so after that video recording I went to done a tram channel and I was like darn what am I doing wrong why do I keep dropping sticks especially when the pressures on and he looked at my grip and he was like well it's cuz you got three fingers on the stick and you have no leverage and so basically what he said was just push the stick back so you have all five fingers on the stick because now suddenly you have this much leverage to work with and you have three fingers to control it with so it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that this is way easier to control then this when I changed my grip immediately Whaley's blisters way more control drop the sticks way less ghost notes became softer and I don't like certain groupings and certain techniques actually became possible to me now because I wasn't I wasn't choking the stick and like squeezing it to death like a caveman if you're struggling with too many blisters dropping sticks loud ghost notes just have a look at your grip make sure you've got all five fingers on the stick make sure that your fall current position is correct yeah that you're just utilizing the leverage on the stake correctly the one thing that had the biggest effect on my sound am I playing was changing from sucky caveman grip to less sucky healthy control grip making sure that pinky doesn't veer away like a like a like a rebellious but stepchild is keeping it on the stick um just give me just make sure that all five fingers tight on the stick at all times and and it'll have such a big effect on your playing up so that's mistake number one then mistake number two is dynamics I spent years far too long only practicing medium to loud range of dynamics playing moderately loud to playing very loud I didn't spend barely any time didn't spend barely any time I spent barely any time practicing dynamics at the lower range ghost notes just softer notes that made my playing sound really one-dimensional for the longest time for years and years and years and so mistake number two would be not having the self control and self discipline to sit on a practice pad and learn rudiments and really differentiate the volume between the accents and the dynamics when you give yourself a wider range of dynamic expression on the kit it's your playing sounds so so much better I think that's one of the biggest differentiators between people who sound like amateurs and people who sound like professionals is the professionals just have that lower range of dynamics where your ghost notes are just soft and they're subtle and they're controlled and I like I said this is closely related to mistake number one because that's very difficult to do with sucky grip so once you've like taking care of having good grip the second thing I'd say that I wish I focused on it was just improving my dynamic range and then lastly the one that I've that I've the missed the biggest mistake that I've fixed most recently is posture the reason why I needed to start changing this unfortunately is because I hurt my rotator cuff in my right shoulder and I'll explain to you exactly why I hurt it so that hopefully you don't hurt yours let me also be perfectly clear this is not medical advice I'm just fascinated by the human body and I'm fascinated by the mechanics of the human body so this is my best attempt at explaining how I understand the mechanics of the shoulder and specifically as it relates to drumming but by no means is this medical advice also if you are formally schooled and studied in biomechanics you are probably about to have a good time laughing it how I'm about to butcher this but maybe it's not that bad for concepts real quick this is called the humerus is the bone from your elbow to your shoulder the head of the humerus is like half a sphere like perfectly around sphere that just cut in half that's the head of the humerus it sits in this thing called the glenoid which is basically your shoulder socket and so I think most people know that that's kind of how your shoulder works then you have your shoulder blades your scapula 's and the scapula kind of extends up and over the shoulder to form this roof called the acromion man I wish I memorized that sentence if I didn't have to look over camera I would have looked so much smarter the reason why these four things are really important to be aware of is specifically for me is because if you're not careful and you have forward roll shoulders with high symbols you're hitting the acromion or the roof consistently and applying a lot of pressure to your rotator cuff muscles it's not difficult to visualize actually if you if you right where you're sitting right now if you kind of roll your shoulders forward and you like exaggerate that motion and you kind of like hunched over and roll forward and you see how high you can lift your arm you'll see that it's it's almost impossible to lift it higher than this but if you just tuck your scapula z' back and down and you sit upright it's very easy to see how you get that range of motion especially if you set up right so instead of having 180 degrees range of motion with proper healthy posture you have what's that like 110 120 degrees range of motion if that and so what was happening was because my shoulders were rolled forward and I had bad posture and my symbols were high I was consistently hitting the acromion or that roof at the top of your shoulder and I was really hurting my rotator cuff I think lots of drummers have forward rolled shoulders and bad posture definitely make sure you're not hurting yourself it's easier to hurt yourself than you think drumming is such a physical instrument we exert such forces and pressures on our bodies and it's really important to make sure that you're not hurting yourself it's not a difficult change either just sit more upright and tuck your scapulars back and down so that makes the big difference so those are three of my biggest drumming mistakes I really hope this helps you guys I really hope just having a look at your posture having a look at your dynamics and your grip might have a positive effect on your drumming and maybe hopefully make you a better drummer I really really hope this helps you guys thanks again to raid shadow legends for sponsoring this video they're awesome super thankful for the support go check out the game and I'll see you guys in the next video bye you
