it's been a while since I've chatted about Apple's lineup but I thought you know what better time to do this then under quarantine and economic uncertainty with no sponsors in the pipeline to support this ridiculous tuned until the end of the video let's start with the Mac the Mac lineup finally makes sense in my opinion for the first time in a really long time I mean look just over a year ago I was making a video about three different Apple laptops the 12-inch MacBook MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air which all cost within $100 of each other that had vastly different specifications features use cases and and product life cycles and I feel like today I'm in April 2020 that's no longer a thing Apple has cleaned up the lineup significantly and I think that things are finally properly segmented and all machines seem to have a target market and use case without much price overlap you know thinks I don't know things just still feel awkward to me you see apples to newest computers happen to be their cheapest and most expensive MacBook Air and Mac Pro respectively and while on the surface these computers seem to have nothing in common they do in one big area and that's Intel I can't mince words Intel is blowing chunks they're screwing the pooch the gyro knees are getting schooled by AMD and it currently doesn't look like that's gonna be changing anytime soon I mean look the new 2020 MacBook Air is using Intel's brand-new tenth generation isolate low-power processors and the performance at least compared to the 2018 MacBook Air seems to be decent but it's still not great by comparison am DS Rison v 4600 u which is smack dab in the middle of their Ultrabook processor lineup handily outperforms Intel's more expensive highest and i7 1065 mg7 what a great product name right which is a processor not even offered in macbook air on the mac pro side of things apple's using the intel xeon cascade lick series which seems to let's off pretty well compared to AMD's epic lineup at least until you look at pricing for example the highest end 28 core Mac Pro uses an Intel W 30 to 75 M M stands for moolah and that's a CPU that allows up to 1.5 terabytes of memory through the hexa Channel Ram slots on Mac Pro now the trade price of the CPU what it costs customers is $7,500 but what Apple doesn't tell you is that Intel sells the exact same chip with a max memory limit of one terabyte instead of two terabytes which is theoretical really that's one point five terabytes in Mac Pro for almost half that price 4500 dollars and you'll see this trend in all but the lowest end Mac Pro processor and I don't know what percentage of Mac Pro owners are pushing more than a terabyte of memory in their machine but I suspect it's very few what this means is that most Mac Pro customers are paying double for a CPU that they're never going to take advantage of and I like to blame Apple on this but I can't really because having different CPUs skews for supported memory capacities gets from really confusing and that's all because of intel's BS their competitor AMD largely eliminates unnecessary feature lock down all epic CPUs for example support two terabytes of memory by default so why then what Apple alright we're not touching our faces so why then what app will continue to stay in business with the company that seems to be shanking the ball off of every tee box on every hole now I have a couple of theories and I think several of them have merit for one Apple demands millions of chips per year and requires a consistent supply of them with which AMD's root track record has honestly been frankly quite spotty there might be exclusivity contracts that we the public just don't know about the Mac OS kernel has been built for Intel and while AMD hackintosh is show that kernel rewrites can be done and that Mac OS can run just fine doing this securely and with proper vetting takes time and resources but my leading theory is this money money Apple what yeah listen Apple historically has been with Intel because there was no other option I mean AMD was irrelevant for years nobody could compete now AMD ham and Intel is becoming desperate better yet apples in a great position because if you want mac OS you have one option and only one option buy a computer from Apple so it doesn't really matter what CPUs Apple uses because we'll buy them which means they can stay with Intel and get excellent pricing while all of the other PC OEMs jump ship to compete in the specs war another reason Apple might not be switching to AMD or itching to switch because they're probably jumping to their own ARM chip soon this has been rumored for years and while nobody can say exactly when it's going to happen there are rumors that it will be as early as later this year color me skeptical despite having prophesized this since like what 2013 we've seen what iPad pro can do relative to its PC brethren and it's incredible I mean in certain benchmarks it's doing 70% as well in multi-core tests as my eye nine MacBook Pro which cost nearly three and a half times more money and it does it being a fraction of the size it's completely silent and with better battery life our Mac's are gonna be a big deal but that doesn't mean they won't be without their downsides and I talked about some of them in a video I made last year which you should definitely check out if you haven't seen it but all at all the Mac is in a good place Mac Pro is good for those who need it and can swallow the tremendously corpulent price tag though Apple just killed the 580 X GPU it's it's garbage and just include the upcoming 5700 XD as the base model that same GPU the 580 X is in your 2200 $99 5k iMac tech ships with a friggin spinning hard drive say no to the 580 X in a $6,000 computer even though I didn't I Mac Pro ok iMac pro in my opinion needs a little bit of reworking relative to the Mac Pro its value proposition is actually pretty good I mean it's a thousand dollars less it comes with a gorgeous 5k display and a dual raid zero one terabyte nvme SSD as opposed to the putrid 256 gig one found in Mac Pro that said you're right on the edge of thermal throttling no expandability is offered at least not unless you want to tear down the machine like I did and trust me you really don't want to do that and to me I Mac Pro mostly feels like it was released to tide people over to the release of Mac Pro and whether or not that's true it largely feels unnecessary now I mean the regular iMac frequently out benches it in certain workloads thanks to the tea to chip and Intel's internal graphics along with an additional dedicated GPU which is something you don't get using a Xeon in iMac Pro and it does it for $1,000 less in my opinion iMac pro should move back down to consumer Intel CPUs but with support for quad-channel memory as opposed to the IMAX current dual channel configuration it should maintain the same awesome striped SSDs it should keep the 10 gig LAN and offer higher end video card options than the iMac these features are enough I think to adopt the pro moniker and maybe just maybe iMac pro could be the platform for this crazy rumor that Apple's making a gaming PC oh man I have a ton of thoughts on this so give this video like if you're interested in seeing that on the other hand like I mentioned I think the iMac is great and it needs very little attention the 5k display is still best-in-class the form factor a lot of people seem to say it's becoming dated I think it looks fine although I wouldn't mind a slimming down of the bezels perhaps in a more squared design approach Allah iPad pro and protists play XDR but Apple does need to get rid of two things that are absolutely unacceptable in a computer of this price or really of this decade first the base model $1100 iMac still has a seventh-generation dual-core CPU and a 1080p display what for just $200 more you double your core count you get a dedicated GPU and a 4k screen Apple kill that baseline iMac it is a Bismil and completely unacceptable my second gripe every single iMac has a fusion drive as the base configuration for storage a spinning hard drive as a boot volume in 2020 what this is also unacceptable and in the next iMac refresh Apple just needs to say goodbye to spinning storage SSDs should be the norm they should have been the norm for years now and you definitely shouldn't include an SSD lower than 512 gigs even at the lowest price point next up the 16 inch MacBook Pro I reviewed it back in November and my thoughts have remained largely the same the bigger size is actually in my opinion the least know worthy upgrade the battery life is excellent even better than it was thermal throttling seems to be basically resolved thank goodness and the abysmally unreliable awful butterfly keyboard is gone and it's back to having a pretty awesome keyboard again and that's great I don't know what more it needs the 13-inch MacBook Pro on the other hand is in the danger zone right now do not buy it the rumored 14-inch should be around the corner any day now but more so than spec bumps and size increases you just really got to avoid that butterfly keyboard man it's in the current model and it's terrible and I know some of you haven't had issues yet and you're gonna be typing down on the comments saying hey my keyboards great that's great good for you you're lucky these problems have been widespread and they're scary and nobody should buy a butterfly keyboard MacBook as far as I'm concerned MacBook Air well we kind of already talked about the MacBook Air but people love that machine and I just I don't look the 12-inch MacBook was a dream come true for me I loved that machine it was so tiny and so light and sure it was slow but that's okay because that's what you compromised for on such a tiny fanless laptop the 13-inch MacBook Air is not the 12-inch MacBook it's not small it's nearly the same size and weight as the 13-inch MacBook Pro it's just a lot slower than that machine but there's something important here that wasn't there last year $999 part of the magic behind the prior MacBook Air that we all loved so much was the price and that has returned if you can forgo a better display which you'll get on MacBook Pro a better processor you'll get on MacBook Pro and better speakers would you'll get on macbook pro a thousand bucks gets you a respectable machine with great battery life and a keyboard that won't murder your whole family so that's that's good I give it a thumbs Mac Mini just got fake updated by Apple last month the storage doubled for the price but it's still using old eighth generation Intel CPUs from 2018 price to performance is rather poor and its small size really isn't even that small anymore I mean just look at the Intel nook basically suggests that everyone's stay away from Mack many though I say that as a guy who literally just bought one to install in a server rack so do as I say and not as I to sink of the Mack okay my let's talk I pad the updated twenty twenty iPad pro has a lot of people up in arms because it's quite frankly a very minor update a secondary camera has been added to the back which if I'm being honest has really been bothering me because my fingers keep bumping against it but the cameras are good if you mostly just scan documents and do occasional FaceTime calls like I do you might be wondering does the iPad really need a good camera not really but for AR it it'd be handy and it's clear that Apple is focused on augmented reality with its new lidar sensor right now this sensor does very little apples measure app is a little more accurate although only marginally and the new sensor does allow you to mask a are objects which is kind of cool but it seems like a whole lot of hoopla over nothing i given the weird release time of ipad pro this seems to be hardware to basically just get it into developers hands for what will ultimately be coming to iphone in the fall and what i'm guessing is that during the online WWDC seminars this year we'll see what apple's grand plans are for this sensor because right now i'm thinking huh you might have also heard that people are pissed about this new 8 12 z buy on a chip I went into a lengthy thread on Twitter which I'll link below about part binning and how it's very common in the SOC industry I honestly don't think it's that big a deal that the new iPad is basically just using the old chip with one additional GPU core that old iPads 2 years old so it's a pretty minor update but this iPad is still insanely fast and Apple's likely waiting to do a massive chip redesign on iPad until after the 5g capable a 14 ships in iphone 12 this fall I bet late this year or early next year we'll see an a 14x for iPad pro with 5g oh one last thing I'm really excited about the magic keyboard and if I might thanks for making this backwards compatible with the 2018 iPad pro Apple very cool and very unexpected from you look I've been mocking Apple for years because every time they say that a touchscreen MacBook doesn't exist because well nobody wants to strain their arm by lifting it up and touching the screen I laugh in irony because that's exactly what the iPad pro has been and they're right it's not comfortable to have to use your arm to poke on a display so now that iOS apps have made their way to the Mac with cursor support via catalyst and they seem to be you know okay it only makes sense that that would be offered as an option on iPad pro don't get me wrong iPad pro is still a touch first OS but having additional input methods is seldom a bad thing maybe now I can finally get my touch screen MacBook but I'll be reviewing the magic keyboard when it ships this may I pad air is a weird one okay it's $500 which isn't a bad deal per se but he's in the middle of two really great products the $800 iPad pro and the $330 iPad which you can frequently find for $250 we just bought one and it's actually it's actually our teleprompter and for $300 this thing is insane okay no it doesn't have a laminated screen but it's retina with the same PPI as iPad air and iPad pro it's only 0.3 inches smaller diagonally than iPad air it has Apple pencil support and the a-10 fusion SOC which while now a little bit data it still feels a lightning-quick it's probably the best value product Apple sells period that's even at MSRP at $330 you can find these oftentimes for around 200 bucks which is insane iPad gets a huge thumbs up for me but that means that the weird oldish looking iPad air seems like not a great value especially that it's gone the longest without an update I just can't really recommend it speaking of things I can't really recommend iPad Mini I loved my iPad Mini in fact I still have it right oh right here this is an iPad Mini 2 from 2013 and we had actually been using it as a teleprompter up until last month we just recently retired it because our prompter software began feeling a bit sluggish but the most recent iPad Mini has the same resolution as the iPad Mini 2 from 2013 it has the same form factor the same touch ID sensor the really the only thing that's updated other than a laminated screen is it now supports a a 12 SOC just like iPad air it also supports Apple pencil and starts at $399 which is just quite frankly insane in my opinion I guess for those that still want a small form-factor tablet iPad Mini is basically your only option but I think as phones have gotten bigger desires for small tablets have all but disappeared and I think that's proof and how frequently this thing has been updated kind of a bummer iPhone I'm still carrying both an iPhone 11 pro and a galaxy z flip and I am enamored by them both and know this folding phone has not gotten any less fun over the months since my review but I phone stays in my pocket for a reason it's just it's excellent no it doesn't have the flashiest new tech yes the notch is still rather big but when you review smart phones you come to appreciate reliability and dependability that's the reason that most youtubers you watch either carry an iPhone exclusively or like me carry an Android phone with an iPhone in and the other pocket the iPhone 11 pro has fantastic cameras the battery life is insanely good the display is bright and pretty with a responsive touch layer app support is plentiful and reliable it's fast as a whip and it has never given me a reason to reboot or scratch my head wondering why things aren't working it's just it's bang on man even if it's boring but being boring as why I carry this other phone in my pocket there's still many months to go until iPhone 12 in 2020 but I'm excited for these new models for a number of reasons first off rumors indicate that it's going to go back to a squarish form factor similar to iPad pro which will be the first time we've seen a squared iPhone since the iPhone 5s rumors also suggest for new models a 5.4 inch to 6.1 inches and a massive behemoth 6 point 7 inch model 6 point seven inches that's likely iPad Mini basically presumably the lidar sensor found in iPad pro is going to make its way over as well and yeah man I'm stoked new designs are always great but more importantly and what I'm most excited for is the new size I am so sick of huge phones but I don't move to small phones because small phones are known as worse phones these new iPhone 9 se to whatever the heck we're gonna call it rumors are circling around like crazy and cool I'm glad that that phone is going to exist for those on a budget and for those that hate face ID or the gesture system but I'm happy to finally be getting a small phone that's just as powerful as the big ones a flagship small handset I guess that leaves us with the Apple watch earpods home pod and services so rapid fire time Apple watch is the best on the market and nobody is even close where OS is a joke and Google should be ashamed Apple watch continues to get better every year and well I don't personally think that the design of newer models are even as good as the older models and just look at this series to watch the crown is more distinguished and present it has a more Square more substantial more intentional design and it just looks man it looks good I think Apple knows that they own the market and they can make apple watch look like whatever they want now and people are still going to buy it so they've capitalized on adding health features and increasing battery life in exchange for design and I think that's great some days I even wish I didn't love real mechanical watches because Apple watch is just so solid but I also legitimately think that I use my phone less than Apple watch people which is kind of funny because people think that the Apple watch decreases their dependency on phones I think it increases I mean look everyone's different and maybe just at the end of the day this is a Boomer thing to say but it's kind of annoying when you're talking to someone and they're just looking at their wrist like this and then you're like are you listening to me err pause are expensive but they're there honestly I hate how much I like them I think that the air pods Pro are the ones to get and go check out my review if you haven't seen that already although the standard air pods they still best a lot of truly wireless buds on the market they don't have the best sound but they just work all the time and when you're talking about Bluetooth that's important I'm cautiously sceptical but also excited for the rumor over your earpods head pots air heads home pot is not very good and I laughed when I went back and watched my original review because almost all of my criticisms in that video which is now years old are still valid and Apple has fixed almost none of the annoyances that I had I do use one on my desk as a small footprint speaker and it's it's fine but that's really the best review I can give it talking about services we could go ad nauseam but I'm really only going to talk about Apple TV which seems to be doing well although other than the morning show I really haven't found a program that has really captured my attention I'm just too busy watching an original content from Netflix and Amazon along with the premium cable providers like HBO FX and AMC which I personally find frankly way better than anything Apple TV offers we'll see how many people cancel their subscriptions once that one-year free thing expires later this year but for right now you can put me in the camp of I'm probably gonna cancel this episode has been sponsored by hosting er the best web hosting at the end of last year and look I'm a busy guy I created snazzy 2019 dot-com but it
