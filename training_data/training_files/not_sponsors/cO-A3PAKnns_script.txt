that's a good intro I just want to say place with Squarespace so I address my haircut first it's I like it's a I think it's something I knew had a rocket and I were gonna go see his mom and then I was like wait let me just do something I got some citizen I was like dude dude and I'm off point you're like so we thought I'd wreck feel any regret I don't feel anything I do feel skin I just finished cutting out like oh no I'm just feel like dealing with my mistakes today I'm gonna make you hear about some of my favorite things about these kind of videos should be more things that are pretty inexpensive or they go towards like supporting artists or things that you have access to without having to buy anything so let's begin let's go through some of my art mail - these are things that I bought from artists so you know when you want to suggest spend money it's like a guilt-free way to do that because you know you're supporting someone and you're giving back to the community the first bit of art nails and I got was from an artist based in Melbourne called ghost patrol or David Perth [Music] I really loved his book for a long time it should definitely check him out I'll put his link down below of cost so I initially ordered this disruption whistle I think that's what it's called I can't remember this sticker sheet and do s freebies these two awesome little sticker oneis ilakaka president hoard stickers unless I specifically bought them to decorate something so I'm not sure what I'm gonna do them for this so beautiful a little place on it on the back of this accept something like perfect for disrupting racist sexist I was like I need this these on social media he's got a really really cool website as well well there's another sticker in it whoopsie doodles it's really really good to support not only creatives but a nice to support fellow Australian creatives EXO artist who I really really like who will appear twice in this video Matt Forsyth [Music] also very cute staff I ordered a set of 20 I think it's 20 or 15 postcards from camp let machine yeah 20 postcards by Matt Forsyth never coming back that Forsyth is like a really really really incredible illustrator I love his work I also recently found out that he was the lead designer Adventure Time for like seasons 5 or 6 or something which I think is so cool but his work is just so incredible the thing that really invigorates me about his work is his use of color and also like mixed-media the contrasting colors the use of pastels for lights as opposed to just using white and also the use of like really really rich colors to replace black whose work is so whimsical it's so beautiful and his children's books are really good too but you'll see more of that in a second next I go deliver from Adam J cuts on Instagram he's out of JK [Music] so these are all the freebies that he got so good this little pencil it's in my Lewis icon football my social media I don't know if you notice I took a new one gives a postcard a little picture of opponents of bread some stickers you cut out yourself will clop and the thing that I ordered from him was a keychain so Adam Jackie is like a very funny artist his stuff is like kind of tongue-in-cheek it's very I know I just really really like it's humid anyway I got this little gold star that says you tried it's a little reminder to say it's fun you do it okay he also sells these covers they pay which i think is pretty funny cuz if you can imagine like you bestow on a gold star be like you're just it was kind of expensive to ship overseas which is turnover standards essentially I paid like $40 for a cage a I think it was like an hour after I bought it I found a keychain on the floor pretty ugly pretty dirty but I was like and the next thing I want to talk about is books baby books at the moment so most recent when I've read summertime Ford's fight like a girl [Music] I picked this up because I was speaking at a literature festival to promote zoom it kind of talked to kids about writing and illustrating my own book and one other author that was doing a talk was clever time for who was a confident contemporary feminist in Australia my eye on it for like a couple of years but I only just decided to get it because I would have some time to read on the play I really loved this book and I think it speaks to a lot of women's experiences and it goes from being like a really personal story about Hope Road to feminism and then kind of talking about like Society and structures that kind of create that inequality although she talks about the inequality she faces for being a woman in like contemporary Western society she also acknowledges that she had a lot of privilege as a white woman so I recommend everyone to read this I really like it but if you're a guy and you want to read this you might find her a little bit prickly I know like a lot of men pay clementine for which is kind of stupid I'd recommend reading it while remembering that this like the theme that she's talking about is it directly a personal tack about you it's kind of a criticism on the society that we live in and the structures that create an equality based on gender angry feminist manifesto but is filled with a really really nice tone of voice really funny humor and it's a really really easy read I read it probably like one to two days and so if you just should grab it I'm sure there's an audio book if you don't have time to read up yeah I really really liked it so definitely recommend next we got 112 one things to draw [Music] so coolly this is like a sequel to something don't know what it is basically I was kind of read distributing my books into bookshelves and I found this and I had had this for like a few years I just totally forgot about it and so yeah it's hard to get back into it as a prompt books there's times where I have a lot of work based on the computer a business stop feeding videos to make etc and so when I don't know chopped roses are really nice weighted stay and warmed up a really nice way to kind of loosen me up in the day yeah I'm really excited to it to do it okay that's the end of the adult section of this I created this book because I was not really a very academic learner especially with subjects like maths and science I was not interested it was a very visual learner so I wanted to create a visual device to teach kids about science or the solar system and I thought using animals would kind of help them remember the size of the planet and then also help them remember the order before this book I was like I don't know any big and doubt like I can tell you the order of the planets I could do it all I spoke about the last video but zoom has now been released on paperback we are selling the paperwork's at my store we did pre-orders and thank you to everyone who ordered this I really really appreciate that and we're gonna try keep Zoo stocked up if you're not in Australia or New Zealand my store is actually the only place that you could get zoo because while it's structured bookstores across the country literally is globally moving on to other children's books we have the bad food of the stick by Lemony Snicket with odds like that for size [Music] this is such a gorgeous children's book it's a really nice embodiment of a bad memory that kind of follies people around really really cute character design here the colors the colors are so good it's so beautiful and the characters they just like seemingly so simple but so full of life one of my personal favorite Oliver Jeffers Oliver Jeffers has to be one of my favorite illustrators especially contemporary illustrators [Music] this book made me cry in the bookstore it's called the heart of the bottle and I was gonna describe it I would say that it's like a book about loss you know those books that are like how to deal with loss for children I feel like it's a very clever and sophisticated version of that also a very engaging story so basically it's about a young girl we want day her dad died and she had to figure out how to cope with that loss and protect a heart that's about kind of putting up those walls and then learning to take them down such a beautiful book and like the full script spreads starry sky is like mixed-media this collage in here his work is so loose and fun and yeah when you take off the dust jacket anyway really important to buy physical copies not just because you're supporting creatives the deserve it but also see artwork in print look it's so different to see an ala kinda little square and then see an artwork in a page in front of you first she has my favorite burner which is bit weird because I'm not because it is bright and happy is like my work of my blogs or everything they put out there by you is so interesting so basically the hosts a two chicks that I'm super obsessed with murders just sounds so weird but they find a way to make it really tongue-in-cheek they come together every episode and they chat for a bit and they also every one burner that week usually they speak in depth about what happened what people heard about like what the clues were what the detective work was the case of the outcome of the case and kind of like what they think and it's just is really interesting a friend Madeleine actually said yesterday it showed me laughs a while ago but it kind of wasn't like paying attention I was interested I found this acoustic version of I like me better please use delirious I'm like these were sweet love and then I basically started listening to I like we've been on repeat over doba and then I found Paris in the race and then I found easy love and there's my three favorite songs there's an incredible singer songwriter and they call it him like the heartbreak Prince or something like that baby what's it called when they have an acoustic version like it's like it's called yeah but then he has these like I'll plug governesses the songs it is voice sounds still so good so I definitely recommend about someone else that ever comes test is actually boy rock and I have become sensitive there again recently in optic monkeys optic monkeys was a band that I've listened to hates as a teenager their first album especially and I haven't released something from quite a while but they will be releasing something in May which I'm really really excited for always about us talk about the Pete winders TV wise record I had just started watching the pinky blind this cuz my dad suggested it oh my goodness no really we really finished season 3 that's all that is a message if I'm dead let's definitely go watch it it's about a gang that was in the 1800s in the UK we're in Birmingham and basically they called the peaky blinders because they keep razor blades in there the pink of their house and they slash people's eyes out anyway it's not gonna bother if it's really really good and up loved it so much so by order of the Posey blinders watch the perky blind discuss a few artists to follow but I think I'm gonna do that big post and I'll talk a little bit and show you then show you all the names and all the links
