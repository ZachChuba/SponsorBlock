hello this is chef john from food wishes
comma with All American barbecue sauce that's right I am very excited to be
showing my take on America's most popular style of barbecue sauce which of
course originated in and around Kansas City and I really do believe that if the
average person knew just how easy and simple and incredibly fast this was to
make it home they would still buy it at the store but thank goodness you're not
average because after make a batch of this and taste just how incredible it
is I don't think will ever buy that stuff from the store again so with that
let's go have started with some ketchup which is the base ingredient for
this style of sauce which is why if can try to use a good one and I
generally go for the non corn syrup version of America's most popular brand
and then to our ketchup base we have to add our sweeteners and I like to use two
some brown sugar and then the thing that makes brown sugar brown which would be
some dark molasses which is never not beautiful and then to balance all that
sweetness we need some tankyness which is why we will pour in a whole bunch of
white distilled vinegar which is nice and high in acidity but neutral in
flavor and then once that's in there we'll go ahead and add our powdered
peppers which will include some smoked paprika or regular paprika some chili
powder and of course some cayenne and how much depends on how spicy want
this and then finally some freshly ground black pepper and then we will
finish this up with the spices which for me are going to be some allspice which
tastes like all spices plus a little bit of coriander which by the way is the
spice that makes pastrami taste so good and then lastly we will finish with a
little bit of cumin and that is going to be it for me and then we'll simply take
a whisk and give this a very thorough mixing so yes compared to a lot of
barbecue sauces a relatively short ingredient list okay one of the big
reasons people prefer this stuff from the store - somebody's homemade sauce is
that the home versions tend to overdo with the spicing and I don't mean
spiciness I mean the spices like mace and cinnamon and a bunch of other stuff
people put in whereas your average store-bought sauce tends to be much more
subtly spiced and well balanced but having said that go ahead and
add in whatever spices want I mean guys are after all the bosses of
your barbecue sauces so taste and tweak as see fit and that's it once this
is mixed up it's done and does not need to be cooked I mean can if want
but generally this is gonna get heated through when serve it for example
when brush them on those ribs to glaze them when you're grilling so I
don't cook this sauce but what I do like to do time permitting is wrap it up and
let it sit in the fridge for a day or two to give all those flavors time to
develop which point is ready to use for things like pulled pork sliders which is
a great delivery system to judge any barbecue sauce okay a smoked and pulled
pork shoulder has a relatively neutral flavor which allows to really taste
what's going on with your sauce and what's going on with this one I think is
a perfect balance between sweet and tangy which of course can also
adjust to your taste by altering the amounts of the sweetener and vinegar but
if do enjoy those very popular Kansas city-style sauces from the store
I really think you're gonna love this and of course if wanted to taste
that on something a little less neutral I find it absolutely fantastic on some
highly seasoned ribs like these amazing salt and pepper ribs which I am going to
show how to make an upcoming video very soon since those really were
absolutely stunning and of course you'd want to just keep your fancy homemade
BBQ sauce in a bowl which is why can always funnel it into a squeeze bottle
and I keep that in the fridge until you're ready to use it although in the
barbecue joints they don't refrigerate the sauce and probably don't need to
since it has such a high sugar and acid content but anyway that's where I keep
mine until I need to pull it out and squeeze it over some salt and pepper
ribs did I mention those are coming up so
please stay tuned for those but in the meantime I really do hope give this
all-american barbecue sauce a try soon so please follow the links below for the
ingredient amounts a printable written recipe a much more info as usual and is
all we enjoy
