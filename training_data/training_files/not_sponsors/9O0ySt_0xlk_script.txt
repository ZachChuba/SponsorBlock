hi I'm Danielle and you're watching Animal Logic second-nature how can light in nature undisciplined play harness for communications the light it generates is a kind of light never before known on earth bioluminescence the evolution of being able to light up [Music] this mesmerizing ability is found in a myriad of species around the world [Music] from deep-sea fish to cave dwelling worms to the fireflies you might see in your backyard yet despite this shared phenomena many of these species came about it individually there is special interest in a special kind of light wave in other centuries they would have called it magic bioluminescence has evolved separately at least 50 times in dozens of species found in habitats around the world this is called convergent evolution when species not closely related develops similar traits and abilities to deal with their environments bioluminescence is the result of a chemical reaction between two chemicals luciferin and luciferase another pathway to research in the spinning worlds of atomic structure when luciferin is oxidized in the presence of a catalyst the photo protein luciferase it produces light the intensity of the light is reflective of the velocity of the enzyme-substrate reaction this reaction produces a cool light that creates very little heat yet Luciferian is not native to all bioluminescent species several species absorb Luciferian by eating species that do produce it or form symbiotic relationships with them the ocean floor is a dream world silent fast mystic unreal lonely beyond words beauty that haunts one Majesty all its own inhabited by strange weird creatures like this great sea anemone the majority of bioluminescent animals live in the ocean as freshwater is too murky for their glow to be effective these marine organisms tend to produce light at the lower end of the spectrum blue light as it travels furthest in the water terrestrial animals like fireflies often produce a yellow light as that's the color to which they have the most sensitivity a jumble of waves of different sizes and colors radiating outwards in wild disorder despite its similarity and unrelated species bioluminescence is used in many different ways you notice that his head is being screwed on tight he really does need that down under the water you've heard of fountain pens that write underwater well this is a camera that takes pictures underwater which is even a hard a trick to perform deep in the ocean lies a creature that has remained virtually unchanged for 300 million years some vampire squid first of all powers what's this eerie shape this deep-sea Marvel is neither vampire nor squid and instead scavenges the depths for organic matter when threatened by a predator it'll turn itself inside out hoping to scare it off with its sinister appearance having no ink sacs as a last resort the vampire squid will release a burst of bioluminescent mucus startling its predator as the squid escapes sea cucumbers and brittle stars don't have bioluminescent mucus to distract their predators but they don't let that stop them when threatens they can detach bioluminescent parts of their bodies confusing their predators as they limp their way to safety some comb jellies are bioluminescent but it's not the ones you might think many comb jellies simply appear bioluminescent when they have a light shone on them that are rippling combs catch the light and reflect it in gorgeous rainbow patterns those comb jellies that are bioluminescent use their ability as a defense when threatened by a predator they will emit a flash of light in hopes of startling their attacker whilst they escape similar tiny beams of light are entering your own eyes bioluminescence is not always used in defense sometimes it's used to hide Lantern sharks like to combine these two strategies they have bioluminescent organs along their abdomen which they use to replicate the color of the sky with little in the deep sea to blend into color matching with the sky is an excellent way to hide from predators or prey beneath you this is called counter illumination but Lantern sharks also have light emitting cells on their spines they use these to warn predators that they're dangerous the theory is that their deep-sea predators have better sight than their prey and their prey won't see their dimly lit spines until it's too late organs actually attract prey when they're feeding that in the deeper zones of the ocean it brings prey to them which then they can prey upon this is a pose Semitism and it's quite common among the bioluminescence the scientist is an explorer moving day by day known to the unknown millipedes in the moat ixia genus found in California produced cyanide in order to warn predators that there is more to them than meets the eye these millipedes glow blue at night similarly railroad worms employ a series of yellowish green lights on their sides to warn predators that they are toxic though some species feature our red light on their heads which they use when they're hunting this acts as a headlight for the railroad worm but to their prey they're invisible as most insects cannot see red now anybody who hasn't a firm grip on his emotions had better not look any more for something's going to happen around here and I don't mean maybe several species of dragon fish including the stoplight loose jaw and it is what it sounds like employ a very similar strategy they produce a red light that helps them hunt which their prey is unable to see a light ten million times brighter and the light on the surface of the Sun what's most interesting though is that loose jaws can't naturally see red light and they need to eat copious amounts of copepods in order to get their required pigments to see red from a hill that's what you are [Music] sperm whales also employ bioluminescence in order to find prey though not directly instead of eating bioluminescent plankton they use it as a lure when a fish that does eat plankton approaches the plankton shines alerting the sperm whales that their meal has arrived science itself cannot know the total promise or it stands now only at the threshold of its exploration yet this narrow pathway of light leads surely to tomorrow [Music] deep in the caves of new zealand live one of the world's most mesmerizing species look lo worm inside the white omec caves these worms produce thousands of gorgeous blue dots that look like a fantastical night sky but their beauty is part of their trap these glowing larvae use their bioluminescence to lure prey into their sticky silk threads trapping them before pulling them up towards their mouths and devouring them in this submerged world we're unreal lights play across the ocean floor strange fish appeared out of unexpected corners forests of gently undulating seaweeds gaudy shells which is the punch of the divers would become animate and couple away possibly the most famous bioluminescent creature also uses lures the deep-sea female anglerfish these monstrous looking deep-sea hunters feature a bioluminescent lure which they use not only to attract prey but mates angler fish are incredibly sexually dimorphic and while the females look like something out of the mind of H R Giger the males are tiny and bland these males spend their entire lives searching for a female to mate with and her having a glowing lure certainly helps a beam of light more intense and more precisely directed than has ever been produced in man's history fireflies employ a similar strategy male fireflies use bioluminescence to light up in different patterns to tell females that they're single and ready to mingle though sometimes that's a trap some females will light up using a pattern of a different smaller species when a male arrives to mate with her the larger female Firefly will eat him they're real femme fatales so you see women need to know as much about science as some men do next time on animal logic second nature you'll be meeting my co-host just kidding she's an illustrator author and zoologist and all-around cool person she'll be guiding you through the scary world of
