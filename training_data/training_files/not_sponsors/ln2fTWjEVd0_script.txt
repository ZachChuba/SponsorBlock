make your next move with Squarespace oh hi there it's me Jordan I'm coming to you live from my Josh is here - yeah pretty great echo-chamber we've got here I was thinking the exact same thing huh I think that's why it's an echo chamber I love everything you say and the same for you what we all have that go chambers don't we the internet just makes it all so darn simple validation has never been easier seriously Jordan this echo chamber is so nice I love what you've done with the walls thanks I really think it makes the room feel bigger yeah look it's hard to talk to people you disagree with it immediately puts you on the defensive well I loved the last Jedi yeah what I hated it is a personal attack against me no I'm not personally attacking you but I do feel like the fact that you like the movie is the personal attack on me like I'm the one being attacked here Oh give me a break you're acting like such a martyr if anybody's being attacked here it's me it wasn't good become so tough these days to have actual conversations with people we disagree with which is a very bad thing because if you can't talk to people with different opinions than yours then you can never grow unless you're 100% right about everything in the whole world in which case none of this matters and you can carry on just to being right about everything thank you guys it's important that we all maintain the ability to communicate with each other even when our precious opinions on things different I know it's a tall order but for the sake of society as a whole we have to bear this cross so here are a few things to keep in mind when dealing with these confused deranged people who don't share in your enlightenment okay so the first one is to just try and find some common ground sure maybe what this person believes is toxic perhaps even god forbid problematic but maybe just maybe there is some common ground between but how do you find it well call the All American Rejects as I'm about to tell you the dirty little secret everyone thinks that they're in the right no one is trying to be evil aside from the Illuminati nobody wakes up in the morning and things oh wow another day to make the world a more evil horrible place everyone thinks they're doing what's right and that's why it's important to to keep in mind that just because someone doesn't agree with your solution to a problem doesn't mean that they don't think that the problem is a problem let me explain with an example so you know how the politicians always give the bills they want to pass these insultingly condescending names well today I am signing into law the save the poor people bill I care so much about poor people that I am signing a piece of paper to end poorness oh thank God for the brave politicians who have the courage to sign the save the poor people bill I'm not really sure I necessarily like all the details of this bill you have to avoid thinking this way see because if you can just strip your opponent of their humanity by falsely assuming that they don't have any well you've just given yourself permission to treat them like the scum they are right Wow Wow another day to treat people as less than human because they treat other people as less than human what this just cycle this leads to something called cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonance is when you say something to someone that their brain it's just not prepared to hear and thus cannot receive their brain literally rejects information isn't that sad hmm what's that oh oh no no you you can't suffer from cognitive dissonance it's something that only afflicts the people you're trying to enlighten if they try to convince you that you are suffering from cognitive distance well I don't even know what will you call that well it must be so sad to be bad closed-minded I have one more piece of advice on the topic of talking to people you disagree with and honestly it's probably the best advice I have that's right I saved the best for last and I didn't even say that I was going to save the best for last at the beginning of the video darn attention watched I I'm sorry oh okay here it is instead of trying to let people know what a genius you are and how much you have everything the whole world figured out all the time instead just ask questions just ask lots of questions so instead of saying this oh really that's what you think well let me tell you what I think instead ask a question uh-huh so so tell me why is it that you think that he does care well look I know it's nice to try and prove that your position is the correct one but it's also good to ask people why they think the way they think and then keep asking them questions maybe at a certain point they won't have an answer and that'll prove that you're right yeah no look okay you're not asking people questions so that you can catch him or something hey I got you you're asking people questions so that you can understand other people's perspectives and that shouldn't scare you it's it's okay to expand your mind I promise but he's not going to expand his mind if I give up warnings then I lose maybe so maybe so but you've been a good example for how to have healthy communications and eventually we're gonna need someone to be the better person here or else yeah boy I could use some of that cognitive distance right now you know to protect my brain from the natural conclusion of what happens when people stop being able to talk to each other oh boy stay tuned for a scene from our next purchase that squarespace.com slash Cal next week on messy Monday's Jordan and Josh admire their echo-chamber seriously it is so nice in here I agree I really like that it can be anything that we need it to be you know yeah if we can just stay in it for years without ever leaving yeah exactly it would be scary to leave the comfort of this room yeah but what if we changed things up like what you want to paint the walls white or something what do you think this is like a Christian movie review channel no no let's we'll stick with the black yeah
