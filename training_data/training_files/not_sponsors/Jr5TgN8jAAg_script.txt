[Music] welcome to the picture this photography podcast where we talk about all things photography and today you are gonna be talking about the five hundred dollar full-frame mirrorless cannon to beat Fuji Sony and Nikon yeah we think this is how it's actually going to play out we think and it's already working on this this is a futuristic podcast we're gonna be looking into the future we're gonna be nerding out we're gonna be talking about what this means for you because it might influence your next camera purchase decision it might even influence how you feel about your gear right now but first please take a moment the coupon code Tony thank Squarespace let's dig right in to this $500 camera versus the smartphone first why is a $500 camera even important like everybody gets excited about the 2000 $3000 cameras but that's not what people buy right when we talk to people people ask us all the time what camera they should get like civilians like people not watching this YouTube channel yeah this isn't really about you if you already have a camera and you're ready into it we're not really referring to you at this point in the podcast podcast we're talking about people that like taking pictures on their phone and then they say which camera should I get I enjoy photography I want to start and the price point they always give us is $500 I don't know why what if they're a multi-millionaire literally no a multi-millionaire told me $500 yep waiter at the restaurant down the street $500 right my friend 25 years old $500 and I talked to Chris Reddy he teaches photography classes at a college 500 dollars for some reason like between four and $500 is the magical price for people starting and this has always been like the entry level camera but there's kind of a problem that it doesn't yet exist for these new mounts that Canon and Nikon have they don't have a $500 camera so we'll get into that into a little bit there used to be like the point-and-shoot cameras and things like that those are huge remember the cool pics and Ashton Kutcher was in the commercials yes and they were so cool they were literally called cool pics and the point-and-shoot cameras were like just moving like crazy for these camera companies cannon had power shots we had a power shots and Nikon had cool pics and then there are a few others but that's how camera manufacturers were making their money they were selling these point-and-shoot cameras like crazy before smartphone cameras became good and now they're dead and now they're completely dead I did a whole video on this called the death of the consumer camera if you want to look it up that's from 2016 and it has only continued we have a chart up here that shows 1999 the digital camera market was very small they didn't really exist yet and then some of us started moving on to MySpace and match.com and we wanted digital pictures of ourselves good more and more people started buying digital cameras and this whole thing Peaks from 2008 to 2010 where we were shipping like 120 million cameras a year a lot of cameras it's crazy and so now we're in 2018 and that number is down to about 20 million cameras and the president the CEO of Canon recently predicted that that would fall by 50% over the next two years it doesn't keep down trend is not done it just keeps falling so why are we bringing that up because now there's a hole on the market so used to have people starting out in photography they buy a point-and-shoot camera they were like $300 I remember you know people would go down to RadioShack or whatever and grab a point-and-shoot and now I see people they have their smartphone they want to get into photography with a camera that's better than their smartphone and they can get a $500 camera but it's not better really or easier than their smartphone yeah when you pick up a $500 camera especially something like a deed 3500 or at night Canon t6 they have immediately have a primitive optical viewfinder and when I say that you look through it it looks like a Commodore 64 like it's got a little green text and it has half a dozen little boxes within the center of the frame that you're supposed to focus with yeah and if you're used to a smartphone that seems so old-timey if you grew up on those cameras fine but on the younger generation it starts with smartphones no the focusing on those actually way slower than your smartphone they do not connect directly to the Internet so you can't quickly share things you can't do things like streaming to snapchat or Instagram stories which we do it has not that capability at all it has these SD cards which were all used to it well used to it fine with it what happens when our daughter who has access to lots of cameras when she takes pictures with a real camera and they're on the SD card she hands us the camera and she says can you get these on my phone and she loves using the camera and the same thing with my mother she likes using her camera but when it comes to the SD card she's like I don't know what to do with this I don't want to deal with this so there's this disconnect between using it and actually getting access to the to the photos so but if you can't figure out SD card you shouldn't even be a photographer you know you should get a different hobby I'm sure that there's someone crying about that right now another thing I see all the time I hear it from people I see it in reviews they say I bought this camera but then I look at the pictures side by side with my smartphone and my smartphone pictures actually look better and this is true the image quality from entry-level cameras because of the awful lenses they put on them is worse than your smartphone so you have a worse experience overall worse image quality and then have you tried going into the menu systems holy and I think a part of this problem is that people used to go from like remember your disposable film camera I had those those were some of my first cameras then you went to just you know a point and shoe and then it was kind of a natural progression to go to a DSLR it really wasn't that different there was a shutter button and some of the same features but it's different now it's changed for people that are starting photography right now they're going from a fully automatic beautiful display with very intuitive touch and drag features to something it seems old-fashioned and something that's more difficult to use but not everybody wants to use the smartphone for pictures that's why people keep asking us what camera they should buy the smart phones if you use a smart phone first of all you don't look pro at all so if you have any ambitions of selling your services or you just want to feel like a pro you don't do it with a smartphone they also have a pretty terrible experience like you can kind of use the volume down button as your shutter that kind of thing but it's difficult to hold it's not comfortable your finger ends up in the picture sometimes you can drop it easily and that shatters when you drop it if you want to shoot sports a wildlife forget it telephoto lenses on any cam smartphone the bokeh on it for portraits that's getting better but it's still fake still looks a little weird sometimes and you can't do bokeh at all for video and video is increasingly important and we want to look pro with a little bit of bokeh it's also not hobby like people want a pastime they want to get engaged into something and a camera makes them feel like they're involved in the hobby of photography and a smartphone doesn't do that so I didn't understand that because we get tons of people coming to us that we know saying what should my first camera be you should you would know and I say well what do you want to take pictures of and how much do you want to spend and sometimes my answer is we'll just stick with your phone and then I feel bad because like their excitement I can see them deflate and I've come to learn that people still really want cameras they really want to hold a real camera there's a need for that there's a hole in the market and that's what we're about filling today I tell people just use a smartphone and then the next time I see them they asked me again what camera should I get yeah they say smartphone and then the next time I see them like I still want a camera yeah and then they get a camera and they're like I don't use it because I don't know how to get the pictures off of it so there are lots of $500 cameras out there now but they all have one real problem for both the consumers and the manufacturers and there's no upgrade path to the high-end full-frame cameras and for the manufacturer that is the ideal they want you to buy a cheap camera and then two years from now buy a more expensive camera buy more lenses and hopefully keep you on the hook for 20 years in their infrastructure buying lenses and flashes of course you want a repeat customer that's how they make their money and that makes sense yeah they don't want to make 500 bucks they want to make ten thousand dollars off of you and they do make that off of a lot of us so $500 cameras you have the e/m 10 which is in the Micro Four Thirds system I love that you have the d30 400 which is Nikon's DSLR but I feel like Nikon is leaving behind the F mount and they're moving into the ass Mountain with the Z cameras now you have the Canon t6 which again it's a DSLR mount that I think Canon is abandoning and then you have the Canon M cameras which are canons mirrorless mount but it's their aps-c mirrorless now and they developed this new Canon arm mount and they're not compatible this means you can buy yourself an M 50 but if you want to upgrade to a full-frame Canon are you can't you have to sell all your camera and your lenses again and that's where okay so that becomes an issue right because we've actually talked to people about that too I want to upgrade to full frame but I'll have to sell all of my glass and my camera maybe while I'm at it I can switch from Canon to Nikon so now you give camera manufacturers they're seeing that people have an opportunity to switch away from their system and that is one reason that they might want to just stay with one mount because when people upgrade their camera they don't have to sell all their lenses that would be the ideal situation so why not do what they've always done we just have the low end cameras have a smaller aps-c sensor and then have people upgrade to the bigger sensor I think there's a lot of reasons we've talked about the fact that the aps-c format might and people have been enraged about it we've we've upset you so much and I'm sorry we've upset you but this is some of our reasoning behind why we think this might happen I've talked to a couple of confidential sources in industry insiders who have given me some insight into what the manufacturing cost for these sensors are and it seems like the price difference between producing an aps-c sensor and a full-frame sensor is somewhere between 50 to 150 dollars so if you were to take an aps-c camera and just upgrade the sensor and keep everything else the same the price wouldn't need to increase that much maybe you'd be looking at a hundred or two hundred dollars total price increase but there's a greater perceived value people have full a lot of mysticism around full-frame cameras like that is the ultimate goal because that's what all the pro pros use yeah should I go full-frame we hear that all the time for the sake of the manufacturers they could if they could not use aps-c if they could only use one sensor size that means they only have to produce lenses for one sensor size they no longer have to make a 24 to 70 and an 18 to 55 for aps-c they just make the 24 to 70 and as Canon and I kind of developing these new mirrorless lens mounts that greatly simplifies the number of lenses they have to produce but it also simplifies the marketing around it they don't have to say oh this lens is EFS so it's for your aps-c camera but this lens is EF and it's for your full-frame camera that has always baffled people and I have I had a friend who bought an a7 r3 and then a Sony aps-c lens so they bought a full-frame camera and an aps-c lens because they were just confused because it didn't make any sense it's baffling to people so it'll be a simplified lens lineup and when people go to upgrade they don't have to say oh these lenses I have our aps-c so I need to sell those all the lenses that they have will always work perfectly fine the way you would expect them to as you upgrade and spend those tens of thousands of dollars yes so the price difference between an ASP SC sensor and a full-frame sensor it's not that great so why not just switch all the full-frame and simplify everything it used to be greater which is why we used to do it that way yeah you would be huge why Canon because we said we think this will be a $500 full-frame canon camera we talked about which companies we thought could do this and we think it's canon so let us just tell you why they have their own sensor fabrication facility they make their own sensors Sony does also but Sony already has an existing aps-c lens lineup and they have that path of going from aps-c to full-frame Nikon buy sensors from other people most manufacturers do canon has probably the best brand recognition in the industry right now you can ask anyone that doesn't know anything about photography about the best camera brand and they're gonna say Canon or Nikon over and over again people love my I used to have a Canon my dad had a Canon I think I'm gonna get a Canon and that goes that helps a lot Canon also makes that the most intuitive and easy to use cameras they have very good touch screens the autofocus system just finds a face anywhere in the scene and smoothly pulls focus in you can switch to video and it all kind of works much better than other cameras do now that doesn't matter to nerds but to first-time camera users picking up a camera that matters so much it's probably the closest to the smartphone photography experience in just a moment we're gonna show you our actual predictions for when these cameras are gonna come what they're going to cost so you can make your own buying decisions based on that we're also gonna prove to you that a 500 mirrorless camera is possible but first use the coupon code Toni to get 10% off thanks for space thanks alright let's talk about if this $500 full frame is possible because people have told us he can't make a full frame camera for $500 so we started looking into the price of parts and we started making our own Frankenstein monster of a camera by piecing together different cameras and figuring out how to slash costs and how to make it possible it can be done there are two ways to approach this you could start with like a D base camera like a D 3500 or you could start with a smartphone and tack on a big lens so first of all if you're starting from the D 3500 there's so much stuff from this $400 camera that you could take off you do not need a flash now you can get rid of all the DSLR components the mirror box the mirror the prism and the optical viewfinder you get rid of all yeah and everything that comes with that the diopter all these little moving parts that you need to have that and it's not just the cost of the parts but the complexity of the assembly right if we remove these parts and we simplify it then suddenly we have something that can just fly through the factory let's streamline this baby cannon let's get this done we don't need a battery we just don't need one people don't want it we'll put that in the body there's no door and you don't need an SD card either let's just make that all streamline included in the camera you plug it in to charge it just like your phone and you don't have to worry about manufacturing all the little doors and things like we were talking about come on cannon little things you can get rid of like the HDMI port and the focus assist it just aren't really necessary with modern mirrorless cameras so believe it or not mirrorless cameras are actually cheaper because they have fewer parts to make the other direction you could start yourself with an inexpensive smartphone and basically build a buddy around all those electronics and stick a lens mount on there a smartphone you can get an Android smartphone for $220 that has a Snapdragon processor and it which is totally capable of running wonderful software and handling all the images a six inch touchscreen 64 gigs of memory Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity 3300 milliamp hour battery that's three to four times bigger than a typical camera and that's $220 a d610 sensor retails for about $80 I've seen so now you're looking at $300 retail for the parts and you just need to take those parts and put them into a camera body yeah why don't cameras have a SIM card let's let's hook these babies up yeah I want that I want it so it seems totally feasible let's make a couple of solid predictions for when we think this is gonna happen and the price point sir yeah we cuz we wanted to happen but we also think it will happen manufacturers tend went with these new lens lineups these new mounts like the Canon are the Nikon Z they introduced the expensive stuff first because excited people are gonna spend whatever they have to to jump into it and then they'll start bringing the price down canna started with a twenty three hundred dollar camera and then launched a thirteen hundred dollar camera Nikon $3,400 then two thousand dollars so we see that we'll see these prices come down I think by the twenty the end of 2019 Canon will have $1000 mirrorless full-frame our camera they'll introduce another lower camera and then I think over the course of the next couple of years it will continue to drop and I'm gonna guess we're gonna see this $500 full-frame camera and maybe 2021 this is my concern I'm gonna lodge this in here and then walk away I'm worried that smartphones are gonna get there first so they're kind of racing against that a little bit yeah like maybe they'll give us all these things we want the better experience and the better image quality mm-hmm here my predictions for what I think the cameras are gonna look like I think the $500 camera will be very stripped down it can have maybe it's an 18 megapixel sensor or maybe they'll just use the existing 26 megapixel sensor probably still only be HD even a couple of years from now because that's probably fine 64 gigabytes of integrated ram i think they'll keep a hot shoe because vloggers really love that yeah we've debated a hot or cold shoe and a hot shoe is simple enough yeah and then just a USBC port that's it that will be the just like your smartphone and it'll have Wi-Fi integrated and then you want at ease you want to get somebody into the store looking for a $500 camera and sell them something more expensive yeah so we're gonna bring it up a little bit to the $6.99 price point cuz you're gonna get a little bit more and at that point they'll get an electronic viewfinder which is optional but a really nice to have a flip forward screen that all the vloggers are gonna be willing to pay more for Limited 4k at least or maybe full 4k at this point in history slow motion more memory like 128 gigs and then I'm still hoping at some point they'll offer SIM card and see them on it and they could charge a little more for that like if you get an iPad with the SIM card it's $100 more than an iPad without so you can kind of easily do that but yeah so we got the base model $4.99 then though would you like fries with that model and we upsell them a little bit yeah there you go we also tried to come up with some recommendations for how camera manufacturers can get from these clunky cameras to cameras that can actually compete with smartphones you need the software I don't know these menu systems they keep making these small improvements but they need a jump we just need things to be more intuitive easier and just simpler to use so higher the mobile developers yeah there's about a billion of them yeah but they haven't seem to hire them I also think a long term they need to build a camera platform around snapdragon and android they need to use common off-the-shelf smartphone parts that will lower costs and simplify ongoing software development no more digit processors nobody nobody cares about that branding anymore do we need to work to drive down full-frame sensor costs making inexpensive full-frame sensors once you put your targets on that it'll definitely be possible design cheaper fast lenses like $100 $200 lenses more lenses like the nifty 50 fantastic plastic but give me those give me an 85 f18 or f2 that is 150 dollars just imagine can be done someone at one of these companies just being like these North ropes I know that the people that DxO mark will be rolling their eyes at the sharpness and chromatic aberration but first-time camera buyers won't care they won't care that they get that awesome 85 millimeter look and all that background blur and then I think once they build this camera they can market it with influence or marketing because that's so effective those influencers sells so many presets yeah so many outfits like people want all of that and if you had top instagramers switch from using a smartphone to using a camera like this and attributing their photo qualities to this new camera they would fly off the shelves yeah already doing a lot of that would the influencer marketing but that would probably be how they'd have to market this camera then will they make their long-term profit because we pondered this could they actually make enough of a profit margin on a 500 dollar full-frame camera to make it worth their while and we realize yeah we think it's possible because you can upsell people if the camera is easy enough okay let me back up this is what I see happen people get an entry level camera and it's difficult to use and then it just sits there and they never buy more into the system because it's too complicated they don't want to buy another lens because they don't know how to use their except their existing ones so once the camera is simplified and people are actually using it they don't have to take out the SD card they'll buy into more lenses and they don't have to be expensive to produce you could even do a vintage line where you take older tech that looks cool and has new effects that could be a part of it you can make good looking cases that come with it a lot like they did with like the cool pics and the point-and-shoot where it was about the design and the accessories and about you know identifying with the camera and making it a part of your style and they could have their own flashes that are easier to use like water flash is so complicated right now it should just be much simpler and if they're simple people will use them yeah I think it should just be like based on Bluetooth or some other wireless connection you could stick it in the hot shoe or take it off the hot shoe either way it's operating exactly the same and you're not worried about it and one that I think is really important is if you start working on your software development you can sell apps and people love that so you can imagine looking at your camera and you can buy an app for skin smoothing or you can buy an app that makes it look like film or you can buy an app that puts cool picture frames or makes a collage suddenly these camera manufacturers will be making money from software that would make a ton of money other ideas that we had things like overlays that could outline poses you could see them right on the back of the camera and make sure that you were nailing the poses you could have tutorials built in you could build scavenger hunting apps using things like object recognition you know take a picture of a bird send it off to the cloud and then it'll identify it as european robin and give you a couple of points for that yeah like badges and achievements I mean if it's you know cellularly connected it could tell where you are oh you photograph five major cities like suddenly there's an interactive component like your phone where your camera is more than just the camera it's fun and it's interacting with you and if they open up their own app marketplace developers will be motivated they'll be paid for making cool things and who knows what they'll be able to develop but the camera manufacture will get a piece for that this is a multi-billion dollar industry for companies like Apple and Google so why don't they what doesn't Canon and Nikon and Sony get a piece of that it's huge finally I think they can also make some money off of selling like prints directly from the camera you know you're gonna be the default provider you don't need to be the only provider but you can be the default provider for prints and Internet cloud storage for the photos and you can charge people monthly you could Co market with cellular providers if you put that sim in there then people go into Verizon and for an extra 10 bucks they can get their connection through Verizon so their cameras constantly connected you can each get a piece of that both Verizon and Canon there's a lot of opportunities here I know I'm excited and I get a little bummed out when I think about the camera industry not selling as many cameras and phones getting a piece of those sales that bums me out I'd love to see them really dig into this technology and make that $500 camera that everyone Watson uses the Newbridge camera needs to bridge the gap between smartphones and the cameras that were accustomed to and it does not exist today no well it does now that we just invented it tell me we'd like to take a use the coupon code Tony to get 10% off in the comments down below I would love to hear what your thoughts are is a $500 full-frame mirrorless camera possible would you buy it what else would you want to see in it are we completely wrong is it all impossible and everything we're doing everything wrong should cameras just stay the way they are gosh darn it can I just comfort everybody who's freaking out right now we always get people who are like oh my god no I hope this never happens because they think we're like taking the camera out of their hands or something there is no risk that camera companies are going to innovate to fast they are not gonna leave you behind the cameras the form factors you like your SD cards they're all those cameras are gonna stay around for a long time yeah I think that's true but I also I mean this means so much to me I'd love to have a camera I could put in my teenager's hands and she can just get those pictures online right away and enjoy the experience and I want the next generation to be able to really love this hobby and profession that we've been able to enjoy it doesn't have not all cameras are gonna be like this if we just want one camera just one camera that fills this void yeah let us know your thoughts subscribe for more be sure to sign up for the podcast and picture this in your favorite podcasting app and we'll see you next week
