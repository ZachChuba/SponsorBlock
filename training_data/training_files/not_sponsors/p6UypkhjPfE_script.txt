what's up guys my name is Tom spark welcome back to another video today we're gonna be doing another video review of a VPN I've never really looked at that much before it's a smaller VPN service but who knows maybe it's the next best VPN on the channel anyways guys today we're gonna be taking a look at bullet VPN if you guys want to see all my other VPN reviews and rankings of course go check out VPN tearless com that's pretty much where you gonna find everything related to the channel anyways guys let's go ahead and start this review okay so of course the first thing we're gonna be taking a look at is pricing what are smooth things so that you can't Wimpole a VPN in terms of what you're paying for what you're getting well both VPN is 6:17 use devices wait a second this look kind of familiar so the same guy hmm well either bullet VPN really likes expressvpn just got inspired or maybe they're using kind of the same image or the same designer those two say kind of funny though right I'm 146 servers and 54 countries looking at the pricing let's take a look at it it's gonna be around eleven dollars per month and it's gonna be under $20 for three years and one year is gonna be around $90 I do not really like pricing plans like this that are expensive for one month and cheaper or longer-term for three years and the one year plan isn't that good either $90.00 90 to 100 it's pretty damn expensive we see VPNs in Tier one like tor guard being only five dollars a month with promo code Tom spark we VPN is also only five dollars a month other stuff like air VPN is around seven bucks a month so there are cheaper options out there than pullet VPN and I don't really like the trying to push you into these long term commitment plans to get a decent price on that set you know we do have 6:17 these connections we have some Bitcoin alternative so this is just a credit card maybe the alternative credit card we've credit card of course in PayPal I do wish for a little bit more options here you know with stuff like tour art again you have stuff like more cryptocurrency payment options you have gift cards and stuff like that which is really nice and anonymous we're not really seeing that here so far so overall you know and then let's move on to the next category so let's go ahead and do the application analysis that has become standard for VPN reviews let's go ahead and see what they have to offer I don't really know why I can't click on this it seems to be an clickable maybe if I do this below shield there you go so both shields some kind of firewall I'm imagining and it has a kill switch is probably an act like a network kill switch you know if bullet VPN disconnects or something like that it's going to disconnect the network if a little bit of connection start up there PPTP LTE GP slap ship sec and openvpn these are pre or protocols LTE to be is more common on mobile devices Open VPN is more industry standard here as well as a little bit of options for Open VPN port protocol customization it's just configuring you know TCP might be more reliable UDP probably give you better speeds but we don't see wire card here and notably we don't see Ike v2 either which is good for fast connections I'm looking more and more nowadays for VPNs that support wire guard because it's becoming more of the industry standard besides that though there's not really too much else to the applications so let's go ahead and fill this out that's gonna be known for application kill switch we have known for that know for I cleats you support no for dedicated IP support no for wire guard support we didn't see any ad blocking features let me double so I double checked and there is no ad blocking features no split tunneling no stock side proxy support I do not believe this has observation either I am correct there is no observation no encryption customization no DNS no port customization no script support no server whoa let's see is there server favoriting there is server favoriting so we got a green folks we got a green and this is also green that would kill switch configuration wild live use well let's go ahead and find out connect to it let's see what happens connecting that's not a good sign so guys I was actually able to keep all of that VPN working basically what I had to do is uninstall every other VPN uninstalled the tap driver and completely restart my computer so definitely a little bit of a hassle but sometimes it can be a problem with VPN so not gonna dig in too much for that although that's definitely annoying now we do want to finally test that configuration while you live use features so let's go ahead and see if that works so no actually somehow tour guard works you cannot just swap servers whenever you want which is definitely a bit of a bummer so guys in terms of bullet VPN I definitely think that this is probably one of the most out-of-date VPN applications we've seen on the channel they don't really have any features to boot it's pretty much just the ability to change your protocol to outdated protocols there's no wire guard Ike v2 no port customization no DNS customization script support encryption customization no cool features like ad blocking or split tunneling no dedicated IPs you kind of get the picture overall I actually don't really mind the interface it's actually quite easy to use it's simple to navigate good to look at the servers and there's a decent amount of servers to pick from and you can favorite them as well which is cool I don't really see any options for streaming compatibility yet so I'll have to test it on later but you know while I do like the interface I can't deny that it's missing a lot a lot of stuff guys [Music] so guys what is disappointing not to see that bullet VPN doesn't support wire guard or anything like that it's still good to see they do have open VPN so we're gonna be testing that with this speed test and seeing what kind of speeds we can get and then of course go into a more realistic downloading torrent file from Ubuntu so we'll see what kind of speeds we can get there the ping looks pretty good here not bad at all download rate seems to be testing very very slowly not sure what's going on in there upload rate is usually around 40 without VPN download is usually around a thousand being is somewhere around here so not the best beat test so far let's go ahead and see we can get torrenting all right so we are connecting it now let's see what kind of speeds we can get I usually like to get around thirty to forty megabytes a second download here for faster VPN providers anything about forty is gonna be very very fast almost like above five out of five four speeds we see some that a little bit more nowadays with stuff like wire guard implementation but since we don't have that I would be surprised to get that go to speeds right now we're getting kind of just kind of decent speeds like I said thirty to forty is kind of like my five out of five four speeds right now we're getting kind of inconsistent below fifteen more as standard you did get twenty seven right there but it looks to be more consistently kind of in the 10 to 20 range which is just kind of okay coupled with that slow speed test I'm not gonna think that a bullet VPN really has that good of speeds which is kind of unfortunately so guys what kind of logs does bullet VPN it collect well it does collect advocate usage information which is used in the following manner they collect information I guess to perform server analysis for server performance analysis for continuous optimization such as adding new features and forcing preventive and security stuff as such we use email address stored so it looks like they story email address for just basic website stuff and here is the information about the aggregate information collected they do collect server connection metadata including server IP addresses of reports and server bandwidth metrics for the VPN service to remote resources or stored in aggregate form that is kind of anonymized i yes the metadata does not include user IP addresses reports norris attracter stored any manner that allows costs from referencing so they just throw the server IP addresses and probably kind of connection and bandwidth logs and stuff like that it doesn't look like they collect any of your user information so a little bit more logs than i would prefer a but it's not the worst necessarily so so I was able to find some information about bolt vpns ownership is that they are owned by Nick's work so you a private limited company based in Estonia it's part of you and not part of the 549 Alliance I guess if you care about something like that honestly don't know much about this company no one's were they talking about it I haven't really heard too much about it but yeah you know there you go that's pretty much all I could find about the company it's a pretty small company so again not that much information on it so we are connected to bullet VPN let's see if it works with Netflix so the way these VPNs nowadays work with Netflix is that Netflix will allow you to watch Netflix originals like this stuff but if you really want to see if your VPN is unblocking G restrictions or giving you additional content let's say you're based in the United States and you want to watch Japanese content in the Japanese version of Netflix or if you're in Japan and you want to watch the United States version on Netflix you're going to need a VPN that unblocked cgo restrictions on Netflix that doesn't just serve you up Netflix original content so here we're gonna type what's that show called again Twilight Zone so if it's showing the twilight zone that means we are watching the USA version of Netflix not just Netflix originals so it's actually quite impressive to see that bullet VPN is compatible to unblock your restrictions on Netflix very nice let's go ahead and test out some of the other streaming services now all right so we're testing Hulu and it actually looks like it's working as well very nice so guys I've been trying to get Bolla VPN to work with Amazon video it seems like it's kind of like too laggy to honestly get working with it which is definitely kind of a bummer the good thing is is that it does seem to be working with BBC iPlayer a little bit slow No maybe not so I'm trying out a different TV show same server and we're still kind of running in just some of the same problems that I ran into with prime video seems like it perhaps could be unblocking it but it's so slow and so laggy that it doesn't actually start the service so that's quite unfortunately so guys what about bullet VPN support well they don't have any live chat which is definitely disappointing but they do have a way to send the messages in contact their support you know as expected so I'm gonna test it out and see how long it takes to get an actual refund so yeah there we go what's the only long it takes all right guys so what is bullet VPNs final score well it's gonna get a two point five eight out of five making it a tier 3 VPN provider not really recommended for use now bullet VPN you know it's not the worst VPN out there are some things like its reputation or you know we've never really been anything bad bad about it I don't think in terms of speeds it's okay however the application it's just two basic nowadays it doesn't really do that well in terms of the application analysis it's missing a lot of settings and new features and new kind of things that we're looking for in VPNs nowadays the pricing also I think this is much too expensive for what you're getting especially with how simple the application is and in terms of support we did see pretty good response time actually I did manage to get a refund without too much of a hassle or I think it took you know a couple of hours and then to respond to my email which is actually pretty good so I did give a little bit bonus there for support even though they don't have live chat streaming it did work with Netflix and Hulu however I couldn't get good enough speeds for BBC iPlayer and prime video to get it working to get that full stream compatibility so unfortunately Bolton VPN it couldn't do extremely well there either overall it's just kind of like a little bit of an outdated product a little bit mediocre not very reckon if you guys want to see more better VPN to go ahead and check out q1 VPNs on VPN tearless com anyways guys thanks for sticking around for this review let me know down in the comments down below if you want to see other VPNs reviewed and I'll see you on the next one very soon
