hey what's up it's your boy loud annoying guy who talks about role-playing games today we're gonna talk about level 20 among other things but in a typical youtuber fashion before we get into that we have a sponsor time again to go support and get the book if you want it but anyways let's let's talk about the game that we all play so and all the other videos where I'm calling things dumb or I don't like them or ranting about them I often try to put a little bit of a spin on it and be like well it's okay so long as you do this I'm not doing that with this what I really don't like level 22 simplify and break it down I think level 20 is really great on paper and I think that's why it exists and in play it is really boring long annoying and just generally very confusing and I don't get it so when I first started playing D&D I really enjoyed the idea that you could get to level 20 and that's the whole point behind level 20 is that once you get there it's awesome you get to be super powerful over the course of making all of these videos I realized that a lot of the level 20 abilities are either insanely powerful to the point of being game breaking which I prefer or they don't really make you that much more powerful anyways typically the spellcasters get this because they're getting access to ninth level spells anyways that give them spells like wish which is insane but I've always enjoyed the concept of getting something super epic overpowered whatever I level because who plays a campaign at level 20 and I think getting to level 20 is an incredible achievement obviously not done by many people as according to this Twitter poll I made and I think the biggest reason behind this Twitter poll is due to the fact that a lot of people don't say can a lot of people don't stay consistent with their campaigns a lot of the comments were like well we haven't had a game that went on and we played like four or five then we canceled them like oh well that sucks and that kind of skews a bit of the research because most people don't get to play that many games of D&D which I you know it feels bad but it's realistic a lot of people just don't get to play that much I get to play a lot because I force my friends to and I tell them that it's gonna be on a live stream and then they go go okay and then we play over 50 episodes of thunder and all of Waterdeep dragon heist and then all of cursive Strada and this is the part where I plug arcane arcade even before I did streaming though I did have a game that went to level 22 in fact and we didn't really play at level 20 it was like that and like we beat it 90 level 20 like that's what happened and somebody disappointed because they're like oh I wanted to play my character at level 20 and so with another campaign that was alongside my other one we did end up doing that because the campaign ended and all the players who are and were like still wanted to play and so we can't play these weird like epilogue games that involve like maybe two or three people sometimes more where everybody's level 20 and they would take on insane encounters so these games aren't fun to run I just be honest on that aspect I don't like writing for them I don't like DMing them they are no fun at all but they are hella fun for the players their reason they're so fun for the players is very obvious they are incredibly powerful and they will just destroy anything you throw at them I just remember running it and it's just insane and I was like mint combat isn't very fun for 20th level for a number of reasons first of all the characters have a bajillion abilities there's like even monks and fighters have tons of stuff that they can do even roads the most probably the simplest class at level 20 it still has a ton of [ __ ] they can do oh you're a swashbuckler well you also have panache and your sneak attack is really really high and maybe you have a magic item that can turn you invisible and all of this [ __ ] they have magic items and all these powers so when you play this level 20 game every turn takes forever you would think that the combats would be so quick because there should be the tabla Bobby killed the thing but it's no no no level one combats really fast because it's like I have one option maybe two oh and they just take those options and then they're done what really set me on the train of level 20 sucks is watching the return to the campaign one of critical role games and they're really great all of the role-playing is super fun and that's really why everybody's watching it all of the the continuation of the story and the interaction between the characters that is always going to be super fun the role-playing aspect well mm-hmm yeah well the role-playing aspect typically isn't too skewed by the fact that the characters are super overpowered it can be but not too much and that's a whole point why people like to watch Vox MOC and come back together because they love the characters nobody comes back to watch Fox machina to watch them all just fumble through their level 20 character sheets going I've explained why I don't like level 20 on that aspect now let's let's let's let's go to the next part of this whole I don't know breakdown and complaining complaining that's what all this is okay so this next part I rambled on way too long to explain something that I wanted to talk about but I feel like I didn't do it very well so I'm gonna do it right here so basically I have a discord this discord is run and managed and kind of built up by the moderators of the server it just kind of has my name on it it's really great if you want to go check it out there's a link it down in the description but in this discord there is a roleplay server part of it roll like a bunch of chats where you can play a character and I found it very interesting that most of the characters that are put into this role play area tend to be above level 10 if not above level 15 I think that it's interesting that when people are given the option to play a character outside of a campaign they tend to pick above level ten because they want to be powerful anyways that's all I was trying to explain here now let's let let's bring out the facts the fact does the Dragons is a game that was not built for characters to really play after level ten it can be done but dear God the game changes so much I'm in my livestream game right now we in sunder they're currently level 14 they just hit level 14 and it's fine it's fun I still find a way to bring challenges to the game but wow they can they can change reality can be whatever they want thanos quotes and that's the biggest part about being so high level endeavors the dragons that you kind of just you kind of become like a pseudo dungeon master everything you do can just be up to your whim oh we're gonna go fight the demon Gordon yeah I'm just gonna do this and now he's doesn't exist anymore it's like oh how do you build adventures for this how do you challenge these characters to do anything when they're basically gods so that's why I think level 20 is really great on paper it basically gives you the option to go you can become really really powerful if you work hard enough and it's like okay cool but there should be a disclaimer in the book that says dear God don't play this game above level 18 it's just insane and it's no fun for the dungeon master if you're done mastering you enjoy running 20th level campaigns I commend you I don't know how you do it because I can't figure it out and I don't know how to make it fun I can make it fun for them but it's never fun for me like I did have a fun time being the dungeon master I love being a dungeon master and setting up challenges for the players and creating little stories and having encounters and fighting and doing combat and being stressed out when somebody's gonna die is really really cool I enjoy that the crappy part about level 20 games is none of that really exists because they're kind of in control and the dungeon master isn't because even if the DM says no you can't do that it's like well okay I this other thing that I can do or this other thing that I can do because I have 400 spells so yeah I don't think that level 20 should be a whole thing that everybody should really play a whole lot or really strive to get to in terms of their characters level 20 is just just come up there just to be like well we didn't want to end it on it on 16 this is a weird number to end it on and we've done it for ages dandy is all about tradition and that's why a lot of people like it you know this concept has been done about before characters being so in their characters head that they're so powerful that they can just basically do whatever they want yeah Gary Gygax was like that sucks and I hate it so I'm gonna make an entire dungeon that is dedicated to destroying players like that and characters enter the tomb of horrors the one of the most renowned dungeons ever in down to the Dragons where it's really really hard but not in a fun way it's just meant to punish really powerful characters because all of the puzzles in Touma Horrors are unconventional and meant to trick you the whole point behind juma [ __ ] is that you could run any level of characters through it and no matter what the challenge is relatively going to be the same except for maybe fighting the gargoyle and a Serra rack at the end of it the whole point behind the entirety of that dungeon that Gygax wrote oh so long ago was that it's supposed to challenge the players not the characters and if you fail and you're stupid then you die and the whole difficult thing about running campaigns for level 20 characters is that their characters can do anything and the players get into the mind of I can do anything I'm going to let my character figure out everything I'm going to let them do all the work and I'm just gonna sit here and just be haha I can do whatever I want and Gygax was like that's annoying how about we make a dungeon where you actually have to think and I debilitate your resources and actually you have to go through an adamantine door where you put your swords into it and then it breaks your swords also there's another room with hidden walls and then you have to read a poem that makes no sense and if you walk into that mist you lose all your equipment and if you step into that mist you instantly die and then if you put on this crown and you take a rod and you touch it to the crown did you struck your face it's probably okay how did you do that guys my my fiancee just walked down the hallway and dropped her phone directly into a small bucket of water now it's very impressive actually good job Ian yeah that was uh that was it's so small I would I would obtain some effort so if you want to challenge level twenty characters but in a really mean way do the tomb of horrors I really don't recommend it neither just pull vildan neither does anybody unless you really want to just be mean because it's mean it's not like oh it's so hard it's it's like unenjoyable II not fun and it's meant to go your characters aren't powerful because this dungeon I've been tricking you I'm being mean and I really hate the argument that the tomb of Horrors is like the DM versus the players it's not at all it's it's actually completely solvable it is very easy to complete it's just supposed to trick you because when you're playing it you're thinking what would my character do and you're not supposed to play it like that the way you're supposed to play it is like okay I need to be smart and play this like a board game how do I solve this puzzle in this room okay we need to figure it out I need to use my braid not my character's abilities that is that is why I like a level one monk can complete the tomb of Horrors because it's not that difficult because all you have to do is think and that was the whole point behind Gary Gygax making that tomb because he was sick of players getting lost in their characters abilities and not thinking for themselves when going to this dungeon if you're gonna run into [ __ ] just don't or shorten it or make it easier for your players in any case there's a bunch of other better dungeons suited for that so sorry patrons and my patrons are going through right now because I wanted to play it again and I altered it and maybe I thought it would be funny so I'm big ol hypocrite anyways um just ignore level 20 and I just played the game as your characters but don't play level 5 forever because that can be not very fun but maybe it might not be fun for the dungeon master to hit level 15 because at the end of the day at the end of the day what did we learn today kids do all we learned today the dungeon master likes to have fun to remember that oh the done is master is also a player now I'm gonna go work on how to play cleric coming soon TM and make sure to go support nerd are key go go get your late backs of out-of-the-box encounters really it's really cool book should go check it out it's really awesome and
