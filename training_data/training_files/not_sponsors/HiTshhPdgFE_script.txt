oh that's gonna be an accident yep this guy hates me at this point tesla and self-driving technology go hand in hand it's pretty much impossible to talk about a future of full self-driving cars without mentioning tesla's efforts in the matter now there are differing opinions when it comes to tesla's use of camera vision as opposed to lidar which a lot of other companies use to achieve full self-driving but we can at least recognize that tesla's full self-driving package while it doesn't live up to its name yet does provide a lot of great features that do full self-driving type of things for customers i just recently got the full self-driving package on my model y and i took it across la using their navigate on autopilot feature for a few different long drives and as you can imagine i encountered quite a few bad drivers along the way and got to see how autopilot would handle those so let's get into the footage and see how autopilot really handles against bad la drivers so this is navigate on autopilot i just entered it on the on-ramp and what they talk about is it can take you from freeway on-ramp to off-ramp including all the interchanges and everything let's see how it handles this right here actually was pretty aggressive it's kind of staying right in the lane so that was a pretty solid lane change right there it definitely was helped by the car behind me actually letting me in but this next clip is phantom braking and that is where the car is braking for seemingly no reason back because oh there was some phantom braking i don't know okay now it's kind of hard to tell on video but it went from 75 down to 71 all of a sudden for no reason i mean if we look around right here there was nothing around me there was that car next to me but they were staying perfectly fine in their lane with no intention of getting over those are scary sometimes because it just decides to break not exactly sure why and if that car behind me had been closer i'm kind of afraid of getting rear-ended at times now here's another example of phantom braking you'll see right here it pauses just for a second next to this penske truck and then continues again it might not seem that extreme but if you look i went from 74 down to 67 out of nowhere but if we zoom in on the penske truck we can see it was drifting from its lane so autopilot did stop just for a second because it did seem like it was going to have to take evasive action for that truck but if we circle around me there was no one next to me so i think the better course of action would have been to swerve a little bit into the lane next to me as opposed to slamming on the brakes for a quick second so what's cool about lane changing is it i just signal it and it does it when it can so right there i signaled and it waited a second to make sure that one was pretty accurate but let me give you an example here this kia is pulling up to the left i'm going to just signal it obviously waits until they pass and then it goes for it sometimes it's a little slow for my taste especially when it's a tight interchange but for the most part it's actually pretty assertive and it gets in there pretty well but here's one of these quick turns where it feels like i'm hanging pretty far right and getting awfully close to this crv yeah it's like when you look at it and really pay attention i'm still two feet away but it's a lot closer than i'm used to being now i was just talking about how a lot of times it rides the outside of the lane it gets too close to the car next to it so i was expecting that to happen right here with this semi but actually interestingly enough it did a really good job here and actually was hanging far left of the lane if you look at the visualization on screen you can see that it is actually riding a little bit left right there but it might be feeling very comfortable about that because this lexus next to me is also very far left in their lane now before we go any further i want to point out that this video is made from about two and a half hours of footage that i took so i'm condensing it down to 15 minutes or maybe a little longer and i'm showing you the good cases in the bad cases but it's important to keep in mind that these are all edge cases for the rest of the two hours or so that i was driving with autopilot there was nothing really to show because it was just cruising along and doing exactly what it should do so it's not like if you have the full self-driving package you're constantly encountering it doing really great things and doing really bad things most of the time it's just doing a good job so the next opening i'm going to try to get over there's this lexus right here i'm just going to signal see what it does slowed down to get behind the lexus how's it going to handle this truck oh oh barely made it actually didn't make it i crossed that yellow line for sure so this next clip was one of the worst instances i've had so far where i purposely brought myself into the slow lane to see how it would handle this merge and as you can see right here it kind of doesn't realize it's happening and right there i engage and slam on the brakes now i'm not going to put this fully on autopilot let's watch it again because i purposely brought myself into this lane autopilot wouldn't have automatically done that for me but it should have seen this coming right here a little better than it did now i assume automatic braking would have taken over but i wasn't about to risk that now here's a fun one autopilot didn't really have to do much here but just a prime example of a mercedes just driving terribly in la we see this kind of driving all the time just cutting people off trying to pass all of the traffic and trying to get there so much faster than everyone else here's an example of autopilot wanting to get me into the carpool lane i confirm it and it goes partially into that lane and then changes its mind and then it goes for it for real and if we look back at the other camera angles there was really no reason for that and i'm not really sure why that happened that's another one of those weird things that just happens sometimes i guess you could call it phantom steering real quick if you're enjoying this video make sure to hit that thumbs up so that more people can find it and subscribe to this channel for lots more videos about tesla and tech in general now here are a couple merges in a row that autopilot handles pretty well i mean it's not 100 perfect but you can see there were no cars next to me there and it stays in this lane and now it's going to have to merge again it wants me to lane change but i just wanted to see what the merge would do anyway so i had my hand on the wheel just to make sure but overall it did a good job it was just pretty heavily riding the outside of the lane here if we watch it again from this angle here's an example of another terrible la driver just trying to speed around everyone and the reason i'm putting this in is because autopilot handled this well even though he was coming up quick behind it just stayed there because i mean what else are you gonna do so this was in the middle of some traffic where the lane to the right of me is the lane autopilot wants to get into but the cars are going by very fast so i was curious to see what autopilot did i signaled right here and it actually was pretty aggressive getting in that lane if we check it out from the other side angle you can see those cars were coming up pretty quick and autopilot got right in there it sped up it did a very good job so right here i'm merging onto the freeway and autopilot beeped at me as you just heard and it beeped at me to let me know that my hands need to be on the wheel which it normally does periodically but this time it actually did it in the moment because it seemed like it was probably a little unsure about this move but it did pull it off with no issue and no interference for me other than proving that i'm there right here it might be hard to see but this is one of my biggest pet peeves with autopilot as soon as the merge lines disappear it automatically lanes centers now it's always trying to lane center but it doesn't no matter how wide the lane is so it's going to get me onto the 405 right now 405 north it just slowed my speed quite a bit i guess it's reacting to that car it just seems kind of far now in order to complete this maneuver it needs to get over one lane to the left but you can see this prius is coming up really fast now normally i would probably have waited for them to pass or something but i confirmed the signal anyway and it went for it and then started to slow down for the whole maneuver it seems that this roundabout that it's taking it has a set speed that it wants to take it out and it's just gonna go ahead and do that it also let this other bmw in in front of me in the process but it didn't really seem like that's why it was slowing down but it definitely made that prius behind me pretty angry and rightfully so this is where autopilot definitely felt like a student driver cutting in front of this prius at 60 miles an hour and then pretty immediately dropping down to 41. now in a similar situation right here i wanted to see what autopilot would do it wanted me to get into the carpool lane but i saw how close this truck was behind me and it just kind of went in front of him i would say that's basically cutting off that car and of course he got pretty mad at me and really wanted to show me how mad he was by drifting back into my lane again student driver territory what's most interesting about autopilot for me is that i find myself reaching for the accelerator more than the brake now with self-driving stuff you would expect that you're reaching for the break to you know stop the car because it's missing something but usually i need the car to actually keep driving because it's stopping for nothing that happens far more often than the opposite here's another example of a merge that autopilot ended up handling well but it did beep at me as you can hear right there and it's basically just saying it was a little unsure for a second and it just needs you to be there now here is another example of autopilot being extremely cautious you can see there's a lot of distance between me and the car in front of me and if you look the speed's right about 58 and i'm not really sure why there is so much distance there and my following distance was set fine and that caused all these other cars around me to pass me and get pretty annoyed and then autopilot handles this pretty well this guy cuts me off right here totally and you can see my speed's at 65 he cuts me off autopilot does a great job right there slowing down exactly the amount that's needed and not just slamming on the brakes and while we're at it one more example of autopilot being extremely cautious merging onto the 101 south slowing down again a ton i'm just gonna let this happen make all the cars behind me mad but this is a very cautious student driver-esque lane change now this is an example of that thing where autopilot kind of rides the outside of the lane and it's not very comfortable it was super close to this car next to me and if we look at the close-up it knows it was super close it has all those sensors going it knows it's very far left in the lane and getting close to that car so i always wonder why exactly it's staying there so speaking of cautious lane changing here is us merging onto the 405 south now at this point it actually switches to normal autopilot it's not doing technically navigated on autopilot because it's not going to be changing lanes it's just doing lane keeping for this merge and so far it's good even though it's a little bit more distance than i would like to the car in front of me it's keeping that distance well but you'll notice it just gets further and further as this change goes and look at how slow this is going and then look at how slow the acceleration is back up to the freeway by the time we get on the freeway it's you know it's the right speed but it just makes everyone behind me mad and here i'm trying to set my cruise control speed higher because it had dropped down to 50 but it still was just gonna take this super slow no matter what if you look there's actually a mustang behind me and he had to be pretty furious and just wondering you have a tesla why aren't you accelerating also to note my hand is there just in case but autopilot is 100 steering now this is me finishing out my freeway driving and it automatically signaled to get me over here and this transition was actually pretty smooth as you can see it's slowing down pretty gradually there every once in a while it's kind of not smooth at all it's kind of jumping five miles per hour at a time slowing down but this was very smooth i was curious here if it was going to choose the right lane and it didn't so i just got out of auto steer right there it's not too difficult to do and now i'm just back to normal driving and i handle all the driving for myself so that was navigate on autopilot for the freeway but recently tesla added the feature where it recognizes in response to traffic lights and stop signs now this feature is clearly a beta and when you click to go into it they're very clear that it's going to be very cautious and it's going to improve over time and i definitely saw that in my neighborhood in particular it's pretty bad it recognizes them but responding to them is just not great and i'll show you real quick a couple clips of what that has been like so just for fun let's try and navigate on city streets right now it's not gonna steer for me but it's accelerating and it's stopped at the stop sign and it won't go until i look and confirm that it is clear to do so now this feature is definitely pretty jumpy right now i mean when you set the max like what was that what do you what the stop sign is a good 20 feet in front of us and it has stopped so if i click proceed now it's going to try to go all the way through there and i didn't even get to look so yeah yeah the biggest flaw with this ic is just that it always stops exactly on the line which is great that's what you're supposed to do but it won't inch you basically just stop and then confirm and it proceeds all the way through let's proceed here this one's usually pretty awkward yep oh oh okay going 15 now and a 25. it's a pretty natural stop right there my one complaint is that on this street there's a bunch of cars parked over here and normally i would proceed forward a little bit inch a little bit and then go i would stop at the stop sign inch up and then go this i really can only go but i just select on the drive stock and it takes off for me and i'm turning and it's whoa okay not great should be going 25 so this signal since there's no car in front of me at this point i will have to tap the drive stock or tap the accelerator for to actually proceed through the signal but i'm curious i'm in auto steer and this is crossing an intersection let's see how auto steer does right here so i just confirmed and it's going to proceed and pretty yep there we go told me to take over because it did not know where the lines were and as you can see it's very hard to see where those lines are basically until you're over there and that's the biggest question people have with autopilot is how exactly it's going to learn all that stuff well i hope this video was helpful for you to see how autopilot handles really tricky situations in a good way sometimes and also handles really tricky situations in a bad way sometimes i've become very comfortable with navigate on autopilot after using it for a few hours and i recognize where it's going to do well and where i should probably be ready to take over and all that stuff but you can just see how much it has improved and how much it is going to improve over time sometimes it changes lanes for seemingly no reason and sometimes it's overly cautious but at this point i'd rather it be overly cautious than overly dangerous and i'm really excited to see five years from now how that all improves i'm assuming it's going to be worlds better in the meantime make sure you subscribe to
