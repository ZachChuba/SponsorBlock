[Music] all right welcome to the show we're driving at 2018 27 2017 our F Miata mx-5 an automatic in automatic which I'm very disappointed by yeah I'm kind of saddened that this is an automatic but you know what this is a good episode because I've never seen anyone review and automatic me on it before come to think of it no I haven't really either so if there's that you know we're the first were the special you do get little paddle shifters which is kind of kind of cute my my gripe with that is you only should have paddle shifters on performance cars I mean this is kind of a performance car it is a performance performance car but it's not fast like you don't need paddle shifters in this car like you did like I ate gets paddle shifters because it's quick ish yeah this should have a stick or nothing at all I mean I would definitely prefer having a stick in this but I still think this is fun yeah oh it's a great car despite that we just need to see if it's still great despite its automatic transmission right now we have to talk about arguably the most important part of this car which is their retractable fast and I are in love the fact that this is basically a coupe yeah and a convertible at the same time because when you have the roof up it looks like a hardtop coupe yeah and I always think that convertibles don't look as good as coupes do I could never look quite as classic yeah they don't look as good but hardtop convertibles can and do look as good as their coupe counterparts that's you're going about 30 let's see if it'll let us yeah nope I bet you it has wheels Oh exceeds six miles per hour it's okay you can only retract it if you're going six miles an hour so let's let's let's do that yeah let's try to go six hold on I'm still not going six I'm still not going six now I'm going about sick all right there we go holding it down Wow if I go any faster than this it will stop I wonder if it would stop in the middle or if it I don't know that's an interesting question still going oh yeah no it does stop operation complete it says all right keep it at me okay this should be good are we done okay all right let's wait wait wait oh yeah now it's done it literally had to put the windows up a smidge okay three two one power really windy yeah I can tell you that's probably pretty noisy for you guys yeah this is not a fast straight line yeah that did not feel fast not at all that felt slower than the Tesla Model 3 definitely and that was the model 3 is about a second faster 5.1 seconds yeah on the model 3 this is six point one that technically is adorably faster yeah the model 3 did [Music] it's actually pretty nice with the windows up you don't get a lot of windows in here actually even with the top completely off yeah so you've just gotten it's basically this is basically a t-top car like this is what yeah Johnson was it's an automatic seat ah yeah you could do this a which is cool it keeps you enclosed it's got a little window back there that opens up I want to see what it's like with the window down if we get buffeted very much VI to sue I want to hear what that kind of sounds like more wind bit more wind definitely a lot more minutes we're sorry if the mic job you sing it up but we want to see what this is what this is like it's not not terrible it's about what you'd expect for a convertible in the front yeah obviously there's no back in this car but most convertibles we sit in the back you're gonna get a lot more buffeting yeah but that's pretty vile yeah I think it's actually pretty mild that's nice first off me autos are the most sold sports car of all time in history and the reason why is because they're pretty fun for an affordable price absolutely all us anybody can afford to get one of these at some point in their lives yeah and I don't think I've ever heard a bad thing about a Miata from a person who's driven at me on it yeah they're great they're fun cars and they're great for the price yeah they're it's not gonna win you any drag races but it's a great car for the twisties yeah because it's got a perfect 50/50 weight distribution which is really impressive for an inexpensive car so this is a great one to throw it around corners and you don't feel like it's gonna get away from you yeah no I don't at all the handling on this is very precise the steering is very very precise like you wiggle it the steering wheel just a little bit and you can feel the movement in Maleng cars yeah it's very tight JD if you ever driven a Miata before I've never driven beyond it all right yeah basically this entire show is has JT ever driven this model car during the time the answer is no and another most of the time is I get in the car complaining like this car sucks it's automatic or it's a 4-cylinder or whatever you start liking and I start liking it let's see if the Miata will be that the case I will say the manual mode and this is pretty good like I was I was revving it really high because I knew there was a curve coming up and I didn't want to shift up yo I like that it doesn't shift for you but man put flat here yeah it's definitely a lot of fun on this it's on this type of roads that's cool yeah this this manual mode is this I think the best I've experienced in in a non manual car yeah it's good stuff does sportiness very well it does yeah it feels like a sports car like that is what you're supposed to experience when you're driving this car we weren't going that fast we're gonna maybe like a 45 or get out and that was like foot to the floor you're driving at the limits of what this car can really do but that's I think the whole point because that old adage it's better to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow well yeah horrible grammar by the way but now I'm gonna give it a pass just for this just for this I apologize in advance for every single video JT's always a debbie downer I until he gets behind the wheel this car sucks I've changed my mind I change my mind I can easily imagine wanting this I think this is cool what in the world is that I don't know what that was oh it's lame keep it's a warning oh okay so yeah I go over here let's see yep sure enough fascinating you get a blinking orange line so if you drift it's gonna yell at you like it's some kind of Reaper or some wow that's really cool that we discovered that you're such a bad cuz I never had that experience it never happened when I was driving it you know but I just like to live on the edge literally a lane I really like how this car looks high due to the RF the back looks like a duck which i think is really quite quite charming that's a goofy little car a duck call like a duck tail it really does but I think it's like a shrunk down maybe Jaguar it's like a shrunken down Jaguar yeah you know what I can actually kind of see that it does look a little bit like a shrunken down f-type yeah a little bit it's just like some ways kid version it's like it's not the John Deere tractor it's the little electric you know what I really think it looks like just a smaller version of the Aston Martin Vantage yeah you know what that's what I was going to say but didn't because I didn't want to compare this to a Fanta holy cow this cabin is tiny in here if you're taller than us which means like you're taller than average American male height you're not gonna have the greatest time in this I'm cramped in on five eight yeah we got enough leg room here but it's like it's all straight ahead leg room you don't have much to the sides I don't have much to the side just because I've got to zoom audio recorder I've got a jacket I've got a clipboard down there because yeah has no storage there's there's no glove box on the passenger's side so there's that wanna see what storage you get in this car there you go that little thing is all the interior cabin storage you get there is there are cupholders that being said though my guess is you can fit seven Wendy's jr. cheeseburgers in there that is my estimate of that space yeah it's really cramped and obviously the engine is in the hood so it's nothing there and then there's the trunk however the problem is is since this is the Miata RF I have somewhere for the heart the heart off has to go somewhere so it goes into the trunk which severely limits your trunk space [Music] that class but you got like a nice infotainment actually relating the screen and I like the thing you use to adjust it it's this little knob here it's very very clicky you know when you turn it yeah I do like that I like how that feels I like all the dials and controls things are chunky I have said this with cars before but I think the interior in this feels appropriate for the price I would say so I swear this is what 32 so it varies this model that we're driving is $32,000 base price because this is the RF model yeah however there are different trims of the Miata the the very cheapest most base trim of the current mx-5 miata is $25,000 roughly yeah and that I would say is a reasonable deal yeah that comes with a cloth top and a manual transmission at 25000 and it ranges up to here so like 32 or 33 thousand dollars with options so and then that back the top-of-the-line RF which is the there's the club and then the what a Grand Touring do they call it yeah chichi yeah they have some additional like little luxury touches that that will drive your price up north of 35,000 I believe yeah which at that point I think is excessive for Miata for a Miata but it is over $30,000 and you can and after that price point you start to expect a little bit more from your cars I will say nothing in here feels loose or ratalie which is nice yeah a very plasticky for sure but not not super cheap yeah not insanely cheap again like if this car was like more like $50,000 chance I would think this interior was a joke yeah Heights at the price I like 32,000 gonna pass I think it's acceptable so I guess it kind of depends what you think is important whether you think are convertible and being good at handling and being like a go-kart is more important than straight-line acceleration or looks that's the kind of thing you're debating about here so I mean also at about this price point you can get a Subaru WRX yeah I wish the base is about $27,000 or you could get my personal favor at the Honda Civic type-r yeah which is $35,000 which is almost the same price as this and the Civic type-r comes with a manual transmission only it has 300 horsepower it's probably a little faster at a little master yeah I'd imagined I will say still though this is one of the best handling cars in general at any for any price I've ever driven the handling is so good in this it's so clean and I don't want to bash it too much because of that because it is a fun car absolutely this is fun this happens in a lot of our episodes where it sounds like we're really ragging on a car but and yeah I'm just pointing out the negative things yeah more so there are little nitpicks and yeah because we we based all of our complaints on the same list of things so some cars are really gonna suck in some categories yeah like a luxury car like I don't know whatever slow giant boat of a luxury car it's gonna suck in performance because that's not what it's for but it's gonna kill cars like this in terms of interior quality and stuff like that right so [Music] three-two-one [Music] so we rated first up is performance what are your thoughts oh this one's tough because it's a slow car it's good on one hand and bad on another yeah there's no getting around the fact that this car is not fast yeah it is sluggish but my god is this so much fun around court if you live in the Northeast or in California somewhere with this illegal somewhere with toasty roads or the handian roads or something this car will make you smile if you live in a place where you don't have access to twisty roads this car will bore you I'm gonna give it like a cumulative 6 yeah I think that's appropriate actually I was thinking a 6 as well and then yeah this is where it's really gonna suffer as on practicality yeah which is bad there's no glovebox there's only this tiny little compartment here I think I'm gonna go with the three ouch I'm gonna give this a two and a half Wow literally all it has going for it is the cupholders yeah it's pretty poor this car you can barely get groceries yeah evil Otis you've got a backseat the teen has your grocery haul waste you know what I think I'm actually gonna change 102.5 also wait and I'm pretty sure I gave the Lotus a lower score than a three yeah and this is definitely worse than the Lotus next up is value which i think is where this car shines the best having yeah having just driven it around where it's supposed to be driven yeah I think this is a very high value for the price honestly I'd probably give this an 8 I wouldn't go quite that high I'm gonna give it a 7 because I would like it to be to be a tad faster cool factor low yeah also on this for I would give it a 3 yeah probably well I like the RF the RF is the owner I know I'll do a 4 also actually because the RF part is cool I think yeah but I can't give it higher than a 4 then that there's quality which is good for the price but it's not certainly not any luxury car I don't care anything you know I I think I think a 5s appropriate for me yeah I'm gonna give it a 5 and a half then fun factor is pretty high like I'm having a blast I like I'm barely paying attention that we're recording an episode here yeah I would think it's really high actually I'm tempted to go with probably like I think it's meat is reasonable on my end I'm gonna give it it's I'm gonna give it a seven again okay because I've had more fun driving cars that we were reviewed like overall alright so done the math our average score for this is a 33 out of 60 which is one point less than we rated the Mustang extra we rated yes we were eight at the Ford EcoBoost Mustang at 34 and this is a 33 and I think where this suffered highest was as practicality yeah because we rated the Mustang a little higher on practicality we rated that I give it a 3.5 you gave it a 4 yeah we gave this 2.5 on each so if it wasn't for the practicality this would have had a higher score than the Mustang interest I think it's I think it's totally fair that's fair yeah this car is not a practical car no matter which way you can get nice yeah the most thing is definitely a little more practical than us yeah so I guess that that would be our recommendation if you need something that's a little bit more practical but still fun go for the Mustang if you want something that is strictly a toy certainly a toy a two-seater hardtop convertible this thing is hard to beat yeah this is this is more fun than the Mustang is but less practical than the Mustang is so you do you decide what's more important to you funner practicality as we sign off we're going through the twisties one more time where this car really shines yeah as predicted I changed my mind by the end of the episode who knows what I'll change my mind on next give us recommendations for cars that really really suck and maybe I'll change my mind huh yeah who knows this is your first episode thank you for tuning in make sure to watch next time if I don't crash this car will be back next week and thanks for watching yep see you guys there's one thing I know give it a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
