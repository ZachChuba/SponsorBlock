today I made a drawing using the craziest material ever this is a hundred sheets of 24 karat gold lead websites and they gave me a lot of money in order to buy the gold leaf since this is a material I've never used before we're gonna have to test it first I want to make sure you get this right because I don't want to waste too many sheets of gold because this stuff is very expensive these are the materials I think I'm gonna have to use to apply the gold leaf I've never done this before so we're just gonna have to play along as we go first up the brushes honestly I hate painting so I never have to brush this around I bought some kind of glue I don't really do this kind of DIY stuff Oh oh that smells bad draw a smiley face well my eyes are burning this is starting to look like the kool-aid guy before my eyes burn anymore let's take a sheet of gold leaf and put it on for what am I doing this right let's hope this sticks to the superglue see it worked come on I think that was a big fail okay I'm back again as you can see the setup is a little bit different and I got a new gel this is clear gel tacky glue the reason the last glue was hurting my eyes cuz I got the wrong glue and that was some crazy adhesive kind of glue that's pretty frustrating let's give this glue a try I feel like that was the reason why it wasn't working let's put some gel on the side over here maybe we can get some extra views cuz this counts as ASMR to us smiley face let's test it out right now I have a good feeling about this this smiley face got more clout than I'll ever have you starting to come off please work please work whoa wait damn this looks hella sick yo dude I'm shook I didn't think this would actually work no it's time to move on to the drawing shoot there's gold going everywhere so I sketched out my idea it's kind of like an Egyptian supervillain I put a big moon in the background he's holding a step and he's standing on some sort of Sphinx [Music] [Music] [Applause] too many cups in my mind I can't sleep at night so I just keep writing I don't need no help I don't need opinion so don't wait for time then I just been living online my city don't show me no lumpiness fun-looking radio stations I got my plaything all of these rappers combined I'm going I'm going again I bingo and then I'm fed up with so many things they gotta just let it all out I'm talking about the stiff and talking about let me do this telling me I should do that then let me telling me things about rap talking the truth in that step in my packet when I fell track don't know too many things have been building been hard to deal with I just been drinking remember my moves in the past I'm wondering what was I thinking lately I'm living in fear wondering what if the end is so near coming on the shootings a strong was shot to the head and I'm gone I'm losing control but I can't let it go cuz I'm trying to get more and not being in the moment I've been in the zone and I'm moving along I pick up the phone my family color been doing it wrong and I don't know what's happening trying to get what I just been imagining getting close and I just been examining all the faces that game is repackaging [Music] no this Wayne I'm gone I come from a town where muscular people are so closed-minded they come in the school and they work in a job but they don't even like it I will be put in the box nobody telling me what I should rock nobody telling me what I should drop cause I do what I want and just robe I know start recording tomorrow in the morning they snow reading a poem I stole in there every story I'm ready producing that makes it I master run building my crafting I'm not looking back if income when there were things I want to do when I want to everybody when they get a rain but they not do everybody wanna cover you but they're not you everybody wanna be cool but then I knew whoa look ever go don't be you're Dennis and still got the flow never gonna lose cause I'm still doing bone never gonna lose cuz I've been on the road come these day and I'm killing the show know that I'm young and I still gotta grow know that I'm working there must know I'm never gonna talk and I'm looking back down on the people below laughing knowing what I feel these are the finished inks I started out giving his skin a bluish grayish tone using Copic markers next I added some purple to his costume as well as some blue later we're gonna go in with more gold here is my finished drawing with the background with the moon and all the colors except for the gold alright so I have my drawing over here oh no not the gold right so for my drawing each of the yellow spots indicates where the gold should go so it's just slowly start to apply them on let's lay some gold leaf on all right go in I'm ruining so much gold leaf like this okay we need to take off the excess gold leaf because this can be used for later he's work okay some parts worked if you like I need to redo some parts a bit and this is simple messy this is why I'm a comic artist and not an arts and crafts guy oh wait the gold just went flying no school leave the silk wimzie yeah okay I'm gonna try some bigger areas first maybe that will be easier okay gold leaf on I'm just gonna dab that on really lightweight the top one came out pretty well so annoying oof I can't believe I'm wasting all this 24 karat gold this gold likes me too much doesn't want to like flee this part work just actually turned out better than I thought let's do this part [Music] and being very careful not to breathe at all otherwise this goal just goes flying time to lay gold on a big portion right here think that stuck properly this time that looks pretty cool hoping this parts dry now we feel so we're just having 24

that it takes so long to scratch the gold off of the blue parts bruh that was pretty worth it [Music] these paintbrushes have super super-thin handles I'm really not used to it the one thing I'm grateful about is that this isn't turning out worse than how I originally drew it and notice I treat my paintbrushes with respect they're covered in gold right now a lot of art youtubers they mistreat their art supplies you know art supplies have feelings too next time you see an artist use an art supply go to jazz I go to super rages I'll go to drying with waffles I don't care who you go to tell them Art Supply lives matter this is not okay everyone's just pretending like it doesn't matter this is 2019 this is the year where art supplies get the respect they deserve this is the artist art movement we're doing our part to make sure all the lives of art supplies are respected damn okay I think that's about it but it dumped all this in the trash to make sure looks nice most all art supplies can't stand up for themselves so we need to do our part oh yeah yeah look at that they're random pieces of gold there [Music] now I got to lay this gold leaf out on the table a bit so I can
