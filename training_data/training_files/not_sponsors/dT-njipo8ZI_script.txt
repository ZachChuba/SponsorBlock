the path to having giant brains as a writer and a dungeon master writing up unique puzzles and traps can be a real struggle but finding a riddle your players don't already know is a next to impossible feat so I took the time to try and understand the structure of spoken riddles then make some sort of template I can come back to again and again and this video is what I came up with riddles vary from culture to culture and even the definition of a riddle itself is debated by different scholars I'm not one of those I'm actually pretty dumb but the way that I would describe a riddle is a question posed to describe an object or concept stated in an enigmatic fashion to puzzle the listener the main focus of a riddle is of course the enigmatic property the angle of the question that only creates more questions this is done by using words with double meanings diverting expectations or employing cryptic adjectives that aren't normally used to describe your riddles answer my favorite way of doing this is to start with a subject matter that everyone is familiar with ideally it should be a common or abstract noun because the more familiar people are with your subject the more versatile your riddle is a few examples are the Sun the ocean a hole death shadows and I don't know a dragon this is your answer then make a list of words that are taboo things that would make the riddle way too obvious for something like the Sun you should avoid words like shine radiance glow light stuff like that one golden rule I've found that makes writing good riddles easy is to personify objects and ideas or to objectif our animals or people often with this tool a riddle can subvert speculation by implying something takes a different action than it's able to but describing the rest of it accurately my body is vast and I travel far my life ends when my sorrows turn to tears this riddle subject is a cloud but clouds can't really be sad I don't think see how I immediately spoiled the riddle there maybe it was a little confusing at first but now that you know the answer it's a useless phrase like a locked door that you now always have the key to right in your memory the best riddles are what we call bulletproof almost impossible to figure out when you don't have the answer but with the answer it's a less than useless phrase this is also a trait of painfully abstract riddles which are of course the most difficult in a way the more abstract the description and the shorter the riddle the more hidden the answer is take for example the Sphinx's riddle what is it that walks on four legs in the morning two legs at noon and three in the evening the fact that a single day is a metaphor for an entire life and the third leg isn't a dick but it's a walking stick is extremely frustrating and confusing now look at two iterations of the same riddle both made difficult by either size or abstraction white field black seeds in front of him he led oxen white fields he plowed a white plow he held a black seed he sowed the answer I wouldn't have figured out was writing there are more unique ways to write riddles than the one I'm presenting my favorite being the killer's paradox riddle your life shall end by my hand but I allow you a choice speak the truth to me and I shall grind your bones speak a lie to me and I will remove your head the answer you need is to create a paradox and most people would just say the self contained this statement is false but my favorite answer is to relate to the prompt itself and say you will remove my head now that we have the cornerstone of our theory I'm gonna make a bunch of example riddles and just break them down for you people to know me is to be alive to touch me as a journey that leads to death to see me is to know pain I hold many secrets and beneath me is life I am forever changing but too many appear the same as I did in the beginning to learn my deepest secrets you must search in darkness I am known to all whose eyes open and close many earn my embrace others cling to my arms the passing of days will bring you to me and to deny me is to forsake yourself she blossoms from the smallest intention and brings life to those who draw near her but to nurture her is to invoke rage unrivaled pride of Kings age measured in wealth powerful as the Sun terrifying as a blackened sky hidden where the world is hollow resting on a mountain tribute it it's the Sun I started with the Sun then I personified it and then I came up with random facts about it and made them sound weird this one is the ocean and it should be a little easier because of its length I could have added something about the veil it wears relating to the surface of the ocean but that would have been too much detail and the riddle would be even easier if your riddle is too long it'll be hard for the reader to consider other answers because of how much you described I wrote this one awhile ago and during peer review I deleted the answer and I think it's death which is a really common answer which brings me to a different point you should try to avoid topics that would be people's first thought like nothing death time or darkness she is fire but I described it as a plant or a young animal this one works well because every part of it is a metaphor and only requires a few statements to lock down what the only answer could be it's long enough to be relatively simple but abstract in a poetic way also it's a dragon I mentioned birds earlier but they're hard to hide in the riddle because of how poetically they're already described I have to steer clear from words like freedom float soar feather song you know all that fun stuff that I want to use so picking a direction is tough because once you have a trait of the subject in mind it's easy to build on it I've decided to describe them as a tool to make their nature like a function here we go let me know if you can figure out what this is my center stores the stones of life which scatter in my wake I mark the Rising Sun with a hundred voices and I speak to all the earth as I tend to her vines this is the point where I realized I don't know how to end the video because I failed English and hated doing conclusions for essays the cool thing about making videos is that you don't have to pretend that you're smart if you aren't because it's whatever you want it to be I can literally end the video in the middle of a site you
