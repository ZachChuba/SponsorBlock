of your 18 years or older and also to gamble responsibly what is going on YouTube so we're coming at you with another well face bill not Russ gameplay this time and today I am doing the base that you all asked for a long time ago it is my unrated base I mean we've we've we've done it and I think the longest period is like maybe like four or five days something like that and yeah it just looks like a real [ __ ] to rate it might not even be worth it and I don't know it's just really good for our solo or duo so yeah this is so when it's underrated a base a design all for you guys I've come up with a couple of new ones but another time huh all right well let's start with the bill it's very easy so let start up with these two squares triangle triangle just struggle over here you can pick it doesn't really matter down so put it too high Dumbledore frame down below that is a must and a single on top then jump up place that there excellent now this looks like honeycomb but it's not so we're gonna have that there like so and we're going to put explai here and we're going to put a staircase there like that and this staircase but being a bum skis for this part so I'm gonna put a half ball there and then put our high walls right now the reason we're doing that is we're doing that stability trick here so two triangles there like so and then you could just delete these walls and put whole walls and then you're left with these two triangle thing of the Bob's here right shut the roof on top excellent now we're all here a double door frame here a double door frame there now the first things first that you're gonna want to do you probably want to start you can do this from a starter base if you're if you if you if you do it well but there's been this new thing implemented where you can't play some garage doors if something's through before if there was something like that for example you can place the garage door still but now you cannot so you want the garage door first we're gonna put it facing that way then we're gonna put these two so we want a tear see and a tear to place the TC there like that tier two [Music] like that see we wouldn't be able to place a garage door on this if we place the tier 2 first all right shelves Chuck a shelf in here like this so grab some boxes that we're gonna have small boxes so we've got a small box today I'm gonna have three large boxes there now slide some boxes right on there we go now small boxes it's a little tricky to get this one that you can this is first here also this service right here this will be your way out it'll be the drop down right there so you want one of those pretty quickly otherwise you'll be stuck in here and that's how we normally have it maybe a little less furnaces sometimes bright get rid of these two you know small box box there now these are these are just guides obviously you can place there's a lot of details nice okay now what you want shotgun traps I like to have three first night now this makes this Bay is pretty unreadable by doors but it looks like it would be an easy read but yours once they get in there they kind of get screwed up a little we gonna have three shotgun traps bags so I do iso of sub two bags uh now that that's done checking it out it's pretty little storage down that's pretty good okay side now for the top level [Music] [Music] nice now we're gonna hold that the reason we have it at hopple here so we got a couple doll there yeah I like that a guard so let's chuck outdoors on and you could even check the shotgun trap if you wanted you can see it you know the unsuspecting pork it might run in at some point all right so the upkeep at the moment on the only honeycomb part pretty cheap 2400 stone 340 metal frags what we're gonna do now is we're going to Honeycomb real quick so we'll start with the top you want a honeycomb you drop down square here just like that [Music] this needs to go wait yeah that is pretty much it now let's let's see what it's like and it's upgraded forms what we'll do is we'll get a fully sheet metal this is our fully sheet metal database and this is the cost three thousand one hundred and fifteen metal frags really cheap so let me tell you what you want upgrade to high quality with definitely all all these ceilings yeah to upgrade some of these ceilings you might have to remove a box but that's all right now that is operated so look at the TC the cost twelve high wall not bad next part of the hike boiling period is yes you'll have that box like well if this is close enough to the ground you don't necessarily need it hike while but because of that's TC on it I do with all the main parts hike Walt twenty-eight high-quality 2900 metal frags perfect solo duo base especially with oil rig now you get high quality easily now let's see what it's like in its final form with all of this alright another thing I forgot to mention is you definitely want that bike walled as well not too bad so far drop down pretty important as well actually I'd say I'd say it's probably more important than these walls so when you when you're upgrading do the drop down before and all right let's have a look see what the upkeep is so many one the higher quality really easy once you get a foothold me myself and pokey we've had no issues now for this part I'm here this is where the tier 3 goes like that and small boxes under you can actually fit two under here done and another thing you know we we sometimes would have repaired beds up here is so saleable but we have all be pays if we really need to skin anything we normally just wipe the repair bench down and we'll kind of just deck this hallway out with boxes oh you also have to close the garage door down below because even place another box say you go another four boxes there you can put our furnace there or small box it's up to you pretty easy to get through so yeah this is a base design we've used a lot actually and yeah we've never been rated in it looks kind of small like an easy door raid but you know you go through one two three three none of those garage door then you get to this door and it's just cats and reading drop-down faces it is hard so most of the time now especially now this is gone public people have ever just got to blows straight in with rockets but who knows you might end up like us and not get rated in it it's a simple cheap base design really easy to do it has my seal of approval it is tried and true served as well ah also guys the announcement as promised I'm moving out so there won't be many uploads over the next you know I'd say week while we wait for the Internet to come in but this is from the 25th that I'm saying this so who knows like we might be back up and running before even the before you even notice I'm gone but I daresay will probably miss a few days but yeah it's a big move I'm moving across the state are moving in with our Pookie yeah just a really cool thing also guys I just like to point out that in its sheet metal of stage it is a 16 rocket raid not really readable by doors and when it's fully finished this base is a 23 rocket raid so yeah it's pretty expensive for this little old thing and that's not including the garage doors but with the garage doors want to add an extra six Rockets onto either upgraded version of that hey guys hope you guys enjoy the base design hope you get tons of loot fill it up live long and prosper [Music] in this motion flies through [Music]
