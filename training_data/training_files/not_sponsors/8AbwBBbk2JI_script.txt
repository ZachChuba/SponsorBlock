this video was sponsored by curiositystream in partnership with my streaming service nebula on the 18th of june 2020 mozilla announced a vpn service aptly called mozilla vpn the announcement was understandably met with a collective shrug by the tech press the internet was already drowning in vpn services so why would anyone really care and yet while i think it might not have raised many eyebrows at first this 4.99 a month subscription service was not some minor news it was the clearest most tangible sign yet of a troubled company desperately trying to reinvent itself so in the 70th episode of the story behind series let's see where the new mozilla is headed and why they are so troubled in the first place [Music] mozilla got started in 1998 by members of netscape in a time when the future of the internet looked rather bleak microsoft was on a war path to monopolize the internet with proprietary technologies that could only be opened in its own internet explorer and mozilla emerged as a clear opponent to it aiming to break that dominance and ensure that the web would remain open and free early on mozilla set its principles in writing known as the mozilla manifesto firmly committing themselves to values like privacy interoperability free and open source software and a balance between commercial profit and public benefit and in the following years the company got to work building the tools needed for an open internet a web browser an email client an online knowledge base for web development bug trackers they built them all together with an army of volunteers and they made them all free open source and placed them firmly under the watchful eyes of a non-profit parent and mozilla arguably succeeded the microsoft takeover failed and the open web for the most part prevailed but with the evil dragon now slain new more nimble companies set their hungry eyes on the internet and mozilla with their rigid model wasn't able to fight them back see one thing the mozilla manifesto never really gave an answer to was how exactly a balance between commercial profit and public benefit could be achieved on the long term like who's supposed to pay for all the software and services that mozilla builds it's hard to make any money from open source software to begin with and especially hard when you write a manifesto that you'll give it away for free and won't even track your users or show them advertising and even more so when your competitors do not have to hold themselves to such high standards despite having developed everything from the firefox web browser and the thunderbird email client to an entire mobile operating system identity management software a location service a password manager a tool for monitoring hacked passwords an ultra popular programming language and many of the foundations of the internet as we know it mozilla has only ever really managed to make money in one meaningful way by letting companies like google and yahoo pay for being the default search engine in the firefox browser every year since their first proper revenues in 2005 this single item has consistently made 80 to sometimes even 99 of all revenues of all of mozilla meaning that everything else they did was losing their money mozilla has really cornered themselves into this insanely skewed business model with their original very noble commitments i'm sure that back then selling the rights to become the default search engine provider in their web browser to some scrappy startup seemed like the least evil way to make a lot of money from their users but over time this relationship has really become toxic as google launched chrome and moved from being a scrappy startup to becoming a larger and larger privacy nightmare and also an anti-competitive monopolist which i've made a dedicated video about that you can watch here mozilla found itself in bed with their own worst competitor whose values go against everything mozilla stands for and there is no easy alternative for mozilla they tried switching to another search provider in 2012 when they signed a five-year contract to use yahoo instead of google in the us but before that contract even ran out they had to concede defeat and switch back to google in large part because as it turns out the average consumer doesn't know how to switch default search engines and prefers google search so much that they're actually willing to change browsers for it and google knows fully well that mozilla can't switch which is why they only pay them around 400 to 500 million dollars a year compared to the 12 billion dollars google paid to apple for premium placement in safari in 2019 and the lack of bargaining power becomes abundantly clear apple can just afford to negotiate while mozilla can't in fact i'm fairly sure google's main reason for paying mozilla at all is just to have a competitor to point their fingers at in court when they're questioned about antitrust so given all of that given that firefox is unlikely to gain massive market share all of a sudden or find new wealthy sponsors to replace google with all of a sudden or given that people are unlikely to donate huge amounts of money all of a sudden i mean donations only make up a couple of percent of the actual revenues of mozilla given all of that something needs to change otherwise mozilla will just slowly fade into irrelevance and after many years of struggle i think mozilla has finally found two key ways to generate revenue first what i'll call paid services and second what i'd call enterprise software the service business is relatively straightforward and the mozilla vpn shows us the ideal playbook as almost any youtuber with a sponsorship will tell you vpns basically round all of your internet traffic through the vpn company's servers who then promises to encrypt everything promises to not spy on you promises to not keep any logs on you etc what sponsored youtubers aren't supposed to tell you of course is that you the average consumer really have no way of verifying whether they actually keep any of their promises so if you choose a vpn service it better be from a company that as mozilla says has a name you can trust and yeah you know what if i were to route all of my sensitive internet traffic through some companies web servers mozilla and whoever they partner with would probably be a better choice than yet another vc-backed startup with little to no track record add to that that vpns are also wildly profitable hence why they can afford to sponsor seemingly all of youtube and yeah that looks like a promising business and there's more where that came from in a blog post from last year mozilla has confirmed that they are quote starting to invest in services that stand apart from the browser and bring mozilla's core philosophical commitments to privacy security and user control to new audiences and what are those services well so far we've seen three major attempts firefox send monitor and lockwise a file transfer service a service that monitors if your accounts got hacked and a password manager and while these have all been well moderately successful with sand being shut down and the other two not having made any money yet they have all the same core characteristics as a vpn they are online services that don't have to be directly tied to your browser they compete with paid services like we transfer and lastpass so in theory they could be monetized and trust is crucially important for all three of them you really wouldn't want to store your passwords or send your most sensitive files using just any company but mozilla probably not a bad choice and it's easy to see where they could go from here lockwise could get a paid tier with premium features like all other commercial password managers and mozilla could start offering new services as well like a google drive or dropbox competitor with end-to-end encryption an email service to take on protonmail or frankly any other internet service where security and trust are important i think even their new logo designs were made with flexibility in mind so they can just add more services as they go now besides services the second revenue source mozilla has found for itself is enterprise software in other words charging companies that use various mozilla software for fancy extended support and i'm going out on a bit of a limp here but i think i found two pretty strong signs for this first thunderbird their email client has for the longest time just hung around kind of aimlessly and they almost got rid of it at some point but then all of a sudden earlier this year mozilla founded a new for-profit company called mzla technologies corporation whose stated purpose was to own and operate thunderbird and guess what in their announcement post they said their goal was to quote explore offering products and services that were not previously possible and to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable donations if i'm any good at actually parsing corporate speech i think that means they're gonna make a paid version of thunderbird which why not and the other example i found is actually one that i talked about in my old video from six months ago with regards to kaios if you haven't seen it yet you can check it out here but kaios is a wildly successful commercial operating system built on top of the open source remains of firefox os and this year mozilla has entered into an agreement to officially start supporting it and promised to ensure that the so-called esr or extended support release versions of its browsers would be compatible with kaios and while neither party would explicitly confirm or deny when i asked if money was actually changing hands for the support but i think it's pretty safe to assume that yeah kaios is probably paying for the support why wouldn't they and i really like this new direction i love the mozilla of the past for making free software that's available to everyone without crappy tracking i donate to them every year and i hope they don't stop doing that but even more than that i'd love it if the mozilla of the future could stop relying on handouts from google and could instead build a portfolio of services themselves that respected the open web my privacy and were actually worth paying for i really believe that a healthy internet shouldn't just be controlled by a handful of monopolists like google who can track every move you make and decide what content and ads you're supposed to watch which is part of why i've teamed up with some of the world's best educational creators to build our very own video streaming platform called nebula imperial japanese aircraft carriers for example access to nebula comes for free so check them out at the link in the description and i'll see you next week
