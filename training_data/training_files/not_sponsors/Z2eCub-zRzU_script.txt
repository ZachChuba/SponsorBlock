hey hey you Marcos house with you here and today we're talking about the latest version of SpaceX of starship and there have been a number of interesting discussions going on since Elon Musk's presentation now in this topic we are going to talk about whether it still makes sense to return starship vessels to earth after landing on Mars or to simply leave them on the surface for other purposes now although in the past this seemed to be a fairly clear-cut answer currently it doesn't seem quite so obvious a choice in fact it may actually turn out to be at least in the short term quite detrimental to return them this topic is one that warrants probably quite a lot of discussion so I'd like to hear your opinions in the comments below perhaps this may even deserve a follow-up video to break this down and expand on in the future so to keep up to the next exciting 12 months of SpaceX development anyway so since 2016 we've seen a number of presentations starting off with the massive interplanetary transport system or IITs which was designed to be 12 meters or 39 feet in diameter since then of course the vessel was scaled down being named the bfr or the big Falcon rocket then renamed again more recently to the starship and super-heavy this is the current prototype at 9 meters in diameter and based on the massive size of this thing you can probably imagine just how much larger the IITs design would have been if everything had remained at that scale so starship now I know I know it's not a ship that's going to travel it's a different stars you've all made this perfectly clear in the comment thread every week I didn't name it that's just what it's called so let's just continue on a quick comparison of the design just to get started the IITs was designed to be monumental the proposal incorporated nine engines crammed into the ship come opponent itself compared to the six in the current stainless steel starship design the fuel tanks and both stages of the IITs launcher vehicle were proposed to be constructed of lightweight yet strong carbon fiber and even the propellant tanks would be made from this material this at the time was a major change of course from the aluminum material is used with SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles and it was going to cost an arm and a leg to construct one of these ships and get it off to Mars now think back to Elon Musk's recent statement about the material cost for carbon fiber versus the new 301 stainless steel it's one hundred thirty thousand dollars a ton for the carbon fiber and twenty-five hundred dollars a ton for the steel so the steel is about two percent of the costs of the carbon fiber so this is a good thing we changed from corn fiber steel by far so one hundred thirty thousand dollars per ton compared to the stainless steel at only two thousand five hundred dollars per ton over fifty times cheaper than the material that is now to be used to construct the vast majority of the starship body not only that it's quite a lot smaller than the IITs now what about the Raptor engine itself Elon said the other week that SpaceX hopes to be churning out an engine every day by early 2020 so it takes six days less than a week to create the engines for one starship one week this is pretty incredible stuff now the point I'm trying to make here is that compared to the original proposal with the IITs the new vehicle is going to be many many times more cost-effective to create especially when they're churning these vessels out rapidly back when we watch this IITs simulation landing on Mars and after calculating the manufacturing cost it just seemed crazy to not return it to earth and reuse it repeatedly it would have worked out monstrously expensive as a single-use Mars transfer vehicle but perhaps this has now changed with the starship so this is an interesting debate to jump into right there's been a constant plan by SpaceX and Elon Musk since 2016 suggesting that the IITs or the starships must return to Earth to make the colonize of Mars viable but given the new design and a switch from carbon fiber to the much cheaper stainless steel will it really be necessary to fly back this vessel considering the differences that we now see in its design compared to the IITs Elin dropped another interesting potential plan in the recent presentation tool and a few ships on Mars before sending people presumably this would mean there would be cargo ships with hundreds of tons of a useful cargo already sitting there before humans even launch from the earth now let's take this idea even further a starship one emptied of its cargo is largely a strong airtight pressurized structure it's around 50 metres high 9 metres in diameter with basic tools and welding equipment this ship could be easily converted into a permanent building structure radiation exposure on Mars is high compared to earth and imagine I guess if storage and equipment was placed towards the top of the structure and on the sides as well water containers food storage even vertical farms could be created to help reduce the radiation getting through to the humans using it as a habitat there is a lot of space in one of these vessels but let's say there was 10 of them maybe even 20 of them then there would be enough equipment and supplies for setting up a successful permanent base on Mars a base that would not need settlers to return for many years after this trips back to earth using fuel processed from manned industries on Mars would make the viability of returning much more realistic now what do you think here what is the value of a starship full of material as well as the main body of the vessel on Mars itself it costs a huge amount to get it there and to me it seems like it can be useful for any number of applications as suggested in the presentation the 301 steel itself is great material for general uses as easy to world and manipulate as needed you could even see an old version of the starship being decommissioned and repurposed into completely different structures on Mars well before the settlement has industry that's able to create materials without deliveries from Earth now compared to those original carbon fiber materials designed in the interplanetary transport system this is a game-changer now let's look at the alternative here we send starship vessels back to earth after refueling with liquid oxygen and liquid methane there is a probability like with any new technology that the ship may not even make it back to earth at all perhaps it explodes on Mars perhaps it fails to re-enter and land correctly on earth it's essentially a bit of a risky choice to actually relaunch the thing from Mars now to ship the necessary cargo from Earth to Mars to make a similar-sized airtight building than what the starship structure would be would take a huge amount of planning all of the structure needed for new habitats needs to be contained within starship unpacked assembled made airtight that all sounds like a huge amount of cargo instead of shipping materials for these structures the cargo space could instead be filled with energy generation equipment solar panels mining equipment boring machines food water Rovers and of course all the creature comforts needed to keep settlers happy healthy and as stress-free as possible if the starships do not need to be refueled then there is no need to spend enormous amounts of energy generating that fuel from the Mars atmosphere it could instead be spent on more useful things like mining and new manufacturing industries not to mention of course life-support and all of those other things another interesting point to consider here is that the starships are going to evolve rapidly over the coming decades a full Mars return mission for a single starship takes years pulling a very rough numbers from a few sources let's say it would take a few years to refuel a vessel on Mars and a heck of a lot of spent energy the transfer window for earth needs to be after more to launch back so we need to wait for that we then have to wait for the trip to earth itself so wait let's add all this up it's around four to six months to travel to Mars a few years refueling on Mars and then awaiting a transfer window for a turn another four to six months on the way back so yeah by the time the ship gets back it's now several years old and frankly probably already out of date compared to any of the new ships which SpaceX really reuse these ships at that point or they just recycle them anyway here is another interesting point as well after a reasonably large settlement is thriving on the surface of Mars it is surely going to be useful to explore much more of the red planet the atmosphere is really too thin to fly aircraft too rough in a short term to drive around it but using the same technology SpaceX are planning to utilize with earth to earth transportation imagine that same technology on Mars because the gravity is much lower in the atmosphere very thin a starship could have the capability to launch and land on other areas of the planet much much easier than an interplanetary launch from Earth perhaps free starship vessels on Mars could instead be used to hop around new areas helping to create new colonies perhaps even further down the track satellites will be manufactured on the surface of Mars and launched into orbit on a reusable starship who knows what possibilities can exist with all of this technology remaining on the surface of Mars now keep in mind here I'm really only talking short term over the next few decades after these ships stopped evolving so rapidly crew transport vessels traveling back and forward I'm sure will be common but over the next few decades I'm not so sure will the new starships be more useful on Mars itself or should the plan be to return them to earth after several years of refueling should that still be the goal
