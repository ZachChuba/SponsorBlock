i'm greg and this is my favorite cocktail on the citadel have drink in hand shoot after episode oh i'm greg and these are my favorite drinks on the citadel today i'm making some drinks for mass effect now i never actually got into mass effect i'd already played the hell out of it was called star control but it is by all accounts a phenomenal game and i bet you have at least somewhere between a passing familiarity and a rabid devotion to the franchise so i'm not gonna waste time explaining mass effect to you okay instead let's get right into the drinks but which drinks because mass effect has quite a few for me to adapt and since i don't think i can do them all i'm certainly about to disappoint some of you i'm quite sure what is the most interesting to me is the dlc called the citadel which was a follow-on i'm told that was designed to alleviate some of the bad tastes in the fanbase's mouth after the conclusion of mass effect 3. i'm just going by what i was told as i mentioned star control there's a scene just before the game's final hurrah where specialist samantha trainer reveals that she used to work as a bartender and makes herself available to shake up drinks for the crew trust me edie i worked at a bar to pay for university but what about rincole i hear you all screaming into the void and into my comments well i'm going to tell you about wren call ring call is just like another in a long line of kind of poorly conceived sci-fi and fantasy drinks that tell you nothing about them except that they are unpleasant and impossibly supernaturally strong and really there's only so much i can do with that kind of info first off there is a physical limit to how strong a drink can be if it's active ingredient is ethanol maybe in ring call it something else but how do i simulate that i would make the drink boozier but then there's a practical upper limit on how strong a drink can be before it's simply neat spirits so it's really strong is kind of useless to me secondly as far as my research tells me there's no real information in the game about krogan cuisine the flavor profiles that come up in there cooking the stuff that they eat or drink outside of consuming a ring call and mass effect 2 when they show you the liquid it's the same color as every other liquid the bartender pours it is green and clear so i got nothing you're just not going to get ring call out of me it's not going to happen instead let's make a full biotic kick now this drink was requested by cayden alenko himself abiotic that's telekinesis kg ever hear of a full biotic kick now according to specialist trainer bourbon a dry twist of orange and ginger beer to film tuchanka is the name of the original krogan home world which they made inhospitable through the use of nuclear weapons uh there's also new tuchanka which is a colony on uh aladdin ellidin i think you'd pronounce that eladen eladen maybe there's two a's on there i don't know how to pronounce that and my research um was text based so am i gonna get i am i'm probably getting more about pronouncing tuchanka and aladdin and krogan wrong that i will any french word or italian word ever anyway the krogans made their original homeworld tuchanka inhospitable through the use of nuclear weapons uh there is also this new tuchanka colony on elaine but i've got no references here as to what kind of alcohol production is happening in either place but there was something i guess about the descriptions of old tuchanka with like thick jungles growing from salty seas orbiting a star called the eye of wrath that made me think of some kind of herbal amaro and i have it on good authority actually my own testing and iteration on this recipe that amaro diagnostora is the closest thing to dry tachanka you can find on earth so that's what i'm going to use personally i think a full biotic kick is a perfect drink to build in the glass i would just treat it like a mule but if you want to shake your ingredients i'm not going to stop you i can't you're at home and i'm over here so i'm going to start with the glass i'll be drinking it out of and in this case i'm going to use this spherical glass that i bought for doing drinks from valhalla the cyberpunk bartending simulator and i never ever get to use otherwise it is perfectly science fictional and appropriate for this drink please we're gonna make a full biotic kick and i'm gonna start with the glass i'm gonna drink it out of in this case this sphere because it feels really science fictiony i don't think that in the game that they drink it out of a sphere but why shouldn't they i will approximately fill this glass with cracked ice gonna be tricky to do that we're gonna give our best shot like i'm a pro or something right hey guys get in there no complaints to that i want to add one ounce of amaro the angastura amara that's really good stuff by the way i love amaro diane gestura it's cool and uh probably available on curiata by the way if you wanted to pick that up it's at drink.com check it out in the link below everything i use in this episode should be available up there or at least an analog to it certainly if you're following along at home they've got the stuff that i use in the how to drink collection now i want to use two ounces of bourbon and i'm going to use this yellow stone select because there's i like it it's good bourbon i should use a funnel with this kind of glass maybe it's a little tricky i i did not count on how like awkward this would be to pour into could i stir it sure i could stir it a little i don't think it's going to be necessary though because we're about to top it up with some cold ginger beer use the ginger beer you like if you want to make your own you can we've done that on the show today i don't really use it much that's actually not even the ginger beer i used to test this recipe but it should not matter i'm going to use huge ginger beer let's see how it is it's perfect it's very dry very gingery it'll be great hot and spicy not very sweet at all very low sugar i mean honestly you might want something a little more sugar than that anyway i'm gonna top it up with about four ounces of this spicy ginger beer and since this glass is a sphere i'm not gonna try to eyeball it too much boom and now we need to pull a peel from an orange and i think it'll be fun to do a really long one almost treat this like a horse's neck i'm gonna give that a little twist here i guess you could twist the whole thing what the heck it's a little bit over its top and see if it looks neat and science fictiony kind of floating around the inside of my glass i hope it does yeah that kind of works if your glass has a lid you want to screw that down at this point and then put the plastic straw in there there it is the full biotic kick my favorite drink on the cinnamon ah let's see how it came out yeah i like this a lot i do think that actually this might be a place where you would want maybe a slightly sweeter ginger beer when i was working this out i was using a different ginger beer on my recipe and i think there was a little bit more sugar in it i'm going to do something silly i'm going to taste it like this and i'm going to put in like a couple bar spoons and see if how it improves it this is basically a bourbon mule right like it's a kentucky mule but with a weird twist in it which is coming from the angostura amaro diangosaur there's a lot of the angustora notes in there but with this kind of elongated flavor profile it's a little less pungent but still present and with also these herbal notes kind of like a benedictine it gives this drink a very unique character without overpowering or being overpowered by the ginger beer or the bourbon everybody is present and it tastes to me familiar and yet very different like something i've never like not quite ever had and good enjoyable so i feel like this is exactly what i wanted to do with this drink i do think that the cue now that i'm actually using that why did we switch why because i had two cans left of this other ginger beer uh jamaica something or other and i needed more and what they have the grocery store was the queue the jamaica stuff was definitely had a little bit higher sugar quotient and i think that maybe i'm gonna put a link i have to find out what brand it was but i do think that like um a couple brands would be fine i'll put them in the links below i actually think this one is not the one to use i think we want to put a little bit more sweetness in here just a little well maybe a lot and just stir that up when i was working on this recipe a little earlier ago with a little sweeter ginger beer the amaro was much rounder and present in a very pleasant way and i think it just needs that drop of sweetness to kind of kind of live in harmony in this drink much better it helps it a lot and you still get plenty of i mean honestly i think it's spicier i think that the ginger spice now has a longer and more pronounced evolution it comes in later which leaves a lot of room for the amaro and bourbon to kind of round out the flavor oh man it's really now sorry i didn't think i was having more to say about this drink but i do now there's really this wonderful thing that's happening here where the orange and maybe this i've stirred it a little bit more the orange is really getting in there that orange oil is getting into that amaro and they are linking up in a really delicious way and that's kind of where this drink is leading from and then it goes into the bourbon which man what is the bourbon in here honestly i've had now i've got so much ginger beer burn i'm having a little bit of a hard time pulling the bourbon apart now but i think that in this in this mix you're getting quite a bit of bubble gum and vanilla actually um off of that bourbon and then of course we move right into ginger beer spicy burning delicious sexy is ginger beer sexy spicy burning delicious sexy ginger beer yeah why not sexy ginger beer very enjoyable really fun drink leaves you with a nice ginger burn we're going to move on to the next drink but i might want to leave myself the option to put a commercial here so maybe there's a commercial here let's move things right along to the tasty tankard grunt who is a krogan which is basically a lizard klingon asks trainer about this drink which he refers to as a human drink so we know it's it's one of ours it's not a krogan drink i read about something called a tasty tankard uh it's not one i've heard of but trainer describes it irish cream coconut rum iced chocolate and butterscotch schnapps so this is uh very much so a dessert drink and also might i add an incredibly sophisticated flavor profile i mean you have to have a very refined palette to enjoy that combination of irish cream coconut rum butternut scotch and iced chocolate now my first instinct when i hear that list of ingredients is to make this drink very small like a two or three ounce little night cap kind of thing like a puss cafe but it's also called a tasty tankard and a tanker is a pretty big mug kind of thing i brought two options here i mean they're huge really this is a tanker that's 20 ounces the other one's more of a mug so while that creamy sweet list of chocolaty ingredients calls to mind these kinds of small serving pre-prohibition dessert cocktails i think if i reconsider the proportions of my instincts and think of this really as a big mug of iced chocolate that's been flavored and nudged along by a few modifier liqueurs something about the size of a tanker could be achieved of course to start with i need to make some iced chocolate knowing that this drink will get plenty of sweetness from its other ingredients i'm actually going to try to keep the iced chocolate on the cacao heavy bitter chocolate side of the spectrum so i got some 90 cacao dark chocolate bars combined them with milk in a saucepan at a ratio of five to one so i did 500 grams of milk and 100 grams of chocolate i slowly heated it and kept stirring with a whisk until the chocolate was all melted i will say that when it's colder month and i'm making hot chocolate i think i go way heavier on the chocolate i used to live in new york and there's a couple of these jacques torres chocolatia places and on a cold day people line up and get their hot chocolate and i made the mistake of like saving mine for later once and it turned into chocolate mousse that stuff is literally it stays liquid because it is hot if it cools it solidifies into mousse and you eat it with a spoon and it is still delicious i might say the five to one stuff though makes a very very chocolatey unsweetened chocolate milk that will not turn solid on you at least mine has them it might sediment a little bit but you can just shake it right up okay and by the way somebody might ask did you consider going with the chili like a spicy kind of mexican chocolate thing i did i actually tried it both ways i tried it with some like smoked chipotle powder in the mix i felt like with the butterscotch and like the other flavors that were present it was kind of in competition it wasn't really it wasn't working out the way i wanted it to i just don't think this is a place to do the spicy chocolate thing i think it's a mistake the rest of the drink is is pretty simple in my shaker but since i'm gonna go with this 20 ounce tankard i'm going to need two shakers and two shakers i'm going to put six ounces of chocolate iced chocolate in each one six ounces so we're going very heavy on the chocolate stuff right six ounces in each of these and frankly i think if you were making this for a krogan 20 ounces does sound about right those guys are very large heads they have huge heads now i need an ounce and a half of the butterscotch snops and for me really only the very best butterscotch schnapps um i think that you'll find decoypr uh butterscotch schnapps butter shots it's called in fact available at the wino shop near you also on curiata hopefully ounce and a half of this which is a heavy pour but remember we're competing with six ounces of iced chocolate so and actually 12 ounces of rice chocolate but then i guess it's three ounces of butterscotch canops and that smells very sweet now i need three quarters of an ounce of malibu as i said only the very finest in this extremely refined drink this human drink from mass effect the drink of the humans my people are there better coconut rums probably but there's not another coconut rum that tastes quite like suntan lotion the way that this one does and now we need a three quarters of an ounce of bailey's irish cream and i actually like bailey's i you know there are up market irish creams out there that you can get they're cool they're good bailey's is kind of the thing i want here i don't think you want to go with the fancier irish creams but it wouldn't be bad it's just they carry a lot more character and we kind of want dumb simple flavors that's them those are the ingredients yep there's some ingredients in those shakers and those are the ingredients now we need to add some ice i need to add ice to both of these it could happen today could happen today we might see something very seldom seen on how to drink we're gonna do it it's gonna happen double shaking [Applause] let's strain these into our tasty tankard whoa look at that creamy there is our tasty tankard kind of an alcoholic milkshake i think you've got a few options for garnishes you could just grate some chocolate or nutmeg right over the top i think that or a quick shake of some heavy cream like it was a um an irish coffee kind of thing it's the kind of drink that just kind of calls for that sort of thing i happen to have some whipped cream here from another episode i was shooting and i think it's gonna look really nice that way so let's put some whipped cream on this okay oh yeah look at that personally i think a little bit of cinnamon although it's not called for in the recipe i think a little bit of cinnamon would be really nice i'm gonna try something silly that i've never tried to do on the show if there's cinnamon coming out of a dredger on this show i want it on fire oh yeah there we go and there we have the tasty tank you gotta put fire in the thumbnail this is for all the other drink makers on youtube put fire in your thumbnail if you can do it do it if you if you have that option go for it don't do it where it doesn't call for it but if you can get it in there do it there it is my tasty tankard looks like something that they would serve at universal studios i don't know a little over the top here but i mean it's a tanker it's gonna be tasty here we go it's so good i had to reel oh and the cinnamon i think i just did a line of cinnamon actually off the top of it accidentally but it's actually really good one moment please wow that's awesome so the combination of the cinnamon and like the slightly burnt cinnamon actually is really good this drink tastes like a butterscotch chocolate milkshake with this cinnamon kick that comes in surprisingly late considering it's up there on top of the whipped cream i wouldn't even use the word decadent to describe this because it goes way beyond decadent this is melted ice cream this is absolutely a milkshake this is a dessert and i guess this is the kind of thing humans drink are known for drinking over there in the mass effect universe okay i wouldn't know as i mentioned star control chocolate cream butterscotch here's the thing do i taste the malibu not specifically but i did actually try this out the malibu and it did taste different it was less full less round it was missing something in its base i can't quite explain it that was kind of holding up the chocolate so i can't say that you should skip the malibu i mean certainly i guess you could but it's not doing nothing in there and the baileys yes definitely it's in there and i stand by my ratio because i think if you put any more baileys in this than i did it takes over it becomes really loud um to the point where you can't really taste the other things that are happening the most interesting part of the strength to me and i use interesting in a way that like a 12 year old is interesting in ice cream and twizzlers and me i love ice cream and twizzlers but the most interesting part of this drink is that bitter chocolate iced milk with the butterscotch schnapps and the cinnamon all together that is fun and delicious and presented like this no that it's it i mean we're making very low brown milkshake kind of thing but that is a flavor profile that i think you would find at like a tableside dinner service at like a very fancy restaurant someplace where they're making like bananas like it's it's almost like a bananas foster something like it tastes decadent in a sophisticated way almost almost i mean not quite but there is something in that certainly you don't need to make a 20 ounce tankard of the stuff you could do a six you know a recipe based on one shaker or even half of that would be fine if you don't want to go into a diabetic coma i do like this better this is a better drink than this but this isn't this is fun it's a lot of fun thank you so much for liking subscribing and following all that stuff and uh oh oh oh look at all these other these other episodes of the show because i've been making this show for like six years look at them look at them showing up other video game drinks so maybe you wanted to stick around and fall into a little how to drink hole and watch like 12 or so hours of how to drink right now maybe that's what you want to do no pressure no pressure but you know do it
