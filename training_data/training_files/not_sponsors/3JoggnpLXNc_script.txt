oh we are super Mouse world go mousy friend oh that is super cold how's the way to victory all right this is peeking through 3d what does that mean is this another one of those like warped perception 3d things that says all setups from join in so a shout out to that person I guess this is going to be very illusion II or something grandpa what okay that is clearly clipping through the wall it's probably not supposed to do that oh you can like whoo okay oh oh because the little the little tip of the flamp is like stopping me from going here but it's not stopping me from going here that's weird what is this gonna do I love this is this like somebody figured out that swamps can clip through [ __ ] slopes and then they just made an entire level around it okay so someone weren't paying attention you can certainly you can simply use that to change something that might be oh come with me and discover the elusive mating ritual of this right before your eyes you will seen him the power is part of the mating ritual Oh No we have stumbled in what happens next wait I actually win toad wants to get in on the action oh look at this it's like we are now we are now in two places at once we are now in two places at once schr√∂dinger's toad the wind swamps the swamp mating ritual wait I'm like I'm like jumping oh I'm getting actually crazy fast speeds off of that oh man okay give me more give me more give me more oh wow this isn't still work this is a store is this some fat holy crap holy crap that is some power right there that is some that's amazing oh my god oh Jesus I just I just like I literally just okay I literally just made a cp1 setup of the gods I just made a cp1 setup of the gods I [ __ ] like held off and jumped and it just auto put me in this door and went into it oh my god the troll potential is very nice oh oh again little getting a little feisty with this one Oh what do you want me to do okay okay I don't know if I should have done something else or done this level is amazing as well as hilarious Oh oh oh oh I don't think I should have been here oh my god it kills me oh no it was David get me out of here and we've seen enough well what's gonna happen what's gonna happen so we're gonna have in whoa this there's like a bunch of compress springs in there are they vibrating it like one frame is set oh my gosh so you can shove an entire one in there whoa what happens if I throw the shell on it Oh what wait a minute wait a minute you could use this in shell levels to jump off of Lola oh my god hold on what hold on oh my god wow that is so weird this is so oh this is so [ __ ] up what's it gonna do right now oh Jesus huh-huh so it makes me move over here too oh my god that's so weird yeah okay oh what's gonna happen what's it gonna do what's he gonna do what is he gonna go over there oh wait what does it do what does it do doesn't the shin the thing go down there I was expecting the tornado to go down there what's it do oh I missed it ha let me go back wait yeah the twister went flying out from that holy crap so you can use it to launch other stuff too oh do I want to go in there yeah yeah I want to go in there Oh time to stop again time has stopped [Music] I can't move I actually can't move while I'm in it I'm put like these are the jump buttons this is the job buttons right now it doesn't do a damn thing oh the scratch button makes it stop though okay anyway that's my ground pound into that [ __ ] pound away to victory wait there oh my god this is amazing I come yeah call this the jackhammer and he is [ __ ] stars look at all those stars coming out of toads ass right now this has to have a youth this is amazing this has to have a years - oh god I got stuck for a second okay Oh what is it mommy oh oh oh oh man we are like I'm actually kind of worried I might go flying off the edge I shouldn't I didn't really think this through Oh Oh what in the world is about to happen I'm scared I'm scared is it gonna do something Oh what Bob what the key got through Oh [ __ ] thousands of goombahs just plowing into totes crotch at the speed of light oh my god that toad man Oh God oh I went too deep there's a bunch of weird stuff they can do with swamps and I was like this for example the TD styles is a setup where tall Mario standing I won't take but Tom I'll crouch or small Mario will take damage weird oh yeah here wait where do I go oh that was amazing setup it fires out the bullet goes super fast Oh interesting alright guys check that out and go find stupid ways to use this glitch because this glitch looks hilarious yeah jump to the one way and let go powerup let's screen scroll powerup lets power-ups lets screen scroll to avoid clip jump to the one way and let go spike tough flight what is this no sir link I'm not that good what is going on jump to the one way and let go what Oh way to victory what the [ __ ] is happening what's happening oh my god what is happening oh my god what is happening what's happening Oh [Music] look he looks like he's trying to get a hold but he can and he's just falling to his death Carl come on KS alright um well what the [ __ ] was that does this will not work - did they figure this one - do they fix this one zoom defender do they fix this one - by which is [ __ ] rocket ships away to victory by [ __ ] rocket ship a way to victory I think I'm supposed to get in this I don't know oh my god No Mas look so stupid oh god I almost died wait it works current fashion it still works this one still works hey programming hey what the flying [ __ ] your comment is somehow somehow relevant ok what's the setup here there's a blue spike top with a cannon on top of it and there's another spike top that is walking across that Canyon they hit a music block go Boop it in the air and then what happens this looks similar to the swamp thing that makes the swamp fly way to victory potentially the Buzzy's walk on each other is that what it is they're just like vibrating a way to victory both spike top climb on top of each other yeah they start walking off of each other that's amazing one more time I want to see it one more time yeah look at that they're just walking on each other oh my god that's amazing it's so funny all right that is awesome ladies and gentlemen that is how you make a baby Spike Tom so I was playing with my girlfriend her and we actually came across these two levels that were just super super cute I really want to show them you guys they're so awesome both of the ideas are so good all right guys this is get alive now in 3d we played another one of these that was only in 2d I guess and it was freaking adorable this is this is trolls gone cute this trolls gone cured look at this look how dangerous this wait you can actually die wait a minute you could actually die oh my god I was getting ready to talk about you like Kent with this a 50 percent clear rate I must have like okay apparently I thought there was an entire roll of things we literally just lowered the clear head we literally just lowered the clear head I actually thought you couldn't die on this level okay well that one thing aside you have a victory condition of collecting one 1up mushroom and they're always one of my teams now that we cannot get there's one up there that we can't get this [ __ ] in the way we can't get it we can't have anything we'll never be happy again oh look now you can get those what a schmuck what a schmuck oh look we're just gonna go through this pipe and collect that wonderful little one up and then be on our you bother oh my god I just I love the setup in this it's so silly it's like wait denied oh my god so what have you clip through the wall to get that it's okay guys we're gonna get it here we're gonna get it here Oh Shirley I'm gonna get this OH oh my god what's even up here actually oh of course of course nothing but betrayal level oh no [Music] [Laughter] this is like that chase your dreams level yeah this is this is a metaphor for life everybody this is a metaphor for life everything everything seems so close but yet so far this is actually amazing I did not know that that that the that the [ __ ] those guys actually called the MATLAB can actually like hit those blocks [Music] yes this is another metaphor no matter how hard you try I can never get a life low MATLAB yeah what's the real name the only I remember is that boom boom that's it yeah thank you oh this is great - look at this hip box like you can get you can get deep in there you can get deep in this guy and you still cannot get that what if I roll into it I'm so close oh but I laughs cannot get anyone else but I'm curious what's up here nothing only only broken promises shattered dreams would you go in the hall please thank you I just forgot Eddie Fred my brain is dumb okay more disappointment shattered hopes and dreams we have fireworks low everybody loves fireworks and hold on a minute props the Carl's girlfriend though I love Carl but I would never date him wow those toxic as [ __ ] all the rip oh we're gonna get it ready oh goodness wait we actually get it why are we actually gonna actually get it that time no all right find that I didn't want to go that way level so cute blonde so cute I love this level I would date you Karl oh yeah thanks oh my god mmm see it is just like real life you may think that you're never going to get it but if you never give up you really will all right this is ride the peace which by lappy what do we got [Music] what did that tell me to do ride the peace which how how doth one ride the peace which what wait what what what [Music] holy [ __ ] whoa bye later see you later holy [ __ ] how did that work okay we need to learn how this contraction works uh what what [ __ ] pee away to victory holy crab okay we have a spring hitting a muncher what's that what is going on here so something spawns then we go to the door right you know let's do everything like slow-mo this [ __ ] [Music] okay I see that the swamp hits the swamp hits the seesaw and there's pals that destroy the swamp and the other side of the seesaw I think that was the the p-switch that went happened but at what point did we [ __ ] fly a million miles an hour I'm gonna go in and out of the door I think let's see if we can watch this close if we go in and out of the door there's a can in there there's a Canada two feet what happened why does this happen the piece which is pushing up the cannon Oh what so they're like on top of each other like boosting each other or something you can see the setup in the thumbnail right here now hold on a second for this to work do you literally just need a piece which underneath the cannon come one one one one moment here one one one minute here it's patched oh it's this guy he made the shell train level he's made a bunch of other levels and this one was recommended to me uh yeah anyway let's take this out night skydiving by Japanese dude he makes really cool levels reach the goal after grabbing at least 100 coins alright so we have to get a lot of coins we got low grab we got giant giant low grab what a combo collect all the coins let's go oh [Music] oh that is awesome it lets you see what's happening gotta go to what oh that is super cool wait am I getting any funds uh oh this is so cool [ __ ] bounce up oh oh I tried to bounce novice but it failed miserably well we are probably bond oh boy yeah we're probably bone I need actually I need ten more oh we're still good oh that's okay benevolent level creator haha that is a six setup you could hope you're a big boy you can just like you can get hella coins of your big boner no 100% I'm gonna go right okay hitting oh you know what I think holding a direction actually made me go slower there oh wait big Mario oh this is interesting I think there's two tiers of bonuses at the end huh because not big Mario so I can get to the top but I can't get to the bottom that's really cool actually there's like two different tiers of dude replayability what is this replayability what is this actual good use for down look downwards auto scroll this is very true 100% though I don't actually understand how to use those Springs correctly because I hit the spring that time I didn't let me go fast enough okay this one's like reasonably difficult to not get hit on just because the like low grab fat dummy thick Mario toad is really hard to it's really hard to get his ass moving hold on do it don't do dog [Music] now we gotta get our game face on all [Applause] right how do we not [ __ ] this up I'm gonna like hold right and hope it works it works that was it and then I have to go okay I get how to do it now I have to hold right because I actually triggered the spring hella early compared to what I thought he was doing okay wheeze hold right here I just want to get those coins oh yeah oh I still have to not suck though oh oh I still have to not suck okay don't suck everything simultaneously no I suck what's the play there I think I go I think I have to I'm trying to go in and out and in and out of them and I think it go two of them out and then two of them back I think we're gonna like yeah do that that's the way I want to do it I want to go to outweigh what's the end we're good right yeah yeah yeah if I hit that last one it's good in there the truest of true endings it's like a troll and you can't actually break this in a two-block I bang all right get your dummies big booty in there let's go truest of endings this guy this guy make some super creative stuff always really loving alright y'all this is a super cool level that I saw just cook recommend watch a mouse play supermario don't press anything let's do this is a fun little warmup so this is this is a don't do anything level with a really really interesting twist we are super mouse world go mousie friend Gomez yes mouse away to victory this is so cute so it's like you're playing as the mouse okay it's even got its got peril it has it has plot twists this is this is [ __ ] everything Netflix series one [Music] now I've seen also some levels oh my God he's got kaizo moves he's got quite wait [Music] how did toad where'd a toad come I missed the end where did toad actually come from at the end right there hold on I didn't actually see yeah this is super cute I didn't actually see where toad was at the end let me see that again I might be totally freaking blind oh I get it I get it he just falls down on it okay so toad is just up on the screen and falls down on it all right I want to see this sick spring jump again though how does the how does that thing even do how does the skips week even jump off then it's kind of interesting sweet super sweet oh I know I can really want to show you guys this level this level is so cool so yeah it's playing this with my girlfriend and I just saw the very first part of this and I stopped watching it because it was so cool just love when people come up with these creative ideas blue yoshi castle blue eye look that is a giant yoshi mouth and we are going to go into z giant yoshi mouth you guys ready for this are you guys ready for this this is this is the tongue action that you have always wanted on this dream are you guys ready yeah all blue yeah she get revenge giant blue Yoshi this is like this is like a Koopa nightmare right now this is [ __ ] right out of a Koopa nightmare giant Yoshi statue just alright it's not awesome okay so that's the only one that I've seen I don't know what to do for any of this other stuff but I'm assuming we pull away to victory can I hurt him with this oh I can I see I want to like blow it up high up and it hits him Oh noise are two big bombs is all it takes together guy that's awesome No what is going on right here can I kill him in that oh I don't even know what just average it was pretty cool okay boo boo yeah light blue yoshi best yoshi just saying light blue yoshi best yoshi oh that was three uh what was it building at Yoshi build me a Yoshi build me a Yoshi yes yes we're are we riding we are righto we're riding the Yoshi will feel like it's got a cute tail on it it's got a cute tail we are riding a [ __ ] Yoshi mobile right now hell yeah uh-oh shoulda stood there hopefully we're good later oh my god that mole is out for blood stay back singing my friend my friend no I was cute that was super cute hold on I need him need to [ __ ] murder some old skull Tuesday boss perhaps oh yeah we got the boss how do we do this Oh what what what are we doing Yosh what are we doing yoga oh it's not like a little moving tongue or something oh oh we just we get Bowser into that into that sweet sweet Yoshi tongue this is so cute this is the best story level Oh do we get do we get our Yoshi friend but whoa still going oh there there's Yoshi friend again no that was cute okay an unbalanced situation by 1/3 plus 1/3 PI just killed the Piranha plant five head all right guys just kill the product land um just kill the piranhas I did not do anything right whatever happened it was not can I touch that can I just like you get in there please friends Nicky just scooch over just a tad for me they'd be great you could do that appreciate it please all right fine fine okay what if we do one Oh like if I turn around the booze do that thing okay okay wait so okay I can't I can't look left because if I look left oopsies I didn't mean to do that if I look left then the ghost on the right side will start flying towards me and he'll smash that bomb which will drop a muncher onto the p-switch and that will cause the munchers to fall over the axe made so I can't win something to do with you this oh oh that's amazing so oK you've you if yo she gets hit while you're spitting a fireball he like waits a second to spit the fireball so he turns around first that's really cool I guess it makes sense it's just a little delay on the fireball yeah we're puzzling good let's go could Jenny be used to extend human lifespan eventually been but the problem is is that there's too many there's too many things that need to be fixed right now like when you when you get older they're problems all over your body and correcting all of them you know would be a crazy task it's a lot easier right now for things for either like if you edit an embryo when it's only a few cells then or like you know when it's just a single cell then you only have to make one edit but if you're a person with the trillion cells you have to edit a trillion different things if you if the problem is all over the place and there are different problems all over the place when it comes to aging so definitely that's a much more complicated problem that won't be tackled anytime soon though there probably be incremental advances like if there's any specific thing that you know is going wrong like something's becoming cancerous or something like that you might be able to just fix that anyway guys space pig is a fantastic level creator and most of his levels are really super freaking hard Kai's owes this one has a 1% clear rate though so I got a recommendation that this is really good I took a peek inside and like the first 10 seconds and I really really liked what I saw so let's check it out the space pigs stunning new level I have a strange feeling that we're gonna love this level alright so we got we got we got this dude and as you see when he smashes the ground actually I'm you can't see me but I'm sitting here stunned and I'm able to do anything so we're on a timer here and when that shell goes back and forth its eventually gonna hit that on an off switch and so we have to sort of proceed through this level before that happens but I am actually completely stunlock so once he hits you this setup that space pig is created makes it so that the Bowser jr. hours it just Bowser Bowser jr. if I if he ever if I'm ever on the ground when whoops when he slams down I get stun locked indefinitely and you lose so I cannot get stunned even once or I lose due to this setup it's a pretty oh alright oh wait actually oh I actually got out of that I actually didn't think that you could get out maybe you just can't get stun too many times I couldn't I thought I couldn't get out the first time but it was it was very I could like do a very precise jump to get out so we kind of have to like keep jumping here and I need to I need to get the spring go up here no and we have to do it faster all right exciting human lifespan shouldn't be a priority right now we should fix all the other issues yeah I agree pretty much like there's already enough problems with people who are alive but those should obviously be fixed first so well by looking into Aging and all that I'm sure we'll learn a lot of useful things though yeah I'm basically stun locks when that happens and just I think I'm dead yeah definitely like quality of life is more important I think than quantity of life like being alive forever could basically be a nightmare No maybe I'm okay but probably not oh [Music] I'm actually okay well I did that really fast all right I did that really fast I thought I was bummed give me bad checkpoint okay what do we got now oh so one of them is hit I have to I have to not be on the ground when either one of them hits but only one of them actually switches the on and off status so I have to do jump jump to next on and off jump jump to next on and on or jump to next on and off jump shove to next on and off jump jump fix on and off oh I don't even know what I jumped on right there okay that was the idea being alive to experience space colonization would be pretty cool oh I forgot on jump oh I'm almost survived based on my own stupidity there we go wait this is awesome this is awesome that was so cool that was amazing dude I there gonna be three of them are there gonna be three of them in the next one that sounds terrible this sounds terrible sounds oh god what are we doing dodging fireballs oh my god what pattern even is this what is this they're just going crazy up there no yeah Mirian you bring up a good point that if people did live longer than well actually nah I don't know actually I was gonna say maybe but make people think about the future more but then it's like we don't even think about our own futures like that we're going to live to experience anyway so never mind okay what are we doing there's a switch and that it's all we have to wait for the peace marriage to wear off if I get hit once I die because there's not enough time for the thing to come off before the donut sinks alright well this looks like garbage take everything back I said about space I'm trying to watch them [Music] oh god let's go let's go how the [ __ ] did that work how the [ __ ] did that work me sorry oh god I thought that there was gonna be four I thought it was gonna be another one with four oh my god okay that was amazing this is the stunning level we sadly have not evolve as instant gratification I know it's really sad like I mean it makes sense evolutionarily why we value instant gratification so much though because just being alive for now is so much better than hopefully being alive at some you know it undefined place in the future but now our lives are so you know consistent like most people can live a long time it makes much more sense to think about the future but it is hard for the brains to do there's that quote that's like progress occurs one death at a time people get set in their ways and if people live for too long then we would just have people set on their ways forever so at least in that at least in that sense is a good thing that people don't live too long I mean most of the people who are opposed to most social progress that you know at this point like at this point everybody agrees has been a good thing the old people at the time were generally more likely to resist those things so since I am late to work let's do a No Mas how do you switch the on and off lock and leave this world ah what okay so we need to oh yeah so when this block is activated it shouldn't let us come into the overworld again see it makes it so you can't come out when there even if only half the pipe is covered you can't go through it so is this some weird [ __ ] where like I just I didn't actually do it but if I go like really fast it'll somehow work and then change on top of use game is 10 hours back I was actually pretty long it's too long for me to do in a single strand okay what's this gonna do oh I need to do the other way though hold on oh that one's gonna respawn and hit it so I just I panicked what it actually hits it it like hits it in the other world dude this is like the other that pipe isn't just that pipe isn't just like a totally separate universe it affects this universe to the stuff is still going on in there all of those Yoshi's that we dumped into the pits they're still there they're still in those bits they're still there dude that is weird that doesn't make any sense how that happens yeah spooky action at a distance but I have so many more to make it loves to get through guys all right look the impossible coin riddle bye juju I want to do this this is let's get our puzzle on y'all let's puzzle good I know I miss the juju juju Jude okay we used to go after grabbing all one coin I see there's a coin under I don't know if that's a coin does that look like a coin to you that might be a coin I don't know that's the corner we have a POW and we have an obvious power target the coin just fell and Bree bond the coin just fell and we're boned how do we not get bombed well what happens if I just stand under oh I can't oh I was gonna just go down there but I can't go down there there's no like vine there is the muncher on a half-block I think that I think that this muncher is on a half-block which means that it was stacked on top of something how that's gonna affect things I have no idea how do alright I got the coin there we go no I didn't mean AG said there's got to be like some weirdness going on here sticking like what if what if I can collect the coin like up here but that doesn't make sense just like expecting to just get the coin somehow as if that makes any goddamn sense whatsoever you can't like do the tiny little jump right because maybe I could like tiny little jump into it what you can do the hold on you can do the tiny jump you can do the tiny jump can i define any jump into this [ __ ] what if this is dead is this gonna do it this might do it that is how you do it so this is it's misdirection that is complete you don't even need the POW you don't even need the muncher what was that [ __ ] I'm just like all that muncher is on a half block there must be something stacked right there oh I was a massive red herring yeah grabbing without hands hot by bone of ear just don't use your hands okay no hands I have to I have to use hands though to like play the level bruh c'mon bruh grabbing with no hands [Music] what is this okay I can like I get it forces me to duck but then I can like come out of it [Music] wait a minute this doesn't make any sense what what does it do though does it is it gonna do I have to Mike what if I hold doc oh it stays like this it stays like this now I'm gonna assume that that wouldn't have done that if I hadn't done this [ __ ] first so let's just like let's see what would have happened if we didn't do the weird duck [ __ ] oh I can't get the POW in there I get it look I can't like duck and pig it out like I'm I'm Brian you can't bring it up you can't do it but for some reason this lets me doc and I can stay docked and now I can even have an animation for it it's so weird I just I guess it's just a duck hammock yeah it's actually an idea it's identical to the duck animation huh that is weird so one way is really mess with your they like force you into a duck state and that overrun that like it forces you to do that even if you're carrying something when you normally can't suck strange very strange so I was just sent a level code that apparently this level has like a bunch of glitches in it so I I have to just immediately play the level so it doesn't get deleted but I just did some level code it's the funniest level code ever what the hell is this level code dry baby dry baby Joe alright well that's that's a [ __ ] level code right there if I've ever seen let's check it out this so this is by Shawn jank not to be confused with Shawn hip uno mas impossible another impossible level ignore the first pipe broken hand okay so I guess it's gonna not actually be possible to beat this let's see let's see what sort of black magic [ __ ] has gone into this [Music] okay wait I think it told me to like go in the door or not or just say don't go in the pipe oh this is the hint okay okay okay wait wait wait wait wait okay door [Music] Oh what wait that looked like the setup where you push up to go in the door right when the mushroom hits even Oh do something weird I don't know what's going on start going down here can I don't want to put this on yet let's first go through the door and see Oh what is this setup oh that setup make sure that I wasn't holding the shell so I should have put it on maybe I mean if it's impossible it doesn't matter right what the heck okay so it's like oh I would throw the oh I could throw the shell up here interesting if I had the shell I could throw it up here but it didn't let me hold the shell because of the Koopas were in the way right it's that fire flower up there okay hold on let me read the actual hint again the actual thing that you named all right ignore the first pipe broken hand oh is the hint a joke or is it just broke I don't know if he's saying that it's broken or if it's like a Lobel the lungs impossible so what's a hint gonna give you in the first play is it well I want to see what's in it anyway can't tell me what to do what do we get oh this was a holdup setup but it always doesn't actually do anything okay I think I'm gonna have to use the holdup trick then though based on what this is doing no this is how you come out here what probably shouldn't - this is like the hint thing but I think it's not gonna work something-something question mark okay yeah that just takes me back to the okay that just exacted a so let's try this again I think this wants me to do this trick I just tried to do it right now let's see if I did it I don't know if it's gonna I'm holding up and I'm not going in the door that doesn't make any sense what shouldn't it have Auto gun in the door because I was holding up okay so what happens if I do something like this oh oh I'm tried to throw this shellman up right there oh it's gonna get stuck up there yeah that's not gonna work because there was this there's a this thing right here it will get stuck on this so it seems like it's impossible to bring that which I guess makes sense if you're trying to design a level that's impossible what's in this pipe okay I just forgot there was a pipe here I didn't do it uh-uh no I don't know what to do I guess I could put the helmet on but it's not gonna help me here because then I would get here and I would have a held on and I would be bummed because I have to hit this fricking switch in order to go through there but I can't because I can't hold the shell oh whoa okay so I talked to the level creator and the level creator says that there was a glitch before the patch that lets you beat this but they globally patched the trick so the level is still uploaded but it's action wait no the lows not how did he just upload yeah okay so apparently what happened is the level creator have the clear check already done and then a patch happened and they changed the game physics but since the clear check was already done they could still uploaded so yeah good system intended and now we have impossible levels yeah yeah yeah zip ali st 100 bit says I call I'm taking biotech in school and one of the topics we cover in English is invite for biotech is the ethics of what is PGD and gene editing in humans what is your opinion concerning this so the long and people that's because a lot the lawyering short of it is genetic engineering has tremendous power to cure all sorts of terrible genetic diseases that we've not really had a solution to also for cancer too so right now there's three ongoing clinical trials so this is like when scientists to have the technology advanced sufficiently enough to start trying it in humans that's when they do clinical trials and there's three different phases of those but the first phase is just figuring out if it's safe and so what they're doing right now is they're trying to use CRISPR - they're using it for a genetic eye condition so basically the people gonna go blind and they can use CRISPR to sort of modify some of the cells that are the epigenetic mutation that is causing people to go blind the other one is to like it's so a lot some people have a blood disorder called sickle-cell where their blood cells are misshapen and it's like horribly painful and it causes all sorts of horrible problems so they sort of take out some of the stem cells that make those blood cells modify them genetically to fix the problem and then put them back in and then there's a third one and I don't know if I remember it it might be a cancer one though but yeah so I'm all for that sort of stuff you know as long as people
