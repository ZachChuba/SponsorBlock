this video is brought to you by Squarespace it is to lose the people you love but you still have a family Sokka and I were your family now Katara and I aren't gonna let anything happen to you promise [Music] ending a cartoon can be hard after creating so many memorable episodes with characters everyone loves it must be difficult to find the right way to move on from such a time and close the door on series God knows Nickelodeon can't close the door and Sponge Bob already just ended Jesus Christ so many cartoons with so many great finales but for Avatar The Last Airbender the great finale was planned from the start a lot of the cards soon drew up watching would go week to week with random differentiating plots never having a consistent storyline except being hinted at slightly here or there to end up in the finale but avatar last airbender had one goal in mind in new how is going to eventually end and it did it beautifully you can basically say that this was most kids introduction to anime it took inspirations from animes and kept a consistent storyline that every kid would tune into each week to discuss the craziness of each episode there weren't many that did that even shows like Teen Titans or kids next door had its majority around random plots and self-contained episodes but avatar made sure that every single self-contained plot furthered itself towards the grand finale first off I'm not going to discuss Legend of Korra I have never watched that shiz and do not plan to for me everything with the og avatar ended so God dang perfectly then I'm perfectly fine with having my knowledge of the story end right there if you don't know what avatar last airbender is and if you don't you really got to go check yourself before you wreck yourself it's a series about this 100 year old badass named Aang and his journey to master the four elements of his world in order to save it he must master water earth air and fire he was this thing known as the avatar and not the one with the [ __ ] blue people they should have just named that movie Pandora's Pocahontas to avoid confusion but Aang is the avatar there have been many avatars but Aang is the most avatar iasts of avatars he once trapped himself in a big ol snowball deep below the water and wasn't awakened for 100 years until he's too nerd Sokka and Katara's covered him from then on they journeyed with him across lands to learn and conquer they all become three best buds for life very early on in the show we learned that Aang must learn how to master all four elements before a certain comet arrives by the end of the summer from the start we knew the time frame to show with consistent the show ran from 2005 to 2008 three years three season each season was themed around one of the elements Aang has not yet mastered so as a kid who just eagerly awaiting that grand spectacle of a finale to come when he's mastered every element one of the very first videos a blow up this channel was on the ed ed and Eddy finale and how big of a [ __ ] banger that was so now I want to discuss the avatar finale but not in just one long video I want to do it in three parts I want to discuss the journey it took to reach its end it's one of the greatest cartoon finales to ever exist in each season the show would get a dramatic boost in quality starting off pretty freakin good until reaching actual masterpiece levels of quality to begin we have to start with book 1 water water is the first element Aang must master one of the people to awaken him from the snowball was Katara who was a waterbender herself yet there's no water benders where Katara originates from as they've all been [ __ ] murdered the biggest thing in avatar last airbender is its themes of genocide and war everyone knows the very famous line then everything changed when the Fire Nation that line basically means that while Aang was sleeping the fire nation of fire went around the world wreaking havoc on all who crossed their paths so they can be the sole rulers this creates an incredible backstory for the world and allows for an intensely dark and dramatic moments throughout the show you also have Prince Zuko he's a part of the Fire Nation but he's exiled the only way he can receive Redemption is by capturing the avatar so throughout the show you always had this little cat-and-mouse dynamic going on while Aang's on his normal quest he was one of the best friends I ever had and he was from the Fire Nation just like you we knew each other back then do you think we could have been friends to the Zuko's not just a cat he's also one of the best written characters in any cartoon ever with a heartbreaking backstory and emotions that every single angsty kid or teen would relate to growing up you just can't help but sympathize with him I meant you no disrespect I'm your loyal son rise and fight Prince Zuko I won't fight you learn respect and suffering will be your teacher I looked away besides learning about each element in learns control and empathy and life lessons that go beyond [ __ ] Jesus Katara and Sokka learned things too guitar and learns how to remain calm and forgive throughout the show and Sokka learns how to be more open-minded and respectful you also got Tov inches but I'll talk about her in part two okay so now that we know about the main characters of season one let's talk about their journey okay so for in order to Aang to learn waterbending they have to travel to the north but their constant stops along the way allow the characters that get constantly fleshed out every single episode even in the smallest way possible Aang's four stop on the way is at his old home that he used to crash at before he took a big ol nap but of course no one's [ __ ] alive I just told you about genocide in the murders at doof so here we get an incredibly heartbreaking scene where Aang's emotions are lit out for a moment until the frenzy has now are able to calm him down from this point on we knew that these three were going to stick by each other's side soon as they head back out they get involved with local town and they're one of the first to find out that the avatar is back and is alive Russell meet Sookie but she becomes more important in the later seasons but here's when Sokka starts to learn how to stop being so arrogant and guitarra learns to calm down more your angler pnes he can't get carried away with his fame and soon the gang continues to travel towards the north but they stopped at an earth Kingdom along the way okay so here we get some more world building avatar so damn cool that they made the mailing system a fun and exciting part of their world when a freaking postal service sticks with you from a cartoon while you're growing up you know something was special about that show a needs an old man who rules a town who turned out to be one of his childhood friends who is old as [ __ ] now which is kind of dark but Aang embraces it head-on with acceptance [Music] it's good to see you know how they've changed a bit literally so as the game continues to head north they stop at multiple places and meet many people who will teach them incredible things that they'll remember throughout life ain't [ __ ] dies and becomes a ghost for a moment in order to talk to the past incarnations of avatars we get some chilling moments where Aang enters an avatar state and goes ham on some fire nation they can help you face the threat but only if you are ready fire but each episode is a new lesson it's always serving some amount of character development every episode they get better and improve and they don't really fall back on past mistakes if they do they almost instantly remember why they shouldn't be like that anymore except okay there is this weird thing that an constantly does throughout season one like he's learning all of these incredible life lessons on his journey but he does some unmistakable [ __ ] like there's an entire episode where the gang travels with a divided group through a dangerous Canyon this group is a real Romeo and Juliet kind of group 1 says that High School Musical 3 is better than 2 and the other one says that High School Musical 2 is better than 3 because you know they're right but once they cross a canyon and make it to the end they begin to fight about their past heritage too bad we can't rewrite history you thieves stole our sacred orb from ghin way you tyrants unjustly imprisoned wage in for 20 long years so anxious abuses his avatar status to change their history and lie about it creating peace in the process might not look it but I'm 112 years old I was there 100 years ago on the day you're talking about first of all him laying waging Wars enemies they were brothers twins in fact and there were eight most importantly they were just playing a game that was the bull but the dude still straight up lying to them like what the [ __ ] Aang that's some luck you knew ghin way and wage in you could call it luck or you could call it light what you need the whole thing off you did not that is so wrong you're abusing your overpowered status but later on we sees people are gliding around in the air he gets jealous because they're not airbenders so he seriously tries to one-up a [ __ ] in a wheelchair who can't walk so instead he flies but Anglet Jake gets mad at him at first but I'm stating this because the very very small faults and Aang's character are things the show fixes throughout the series his flaws are subtle and may seem harmless at first for such a high status as the avatar they are flaws because Aang is still a kid in the journey towards the finale and becoming worthy of that status is something that the show perfects to a tee you not ready you are too weak you think I am weak Avatar Roku I have mastered the elements a thousand times and a thousand lifetimes you will teach the Avatar firebending yes yes I will teach you really that's great it's like season one presents us all of the flaws in each character and how it quickly improves upon them it's a giant melting pot of incredible writing and a lot of this does sound like holy doly normal stuff that normal plots have but avatar does it so insanely well that it basically becomes an example for that kind of writing in and of itself while the animation and direction isn't as good in the first season as it is in the following seasons it kind of adds to my point that the show just builds up into one master class in a quality finale the finale of the first season brings the events of everything we journey towards throughout the book in one massive climax a climax so good M night shamalamadingdong made a parody movie about it in order to give us a way for Aang to master waterbending his Frank Katara who's already been a waterbender fully masters it herself and will help Aang master it well mastering the others because this boy turned into a massive [ __ ] frog demon water master for a moment look it got a little crazy but is incredibly cool and iconic and I lost where I was going with this but yo check out the insane use of lighting in finale in my opinion season 1 is definitely the weakest season in the show but in the show as great as this it's not really a bad thing overall season 1 of Avatar The Last Airbender is simply an introduction it introduces us to this world it gives us an introduction to the depth of these characters it gives us an introduction to the lessons we learn along the way the show has inspired me growing up with its delicate badassery of showing just how good a story can be even if it's marketed towards kids but it's much more than that it had no rate the snap as hard as it did [Music] you know the entire process of angling how to master all four elements shows he can overcome a challenge it's difficult for him but he pushes past it to learn thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video thank you to every beautiful soul who supports me in patreon and to that guy who wished me a good morning at the gas station at 3 a.m. instead of a good night a very special thank you to you [Music]
