hey groupies welcome back to forma therapy this is the culture study on the channels video producer you can call me PD and today we are checking out Tiger eyes by usage Jung Joo Jung most famously known for being part of lovelyz got to know her a little bit more and the group through queendom which we variety show reality show reactions all over on patreon anyways let's get into this video this is Tiger Eyes bio deuce Jung and this is your form of therapy there we go [Music] [Music] Wow having the soundscape be so minimal like what kind of forces you to focus on or vocals [Music] and you know just the slight amount of piano [Music] go Gingka Sanka [Music] oh really that's what they're gonna do with this chorus this is interesting [Music] don't soon silhouettes girl Monica but topic [Music] [Music] so Charles I hung it on a wheel I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't be offended when I say I did not expect a 10 out of 10 out of this song i'ma tell you first of all this is a 10 out of 10 this is quite an incredible song Wow Wow okay let's get into it so users young based on what I saw in queendom I knew that she and Kay were probably among like some of the best singers in Lovely's this is not what I expected from her when I heard that she was doing a solo song I expected somewhere between a more fairy pop song you know something very light-hearted very beautiful or something that is maybe a little bit more sentimental slow sad ballad I would say this is not what I expected especially from you Jeong she never struck me at least from what I've seen on queendom as somebody who would want to do this kind of concept but I really dig it and she executed perfectly I mean there are first of all it's it's it's a well well shot music video I mean it's very hard in this day and age to stand out and kind of even be able to say that this was unique but this was unique this song I haven't heard something like this like this reminds me of like kind of like the weird euro techno music like the very very like bass heavy techno music I heard like the late 90s and early 2000s like the fact that this song never it never has that like pure overtly loud drop or or the texture never really like changes it's it's a very hollow very minimalistic song there's really only one time that's different and it's right at the right of the drop of the chorus but it's not even like your typical kind of drop it's just like a it's almost like a loud crash but then it slips right into it and then it's got an additional it's kind of an additional let's see [Music] so they add just like clapping and a little bit more percussion but it never actually it it never exceeds beyond that and the song doesn't do anything like I don't feel like I feel like what a song does this sometimes it feels like I got cheated of like a drop or like an amazing drop but the song never once kind of builds an expectation that this is gonna be the type of song where I'll wait for the drop wait for like this uber satisfying chorus and that in and of itself makes this song incredibly satisfying first of all can we talk about the video the color the color is absolutely gorgeous let's take a look at this by God look at usage on she looks gorgeous with the blue hair and then the orange just oh my god it pops so well behind her let's and let's inspect a little bit deeper like this is a great set it looks like one decay was part of the production I loved this opening in general just like a lot of the blues I mean a lot of this music video is mixing blue and yellow together so you've got this blue here against this cruise liner ship it's a very cool very refreshing scene just looking at this I kind of thought like I haven't seen anything like this but there's not anything like crazy unique or different about this it looks like it's a it's an abandoned cruise liner but just like her dress itself looks really unique and looks custom-made rather than just like Oh generic glamorous dress and again the hair looks gorgeous on her but I really love I really love her look with the blue hair in the leopard print dress I think it's absolutely gorgeous I think the yellow and the blue just goes well together the lighting here seems to be mainly magenta and some red lighting as well this is so gorgeous look at her look at the colors in this scene she really really pops so the magenta and the Sian kaan plenty CH other and then blue and the yellow complement each other god it's so gorgeous God the song is so incredibly sexy it's so seductive but it's it's seductive in that very controlled very mysterious way I think [Music] I think this might be one of my more favorite debut slash comeback choices for solo artist I think this fits her immensely well and I think the idea is actually very well realized and this song just makes you focus on her vocals so much it's like borderline ASMR how prevalent her voice is in the song like because the song is so minimal in the instrumental she sounds so wonderful she sounds amazing I think yeah I think this the I think this is I mean I really really like K from lovelyz but I think this is my favorite solo song I've heard from a lovelyz member and just a really well-executed solo concept for any kind of solo artist [Music] yeah just that dropped is kind of it slaps you but then it doesn't really kind of grow louder and louder and louder I feel like most progression in kpop music nowadays is towards that immensely satisfying big drop but this never goes there and you've got to be a very talented vocalist to even be able to pull off this level of control and to keep the audience engaged I personally love this song a lot but guys what do you guys think about is Jung's
