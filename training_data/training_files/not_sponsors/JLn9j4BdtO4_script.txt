[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel today's video is a very special one because it's a continuation of the mere furniture pieces my husband made you guys really enjoyed my last video and I'm so excited to share how to make your very own glam mirrored entryway table if you're new here welcome I would love to have you part of our YouTube family so make sure you subscribe and hit the bell button to be notified when I upload my next video I love decorating and I get so many questions tore my decorum so when I can link something I definitely will in today's video I partnered with sponsoring this video now let's go ahead and make this glam merde table [Music] we purchased this plywood at Lowe's and with this wood he can build a coffee table a side table and an entryway table I showed you guys in my last video how to make your table set and today we're making the entryway table and mentioned also in my last video that you'll have leftover wood that you can use for small projects so this is the exactly way you can use with that extra wood the Lowe's associate was really nice to cut out so many pieces for us he told us that they don't usually cut out this much her project but he would do it for us I hope you have someone nice to help you get all the cuts you need if you decide to make all three projects the next items you will need is the driller screwdriver wood nails black paint a paint brush scissors gorilla construction adhesive marble contact paper which I got at Lowe's and 24 meters from Dollar Tree these are the pieces you will need to make the entryway table and I will leave all the measurements in the description box [Music] starting off my husband labeled each piece to make it easier to see where each piece will go as you can see this is the floor base and I will go ahead and cut the contact paper to size and wrap it like a present [Music] this is going to go on top of the floor base and my husband went ahead and screwed the nails in I will leave the measurements in the description box to let you know where each piece will go this second part is right in the middle of the floor base so make sure before you know this down that there's an even space on both sides he ended up going back to Lowe's for extra woods had the back support because without it it was wobbly and this made it strong and secure you can cover the entire back if you want to but we decided to add the support on the top and bottom because our dollar tree mirrors would fit perfectly on here you can cover the entire back with wood and add marble contact paper that would look really pretty too [Music] now for the top you will go ahead and screw the nails in and our drill was acting up for some reason so this works just fine as well this shows you you don't have to go out and buy a drill to make these projects [Applause] this piece is now ready to be nailed to the floor base and here's how it looks with the nails in at the top [Applause] [Applause] [Music] here my husband is using Gerlich construction adhesive to apply the mayor's on this side of the table this glue is so strong that it holds as soon as you laid against something he repeated this all over the table and then painted besides black make sure to paint the sides first before gluing the mirrors down we almost forgot to paint first so we stopped gluing the mirrors down and finished this step here's the entry table you guys I'm so excited with how this DIY turned out it was so much fun to make this and the outcome is really rewarding I was really surprised when my husband said he would make an entry table after making the table set in my last video I'm so happy he made this and he has more ideas in mind that he wants to show you guys I'm so proud of him he's never built anything from plywood so this is amazing for me to see let me know what you think of this table I really appreciate all the wonderful feedback you guys gave us in my last video if you have any requests on what you would love to see next please let me know in the comment section and we will make it happen if it's a highly requested one I think we are going to start a mere furniture series so give this video a thumbs up if you want to see more I decorated the table a few different ways to give you an idea of how it would look if you wanted to recreate it for your home this would also look beautiful in your room dining room or living room the ideas are endless and what it cost to make this mere furniture piece is a lot more affordable than going to buy it in store these pieces retail for hundreds and even thousands of dollars so I encourage you to make this for your home if you love mere furniture you can take this as an idea to make your table and make it your own perhaps with different contact paper or paint color or other details I really hope you're inspired today because that's always my goal here if you recreate this or any other DIY I've done please tag me on instagram it's LG Queen home decor I would love to see one of the ways I styled it is adding a flower vase a candle in the middle to cozy up the space a mere box to put my keys in or anything little that I want to take when I leave the house I also added a basket with a throw blanket and pillows to give you an idea if you wanted to style this in your living room or your very own room [Music] here stop the entry table with the same things when I added a place not in the middle and a candy jar let me know which style you like best out of the four I'm gonna show you [Music] [Music] this third style is my favorite because it's very simple but glam at the same time I bought these candleholders years ago and they've been my favorite candle holders I've ever owned they're really heavy in such great quality I found them at three different home goods I add an LED light so they automatically turn on at a set time each day and I really enjoy having that thank you guys so much for all your continued love and support it motivates me even more to keep sharing what I love I'm very grateful to God for allowing me to be here and thankful my sister talked me into making my youtube channel I was scared at first but you have to get out of your comfort zone sometimes to grow I'm very blessed with this outcome in today I encourage you to pursue your dreams dream big and have faith because
