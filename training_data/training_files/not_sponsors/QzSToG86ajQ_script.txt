this is gonna be one of the hardest videos I've ever had light what is the ring light reflect that my glasses no [Music] I'm sorry for saying the n-word guys seriously though this is gonna be the hardest video I've ever had to make because I had to sit through 20 youtuber apologies [ __ ] me throughout recent years I've been a pretty big proponent for no more apology videos they almost always do more bad than good so much at the point that I thought nobody could win with an apology video then I started realizing that apology videos weren't the problem shitty apology videos with a problem it is so ironic that videos that are meant to be genuine are often the most disingenuous the apologies I watched came from youtubers the people who are paid to crank themselves up a bit for the camera me included not just always like this I have to entertain and I think sometimes some youtubers can't get that out of them when they make an apology video they always want to make their emotions translate through the camera so though up in a bit what I'm trying to get at is that I think when youtubers make an apology video and obviously want to be genuine they try to seem genuine which is not genuine that's why these videos are often set up for failure amongst other things so with that I watched 20 apology videos I almost feel like I'm owed an apology for having to watch them and now I'm gonna rank them in the possibly outdated meme known as a out of it [Music] [Applause] hey guys welcome back to making light of some of the toughest times in people's lives today we're ranking youtuber apology videos some of the best some of the most notorious and some of the most [ __ ] shameful I got 20 options here if my math is correct we're not playing around here cuz we got some big hitters we got ksi Logan Paul 8th Street 8th Street PewDiePie James Charles Jake Paul this guy that dated tan awhile ago we got ballers so as much as it would make sense to watch all of these and then do this list it's not at all what I did because there's no way I was gonna be able to get through that I think last night I got through like a dozen then today I got through the rest if they were all nice little PewDiePie 1 minute 45 seconds it'd be easy but some of us like to make 22 minute apologies Danna and then other people make us sit through a vlog to watch their apology J and then some of us should be in prison Ariana so let's start this list usually tearless or like st or a tier b CD you know how it works right my s tier is we forgive you because if you did an excellent job when your apology we forgive you that's the best you could hope for buddy my a tier is you messed up what respect B tier is there we still need more time so shut the [ __ ] up the next one is hashtag you are over party followed by r.i.p your career followed by prison now before i rank these i just want to clarify I'm not gonna put them in the realm of what actually happened I'm gonna put them in the realm of this is what your apology video deserved for example our first contestant Laura Lee I know we're not friends anymore but I want to apologize to you Loreley I'm sure you're a nice person I mean I'm not entirely sure but for the sake of my next statement I'm gonna force myself to give you the benefit of the doubt because mmm you stupid we're not watching this why you edited it I would be [ __ ] embarrassed to release something like this I feel like this is honestly an insult to your viewers like you assumed they would buy into this porn level of acting I hope this debacle of an apology helped you keep all your brand deals money shot the worst she got is a you are over party because I'm pretty sure her career is still often poppin but that apology Laura that deserves a rip or to a massive pointer if you're gonna record an apology video gather your composure first and then on top of that I couldn't find it but I'm pretty sure she made like an a redo apology video where she apologized for her apology video that's impressive let's go to Bart now cuz I keep looking at him so I want to clear the air and and let people know that I know that I [ __ ] up with my joke and I clearly crossed the line and he basically was talking about a story we're back in like military school this one guy was late in his class couple his friends gathered up went to go beat the [ __ ] out of him and then he said that they showed the broomstick up his ass and am I gonna I actually considered talking about this when it first came out however Bart's apology swayed me his problem was that he had a bit of Shane Dawson syndrome where he would try to amp up his stories for shock value for example Shane Dawson [ __ ] his cat he just say really stupid stories that weren't even funny to begin with to try and get a laugh out of people Bart sounded very genuine he sounded very convincing he showed all the context to everything that was being talked about he addressed it directly he didn't condone any of his behavior we might be a little early on something like this but Bart we forgive you at least I do okay we're gonna move Romy Lacoste this is easy if I've made anyone feel uncomfortable if anyone feels like they've been taken advantage of I personally feel like I thought I did my best okay I was talking to underage girls as far as we know he's a bit of a tricky situation because when he tried apologizing to keemstar on dramaalert it was a complete [ __ ] so I'm an entire video on it because it was so bad he was so overly defensive ready with every predator excuse in the book you know [ __ ] prison that apology could quite literally be used in court against him that's how bad it was rice scum apology um now this apology was for his gambling problem the same one that this guy over here did it's true I'm an [ __ ] like what was I thinking like I can't lead ooh much cuz I already did it the damage has been done guys already saw a money-hungry side up and it is what it is and there's nothing I can really do but say sorry and give you these Amazon gift cards so I'm sorry my scope just doesn't care and we shouldn't be surprised by that at this point he literally just pointed the gun at everyone else who took the same sketchy sponsor deal he did and ended up turning this into an H Street H Street beef in other words profit I mean it is a good point the guy who literally makes slime videos decided to do something super slimy that's a pretty big cause for concern I mean honestly for every dude that took the deal this definitely was a dam this bag is way too much - turn it down I get it but they not for me [ __ ] so [ __ ] you guys by the way these Amazon codes were later allegedly proven to not actually work which why it was a terrible bribe to begin with but they're not even real bro how much can one youtuber just not care in his apology video for this wasn't really an apology video it was just another rice scum video where he mentioned the controversy he was so nonchalant about it he knew nothing was gonna come from this he cash in on some views and went on with his life here's the thing with a lot of these apology videos is context really matters for a lot of these and my context I mean the person giving the apology rice gum is controversial and a bit of a Teflon Don at this point then again every youtuber is a bit of a Teflon Don at this point every youtuber will always have fans no matter what team stars apology for outing the pedophile I pride myself on being right and I was not right this time and Tony if you're watching we're gonna make this right with you no matter what we have to do I thought this was a good apology from keemstar it's a terrible thing he did and I don't think he was offloading the blame but he was just saying what actually happened that someone on his team [ __ ] up all I really have to say turns out there's a shortage of jokes when the apology is actually good which for me is bad for business so keep sucking at apologies kids I'm gonna throw that apology at and we still need more time ksi was an odd one I had never even seen this video unto this point he was apologizing for making his like great face and I tried taking down all these rape face videos but it's kind of hard when people keep reloading them and that's just something I'm just not happy about hey guys can you stop bringing up that thing I did that was controversial FIFA hentai compilation coming soon and not to see I don't even know why ksi made this video what's it really an apology he started with his like fun intro he's like was it all guys nothing ksi but it was more so hey guys stop posting this and hey maybe I shouldn't have made lighter rape back in the day to gain subs I mean don't get me wrong he touched on that but very little compared to the rest of the video I know people care but the way you were dressing it's like you didn't care so what the [ __ ] the [ __ ] up man a lot of fun people left leafy I know I [ __ ] up I'm not gonna sit here and try to redirect the blame I'm not gonna sit here and make excuses and I'm willing to admit that I am in the wrong here and I'm sorry I gotta say a genuine apology sounds weird over footage of surfing on csgo but somehow even with that leafy still made a good apology he didn't beat around the bush and he got right into it owned up the thanks slide at the end is a bit off that's like what you put at the end of a subscriber milestone video here's a question you guys think there's a chance Leif he comes back anytime soon it's possible but personally I think there's no chance now that leafies apology obviously to Tommy and see a youtuber who so happens to be autistic he had made a video where he saved the eggs from falling off some lady's car and then he just started to flog him with her she seemed uncomfortable he was a bit awkward himself Leif he covered the video and then all of a sudden his [ __ ] toxic fanbase started giving death threats to Tommy even though he did nothing wrong and leave he actually covered the apology fairly well he messed up but respect it was more your toxic shitty fanbase was really [ __ ] everything up James Charles the man of the hour James should have just thrown in an apology with his 40-minute clap back I guess it's impressive that he released an apology that got memed to hell him back was rejected by the world and still came out on top with a response video but this is what I mean you should apologize yes but if you have information that is very important to the situation at hand spill that tea [ __ ] protip maybe don't record your apology when you're half asleep cuz then that makes for a half-assed apology by the way if you live under a rock James Charles apology is in reference to Tati Westbrook calling him out for being a bad friend supporting her competitor trying to turn straight guys gay and even though James has responded and cleared a lot of allegations the apology was so well worth in you are over party James brought all those memes on his damn self he came back with a solid 41 minute counter punch but this apology video was ass it was like Drake dropping charged up right before he dropped back to back it was something that I said in the heat of the moment I said the worst word I could possibly think of and it just sort of slipped out I think PewDiePie out of all people will never be taken down I would say his controversy is second to Logan Paul's in terms of worldwide news but I feel like he was under a much much hotter fire I mean a [ __ ] Nazi call out with everybody leaving out vital context pets of [ __ ] yikes giggling next to a corpse in front of the prepubescent low gang also a pretty big [ __ ] yikes I don't know they're both pretty bad what are you guys doing out here just stop just be stop [ __ ] up guys I [ __ ] up a lot trust me I got and I got no right to talk but come on you can [ __ ] film dead bodies and then put real tea free tracks over them like come on yeah we still need more time Puetz PewDiePie has been involved in a lot of controversies surprisingly it was kind of getting to a point where I was like oh look peopIe [ __ ] up again but then again it's not fair to him because all eyes are on him when you drop the n-bomb on stream that's what he was apologizing for he even memed on himself because a day after he did it he uploaded like top 10 twitch fails or something where in that video he was like man I'm gonna end up on this list one day but his apology was short sweet one minute 45 seconds easy day to watch easy day the process even if you're mad at the guy you'll give him 1 minute and 45 seconds of your data here mom like it was more of a vibe of I'm such a [ __ ] idiot I'm sorry guys I clearly didn't mean anything wrong from it I'm just a [ __ ] idiot okay I'm just a [ __ ] idiot it was that's the vibe I got which I'm fine with that you're a [ __ ] idiot you're a [ __ ] idiot thank you for owning up to it not many people do Brad Susa or salsa I don't know why this guy's on the list I just came across his apology video and I was like now watch it I obviously wanted to make this video so that you guys could just hear me out you know again I'm very sorry for what I did Brad cheated on Tana and he made it very clear that he still cares about her very very much Tana mojo but besides that very piss-poor apology you're like the tool who can't explain his emotions correctly but the good news is that you're a Justin Bieber doppelganger so you know we find in life have a good one Chad OH have a good one breast guy apologized for cheating on Tana I guess he was getting nudes and snapchats he wasn't [ __ ] anybody in person but he was getting some nice some nice titties with emojis on it and [ __ ] I personally don't care about the matter at hand but that apology was pretty dog [ __ ] if I do say so myself it's just sounded like it was for Tana like Tana made him do it all so you're like chewing gum through it which just makes you seem more like a douche you have like a mid wardrobe change where you're just throwing a snapback for no reason it's bad quality it's a shakey cam you can get it on the party Brad Logan Paul I've made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgment and I don't expect to be forgiven I'm simply here to apologize you know everybody memes aside before the apology but it honestly just sounds weird jumping straight into it let's just jump this is just an apology at its core which is what Logan needed there is no reason to bring up anything else honestly the whole world wanted blood so yeah just do what he did he's doing fine oh maybe the apology video with the most views here I think possibly what freaks me out in this video all the time is just like Logan has these droopy eyes that are glistening that's neither here nor there I'm his apology not a bad apology clearly scripted but at the same time it's pros and cons to scripting an apology when you script it it sounds less genuine but the same time you say what you really want to say you get all of your thoughts out all your thoughts in order we're dropping the low gang and we still need more time finebros finebros hey everybody this video is us wanting to explain some things about react world the confusion and negative response over what this all is has been so overwhelming i can't tell if they're reading teleprompters or if they're lazy eyes are busy filming a react episode good apology though didn't even really do anything wrong I'm looking back on it they just wanted to start kind of like a franchising thing where people could remake their show and then finebros take some of their revenue but I didn't see anything inherently wrong with it a lot of people were saying that they were trying to trademark the word react like and then started taking down everybody's reaction videos not the case pretty inoffensive honestly I think they got jumped on a bit preemptively with not a lot of reason their apology was exactly the apology you would expect the finebros to make sitting there reading a teleprompter we forgive you Benny and the other Rafi we forgive you you're all right in my book guys Jake Paul I'm sorry for not being myself I'm sorry for a lot of things but look it's Jake Paul being Jake Paul nothing like a little wacky tomfoolery before a very serious apology also this is unrelated but your millionaires why are you sleeping on the floor in the 1 out of 32 rooms there's another one - [ __ ] these guys must have T Fu's contract Jake tried to cancel kotico because he was bored this is pretty much the same thing good morning Jake Pollard's was Oh Jake turns out we don't have enough super soakers to spray period blood all over a chance today so I'm gonna take the camera and go apologize for some [ __ ] cue the sad music dear YouTube by the way Jake Pollard's after you're done being introspective like I was Murch Lincoln bio go over pay me for my t-shirts made from shrink wrap an orphan sweat shoutouts a nerd city out of the 19 apologies Jake had I chose the one where he apologized for making a diss track on his brother and also just randomly apologizing for making its everyday bro I guess all the shitty talked in its everyday bro is what he said I don't know I zoned out a lot Jake gathers his thoughts like a nine-year-old sorry didn't mean a cyberbully Oh where's Cody Co sucka sent him to prison for being a sizeable he takes apologies just seemed like hey this is content this is how I'm gonna fill up another seven minutes and I'm gonna place sad music over it you stay right there you stay right there Jake you stay right there t Martin [ __ ] tee Martin T Martin T Martin Cooper I have no idea how I'm gonna record this video dude I love you guys seriously I love you all in fact I love you about as much as I love my dog we all get buried with buddy if you try to come from my pockets ever again this is still honestly one of the greatest things I've ever seen on YouTube and honestly cancel culture just wasn't what it was nowadays otherwise I don't think T Martin would have made it through this like he did people got really mad at Jake Paul and rice gum for taking a check to promote gambling to kids while they most likely use boosted accounts now imagine all of that paired with the fact that you are the mastermind behind all of it that's [ __ ] nuts tee Martin ended up kind of dying off but Pro Syndicate still default dances way into your hearts what a high tier crime to get away with the og apologist T Martin hit every little trope if you will in an apology video the deep breath the dog for sympathy how am I gonna make this video little popper not a lot of people left this is exciting this is just I hear it he's actually in prison smoke I used to ask fans for twerking videos yes twerking the dance move it's not something that I'm proud of it's not something that I think is right and I shouldn't have done it I already covered creeps McGee on my channel also completely unrelated but if you guys want to prove that you're a real GG r DM me naked twerking vids after you eat like three K Cerritos from Taco Bell I want to see some 3d mudslides from my birthday h3h3 you might be asking wait a minute what did they apologize for and this was when they uploaded a video who was a commercial really of their mobile game they had just released and this was after not posting for [ __ ] stupid long and they came back on this not the best look I have accepted that I am like actually depressed Ethan came into this pretty hot on controversy it was really the first time I ever saw him catch heat from multiple people and for multiple reasons I mean for time Ethan and ela were legitimately the mom and dad of YouTube loved unanimously it was strange to see them in a pickle which obviously made it strange to hear an apology from them the reasons were definitely fair and at the end of it I get it it just truly was bad timing with the advertisement of their mobile game and since then they've gotten back on track pretty well also good luck on being parents guys it's quite the experience also around this time if I remember correctly they you know even was on the podcast he was kind of starting problems with people he was saying inaccurate things he was saying a lot of controversial [ __ ] to the play where people were like yo what happened to Ethan from 8th Street like who whatever to the reven what happened a dead meme guy now he's just dead inside he gave good reasons as to why everything came about and come I can't stay mad at Eli what is Eli ever done wrong to anybody if ela ever had a fly she probably nursed the fly back to health he messed up but respect you do not pass go re odd no Horace this is y'all's first thought I know as soon as I hear Oh who's 13 and she's 18 oh she's taking advantage of him but that never happened we were always just getting to know each other and we were barely starting to get to know each other this apology video was the worst because there wasn't even an apology not even a fake one he couldn't lie to us and be like yeah I'm remorseful no your video was you guys are wrong you just don't get it okay I'm just a spicy babysitter prison no question tan among you the first thing I want to talk about is the main thing the thing that is everywhere and that is videos of me saying the n-word and more importantly the half-assed disgusting shitty way that I apologized for them in the past this is too long she said to my biracial penis shoutout logic Thank You Tana for admitting to your wrongdoings appreciate it you just told it how it was I was an idiot I would often sling racial slurs around now I don't because then seek ego and sponsor me seriously though this is good it still shouldn't be 22 minutes but I'm proud of you and to think this Tana doesn't know she's gonna later give hundreds of preteens a heat stroke she was apologizing for it a lot of things I believe this was after the idubbbz content comp because she was being exposed for saying the n-word a lot and she was like no I thought it meant my friend she was apologizing for inflating the whole story with idubbbz where she met him and she owned up to everything she literally fessed up to everything was honest about herself criticized herself took way too [ __ ] long Tana did not need to be that long and you know what just give us a little more time and in this bad boy with daddy oh five if you are unaware daddy oh five posted multiple videos where it appeared that he was abusing his children Philip DeFranco covered it with a lot of details even after all that he still had the [ __ ] audacity to post a video of his daughter and son where his son slept his [ __ ] out of his daughter and it's like why did you think that was a good idea to post now sorry if we let you down I'm sorry but I mean it is a YouTube channel into the ones that really stick with us after this you guys are awesome I just don't understand daddy-o 5s game plan he's pleading for the sake of his children but he also just has this scrunched up anger that he's doing his cellar job of hiding by the way that clearly has pitchforks up for philip defranco okay if this DeFranco guy would have reached out to me i would have just told him that the videos are fake okay even if they are fake you still see how this looks right and in this video it's just hey man you guys got to think about the kids you guys are gonna put the kids through this the kids love this channel you guys really want to do this to the kids no is your fault then they proceeded to suck their audience dick and then they do just kept blaming Phil at the end of it wasn't for this DeFranco guy and also me being a quasi abusive parent this wouldn't have happened I want to tell you to shut the [ __ ] up and then also rip your career and there you have it I think this is what I want the prison section ironically ended up being all the alleged predator well one of them's for sure guilty but alleged predators makes sense who would have thought pedophiles weren't too good at making excuses real quick James might need to be down here cuz it was yeah James is going to r.i.p your career that apology was terrible yeah now I think that's good Tara listen I already had my apology videos pre-recorded that's how much ahead of the game I am in these peasants I already know I [ __ ] up in the future so as soon as I do bang new upload I never thought I'd have to make this video but I'm sorry for you know grabbing that girl's ass cuz it was it was it's a fat ass but I shouldn't have done it storm how am I ever gonna make this apology video I love you so much you're the cutest dog ever I'm such a giving person and I help a lot of homeless people right right I do I give it to I'll give a lot to charity and I and I often volunteer in soup kitchens right can you tell them you need to tell them that I do that that's true oh the cameras on come on I'll be sure to edit this in there get off guys I did want to apologize for eating chick-fil-a at a gay bar
