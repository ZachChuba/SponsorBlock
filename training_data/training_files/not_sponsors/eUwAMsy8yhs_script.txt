I'm gonna indicate left not indicating not indicating not indicating yeah yeah it's doing it it's done it it's done it that was so good welcome back everybody tutors the driver and welcome back to autopilot in a city today we are in the southwest of England and we're gonna be tackling Exeter city centre we're gonna be heading into the center heading to the Cathedral and then driving out as we continue our way down the southwest I just want to shout out daily videos on the car on autopilot as you can see we're coming up to these red lights here the car itself will see them but it won't stop just yet nope as you can see not stopping not slowing down so we're gonna have to bring it to a complete stop so yeah I want to say stupid stuff to do some cool videos with make sure you subscribe and turn on the notification bell okay right we're back onto it here looks like it's been days we have got the bin men out which might be quite interesting to see and we'll see how it reacts to it again this is 2020 20.12 so we're not gonna be stopping for traffic lights stop signs you can see they're actually picked up that arrow as a diamond on the road now apparently a diamond on the road means special lane or at least I think that's what it means in America is like special lane so I think it just puts that there if it sees something slightly diamond-shaped again here coming out some red lights which we will have to stop for but it looks like the roads are gonna do something interesting first let's see which lane it picks it's picked the left lane of course because it's the most obvious for it so we're going to cut it across here and go into the middle lane right when will autopilot turn back on there we go another diamond there so it seems to be picking up a lot of arrows recently as diamonds and actually something I have noticed in this update is the assist of the car when you're not on autopilot is nowhere near as strong and and nowhere as near as annoying as it was before so for example if I took this off autopilot for and I let go of it with my hands every single time as soon as I slightly go on this line or over this line it would correct my driving and pull me back into lane whereas now it won't do that which is nice it only does it when it really needs to and that is hardly ever because it's a rare thing for you to like go over a line like this for example I can't quite demonstrate it because there's obviously cars coming on the other side of the road but we'll find a place to demonstrate that a little bit better for you but that was really annoying and previously it would like pretty much control the car without you asking let's see if we can get it to do it here so if I just like to let go of the wheel it should push me back into lane no you see now now it doesn't do it whereas before that would always always push me into Lane even if I went that far over the lane okay again let's give it another go here yeah you see it just doesn't it just doesn't push you over anymore okay so we're coming up to something now a little bit interesting we've got some lines pointing us over to the right the car has followed them correctly and as we come up to these green lights I'm hoping we'll be able to flow straight through them don't pick the right lane ah no it's picked the right lane which is a shame because we want to be in this left lane and continue on route here that's a little bit of a shame so it's not picking up the lanes correctly we have got the sat-nav on so for anyone that says you need the sat-nav on and then it will do those lanes for you I hope that demonstrates it doesn't follow the lanes at all and it doesn't follow the sat-nav but on the normal driving again there's another diamond two diamonds and an arrow even though it knows okay again picking the right-hand lane here which we don't actually want it to do we want it to pick the left-hand lane for us to continue going straight on will it pick up this massive bike sign in the road yes it did it put the bike sign down on the road as well and look how well it's doing these normal roads it's actually one road all the way into Exeter like just one straight road which is quite nice because it means we're not having to turn off or disengage autopilot at all when it pick up the cyclists yet showing the cyclists there and you actually showed it slowed down slightly for the bin man there you go the man is carrying the bins and the bins were walking across the roads that was really cool to see it be nice as well if it showed us speed cameras maybe when you went past a speed camera it could put like I don't know like a little warning up or something like Waze does that'd be quite nice to have but of course a what a flawless and easy morning drive it is 6:20 a.m. on Monday morning so no one's really on the road let's hope it picks the left lane here yeah it's pick the left lane nicely through the lights no problem picking the ball adds up as cones as you'll see there on the map which again is fine as long as it picks it up as a stationary object that's all we need to see or there we go slowing us down there a little bit late but it did get us slowed down for the corner and did tuck us around nicely this bus stops going to cause issues yeah look at that ah really big issues there with the bus stop and I'm going to slow it down to 25 for this section because it does need to slow down it's going a little bit left and right look out well it's doing it though again if it just regulated its speed just a tiny bit more you know it really could go slow if it wanted to I'd be happy this is a tough one because you can't see what's over the top oh ok so it goes to two lanes and it actually picked the correct lane for going forward in the end even though it did a big switch it actually did pick the correct lane okay so we're coming up now to some lights let's see which way we're gonna be going we're gonna be going straight on through is it gonna change for us no didn't change for us in time so I'm just gonna have to turn it off and go myself so I've never been through this looks like we yeah we're going straight through the city centre here so this could be quite interesting to see what it is like in the city centre of Exeter if these lights ever want to change they've got quite a lot of cameras it looks like I'm not seeing a lot of cameras here which we're not used to okay here we go so onwards autopilot won't turn on just yet it seems of trying to turn on their okay now we can get it on so it's a 20 mile an hour zone down here which hopefully will be good for us because we've got some pretty tight turns coming up just in front of us there's nothing behind us there's no one around us picking up those lights nicely picking up the poles nicely and is it gonna make this turn that was about to curb that was a copy of what happened in Oxford which if you need to remember what happened in Oxford changed it to green they're gonna go left gonna indicate left oh I just curbed just curb that hard yeah it curbed pretty hard so you saw there again it didn't slow down for the corner and we just know that it can't take those kind of corners yet so it would definitely was about to cut a little bit too fine and Kermit again pretty nice here through the center of the city and we're in the left lane so we're gonna be going left to it really nice view so I'm going to stick down at 15 miles an hour I'm just gonna set my next navigation point as well while we're on this road nice and slow I'm not going to Truro we're going to Plymouth next so we've got speed bumps which again the car doesn't show or react to but I do hope that at some point it will slow down for them because going on these speed bumps of 20 might be a bit fast we've got the postman in front of us let's see if it picks him up early yep there it is really nice and early actually I saw him there look at all the crap look all the stuff on the side of the road that's despicable again here in the middle of the road a little bit too much for us it's bringing us back over I think that was only because of the bus stop that brought us over and this is a one way that I'm really confused about so I'm gonna bring it down to ten miles an hour for it and let the car figure it out okay so we've got a turn the car was not turning the car was like not turning there at all at the end I don't know if you saw that but it just it was having none of it and I actually was working yeah it was having none of it and it was just kind of like going straight which was strange that's a shame so we had a little abortion there as we went over the yellow boxes which obviously is very confusing for it I don't expect it to see that as of yet oh it's not sure there what lane it wants to take and you can see there it's kind of fighting with itself and it just picked the second lane in the end but that didn't feel too too great there a little bit of confusing roads but nothing nothing too much okay slow it down for this getting some tighter areas as we come out things like this are gonna be really tough especially if there's cars coming through because they will get tighter obviously through the bridges that wasn't too bad actually let's see which lanes it gonna pick here is it gonna pick it looks like it's gonna pick the right-hand lane yeah it's picking the right-hand lane here so I'm gonna protect just cuz there was a car right up my bum just gonna pretend I'm taking this and then I'm gonna go oh wait no actually I just want to go this way so again that's a little bit of a shame because that's autopilot showing that it's not following the arrows on the road or anything extra like that but you know it's not it doesn't say that it'll do that yet so that's as expected again peanut cones nicely it can read some of the writing on the road whenever it sees stop or slow it will displace low and then sometimes if it thinks it can see words it just puts low on the road even if it's something else sometimes yeah like bus stop says slow which which kind of works I guess here picking the right-hand lane definitely feels more American favored because it always does pick that right-hand lane all this bus is closed on our side of the road but it dealt with that nicely a little bit too fast around that corner but covered itself nicely recovered itself nicely straight across and come into a lane change no as you can see lane changes are not possible it would just keep on indicating for as long as you leave it which this may mean we are in the right-hand lane which might be the wrong lane for where we want to go well let's have a look oh no we are going straight on on this lane as well so this could work now this can be very interesting the lines disappear here and the car is going to take the middle lane you could tell that it was going to go a little bit wonky a little bit wavy there but it did take the middle lane in the ends it is still driving us well the Rose thick and white here but actually I've got to say it's done some very very impressive maneuvers on this little drive here it hasn't picked up the speed change there we go now it's picked up the speed change so again it's not reading the speed signs and it's not quite as accurate yet as we'd like it's actually we want it to we want it to show the speed signs okay this gonna be really interesting it's not behind us here so I'm gonna test this out and see we've got the cones we're going on to the motorway here actually yeah we're going on to the motorway so oh this is perfect no one can get on us let's just see what the car does here I'm gonna indicate left and the car went left wow that actually did go left I'm pretty impressed with that I wasn't expecting it to okay let's see what the car asks us to do because navigate on autopilot should in theory work here yeah yeah it's doing it it's done it it's done it that was so good that was so good well done car well done Oreo that was really impressive we've got one more turn off in 1.3 miles so we'll do that one as well yeah we got roadworks coming up and hopefully I'm not gonna win the cake and I'm just gonna let the car there's no one behind us for a while so we've got space to that's why I put it up a little bit just so we could get a little bit of space I'm not going to indicate I'm just gonna see if the the car will actually push us over ourselves you ready not indicating not indicating not indicating oh I didn't have the balls I didn't have the balls it got way too close it got weighted so I mean if I don't have the balls to do it I think it's safe to say that it didn't feel like it was pushing itself over I do believe it would do it by the last second and especially from the cone testing of the last video it will push itself over but we've also seen it run into cones so I'm not quite ready to take that risk as as of yet here's another test for it good it's followed that the cones pushed it over and out of this Lane which is brilliant and which way is this taking us now we want to go to Plymouth so we did want to follow this road and sadly the autopilot wasn't able to keep us on the road there oh my god this is really tough max speed 30 down here I know it's not sorry recommended speed for the corner is 30 or let the car do its thing oh that's such a shame that it just disengaged back there because that would have been flawless otherwise okay we've got serious sunlight and I mean this is blinding this might ruin yeah yep totally Wow jeepers I can hardly see but you saw the car there panic I've got a car just like appear up my bum so I decided to take it off myself but it does want to take back control so the sunshine although scary for the car not not the end of the world apparently and yeah look at it we're pulling it back up and I'm gonna bring it back up to speed here up to 60 up to 70 and there we go on to the motorway so it didn't do it albeit like kind of wonky it failed when the car got blinded but it definitely did get blinded by those lights but again that's something that I'm really intrigued in the future how is it gonna figure those things out if it's blinded does that mean it just won't drive or will it have to do something else I'm not a hundred percent sure but obviously it's something work that we will find out it's asking us to change lanes here but you can see that it's saying it's not safe to because we've got cars all around us here but I'm just going to try a lane change let's just make sure the lane changes are all good yeah look at that no problem with the lane change really nice and smooth so there we are everybody there is an autopilot city tour through the center of Exeter and a little bit of navigate on autopilot and some cool road works let me know we thought down below in the comments section again apologies there were no videos over the weekend I'll sort that out as we go and the more the better content I can do thank you so much for watching don't forget drive safe
