God it feels good to be back on this account ah welcome back everybody to out-grand unlock as you can see 50 fletching just coming in here another reason we are fledging is I need 58 fletching so that we can make a mithril crossbow and emerald bolts e we're also three levels away from 850 total so that means we will get a chunk in three levels time we're going to get that while fletching obviously because we still need eight levels the reason I'm doing all of this is because I want to kill the giant mole today for the main reason that for the boss kill we get a chunk for the mole claw we get a chunk and for the mole skin we get a chunk as well says three chunks there if we can get one kill of the mole we did try it before and the dog machine crossbow just wasn't good enough so the emerald bolts he will poison him and that should get us the kill we've got a bit of a grind here and unfortunately haven't unlocked any maple tree in our unlocked area while we're talking about the area I might as well show you it but yeah we have unlocked any maple trees so I have to stick with the Willows and that's gonna be out route 258 fletching so this is currently what we have unlocked out of the whole map let me go through it for those of you who've forgotten bit of the wilderness but obviously we don't want to go in there because we're a hardcore and if we die lose 10 of those chunks and starting to open up the canvas which is really nice we can go over there well we get our agility to a decent level we can start training around there so that's very nice most of varrock except the ground exchange is all opened up Edgeville starting to open up towards birth orb we got tabla falador and tirana Remington pretty much all of the free to play area is now opened unfortunately still haven't got that shanty pass unlocked so we can't enter the desert yeah we got this side jewelry no clan wars not really too helpful for us Bittaker I'm just starting to open up as well and that is pretty much it to be honest guys but I'm hoping we can get like five maybe six chunks this episode and start expanding out to the members areas 57 wood cutting just came in which means we have hit 850 total level which means we go ahead and open up a new chunk of the map hopefully we're gonna get something interesting let's go ahead and do it here we go guys let's open this up not gonna be useful for now but if we can get 34 unlocked we can start getting to catherby that is 54 fletching coming in which means we can now make the mithril crossbow for more levels and then we can go ahead and make the emerald bolts that is 60 woodcutting coming in there we go that is the last log of the grind if we go ahead and make all of these into willow longbow so that has gonna be 58 fletching coming in it's taking a long time but being able to use the emerald bolt e's are gonna be huge in terms of killing the mole and killing future things as well so it's a grind that needed to happen and there we go 58 fletching coming in you can now make emerald tipped mithril bolts let's go ahead and buy all the stuff we need to get our myth crossbow together and then we need to go and get ourselves some myth bolts together we need to kill a cow so we can make our crossbow string and there we go and then if we trade with hunter here we go he should have a maple stalk there we go a maple stalk the mithril limbs and then if we use the raw beef on here to make some sinew we are very very close to getting our myth crossbow together right so let's use the stock on there to make a unstrung crossbow and then let's use the sinew on here to make crossbow string use the crossbow string on the myth crossbow and there we go we have ourselves a mithril crossbow wow that took a long time but we finally got it right now we need to go and kill some chaos druids what I was gonna do was gonna get my smithing up to 50 and then go from 50 to 53 to make mithril crossbow bolts but as of right now I'd rather just get the kill get the mold kill so ya gonna quickly go and kill the cows druids get like 3040 myth bolts together and then we'll tip them and enchant them and then we'll go and get our mole kill there we go there's our first myth bolts didn't take too long we've currently killed 14 cows druids so yeah really not too bad and we're also getting also some herbs together and hopefully some more heads for when we unlock that area of the world right now it's the first inventory done got ourselves 17 myth robots together I do want 3240 probably more more like 40 to be honest because we aren't going to hit the mall very often and also the fact that we physically cannot do animal magnetism I don't have the Ava's accumulator so we are gonna have to pick up all the bolts and really look after them I mean this is just gonna be getting the kill so we get the two chunks from it because other than that this is just gonna be such a waste of how long it takes to actually get these bolts together there we go guys that is gonna be all that we need we actually got 65 mithril bowls together so I'm very very happy with that have an awesome trip on that last trip I've got a load of herbs as well actually did get a few levels and just passively sort of made hubs in two potions while I went to the bank and we probably got quite a bit of XP bank now as well so we might be able to get this like closer towards 30 with all of the things that we got but anyway it is time to cut our emeralds and put them on top on the mithril bolts and then go and take on the mall one chunk for killing emboss and then the mole also drops to uniques as well in the mole skin and the mole claws right she's gonna get three chunks just from killing the mole it's gonna be huge so if we go ahead and make our emeralds into the tips here I think I'll just make like enough for these bolts and I'll leave the rest because we might need the emeralds for some reason or other so I'm not gonna go ahead and make all of these we'll probably do one more there we go and let's put these onto here this is what all the works been for so we could do this beautiful 55 fletching per one as well I'm not bad XP and then we need to go ahead and grab ourselves out cosmic and air runes I do believe I have cosmics yes we do beautiful and a few airs as well and let's go ahead and do that oh god oh my god I've got so worried that we need to crossbow bolt enchant there we go that should do it you don't have enough nature in stochastics bail okay all right let's grab some nature's out I don't really know how this works anymore because you can't really there used to be a menu but it doesn't tell you what you need anymore but there we go we got everything we need 60 Emerald bolts now those of you that don't know what the do first of all great range strength compared to the bow bolts we were using but what they do go ahead and do is they have a 50% chance of poisoning your target so you pretty much just constantly keep poisoning the target and it does a tick of 5 damage every 15 seconds on top of what you're doing because when we were killing mold before we were getting it down to 100 HP because we could just say spy it but then because we don't have found or hard done and because we don't have stamina and we don't have things that make more easy he was just digging holes every time and it was taking like 20-30 minutes to get it down to like 80 HP it I don't think it was possible to kill them all it might take like three hours or something which I wasn't gonna waste my time on we might as well have done the fletching grind what this is gonna do is mean the mole is just gonna keep getting poisoned even when it's running away from me and digging into the ground so we'll constantly be doing dps on it meaning that we will just get it down even if it just means it's the poison that kills it and obviously we're gonna hit a lot harder with the mid crossbow and emerald bolts II compared to the bone crossbow on the bow bolts so let's go ahead and do it let's kill mole right so this is what we go in for this is our setup I could have upgraded the leather body to a studded body but I'm have to get to barrel and to be honest I don't think the +6 range is gonna do any difference because we are relying on the Emerald bolts here to get us to kill with the poison a little bit of lobster we got everything we need to get into the actual mole pit and then we have the teleports as well oh here we go on the hardcore on the hardcore the first boss we're gonna kill let's go for it remember we do not have a neighbors so we are gonna struggle with these bolts I want to keep them as close together as possible and we really need to see a hit so that I can actually get that poison start to tick oh god we are not hitting there we go and the poison as well we got the speck that's that little worse or bubbly thing going on round it so it is now poisoned loving that but we are not hitting at all there's the poison good stuff poisoned again I have again about 50% poison this so I pee hitting okay as well now I think we just started off quite badly well I don't want to take too many hits but we really need to get these bolts back okay cool beautiful okay he's gonna start dipping very soon there we go I'm gonna start dipping now there's the first one let's grab up the bolts let's get these all together and as I was saying he's getting poison right now so we're still doing DPS on him every 15 seconds which is helpful obviously we don't have stammers we don't have the fired or hard done so we have no idea where he is but he's gonna keep going that damage which is gonna be huge there we go see this hits back straight through there and we can probably safe spot him here as well I would expect so spot here he's run it saving the run in case I get into any trouble or I just want to run and hit him go on have a hit have a hit get out of there come on he's on a three tick poison now oh come on come on that's a very poisonous a reposing weari poison dibs back up to a five beautiful oh my God look at him look in he's nearly dead the poison pretty much got him can we just finish him does the poison gonna do I think the poisons gonna do it you know what I love the poison to do it I love the poison to do it poison take it away there's the for what it needs for more in this for more come on come on here no man hit one more poison tick should do it I think that's gonna kill it don't there we go thanks very much for playing oh my god yes I would get a little strength as well I think I already have one on the account there we go there we go now I'm going to show you why and how we're calculating all of these unique things that open chunks up but there's gonna be three chunks unlocked but boom there we go joint mulk he'll count one first boss on the account done absolutely love that do I have without me little strength I think I might I think I might what is it for maybe not 49 I might not have one I'm gonna have to go and check that that could be huge if we just got an am little strength as well did we have an amulet of strength we didn't that's a massive upgrade oh that is amazing absolute you'd love to see that we had the Ruby amia that's why I was confused we had to read the amulet but we didn't actually have the magic level yet to to make it so we've got that like 10 magic levels early very nice and then this is how we are calculating unique drops so any unique drop from a boss is a chunk unlocked and the way we're doing it is using the collection log so if we go and find the giant mul as you can see we have a unique there and a unique there so the only other unique we could get from a giant mole is the pet which would be another chunk but we also got the chunk for killing a boss as well so that's one chunk two chunks three chunks bang let's go and open them up right here we go guys three chunks to open the first one where we're gonna go Oh Schatzi pass access to the Desa I mean we don't really have much open at the moment but that's still sick I'm more than happy with that okay chunk number two I mean good cuz we need to get the fire came at some point but like for now we're definitely not ready we just struggled with the bloody bowl so I yeah I'll take it though and the last of the three where we're gonna go oh yes burthorpe yes we can now continue slayer because we currently got an earth warrior's task and I need to skip it because I'm not going to the wheel D on the hardcore so we can go to toriel now and he can give us a new task oh that is awesome absolutely awesome you know what I'm chuffed with those three I'm absolutely chuffed with those three I'll take them all day long well those chunks were absolutely awesome I'm very very happy with pretty much all of them to be honest and shanty pass and the t'as are they're both probably gonna be used later on in the account because obviously you know they're a little bit in the shanty doesn't have anything and the TAS are at the moment isn't it really something that worries us but it's something we're gonna need later on for the fire cape and to try and get some of those cesare weapons and shield and obby cape that good stuff if I want to go for it what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna trade in all of the parts so that we can give ourselves some useful stuff because none of this is actually useful on an iron man so let's go ahead and do it because I serves a ring and ring get ourselves a snap if I can see Wow and we're gonna have to just bank this yeah I currently have the ring of life on so I can't just wear that we have to bank this to see what this last one's gonna be but that is 81 K they're worth a seed enjoy the rest of the video here we go and it is a limp wet seed okay very very nice that is gonna be useful for when we start the farming grind I need to sort of get on this farming grind to be honest I need to start doing that what I'm gonna go ahead and do now is try and get 55 magic four high alchemy cos as you can see all those long bows that I did I have 430 3k worth of willow longbows if we alcohol of them and 17k worth of the willow short bows and obviously we can buy chunks with money and that was explained at the start of the video so if we go ahead and do all that we're gonna be able to buy a load of chunks we're gonna have so much money as well because I'm definitely not going to put a load of money into opening chunks just maybe a fourth of it or something like that so 55 magic would be absolutely huge so let's go ahead and do that 55 magics gonna take some time we're gonna need some startup cash hopefully I can get some together only on 4k at the moment but yeah that is the plan so I'm currently selling a load of stuff off up to 13 case still got like some addy plate legs to sell so a little bit more cash will be on the account but what we're doing is we're just getting out roots together I also bought that studded body for the extra range bonus while I was here and we are gonna grab ourselves we need to our runes for every mined rune there we go that's a decent amount of costs for now that's we're gonna go ahead and do is we're gonna be using fire strike so we're gonna using fire strike I'll probably do Slayer with it just to get the Slayer level up at the same time because we are approaching that eight seven five total which would be another chunk I'll sell the rest of these bits off then I will use the mini-game teleport to get to burthorpe and we will get a task off toriel yeah you're assigned to kill earth warriors no we don't want to do that so let's sort this out I need another assignment and no I want to take a task from you still hunting earth warriors although it's not an assignment that I normally give I guess I can give you a new assignment yes please mate so we are gonna reset our streak here but it is what I need to go and do cuz I'm not going into the wilderness I know there's a low chance I would have been killed but it's just not worth it on this series it's not worth dying stupidly 15 cave slimes let's go into right let's go and grab a task hopefully we can mage this one what are we getting sixty-one kalphite yeah I will go ahead and make that I think they are pretty susceptible to mage yeah level one mage so let's go ahead add them so I'm probably not gonna finish my task here at Californians I'm probably just going to do it over at the workers but we're gonna use all these runes and just see how many levels we can get off killing these guys they drop a decent amount of stuff as well including more runes so we could get our money back and hopefully we can profit they do drop a few rune items as well so that's the plan and this is gonna be a bit of a grind so I think this is probably quite a good time to end the video and I'll see you in the next video with 55 magic and then we'll get to getting ourselves those high outs getting ourselves in nature in together and then making a load of money so we can unlock some new stuff thank you so much for watching guys don't forget to
