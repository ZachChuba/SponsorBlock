episode two of my pvp locked hardcore iron man i haven't played since the last episode because solo mission put out a 250mm bounty on his own pvp hardcore man and i've been scared i'm gonna get caught up in the crossfire of those hunting him but it's time to man up here the stats it's time to make some progress first goal i'm locking the bone crossbow i see an iron man we're gonna go for it oh god no he's definitely gonna get in i'm hitting nothing zero please be afk or something now he's good damn it he even said oh i've just logged in to buy wines there's already another hardcarm and scout sitting here and i'm a level three scout sitting here if i die buying wines it is what it is dude yup there's a level 52 there's a level 52 oh my god okay we really have to be careful don't we all right level 52 goes coming for you dinner i'm with the ego i have i go you're not doing [ __ ] he drops ahaha and wishes me good luck we'll see you later sir oh my god the scout's following me to this world but what i can do is because i've got overheads i can literally just pray arranged i won't die to the debo i can buy jugs of wine like that off your order three red berries achieved two onions two world leaves all right a bunch of people south but i just need my dyes right now um yellow dye mix those we get ourselves orange dye now we can do go do goblin diplomacy teleporting into falador once again oh my god there's people holy [ __ ] goblin diplomacy done we can't start the lost tribe after getting 17 mining i think it is but i want to go do druidic ritual and then dig site first every time i go past one of these house teleports there's a chance that c engineer is looking at me through the skyrim or the skyrim portal i don't know what you call it basically that thing in your house that lets you see the teleports before you go to the teleport which is why going past these ties is very scary i know he's always looking at them so even if he's not here he can see me but we need to buy some raw meat beef raw chicken raw rat meat and we're all bear meat we're gaming and just after i finished buying all my meat at level 4 logs in interesting teleporting into falador or live oh my god bro i was so slow with that one i was so slow i didn't even remember i was okay i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna drag over my screen what i was looking at i was banging out some drake i don't know if i'm going to get copyright for this and that level 32 with a debo could have pumped me what the [ __ ] okay so i'm trying to think how i can safely get the taverley teleporting to falador and going through that way isn't going to work somehow they're going to figure out i'm going that way because that level 32 just did so what i'm thinking about is i'm going to home teleport to lumbridge i'm going to use this glider here to white wolf mountain and oh i just want a white knights castle that's not a good map and then i can run east and then i can go start a druidic ritual like that so i won't be going past taverley dungeon i think this might work okay running out from lumbridge i'm going to pray mage because i can also get one hit by volatile nightmare stars which is a scary thing to think about but so far so okay glidering to white wolf mountain i'm pretty sure these wolves can kill me so i'm going to be using some prayer here okay the plan worked we can start judah ritual okay we got attacked around this spot last time so we need to be careful i'm really scared that someone's just going to be waiting down the ladder and one hit me but now we're chilling okay if that doesn't happen we're good i think we're good for this part now okay and that is judith ritual done nice just gonna buy some herb or supplies as i will need them eventually there's a guy exactly my level just standing here waiting for me to step out okay we have four grounds from earlier but that's obviously not going to be enough to get ourselves to 10 herbal for dig sites so we are going to have to do jungle potion which should hopefully get us there i don't really know all right we got to four almost five hurdler just use a lot of cash going to brim haven for this quest okay i haven't seen his soul while coming here so i think we should be do good doing this quest let's start jungle pushing incredibly slow with his helper once again luckily that guy was out of my combat range and i panicked teleported to varrock there was someone else there who's outside of my combat range that could have gone very bad and i'm gonna have to blame it on kendrick lamar oh my god dude [ __ ] hell that was scary okay considering i last logged out at camelot instead of teleport to lumbridge and risk getting scouted there i'm just oh okay i've just got scouted here awesome kind of scared not gonna lie okay and that is jungle potion dawn did it get us 10 9 herb lore i'm seven her blur off okay maybe we can figure this out okay i have three marientos in the back surely this gets me to ten hurbler right okay we're at town here before we can do the dick side on the level three is locked in level 64. okay we're chilling but that was scary did he teleport out he went into a easter egg or something so i've been informed that pvp hardcore iron mans like myself have actually been scouted by people tracking our xp to see what we're doing and what we're doing next so i've just got 10 herb where people can see that they're going to assume i'm going to go do dig site so what i'm actually going to do now is do this history quiz which is going to give me 9 hunter and 9th slayer i need to do this eventually anyway and then i'm going to re-log out and then maybe that will throw people off the trail and think i'm doing something else and then i can go to dick's side nine hunter nine slayer and this should throw the pkrs off the scent hopefully oh my god what what just happened dude i literally just did this museum place and this guy is here with a dfs killing some guy he can't hit me but i don't know if he can hit a 41 but i'm pretty sure prey mage stops me from getting hit right okay i don't really think my master plan worked out as i thought because the guy with the dfs has seen me do i don't know what he was doing to be fair but i think i'm just gonna risk it to be honest we're gonna carry on i literally just hopped out to a different world at a fighter level 20 hardcore about who goes imma put you down brother enjoy it while it lasts and i am logging off for the day bye i lied let's do this okay and that is the dig site done getting us more money and her blur xp didn't run into any problems so i think wiz khalifa may be the solution to our questing needs oh you guys saw that didn't you i think that was solo mission he always sends me clips of him specking people out on the volatile nightmare stuff account all right i'm 99 sure that solo mission because he's always sending me clips on him on a volatile nightmare stuff peers specking people out on pvp worlds trying to get me i don't know if i can show the clips or not but i can tell you that it's him because that's public information but i'm very scared now and i don't know what to do so this solar mission guy who has a pvp hardcore iron man of his own who died for his 250 ml bounty already sends me a message congrats on dig site quest you know i'm not gonna lie gets me a little bit spooked now i want to go do the lost tribe and i need a candle for that go to camelot go to catherby buy candle and he messages me i hope that candle you bought smells nice i'm scared okay i just logged back in there's a level three here i'm just going to pray mage because we have to get this done i need to do lost tribe bro level 46 like how do they do it some guy called supe's monitor i swear annie chucked the tb at me bro i literally logged on for barely half a second to start the quest and this guy finds me welcome back to tv4 wild sitter ah i'd literally log dog for two seconds to start lost tribe dude it's supe's monitor aka the brother which means i finally ran into c engineer hello mr c engineer i'll be seeing you soon buddy i'm gonna try and sound intimidating with that but honestly i have no plan i'm logging out of here bro i'll see you guys in three weeks peace okay the only way i can think of doing parts of this quest without constantly being found is by doing some of the quests that i can do in the lumbridge area like moving around and [ __ ] in a free-to-play world and only hop into the play-to-play world for the actual part of the quest if someone's waiting for me here though i can just get one hit if they figure out this is what i'm doing so it is a little bit risky but i'm hoping it might work that is the last tribe done i had no idea just spawned me there ready to get attacked by anyone i probably shouldn't just be running out like this pretty mage but we're fine okay i want to get the range training started but i only have 2k cash which isn't enough to do anything so i'm gonna head back to the pyramid which is extremely risky since i was there last episode and if i get hit there i'm pretty much dead but we're gonna go do it anyway we need some gp damn it bro there's a level 18 scout here [ __ ] i'ma just do it dude i have to okay i really need to go for a poo and i'm out of water skins so we're gonna stay with 40k that should be enough for uh for now we're just gonna hometally out of here okay so before the range training can start i need to do two risky things or maybe three i need to go buy the bone crossbow because i didn't do that earlier and i need to go to mage bank to stock up on law runes because i've only got six of them and then i need to go buy ranged stuff to train to 28 range so i can actually use the boom crossbow um i'm already in lumbridge so let's do that first actually i need food i have three jugs of wine so that's the first thing we need to do sorry okay we bought 3.75 k boom balls for now the cash deck's at 25k there should be enough for now we're not even 28 range yet so we need to go do that oak short bow willow short bow and we're just gonna buy like i don't know a lot of bronze arrows okay i'm not sure how much xp like 1.2 k arrows will be but hopefully it's enough to get us to 28 range not only can i get hit by level 111 right now i can also get hit by a level three this [ __ ] is scary all right we're at 15.6k cash and 35 law runs that'll have to do for now i need a ranged training spot for while i'm one range and i found this place which has two men upstairs and i'm literally just going to kill these men with my bow and in order to trade my range they do drop some herbs here and there so hopefully it can get us with my serves first easy clue i'm not even going to show what it is because i may want to do it and i don't want you guys to know where it is so i actually got loads of progress done and got myself in a much safer position before uploading my first episode so that no one would have been hunting me but i decided to try and keep it as authentic as possible sort of like how c engineer did a series so every time you see a new video that is all the progress i've made so far i haven't done more training and have it saved for a future video or anything like that this also means it'll be easier to track the progress i've made so far and it'll be a lot easier for me to die you don't what's the difference between an easy clue scroll and a beginner clue scroll okay these are all the herbs i got from one inventory of men and i'm at 15 range this is very this is the scary part running back to the bank with 11 hp no food 20 range yeah another inventory done we're currently at watts 22 almost 23 range we're still stacking up the herbs another inventory downward 26 range we have finally unlocked the bone crossbow and i know that considering my pvm ability this may come as a shock to you guys but i will be attempting this fire cape with the same crossbow i'm wearing right now obviously not a 28 range it may not seem like i got a lot done in this episode but the two main things i needed before the fight caves were a bone crossbow and prayer pots and just from training a little bit of range i've already got myself 14 runner weeds i don't want to say too much about the future plans yet as i'm getting hunted quite a bit if you've watched this video but the next video should have us in a great position to attempt the fight caves if you guys have enjoyed this video please leave a like and subscribe if you are new once again comment down below any ideas or suggestions you have for me going forward as for a bounty for killing this account let me try and get the fire tape first then we'll see what the future holds
