these cell juniors are not terrifying toddlers they're both those cutest buttons but despite this I think their father is about to have an excel stencil crisis [Music] hey guys massacre X here it's quite clear that if you've been hanging around this channel for at least a little while that one of the biggest tropes that has come about from all these videos all these what-ifs I've been doing for the past nearly three years is the notion that characters who were once bad can become good while that may be true it is actually a common trope within the entirety of Dragonball it's just that I decided to take it up a notch and use the narrative element of characters that will rarely suppose it to be good or they could do and then construct a world around them they start off simply turning their allegiance to somebody else namely the dragon team and then there soon enough there's a whole new world around them which evolved from one choice being made and that is why I love what ifs each interpretation of the same question is different no to what ifs are the same so I encourage you all out there to do the same thought experiment with this question that we are now entering the tenth part of what if cell turned good fyt is being white t then some of you may not have had the chance to understand what we're going on about here this might be the first video that you stumbled upon you probably are wondering how cell could possibly ever turn good he's got too much freezer to tone down after all well yes that is indeed true the version of cell that we are perusing today is another one a construct from the remnants of Jarosz lab off the back of the decision to not blow up the sub lab and prototype cell and instead take it to their local bomber for them to check out and possibly use in the future so it's a cell it's just not V cell but stay tuned to see if the original cell finds out about this guy this good boy in our midst came from the powers of nurturing over a capsule Corp and like a certain blub-blub from the world's strongest abridged he was made for hugs and lots premium now thank you for listening in the last pot our version of cell which we call good boy 21 and had a pretty hectic ton of it after his universe 6 tournament adventures against the likes of hit our good boy 21 felt a little bit incomplete and aimless something that was pretty unusual for him many would think it weird because he seemed so carefree and as a result of all of this malaise he then decided to do something to create some offspring he took himself away into the mountains for a good long time after a particularly long period of educating himself in the art of raising children he managed to produce two kids of his own mightor and Kandra now let that name pun sink in for a moment yeah you get it together with their father the three of them fully established the dojo as the true powerhouse of the cell literally calling the dojo the powerhouse however as the two of them were being formally introduced to the group a phone call came stating that Future Trunks is back in the past and he was looking a little bit worse for wear this then led to 21 not realizing who this is and that the group had really slacked in telling him about his other version the original cell so we will get to that chestnut today but I felt like that we only got to see a little bit of mightor and Kandra so I'm gonna do a slight little retcon here but the same things after that still play out during these introductions mightor and Kandra were pretty shy but mightor was the first one to approach Android 18 you're on my ante right says the little version of 21 with a rather timid tone everybody then looks trying to at 18 not sure how she will react to this creature given her turbulent history with their father her brother for a moment things are tense but then something happens which is unusual surprising many of them this question is able to elicit a small smile from a teen who not slowly and then introduces mightor to her now cousin maren the two instantly become friends they hit it off instantly much to their parents the light especially 21 just growing oh that was a close one Kandra has some more problems with his introductions but Goten and Trunks are the ones that get him from behind his father and begin to entertain little boy he is very energetic bombers rather fascinated with the two asking 21 how he was able to produce offspring that has such notable differences as opposed to the original version who didn't the original cell as we all know was only able to create smaller identical copies of himself which didn't seem to have that much of a different personality to his they were basically clones 21 explains that mightor and Kandra had some limited input in how they developed it's pretty strange but after some careful thought and as of yet unknown skills that Jareau had yet to have discovered himself psychometric physiology changes was actually possible in this construct in some sort of way 21 deduces that the other guy was probably pretty vain and merely tried to have an army of himself all 21 wanted to give his children as much freedom as their genetic code would allow them in terms of shaping their looks speaking of looks after talking with mightor for a couple of hours mara is really getting to know what mitre is like all this new external stimulus for this mightor brings out what her personality is all about as only so much you can talk about when it's just your dad and your brother and they don't really know much about the world it seems like the only thing that might have tends to regret about a decided look is that she doesn't have any hair since you can create such wonderful designs with such a thing but Maya is not left wanting it looks it doesn't really bother her she's got plenty of pride in herself she really enjoys reading from what books her dad was able to collect and find and when she finds out that Gohan has a huge huge room full of these things Mitra's left misty eyed with wonderment Kandra on the other hand whilst not spending time with his sister bonds with Goten and Trunks trunks obviously tries his fighting skills almost as soon as they're introduced to try and size up Kandra and is really surprised about how much potential the little guy has the new kid has got something but hey since he is the new kid trunks decides to impose upon himself the role of chondros mentor because Kandra needs somebody around here to show him the ropes act like a big brother after all he did train conjurus father after all back in the day he chooses to ignore the fact that most of that time has spent playing with him this gets Kandra just as excited as might as desire for books meanwhile there is still one issue that 21 has to overcome before they can resume their malady with the gang they need a house like a proper one not just sleeping on the form of the powerhouse it's a dojo it's not a bedroom and first he plans to ask mr. Sutton for help but he doesn't want to take advantage of the man's hospitality anymore even though his children start to call him uncle Marquis and want him to listen to the stories of how he defeated sell and in moments like this 21 wonders just how many of his memories his children inherited question for later right now though this introduction couldn't have gone better 21 is relieved and again I decided to extend the time that mightor and Kandra were acquainted with the gang unlike the last part because have a look and I wanted to give you some sort of idea about what personalities Kandra and mightor had yeah before we actually then jumped into the original timeline arm as well as giving 21 a slight vision of his future now he got him what he wanted it's gonna be good however the idyllic thoughts get interrupted by a very sudden appearance of a mysterious machine next a capsule call and that infamous call to bomber that we talked about in the last part Goten trunks maite and Kandra are the first ones on the scene to investigate and they find Future Trunks who is on the ground next to his machine and thinks that he is hallucinating in his first act he turns to face the group of four small kid-like figures and mistakes them the cell juniors thanks to the fact that two of these beings really look like them I mean you can't blame the guy he's in a daze he sees than like this and in said days he tries to attack the kids then looking visibly confused and weirded out 21 comes to help which only makes things worse for obvious reasons chunk spots the taller figure and this guy this guy is definitely cell there's no doubt about it you know the big crown on his head no no there's nothing taking that trunks rushes him to attack gaining a second wind not noticing goat in the child trunks the two have an impressive duel 2100 offensive but still in control given the fact that trunks is in a pretty major frenzy and not really knowing what he's doing when it becomes clear that trunks is tiring out 21 tries to convince the future boy that he is not the bad guy here he is not who he think he is trunks is adamant that he's lying but help is on the way thankfully because luckily Vegeta hears all this ruckus going on and senses two power levels duking it out for some reason he gets there in time to inform Future Trunks that 21 is not the enemy this version despite looking eerily similar to perfect cell is nothing like the other beasts Future Trunks stops but since he does stop all the adrenaline that he was pumping just gives out and he collapses in a tired slump he has taken to capture court where he's given a sense of being and a chance to get his bearings now that he's back in the past having traveled from the future it's been a while since he last done this so he needs some time to acclimatize he is slowly introduced to everyone again including mightor and Kandra the kids by now are pretty scared of him because of what happened but 21 doesn't seem to hold any sort of grudge towards him office in the handshake trying to show his kids that this man didn't mean to hurt him he's not all that bad he can't be Trunks reluctantly returns the handshake and here's that 21 really admires him and always wanted to meet him the bug man is able to defuse the situation enough that trunks doesn't attack Goku when he appears but Milly gasps at his sight Goku blacks influence is there but trunks has now since to calm down enough to act reasonably he starts to warn everyone about a new evil from the future but miter and Condors mind are focused on something else of all the things that trunks has been saying they then approached their father and asked him a hard question daddy why did you tell us that this cell guy was like us that's a good question 21 doesn't really know all he knew were the basics about cell you know the real core facts that he was once an enemy like to show off how perfect he was and that dr. Shiro created him he only knew the basics didn't know the nuances it never really occurred to him to find out the whole truth about how cell found himself in this timeline 21 then walks up to trunks and asks trunks tell me how did the other me get here what happened trunks looks 221 and can tell that this guy is not playing him he genuinely doesn't know the look of concern very evident he tells him what he knew and what perfect cell told him the fact that multiverse theory is not all that's cracked up to be 21 and the kids are stumped they didn't realize that cell was that cruel nor did 21 know that his other self had off this Future Trunks the others hadn't told him that bit this leaves the three of them looking very despondent almost feeling guilty soul-searching are they capable of doing the same thing again these are questions for later because all of this chitchat has caused something eerie to appear on top of the sky Goku black has arrived and the gang quickly vacate the room and move outside to see the future dark version of Goku looming over them all like in the original Goku and Goku black have their fight but then something happens Goku black finds himself staring at 21 of the kids there's something about them which this body of his remembers it's enough to intrigue him but also enough to distract him and Goku is able to get a couple of extra blows on to black before the time distortion pulls him back into the future and this time around also the time machine isn't destroyed 21 had his eyes fixed on black and managed to quickly shoot a key blast and knocked Goku blacks attack out of the way but it still caused a massive crater nearby which sees the Time Machine topple into it still damaging it but not nearly as much as before oops black curses this beast and vows to destroy him should he return the two look at each other one more time before black disappears into the time matrix goku looks to 21 and asks what that was all about 21 looks serious I don't know I just felt his icy stare piercing to me like he knew me or felt something but how 21 then thinks back to what trunks had told him and it clicks black must have mistook him for perfect cell clearly there must have been a pretty major thing to have happened to Goku did it happen to the Goku here say Goku I've never really asked you but was so that much of a influence on you Goku turns around well sure he was he was pretty strong and I had to go all-out against him and it led me to sacrificing myself whoever that guy is remembers you and also probably didn't expect to see you here 21 books up to the sky determined even more so to not be like his other self and he will aid trunks instead of being his enemy and that's where we're going to be leaving things for right now so what do you guys think do you think that 21 will do the job all the kids get involved in their own way leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
