[Music] [Music] welcome to rust today we're going to be playing on my server blue lagoon and this isn't the solo duo trio this is the main server and as you can see all these naked's they're they're fresh spawning and they're running the gauntlet to the middle of the map to start the wipe because it just wiped just now we're gonna be playing with spicy and ella plays today and you know the plan is to just you know pvp make a base maybe get online rated uh yeah it's gonna be [ __ ] nuts so let's get it dude how how do i get the first person who says [ __ ] you and then n word dude listen listen listen guys uh we need to figure out where we're gonna build airfield launch train yeah that area look at the iceland that's that's so big though like i don't know if we need that much space we could do like hmm like l13 or something that's what i was thinking yeah it doesn't look too shabby yeah i'm at r18 right now uh same same same i'm at the supermarket jump check i see you this is me right here you're all on why you did a team nice shrug dude thanks oh nice that's huge oh more circuits so it was wipe day and like i said i was playing with ella plays and spicy i met up with ella pretty fast and immediately we got a bunch of sewing kits from some barrels we took those sewing kits to a recycler and headed to bandicam to meet up with spicy hello hello man hello man while we were there we got some wood and combined our metal frags to make a few crossbows these would be game changing early in the wipe [Music] shoot him what is he doing oh my god hit him this is like a really good spot but i don't know how close we can build not very close it looks like what up here be fine up there let's see not too bad okay yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna slap it down up here i think we found the location now we just had to get to building [Music] with the starter base down we were free to go pvp does anyone want boners i already have one good one please cut that oh my god i need a hammer to pick up my bat so dumb so dumb that's probably one of the dumbest things face punch has done in a while dude you need to remove car parts out of your server [Music] someone's on me someone's on me [Music] hit him i need some help he should be dead yeah he's dead i was going to say 45 oh he's loaded and it was beamed eight guys in one clip i don't stand all day when i what the hell look there's a base right there i couldn't even build that close i can't see anyone all i see is darkness instead they might come out of that base the two by two i'm gonna throw just like a couple of things in the recycler it's really just sewing kits i have four four sewing kits here he's coming out maybe we should just go to base i hit him he hit me though wow that's some crazy prediction wait there's someone here hit him headshot one in doorway he might be dead he's tagged on me oh three pushing three pushing yeah i'm dipping on our way back from airfield we noticed a two by two got set up in the middle of the night we weren't exactly excited about them moving in so when morning came we headed down to introduce them to the neighborhood right yeah he's got a jacket oh it's all open dude yeah i'm gonna start breaking bags yeah in the in the rocks dudes two more these kids it's another group guys if we have like an ioka or something we could break the store and then get in yeah i can't reach that i'm gonna run around the right side once one's running towards airfield he's kind of kidding hit him again how is he not done of course i got him i'm gonna get him i hit him i think oh he's dead i think no way a wall on the wall of the left yes 111 meters dude we should go we should go check the first two bodies yeah i need a lot of handmaids what are you breaking this wooden door it's only one door and there's one more bag on the outside it doesn't even matter yeah exactly we need to start smelting sulfur if we can knock a neighbor out this early it would save us a lot of trouble so we took this opportunity to hold it down and try and get in a second he's spawning there he's spawning there [Music] are we trying to place the second door i think it's like 15. he's dead again all right start breaking yeah start sorting it too guys does someone else want to go while i heal [Music] little one for two guys uh coming from mining outpost kitted just keep going keep going keep going keep going i shot him [Music] had shot hit someone [Music] i shot him tagged him he's dead he's not nice nice keep going keep going keep going yeah yeah door's gotta break okay i'm coming coming keep going come on nice going what's up [Music] naked coming up these kids are stabbed oh damn oh yeah this was worth for sure the raid was well worth it not only did we minimize the competition in the area but we also got a bunch of loot from it but those shots brought some attention and a fight broke out i have two full kids pushing me three full kits oh no yeah i we need to go help him but i'm super low once tagged oh there's four don't come out don't come out yeah don't come out they all have bone arrows that's so funny i'm ready gonna fire you yeah let's do it let's see is that mine yeah yeah yeah i see them i see them i want though there was four for sure yeah i see three maybe more hit one hit one oh there's one right on me tagged one tag one the one on you tag one on roof tag tagged on route two i'm dead i'm dead i hit that guy i tagged one tagged one okay good trade good trade we'll kill them i'm heading back i'm almost there [Music] dude i'm good there's so many they came back they live really close [Music] what the [ __ ] where did i just die missed hashtag beamer just as we thought we secured the area for ourselves another group showed up they had at least four or five people there and we knew they lived close because of how fast they got back knowing this we had to cut our losses but during some downtime i made the external tc's to our base just so we couldn't get griefed and while i finished up with that ella and spicy were recycling at the mining outpost when they started getting jumped so i went to go help i just got double hit behind the wall that is oh i can't that the yoyo get one down hit one down there's so many full kill them hit one [Music] how do they see me dude um i'm gonna be dead here yeah i'm dead most of them were still alive but we were able to tag them a lot of times winning this fight was still possible it won he's died to a wolf that's funny what's outside coming back tires he's living by the tires outside i assume hit him hit him again dead one more one more dude he ran into the rocks i need help here anyone yeah hit him i just got hit nice huge get another one below dead oh my god they're so [ __ ] loaded dude they're here they're here again they're here again they're one of them's full naked one of them ran into the back entrance one headshot dead he's dead they're all dead then this guy's loaded man would you look at that it's missed beamer again this time around we got the best of them but we weren't gonna let it stop there we wanted to find where they lived we knew it had to be close and judging by the direction they came back from it was likely to the south before we went exploring though we were running out of box room so i quickly expanded the base a bit to incorporate more storage then we headed south uh c3 right in front of me i see four there's three more four four four four four more i'm coming and there's one in this piece he's dead other what's going on oh my god i don't yo 225 scrap on this guy we gotta go that's nice oh my god i need some help [Music] oh i'm still gonna die here there's like literally no chances oh my god he's got a rock i got a water pipe [Music] oh we need that we need that i don't want to walk like we thought they lived close but we were not expecting in such a small base it seemed too good to be true but whether they lived there or not it looked greased up so we grabbed some handmade shells and quickly went back i don't even hear them in here they might still be on timers i killed them all i think that we should just start hitting it red oh oh yeah it's 5 36 scrap nice i cleared it i cleared it oh my god this was so worth [ __ ] dude nice put on codelock uh we should probably break this guy said he said he lives in this uh one by two right up here sealed dude wow we've done like barely any farming like literally all of our farm is coming from these kind of bases dude this is insane two hours into the wipe and we've already wiped out two enemies both of which had loaded bases but while we were having a good wipe so were a lot of other people so we decided to move away from primitive weapons and start making tier 1 guns what the hell is going on over here [Music] one of the front doors open oh they they they [ __ ] they broke tc they burped you see [Music] i shot a hedgehog dude there's a lot there's a lot [Music] there's three more in there oh my god you guys are so deep holy [ __ ] man it's shaggy they're trying to place the door on top i know i need some help i'm dead [ __ ] ass [ __ ] i think they just got straight to tc why is there so many kids [Music] this guy got a flamethrower [Music] um i just got a sar where on this dead body right here headshot another yeah headshot this guy chase me he's dead i got pumpy too i got the pump dude i just got sar flamethrower db what the [ __ ] how did that just happen luck pretty much right place right time so seemingly all of those pump shots was a group blasting a tool cupboard on some other group's base anyways i guess a fight happened after because i found one of the raiders dead bodies with a sar getting that research was huge it's easily the best gun for early to mid game so i immediately ditched revolvers and crafted us a few thanks for tuning in guys now enjoy the rest of the video before roaming with sars we noticed a huge compound popped up near our base with active furnaces so we went to go check it out do you have two ladders in a building yep i do do you know the way i want to go i haven't even really looked at it yet dude you know what we could do just hatch the one is this close enough like if i were to build two squares here with that no i don't think so i think this is close enough come here blade this guy's name is no shots this one really don't think there's a way to do this no there is oh you want to put the ladder on the side and like interesting nice one spicy oh that's clean oh no shot okay it's loaded it is actually [ __ ] insanely loaded yeah you want a ladder up to the top open no i want to get the [ __ ] out i have two roses okay uh here no no how do you get out how do you get out how do you get out oh you guys there's a starkid outside be careful distract them boys distract them i'm making out like a bandit there's like three four oh my god wow they're they're all shitty yo spicy spicy they're gonna come in they're gonna come in spicy there's five four i don't even know oh they live here of course they do yeah no [ __ ] sherlock ella oh my god it was so loaded did you see the sulphur did you see the sulfur furnace it was a row and a half yeah holy [ __ ] jumping into that compound was so worth it we were in and out and just in time too they came back from a room right as i was leaving so what did we learn here based on ella and spicy's call outs there were at least four or five deep this compound went up really fast and their furnaces were filled to the rim so it's fair to say that these guys were farmers based off of this we decided to head back to see if we could get some more loot off of them oh yeah they definitely live there oh my god we're getting [ __ ] crossbow oh they're in there they're in there that's that's where the crossbow is yo he's in the front door oh my god no why is it killed one oh man build up broken yo oh how brain dead are these guys what the [ __ ] i'm out of ammo i headshot that guy i'm gonna bleed out after fighting them for a bit we decided it would be worth to bring the sars oh one just got my body guys are some [ __ ] mentally ill look at me right now kids that's for damn [ __ ] damn these guys are mad he's dead he's dead okay on roof all right we should just get out of here yeah you're probably right where is this guy he's on the left he said he's dead are you in again spicy yeah attack two we got reefs so two i think he's dead i think so too i'm going to climb in the body you should be dead right i think so yeah there's a dead star guy on the roof as well oh he's waiting underneath what a [ __ ] dude these guys are standing still looting me these guys are such this guy's like literally a human shotgun trap no no there's another one another one good [ __ ] i'm jumping somebody should hop in here with me i'm coming up here now he's coming up louder climbing off ladder nice this is me coming up here wait is it just me or is everything but they're core upgraded this is just me okay uh do you have extra guns and stuff you can name me or do you want do you want it no you should probably just go deeper yourself you have all the stars try not to go in between the two walls there and then you're gonna insta die oh that works i guess once ella depot the stars she came back naked with a db and we waited at their doorway i mean guys they know that you're gonna be in there i'm dead i can see in their base they just let me see in their base oh wow there's a lot there's a lot we didn't go deep but one thing was for certain this wasn't the last we'd see of them for now we decided to mind our own business and farm while going to outposts so we could trade stone for wood and use that wood to make our compound [Music] go um you guys need me to come out yeah there's like three i'm dead i see that guy i'm gonna shoot him in a sec wait one's pushing you i have 11 million i shot one hit him again dead one more behind this three by three on the other side of the road yes yeah twice three times four times four times kill the naked running back oh [ __ ] other side now y'all [Music] what the chinook's out again we should like go to airfield like early premature dresses [ __ ] all right we have a compound boys and gal after finishing up the compound we headed to airfield we've seen chinook drop a crate there before and since it was out again we expected it would do it again oh it's going it's dropping that [ __ ] it's dropping its load on the [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] bro we need to get rocket we need to actually get this great for real uh two guys just got on the ramp leading up to the main building from 120 i had shot one i headshot double body one hit one yeah yeah dude he's my recycler hit three times holy [ __ ] i joked if you go in through the garage tell me when tell me when yeah there's two that one yeah i'm using a [ __ ] crossbow that's just crazy well that's not bad they're inside electrical yeah i have four extra stars dude we were hoping for a rocket from that crate so we could rock it raid in the future we didn't get one but we did get a lot of extra kits one thing we needed to get before logging off for the day though was a garage door we saw an airdrop and on my servers garage doors can spawn in them so we went for it i'm going for it you want to stay up there and cover uh ak no garage door though ladder hatch though but ak is really good oh watch this blueprint my [ __ ] off no way stop the cab no there's actually no way are you serious we got it we actually got it i wasn't gonna go for that too dude it's good that you did my god that was a super lucky find almost scripted i immediately researched it when we got home and you bet i slapped a couple of those down along with finishing pretty much the rest of the base with the resources we had lying around and in case you were wondering this bass design is by evil worst i love his bass designs because they work well with my play style the link to this design is in the description anyways once i finished up the bass i turned in for the knights tomorrow's goal was to raid [Music] day two i woke up the next day to a good amount of progress spicy and ella managed to find a rocket launcher get some large furnaces going in the compound and crafted a lot of our sulfur into gunpowder raiding was on the horizon but if we wanted to rocket raid which is in my opinion the most efficient and fastest way we still need an explosive and an actual rocket so me and spicy flew to cargo ship oh yeah they're crawling all over the top there's one on the front too he said he's inside the doorway he's dead i'm gonna get this guy's body real quick there's another one up there like that ass i thought i heard one i'm getting in we should like just flank we should go all the way around there's 30 seconds on this crate it could have an 8k another crate just opened oh they're panicking now they know we're about to get these crates oh boat coming up yikes i got a bulky uh mp5 and c4 oh other side are you dead he's just bad no he's bad where did he go did he drop he dropped i tried him headshot him doubled huge you know what let's go to front because i heard him above us so i feel like front is least likely to have somebody and i have voltes so i don't think they know that i have bolty yet so i'm gonna crouch around just to clear it he's up top i'm gonna i'm gonna bolt here i killed the one way up top other creatures unlocked never mind what's up my mouth is coming up what's coming up they're both dead nice mark this mark this i marked it honestly dude where's the last crate it's like on me i'm gonna go for it see what's in it and we might just jump with rib and [ __ ] dip out i got akn c4 yeah we're leaving okay um do you want to deploy it i'll cover and then i'll just jump in the water when it's in the water there go go go go go okay uh go to b17 dude holy [ __ ] let's go good [ __ ] dude we need to find the boat oh right here right here there it is the cargo run was a success we got an explosive a bunch of stuff to recycle for scrap and a bunch of extra gear we then called in the supply signal we got from it once again hoping for rockets but we didn't get one it was around now that we started thinking about who we wanted to raid at the time we didn't really have any enemies we've wiped out pretty much all of them at the very start of the run but then we remember the compound clan our neighbors right up the hill they've got the numbers for a fun defense we know they were farmers and their base seems somewhat straightforward to raid plus they were actively expanding so it was decided we would raid them once we found a rocket so in preparation for the raid me and ella went to go buy another minicopter at bandit camp and while on our way there we saw an airdrop in the distance so we quickly bought a mini and flew it over there to grab it uh did you buy the heli yeah come pick me up here's the top yo blue look at the look there yeah i'll get it someone's coming from the left i think the fog we got rocket in ak actually yeah yeah get home please and we're gonna know bro why are they roof camping right now finally we had all three components we needed to rocket raid researched so i went on a huge crafting session and we got ready to just run around i mean i'm making 15 rockets right now all right i have everything i possibly need uh we should just head over in the morning are we going in the same way we usually do yeah front door okay yeah oh no there's there's a there's a hazy staring at me to the right has you to the right get him on supplies [Music] anyway how do you make that [ __ ] what yeah you can't make those yeah you can't move whoa are you having issues there my guy looks like you're stuck oh no dude we need to go in the roof please i need to go deeper rockets while you uh [ __ ] with that what he's dead [Applause] starting on the outside i need help coming back fast no he's bad wait someone's ditching with your kit ella he's dead he's dead dude these [ __ ] kids in the roof [ __ ] they're going to be on bag timer if you kill them i want to go cover spicy's body but a little bit yeah we just seem to play that way better i think like do we need to fly in is that what the answer is like do we see anything we can find someone on the roof that's what i'm that's what i'm thinking of doing thanks for the kids cuties is that what they just said in chat not only were they taunting us but they were talking [ __ ] too just more incentive for us to raid them because the only bad thing is they can go straight up i'm gonna go all the way around what is that oh i thought you were gonna jump out here i'm gonna i'm gonna drop a couple more minutes so we needed to come up with a new plan laddering over their airlock wasn't going to work anymore they learned their lesson there the safest way now was to fly onto the roof and raid top down it confines them into their base and by not breaking the high walls we can't get easily countered what's up homies you're back did we just blur this like do we go down or should we go front i think you should here are you rocking alexa no no just double exploit i don't want to waste a rocket on this here yeah jump up right here i'm going down here shotgun be careful calm down come down here i can start rocking i'm going to start rocking move get back get out i want the okay that's fine this one i'm just going to double rocket it [ __ ] it back rock it in there it goes left and right yeah i think that's i think that's cc right there nice might be one left uh 90 hp 90 hp this is back here i see it i'm gonna break this oh he's back there he's back there i didn't even see [Music] it's wait during the airplane utc down new cc down [Music] this is just nice to just take over [Music] considering the size of this group they had a surprisingly small amount of loot a lot of the boxes were empty so we figured they may have been hiding loot in one of their airlocks but we checked and found nothing luckily the raid wasn't a total loss though as we broke even from the sulfur they had so now what was the plan well we still had a lot of rockets left over and now that we had more sulfur we could craft more we wanted to do another raid but now that we took out the compound we didn't have any in mind so the plan was to just pvp until we found one and soon after our raid we heard another raid in the distance to go and counter oh what the [ __ ] it is iceland i see one don't touch me we should go right oh yeah yeah we should just go far right they're all dying and coming back right now wait wait they're raiding the small base too you want to try the others ready yeah three two one yeah we could steal this we could do this a lot of comps there's so much stone over here guys i'm stuck nice someone's coming up careful i'm going to check outside real quick don't don't go with the bulkhead yeah i'm just gonna check from a bag yeah it's pretty quiet out here all right you guys see the two aks in here you guys depot that yep after that quick little counter raid we saw that airfield chinook crate was up and we got there just in time oh there's a guy running up to crate right now two guys uh they see me which direction are they running um oh there's five yeah i see them below tower they're running towards me one dead another one but i'm super low i'm gonna die i'm gonna kill them no see them kill that guy i killed three so far [Music] there could be two could be two he's along the the edge i'm pretty sure i'm dead i headshot hit him twice headshot hit twice dude so all three of us just got sauced on by this guy sanitar you may think good for the solo he made a play but it turned out that this guy wasn't solo he was part of that 5 man we just fought at airfield now you may be wondering how i know this but for now i just want you to remember his name because it won't be the last we see of him it'll all make sense soon but to continue with our story we accepted the loss and headed to bradley to take it out oh brother you see it wow bradley that's unexpected and there's people at launch right now that's ours where's brad people here with stars no i'm too far away oh four or four four yeah what the [ __ ] are they gonna do brad we're just in such a bad spot they're surrounding us yeah he's on the street the gate or the the fence defense on the left he just jumped down like inside see him yeah he's below he's below platform spicy [Music] who are these guys anywhere rishala like yeah i know they're extra ak kits but you know full send has a kid northeast 50 by the bus stop you're going to meet up with them you're in about like two seconds blue dragon once he's dead he's only it's killa again with a pipe wait what does this guy have [Music] i can headshot him blue take it here i know i know i know but there's i'm about to head for this guy i missed him pogba helmet and he lives sure oh well it's like i have spacesuit coming from 30. two of them that's all i'm dead oh he's falling back hey take a bite yeah ah i think he got his buddy's stuff first crate c4 armor double another crate c4 4x um laser i got it it's a 8x and a laser and an armored door okay well two c4 is profit oh it could get attacked i should have one 100 top of the mountain right now get to my left yeah he's like i see him headshot dead hit the other one he's not behind this side of buying the silo i see the guys up the hill hit him hit one hit them again that on me cyrus get one another one dead all three dead all three dead there's another one i think there's another one i think no no no no they're getting stronger one from the base behind he's dead two people below you one dead did you headshot that guy too i had two there's another one here wait he's not good yeah that's what i was thinking is there a roof cam scoot please i see him on your right [Music] i can headshot them i have bolted this okay headshot them what the [ __ ] that was insane that was the most fun i've had in a while and rust that whole just as crazy as fights please we didn't get db'd yeah that's what made it amazing and we also played as a team yeah that was really good that fight was intense and from it we learned a few things i didn't notice it at the time but we had some tarkov players among us don't know what that means don't worry i don't play the game either but apparently the group we fought at launch site and up on the snowy mountain name themselves after some of the characters from the game so why is this important well let's look all the way back to the counter-raid out on the ice lake i never got a chance to read the names of the people we initially killed on the roof but i did get to read one name and that was this guy reshala the same guy i killed in launch site before we took bradley his teammates fell back but eventually we ran into them again gluckhar and sturman now the thing that connects all these names together was the guy who made a play on us in airfield sanitar rashala gluckar sturman sanitar these are the four tarkov players we've seen them roaming with others but these are the main four guys they're all teamed and we had a feeling of where their base was the ice lake when we countered that raid roshallah was coming back from this large base which shared the same ice league as the base they were raiding it would only make sense that they would rate it and it would only make sense for us to raid them since the time we've been looking for another base to raid they've been the people we fought the most and a nice plus to this was that we still had control of the base we countered slap a couple of beds and gear sets in there and it would work perfectly as a raid base it seemed like our best option so we made preparations and headed over i'm gonna have an extra 20 12 rockets though definitely going to be enough all right guys this is all of our boom this is manka running out in the open like this i know i'm scared i want to put on one of these gear sets and just run outside their base to see if they'll shoot me just to make sure they live there they're in this space active nicely go back in no i'm only a crossbar i'm only crossbow i let him head shot me i'm dead yeah yeah yeah stermin that's one of them yeah with 100 confidence that they live there it was time to hit them hard we may not win but this is a test of our freedom we just can't be getting grubbed by these kids understand we just can't be letting these guys use a tier 5 in airfield not while they have aks no no and we as a trio the cleansing of the server we are going to set it right and we're going to win you understand let's get this [ __ ] yeah yeah okay let's go yeah get that [ __ ] spicy go [Music] yeah i'm reloading rocks no you can't run in front man did you die yes i died i'm coming back in though i'm dead what did i run in front of you or the door the door right in front of him oh no hurry up go just go i'm not dead i'm not dead no ladder placement oh my god no way what the [ __ ] i ran i didn't even run in front of you on my screen yeah i'm dead i'm dead spicy he's out he's outside i'm dead he's one hp oh no what what four shots doesn't kill a hazmat he's alive i got him life he's out there with rocket launcher [Music] yeah you should [Music] man that's so unfortunate dude so unfortunate that would have been a good one i wasn't even in front of you i can't believe that they whipped up i don't know how they where they came from with the he's those there's four doors there's four doors that would have been such a fun race ceiling he said he said 8k i don't know how the oh crusher off the crusher open yeah i know i know might be dead yeah i just [ __ ] up i killed myself i can't believe this [ __ ] here push me for something are you nuts wait how the [ __ ] oh did they pick it up do we now i'm not extra ladders where did that ladder go did you pick it up i took it okay yeah it's naked what the [ __ ] it even let your body down yeah no they didn't know i died i don't even know when i when or why i decided to go right because you're trying to pick the guy open it's no one's fault i tagged him twice it's just that's why i think that's why i pushed they're just not gonna do anything we have rockets boys we have rockets sit in base i guess no you guys have a cheat launcher though you guys have hd launcher i was looking i was looking forward to that guys that's unfortunate it was pretty interesting this this would have been fun to online raid too uh two guys pulling up right now yes sorry dude thanks for the armor i appreciate it [Music] nice it went three times one day another one dad [ __ ] you guys yeah you guys seem like nice guys just you know he launcher it's nothing we can do about it i mean first first online sense yeah we're just not really lucky you're getting online this man i don't know [Music] you should throw your wife at us man let's do it no balls dude let's do it you know what i like i like your stuff there's only three of us bring your whole five man on dude let's get it 583 online rate i'm down it'll even if even if we do have the full five man it'll basically be three of us anyways so that's chill dude it'll be fun we'll let you build it so yeah that raid failed embarrassingly fast we lost all hope when they got all of our rockets as you could hear in our voices but then we talked with them for a bit after they said they would get their whole group on and online radius back but it was possible that they were just saying this to get us to go away almost never does someone stay true to their word and rust regardless we had nothing better to do so we just waited at base to call their bluff yo scrap heli coming in 3 30. it's b landing our base for real yes they're looking at us dude are they going to shoot from the heli that would be so sick no way they are they are hitting hard what's the idea then again one more rocket one more rocket hold on here it comes no hit it hit it please what the [ __ ] just happened dude we're coming back for you guys dude we're coming back for you guys dude they they had more rockets than you probably thought what the [ __ ] okay i don't think we should raid them what i want to i
