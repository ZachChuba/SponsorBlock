that's five up and major smile goodbye scott hasta lavista see you later and that's why here's what we could do okay you could kill scott and then you don't die in med oh ek did not reach out oh well peter said though scott don't go that way don't go that way scott don't go that way scott all right this kills one of two people on god that's five up and major for one i was doing that my route was i came straight down did the node outside of weapons and then i came in through office and i did my sweatpants simply put i saw scott running out of comms that's a lie i came down from the node checkmate checkmate checkmate why would anyone see me by the node where did you come out of five up uh i came out of weapons my question was why is scott running out of columns and saying he's not there yeah if you're in weapons but it must have been only very briefly because i saw a little blip in weapons for like a millisecond so you went in there to maybe check for a body or to check for a person to kill no i went into weapons thinking i had a weapons test and it was actually the note outside of it that's alex says to know what i was on nope yep smile goodbye scott hasta la vista see you later no it's 100 not me i don't know yet between but they're but hey at least remember in the end game there's one between scott and five up and that's why here's what we could do okay you could kill scott and then you don't die kill five up and you don't die because if you kill me you will die because i'm not the imposter if i was lying about where i am oh wait can can this what's the name can the sheriff kill multiple people right yeah okay if you see scott's body on the ground don't report it what i'll get it oh kill coconuts that means five she's going to kill him i want to see this i want to see this now i want to see this now i want to see this now i'm so concerned if you see scott's body on the ground five up is blatantly lying do we think it's more five upper skies oh it's definitely scary i'm so confused your brain is too big for mine no i've walked in first to office if that means anything i convinced him to skip somehow i've somehow convinced him to skip which is quite lovely okay if he's going up there sleepy's going up there and now i camp vitals i don't know about calling the um that thing but you know what let's double kill because michael cool down stop so he needs to kill first how did you win so quick both of them [Laughter] i couldn't find him we found you at the end of the life and we walked with you for really i couldn't sleep yeah i was gonna i was gonna kill scott jester does well on like meeting rounds but we only had one of those i just walk around and pray i don't die i was honest actually i was gonna kill scott cause i killed five up too much today that was so that was it was if i came off it was me and five of as like cosplaying as stephen i didn't realize you killed haku in there yeah well let's see uh i don't have any tasks up there then we go here and we download and then i play the waiting game it's uh by nav just just outside the nav room bit in the hallway i just walked through there but it's i don't think it's outside now i think it's inside and off well i just wasn't no it's like in the hallway i just walked through that hallway no the lights are out me because i walked over the body and it's the report buttons come up the lights are out you but wait because it's in the middle of the hallway i've walked out through the hallway i am also there may i give my my eyewitness account yeah go ahead and then i'll say dumb dog and i were on uh the garbage shoe in o2 and then he got off before me because he started before me i left went to nav and i just see ellen's like pink character i actually thought it was five up because i knew five of was around there too or maybe he wasn't and it was the whole time definitely yeah i walk in a nav to go do my the navigation thingy and then you're just getting off of it and reporting a body like right behind me someone's just sniped it like literally that's okay where's steve at weapons i haven't seen a single person this entire game i did download in the beginning in cafeteria and then trash uh shoot and then i went straight to weapons and i have like eight asteroids done um i i thought i saw you enough hmm i think you got your [ __ ] [ __ ] up man yeah i didn't see anyone enough when i was in there the thumb you better i haven't made it i was looking i was looking for steve the whole time i'm just actually so confused i literally just walked through that hallway no report button and i only saw elem just get off of the nav task that i just hopped on i think so do you think it's ellen then do you think this is a self-reporter he's the only one it's either him or dumb dog or the only two i know that are in that exact dude i've done i just i did my two tasks in there i've turned around the bodies in the hallway that's what's happening yeah i remember seeing four people i couldn't remember if it was you or wendy because you [ __ ] didn't steven hmm okay so i killed there only because the lights were off and because lits were off when ellen walked in they knew or they didn't know i was here and the lights are still off when i killed and i just uh hit above and they only get a report option they don't check that's the reason i could do that that's the only reason now we go here wendy janet um oh god it's wendy come with me come with me andy hey sure um okay this is because he's doing his upload for the second time now oh that's the first time uh you started there i finished my upload uh i see you just get on it i leave uh i come back and you're on the upload again question i'll leave you five up i voted koji uh i i just was with janet in admin before the lights went out i was just following her because i was pretty sure she was crew and we both did card swipe she did it so fast and i lost her didn't know where she went and somebody else was in somebody else was in there doing upload was that kojie was an admin yeah when me and janet were in there so i saw that dumb dog was just in lights and steve on nav simply explain your case to me yeah do it cody wait sorry what why are you on down or upload for a solid 27 seconds okay like the honest truth is i actually just cancelled it too early and then i went down to admin table i realized again i did the card swipe and then i ran past it i was like it's still got a yellow ring on it and then i realized i'd cancelled it too early it could be a jester play though like that i think you're the gesture and he's trying to blame it yesterday what if i'm the detective what if i'm the imposter if my name is if my name's pink i'm the detector all right so my intention there was to just draw attention away from what happened because i did come from that general direction so my only play was to do that pretty much then uh yeah i mean it seemed to work no i think dk might be the sheriff actually no if dk was the sheriff someone would be dead by now [ __ ] you uh five of just killed nope wild got killed nope okay so uh i was just with uh who was it koji you and i were in electrical right uh i fixed lights and then i did i think the gestures you fix like no you fixed lights and went up top and did like wires i walked in i was gonna start doing download uh but then i can't definitely do this no i did my whole download then i left walked out went towards storage i saw blood splatter through the wall walked past the body which was ellums and slowly finally caught oh elves that too so so here's my story dk okay uh no uh i went to reactor i just have says in the beginning uh i went back after lights turned off um i don't know who left but i ended up seeing a body fall over i ran past it i saw a wildcat running away to comps and i found dumb dog's body and so i found the other monsters listen listen listen i gotta talk real quick said there was bells on the feet does that mean that's the gesture yeah so why did you stay in the door if anybody would like to to handle this we can solve this crime this round vote one out and i'll kill the other uh oh so he's claiming sheriff and he's lying about it i swear i'm detective i said the body headed north can i get my story one more time real quick yes so as i i was intellectual with koji as i did my download i left i walked out saw blood splatter in storage walked past the body because i wanted to try and catch who did it because obviously i just saw the blood splatter so there's a chance i can catch him i catch five up's toes as he's leaving storage going towards calm and then he reports a different body so that's a this is a situation where you know he's lying because i reported the body and he thinks he changes the body in med bay hold here's the story here's the reason why wildcat is lying because he's saying i reported a different body but dk has another body so yeah oh it's true yeah no elem's body is in storage yes but you said that you chased me away from it but i recorded it no no no no no no no oh it's five updates okay why are you like i think is one of them all right well i don't know i don't know what crew just did there but i don't know i didn't even get to kill anybody yeah then why are you standing in the doorway dk i didn't get to kill anybody okay if you're just you're still gonna oh just kill me dude there you go so what happened there was detective sees a placeholder body when something is killed on a previous round that's what happens there so the main reason that um hold on 02 up here so that's why that body was there in dk's mind guys guys you really screwed i didn't know it wasn't the body that just died oh my god i didn't know this either but um there's an update which makes sense because on the update it said something about detective bodies uh detectives can inspect old bodies from old rounds yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry yeah want to just honestly that last round i was about to just full send on someone sorry guys i'm sorry guys all right you're you're good you're good well dk yeah i didn't know i know i was like i swear i was like i was like oh my god i finally get to inspect the body i found someone dead yeah yeah yeah don't worry about it at all wait janet were just a little bit worried though yeah she must have been you
