this video is sponsored by Squarespace I have historically been pretty angry at the animation industry nowadays you've seen countless and countless videos of me on one of my favorite styles of filmmaking because frankly a lot of companies are treating it like a money-making machine rather than a way of pushing creativity like oh my god we have a style of filmmaking that allows us to do literally anything so let's make another Toy Story cool that's not what I'm here to talk about though I'm talking about a more specific problem that happens in the industry a detail that really grinds my gears and it's that it's that guy that's that fur CGI fur and hair is one of the most annoying things about filmmaking today every time I see it on the screen it just feels like the animation company going yeah that's right look at it look at that it has this weird egotistical look about it that has always just really annoyed me but why what is so wrong with CGI fur all it's doing is showcasing how far we've come with technology and how impressive certain animation companies are what's wrong with that there are multiple reasons for why it really grinds my gears but I guess I'll start with the fact that it doesn't really matter I'm not saying my my problem with it doesn't matter I'm saying the fur it doesn't matter a while ago I found a tweet regarding The Incredibles 2 where someone zoomed in on Bob's arm hair and captioned it so this is why this movie took so long to make again it's impressive but dude is anyone really out here watching this movie like man if it weren't for that arm hair that I couldn't really see I definitely would not have liked it as much there's nothing wrong with getting really detailed with your animation in most cases it's actually pretty fun but when it's stuff like that that has no real impact on the viewers experience you're just taking away time that could have been spent improving story or other stylistic elements like I don't know making these other superheroes look a bit less stupid a prime example would be something like Zootopia I really like this movie I think it says a lot of things in a really smart way it's fun for all ages and most importantly it comes with tons of small details and a world full of things to explore the animators did a good job with the fur because you know we're dealing with animals they kind of have to do somewhat of a good job but it doesn't look like it could be real because it doesn't need to it's clear that they spent as much time on the animation as they need it to it looks great it looks phenomenal and then they went all out on the world building and story which honestly makes for a pretty great movie The Incredibles 2 hypes themselves up like we're used making this movie animation is so hard and you can tell they kind of put story behind them because the story is just kind of whatever compared to the rest of Pixar's films whereas something like wreckit-ralph two barely did any improvements with this animation and focus more on world building and bringing depth to these characters creating for a much more in my opinion exciting film on another note fur poses questions it makes things weird what do I mean by that well there's a ton of examples but I'll point your attention to the Grinch as some of you may know I recently saw the Grinch and it was honestly not as bad as I expected but it still uses the fur in an obnoxiously excessive way this is something illumination has seemed to do with every single movie when I'm put into a fantasy world something like Whoville I don't want to be dealing with things like you know real life this goes back to what I said earlier it's such a lazy approach you could do anything with this have fun but no let's make the Grinch look really fuzzy for some reason this of course depends on the animation there is a Pixar short a few years ago called Piper that I absolutely loved it was a situation where I thought the realistic feathers actually enhanced the story we're not in Whoville we're on the beach like like the real world it's making what we live in look fun illumination adding realistic fur is them trying to make a fantasy world more realistic which you know makes no sense children and adults to be completely honest we're curious we want to see things we've never seen before hence the excitement of all the possibilities that were revealed to us through the lego movie hence the excitement of seeing toys come to life for the first time hence our excitement to see pandas doing kung-fu ladies and gentlemen the possibilities are endless we don't want to see a beloved children's book character with some realistic hair or worse literally just animals with fur like what is the point lastly I want to address maybe the most important reason it's dangerous no seriously not like physically it's not gonna hurt you but dealing with hair like this isn't actually that great for the animation industry the style of filmmaking at least the 3d kind it's only been around for a good twenty years almost and it already feels like we're at a peak people say things like oh man how are they gonna top this and animation companies realize they can't really because they have no creativity so they just keep busting out sequels that's why I appreciate things like this because it's so far from the realism approach and it looks amazing like Sony may have given us the emoji movie but goddamn at least they're trying things out over here at least they're not like oh you think buzz looked real and Toy Story 3 just wait for Toy Story 4 kids don't think fur is exciting sorry they think it's cute but do you think that kind of reaction can last you a full 90 minutes when I went to see the Grinch I was impressed by the fur for a solid two minutes and then BOOM I was bored that's horrible I just want you all to think about it have you ever had a film that had incredibly realistic fur and had a great story at the same time there may be a few exceptions but for the most part they don't exist animation is a style of filmmaking that pushes boundaries that has no limits so for the love of God could we please just be a bit more creative with it everyone can get 10% off of your first purchase again thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]
