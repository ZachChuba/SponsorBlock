imagine that you have a pizza on this pizza there's pineapple pepperoni and poop next the pizza is thrown into a homeless shelter where it's used as a replacement for toilet paper finally the pizza is injected with AIDS eaten and then vomited out into some kind of aids ridden pizza mush that pizza is feminism at one point or another it was good heck even when it had pineapple on it I mean it was still pizza but over time feminism has become a crap filled mush barely recognizable compared to the once decent pizza now imagine you have thousands of piles of crap filled Pizza mush and you're forced to pick the worst one where you even start do you pick the one riddled with aids and disease or do you pick the one that hits you with that hashtag me too after you smile at it too long trying to figure out which feminist is the worst feminist has not been an easy job it's been extremely challenging but I think there is one feminists specifically who takes the pizza now I recognize that there have been plenty of terrible people who call themselves feminists but I think this one person is the worst feminist currently even by feminist standards what's up everybody it's your favorite gay looking straight boy freshly shaved Hunter Avallone here back with another fantastic video while you're here don't forget to click that subscribe button and smash that like button I consent I've been given a very challenging job trying to find the worst feminist but ladies gentlemen everything else I think I have finally found her this woman's name is Alyssa Milano that's right this feminist is so horrible just looking at her beady little eyes turns my soul so black you think it's about to get shot by police so what exactly makes this woman worthy of the worst feminist award well we're about to find out at first description to download rizal and follow me at Hunter Ave alone today so Alyssa Milano stinks for the home schoolers watching this is Alyssa Milano she's another one of those typical feminist Hollywood hacks she's famous for being a loud and proud me to activists and for instigating the now notorious sex strike of 2019 you guys remember that we're a bunch of feminists said they were gonna withhold sex unless they have the right to go to Walmart naked or something I don't know to me the entire sex strike just sounded like a very loud you can't fire me because I quit so what makes Alyssa Milano's so bad and even more so how is she the winner of the worst feminist award I mean that is quite an honor sure the me2 movement had its flaws but it also helped hold powerful men accountable for bad behavior what's so bad about that well it's not so much about what Alyssa Milano has done but rather what Alyssa Milano has refused to do Milano has turned the me2 movement into nothing more but a partisan crack job enforcing the believe women narrative when it's convenient for her and ignoring it when it's not in short she's a hypocrite and further proves that I have yet to meet a single person named Alyssa who isn't a raging hormonal monster the 2020 election is coming up and it's looking obvious that we're about to have a trump verse Biden showdown Alyssa Milano being the GU Democrat pawn that she is endorsed and supported Joe Biden she very obviously once Joe Biden to win the the you know the thing now here is where we bump into our first little roadblock despite the fact that Biden has a very long history of making women uncomfortable by acting like an Avon salesman Biden was recently hit with the most damning allegation yet he's being accused of severe misconduct by a former staffer named Tara Reid now I don't want to get into all the details about what exactly this accusation was just know that it's the exact thing me two activists would be all over if it were a Republican being accused Alyssa Milano is now at a crossroad her candidate has been accused of abusing his power and worse so what should she do be consistent with her me to believe women narrative or pull an uno reverse that's right she did the latter in a bizarre whirlwind of hypocrisy Alyssa Milano went completely silent when her Uncle Joe was hit with a rather credible allegation understandably this caused a lot of anger and frustration and after weeks of giving us all the silent treatment she finally broke her silence earlier this month she spoke with the radio host Andy Cohen where she had this to say because I believe that um even though we should believe women and that is an important thing and what that statement really means is like you know for so long the the go-to has been not to believe them so really we have to sort of societally change that mindset to believing women but that does not mean at the expense of not you know giving men their due process and and investigate situations like gods and and giving you know it it's got to be it's got to be it's got to be fair and in both direction I sent them me to tweet over two years ago I never thought that it would be something that was going to destroy innocent then right wake you up we don't want that to happen either so we have to find this balance in the believe women movement and also giving men their their due process and you know realizing that we're destroying lives if we publicly don't go through the right steps the funny thing is I actually agree with Alyssa Milano's statements here due process is a very important thing and the me2 movements sometimes seemed like it overruled men's due process when it came to the public court of opinions the problem isn't what Alyssa Milano has said but it's the fact that she's the one saying it what exactly caused Milano to have a sudden 180 on her opinions well duh it's a Democrat being accused remember Alyssa Milano is a partisan hack weaponizing the me2 movement to take down people that she doesn't like plus if she's always cared so much about due process how come she tweeted her support for Christine Blasi Ford the day the allegation went public oh that's right now I remember when Republicans are accused believe all women but when Democrats are accused what about due process when it was Cavanaugh Milano said she doesn't believe that any man's misogyny should take precedence over a survivors humanity hashtag believe women so in a way Milano is kind of admitting that Biden isn't really a man or she's just an enormous hypocrite who only wants to believe women when it's politically convenient for her Alyssa Milano is easily the worst feminist right now exposing her complete and total political partisanship and exposing her blatant hypocrisy for the entire world to see but my friends it gets even spicier back in 2018 Milano appeared on Larry King show to discuss due process and she had this to say I'd like to thank the Federalists for providing this clip due processes are obviously in the Constitution but women are not in the Constitution as far as women standing up and and holding men that have abused their their power holding them accountable we don't really know what that due process looks like we don't know what a fair investigation especially for this the Supreme Court nomination what that would really look like I don't even know how to articulate this anymore without sounding like a broken record how come due process when it came to Kavanagh was a learning experience hey I guess in the last two years Alyssa Milano has learned all of the nuances of due process or she's just a raging hypocrite who's buddy-buddy with Joe Biden and doesn't want to apply her logic equally when appearing on the Andy Cohen show she also had this to say so we have to find this balance in the believe women movement and also giving men their due process and you know realizing that we're destroying lives if we publicly don't go through the right steps in order to find out if an accusation is credible or not it's funny how during her Larry King interview in 2018 she didn't seem all that concerned about ruining innocent men's lives with false accusations that somebody doesn't like somebody could you see he attacked me and get him fired I mean yes there is always that danger but when we look at the statistics of how many people come forward and and falsely accused a man of this kind of conduct it's a very very small minuscule amount and that's you you get even smaller when you go to the fact that 70 to 80 percent of women don't even report as if this isn't proof enough that Alyssa Milano is easily the worst feminist right now even from a feminist perspective she's an idiot I want you to do me all a favor it's a big favor but try and do this with me all right close your eyes and imagine that you're a modern-day feminist hop feminism has clouded your mind your hair is turning blue your IQ is steadily dropping and you reek of cat fur and loneliness okay so you remember how feminism claims to be about giving women social rights and women equally Milano's refusal to treat certain survivors equally and her blatant inconsistencies when it comes to her believe women logic completely spits in the face of everything feminism claims to stand for Milano is even being called out by former feminists me two activists and she's being called a fraud I completely agree of course due process is important but Alyssa Milano didn't seem to care too much about due process when it was the Republican guy being accused who she already didn't like I did my work and spoke two times up and I just don't feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I've known for 15 years and this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation if only Milano have been good friends with Cavanaugh then perhaps dr. Ford's accusation would have also been false and not worth ruining a good friendship over Alyssa Milano is a complete disgrace a partisan hack and a total loser she clearly picks and chooses who she believes to be innocent and guilty based on nothing more but political affiliation which is as bad as it gets so what do you guys think is she the worst feminist as of right now or is there someone out there even worse [Music]
