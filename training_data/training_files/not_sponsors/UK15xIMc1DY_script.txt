Wow another reddit video that's so cool Felix thank you actually I've been traveling for a few days now I'm in Canada and I'll be back very soon but I had to work ahead so you should be thankful anyway I hope you still enjoy this video just wanted to clarify why there's been the same I actually really for coming back and working on Minecraft and stuff like that but until then Johnny bye-bye okay kids describe color to a blind person of you ever saw a color of a blueberry I've never seen anything ever that's the whole point kids are freaking stupid what's up gamers it's time to fully understand just how stupid kids are and not only are they stupid they are also weak I challenge any child to a fight today we are reviewing kids are freaking stupid I'm wearing glasses so I'm probably twice as smart as a child by default when I was six I named my animal crossing character sex and couldn't change it back so panicked went outside the next day and smashed the game card with a head I have lived with this my whole life oh god how do I delete it I must destroy the evidence right now get the hammer I can just imagine like a rainy night Thunder take out your animal crossing' cartridge and you smash it to the ground because no one can know this is one of the best clips of all coding so much chaos in ten seconds this stuff every face in this is absolutely ten out of ten it's so good this clip is one of the greatest clips online I have this theory and I've been talking about this for a long time and if you follow me as well you know all right I think it's time for me to start getting my opinions out there because I am going for president in 2020 and my idea is basically picture Hunger Games but you can't just have a bunch of people there that's immoral and unethical just have kids instead have kids every child that way you never have to see a child that way only the good children will survive and will create a society of strong people I realized this comes across as a little too generous kids are great I love kids they're awesome I just remember it that when I got my first dog I was seven and he was 1/7 in dog years and I cried when he turned 2 because I didn't think a 14-year old dog oh no my dog is too cool to be with me now I'm trying to think what stupid ideas I had as a child but I can't think of any I was just I was just big brain since the womb I mean I yes I did think the action mang figurine came with a real-life surfboard and harpoon okay that's not my fault that's false advertising yes I thought that action meant police uniform came with the police uniform is that so crazy and a dog with an epic leash I got light too it's not my fault I was failed as a child keep your toddler busy by letting them paint the fence with me so good oh I take back my idea by valuing I I want I want to have my own kid so I can terrorize it by doing these things oh my god I look forward to this so much this reminds me my parents would always force me to shovel snow outside our staircase we had a staircase outside a house it wasn't our staircase it was the public staircase but my mom was like oh if we don't shovel the snow and an old lady falls and dies then we can go to jail because we're liable and I'm like oh god I have to shovel the snow because I don't want those to go to prison stupid old ladies I was tricked I was tricked to shovel snow life in Sweden is not easy I'm sorry feel free to share your stories I want to hear when my brother was like nine he said get the f sensor G instead of the gift bag all right seeing this on road like so they ban him and he cried that's some hard-ass crying I had to work overnight last night and while taking a nap today I was vandalized I have a picture and I have detained the two suspects but one is not cooperating the only one who can speak blames it on the foreleg suspect wears no hands to pull such a stunt thanks to my neighbor for pointing out that I have a marker all over my face when I took the four-legged suspect for a walk before I realized that I was vandalized well it seems like kids one parent zero you got played fool imagine being outsmarted by a child daughter didn't want son scream so I put her outside and yell son get her and now she's flipping oh yes well I guess you know what I'll live mate I fell for the whole carrot meme write that if you eat a carrot you can see well in the dark but I never ate the carrots anyway so it doesn't matter oh my god now I remember oh god it's all coming to me I love chicken as a child so a way my mom would make me eat food was she would tell me everything is chicken I was like oh what is this meat and my mom is like oh it's chicken you love chicken right but he got to a point where she just said everything was chicken I remember pointing at an onion and I was like mom what is this I don't like this this tastes bad and she my mom was like no that's a chicken I'm like no it isn't and that's when I realize parents are freaking liars same with Santa Claus goddamn it's unethical to lie to children I feel like there's so many things that you were like that has there ever been I'm curious has ever been anything you were taught as a child and you just don't question it for like 10 years and then you're and then you're about to tell someone something I'm like actually that onion is a chicken and then you realize oh god it's unethical to lie to children my sister just had a baby she brought in her home today and my other niece was so pissed she packed up all her stuff and tried to leave fine go just go everyone has stories of them running away right everyone has a story oh I ran away and no one noticed so I came back never ran away because I'm f ik I'm smarter than that I know I would die bedtime was half an hour ago my six-year-old just walked out bleary-eyed asked his father if a duck is a predator some things are too important to go to bed without knowing that's fair you know at least I can appreciate a child that question things incompetent child look at a cupid what all the look of embarrassin that's beautiful my dad only took me to one soccer game I remember it very clearly that no one is scored the entire match no one made it and it made a point until the end and everyone stood up including me except my dad and my dad looked at me and with disappointment and said that was the other team that scored Felix and after that we never went to another ball game Oh God oh no wait this is Mina was this idiot child no that can't be right that can't be right kids are stupid not me I'm wearing glasses you can't be mad at kids for ask Oh delicious substance it's so delicious like like like like enter car purified it'll make your mouth taste like heaven causing of three-year-olds meltdown this morning banana to small bananas slightly squashed honey on porridge doesn't sufficiently resemble a swimming-pool sister had her first we before his third doesn't want scooter does want scooter something to do with sleeps okay this is it when the kids are acting like this they've gone too far and you need to send them to the island it needs a better name maybe like Darwin Island that's where they all fight it out they'll be like a Call of Duty basically there will be kill streaks when you beat all the children you get the choice of either continuing or go back to society and I think a pretty good anime can be based around the concept as well so if anyone wants to if I have any anime makers watching this feel free to contact me oh my god he has been very very picky lately but loves Taco Bell so I made a homemade meal and put it into a Taco Bell bag and it actually worked I would never fall for this simple-minded treachery toddler daddy I want toast me okay buddy here's some toast toddler I don't like butter on my toast flip toast over to the dry side and hence it back there you go toddler thanks daddy yeah if you let your toddler control you then I'm sorry you need to be sent to the island as well oh that's a good idea write that down that's a really good idea what's the most recent illogical breakdown your toddler had he loved being tickled so I was tickling him one day he let out a huge fart and suddenly started crying and screaming I asked him why he's screaming and he replies with I was saving that for later all right we need a separate island for really smart gifted children to make sure that these kids can thrive in an environment where society doesn't break it down for them okay how dare you question why they were saving apart don't say you want a Lego tower building contest if you can't have a Lowe's egg Oh kids are so dumb you feeble child you thought you could beat me in lego building contest I will beat you in any challenges hmm I'll let you pick the category I remember the first time you looked at porn online it was so confusing because you knew your pants knew what sites you access you didn't know how they knew what size you went on so it was terrifying to like go to a porn website so once you did I remember I went through Pamela Anderson calm or something like that and I was like I need to savor this I already explained this sir but now I already gotten far enough in it I don't know how my parents can know this so I need to savor this the fact that I'm going on break ingush barrier by going to this website so I need to savor it so I printed the photos like the genius I am I'm like oh this way I don't have to keep going back to this website and risk getting caught but then I had a genius epiphany that that's not a good idea that as tangible evidence okay I should just cancel these prints and I cancelled the prints and went on with my day to summarize the story they still printed at a later time when my dad was at the printer and he showed me the pictures and it was epic I'm becoming an actual boomer like saying the same stories twice now my son trying to get back down from washing his hands just hang in there helpless so I decided to take a photo and humiliate him online this is good parenting and I appreciate it I walk out a target to the scene of a child laying motionless on the ground I asked what was wrong and it had said he's upset his gloves match his jacket that's awesome the child should be stupid send him to the ranch Oh we'll call it the ranch that makes sense one time my uncle put a wig on my cousin's head and told him it was permanent yes lions can hunt and kill their own food by the time they're three months old my three year old couldn't find her lunchbox and it was in her other hand this is what I mean if evolution is real then why are kids so dumb this is why we need the ranch okay you don't understand my society if you vote for me we'll be a prosperous nation it will be a semi-autonomous state and the ranch can bring up a lot of revenue if we turn it into an anime I'm just saying opens bottle of bleach nephew how did you open it I tried but it didn't open oh it's because it has a child safety a lot children can't open it nephew looks at bottling amazement how did it know I was a child it's that bottle of programmed how can bottle know what is the dumbest thing you believed as a child I thought Michael Jackson has to stop whatever he's doing and sing when I play his CD as a result I never played it at night to give him some family time that is actually nice and wholesome that's so nice wait CDs are kind of old though how old were the person who made this bet you kids don't know what I catch that player is God I'm an actual boomer this kid asked me for some skittles but I had just finished them so he stared at me like this didn't I how can you do this but why why you eat them all I would just say yeah just let me finish them first and eat them slowly in front of him mom I just wanted to tell you that Mother's date wouldn't be possible without me I'll be waiting for my present in the living room love Joshua Joshua is a child with great potential and he will not go to the ranch he will go to the special school of gifted people Joshua another gifted child I see my first grade students were asked to write letters to the local nursing home and times almost up why is there such a difference between the gifted chat seat my theory is perfect this is gonna go great he made iron man out of costume this would be my reaction either way if I met him I used to think this movie was live-action and the people who lived in Europe look like this this is true all Europeans look like that I'm actually CGI I'm always a little annoyed with parents when kids are really scared of dogs is that it's a weird thing to say but if I'm wrong feel free to tell me but I'm always like dude have you not taught your child my dogs are safe like at least my pugs I don't know it's like Edgar comes up to a child and they're like I don't like Jesus Christ teach your kid how to interact with dogs it ain't that hard I still see adults getting scared of dogs I mean I don't want to shame people if they have fears that's fine but it's just weird like Edgar ran after him lady one time and she started screaming like an adult woman started screaming in genuine fear out of Edgar the Swedish looking area come here I feel like I need to show just how stupid this dog looks so you understand if this dog comes after you like how can you be scared and I was like it's okay he's friendly she was like oh okay I usually just grab Edgar and then I tell them to pet them it's like I'm doing the job for the parents maybe maybe the children isn't fault maybe it's the parents being dumb dumbs yes that's so good this guy this kid will go to that the place of gifted people Jackie you can't just white out a question answer this kid will work for the Chinese government one day oh my god PewDiePie sucks read description I'm not a PewDiePie hater I'm a bro but I'm a new youtuber so I figure this would be a good way to get views please understand peace spots
