[Music] so recently there's been a lot of people telling a lot of people how rush should be played we've got people saying that russ should be slamming little naked ned's head into the dirt with a swift bullet to the brain while smugly smirking insane welcome to rust on the other hand we've got other people who are friendlier than now who prefer to take the pacifist route a whole classic player who campaigns for the lives of the downtrodden hashtag naked lives matter and we've got the role players refined ladies and gentlemen of the drama club growing crops setting up 200 iq electricity-powered masterpieces or pretty much doing generally anything that creates some kind of a story now i'm here to give you the official rust experience which is anything you want it to be it's a creative survival sandbox it could be doing any one of these things i mentioned in this video in fact this video is only called the official russ experience because i'm on an official server but anyway i digress before we start i've got a question for you so are you ready to raid no not that type of raid this type of here in your inbox for the next 30 days only well with all of this uh role-play service stuff going on right now i thought i'd show uh the new players the official rust experience playing on an official vanilla server oz face punch one now let's see what can be done my predictions are i'm probably gonna [ __ ] on some people make some grub plays get some better kids and progress through that way you know what i might even do find a decayed base oh [ __ ] what a welcome [Music] okay [Music] so we've got a double barrel with two shots now we just need to not find a nice juicy fat compound or pretty big base to sit at for a moment here we're also gonna need some food where am i i've got oximes tommy does sound pretty delicious though i think it's coming from that compound someone's eating all the food here so i'm just going to grab a tommy real quick and then we'll move on maybe put a two by two down [Music] hello no no no no don't worry about it [Music] hello hello roof campers how are you today [Music] hey literally [Music] i'll take care of this guy real quick i do need this food box all right so you've got a thompson you've officially made it to tier 2 of rust without a base congratulations guys [Music] i'll thank my distraction and i'll be on my way all right so we're getting up into pretty dangerous territory of this end the end that is the complete opposite of the spawn we're going to need some wood we need a base kind of near launch imagine all the big clans is oil rigged out this way large oil big claims probably going to be around here or there especially with the river exactly what we're looking for [Music] they live there and we live here yeah do we go back with the one shot in the double barrel again in the bow and save the uh the thompson for the next round i think we do i think we saved the thompson we'll see what's up all right it's time to go clan hunting [ __ ] hollow on the db so you know i mean business i know pookie just messaged me on my phone she's out right now getting the nails done what you up to i don't

[Music] come on guys come boost me [Music] all right now you run back in defeated desperation hoping you can pick up a gun that's been carelessly left on the ground and kill every single person there more often than not doesn't happen sometimes it does the hell is gone now and they're just gonna jump down and suck it all up [Music] let's go you're [ __ ] trash [ __ ] leave the game i'm trash right what the [ __ ] yeah what trash [Music] i wonder if the roof campers have come down off their ivory tower and are rating that uh base that's been active over there with a large furnace [Music] i got a custom with no [ __ ] bullets in my house do i have enough wood for any ochre [Music] this is it the official rest experience the last of my loot going all for the big play if i don't get it i turn off rust and i go and do other things and then i come back another day because [ __ ] this game can be annoying sometimes russ can giveth and russ can take us that's for sure that's a lesson everyone needs to learn oh now we are desperate now the old hatchet wait [ __ ] age old story man hey man give someone a table in the offline ranger you got to give them the business back it's the worst camper it's the roof campers it's the [ __ ] roof campers there could be an end to this story after all uh i think it goes to our right there all right [ __ ] it let's go get an mp5 for someone now i'm spending see so it's him it's that guy with his [ __ ] young gravy pitcher and that's the official rust experience for solos everyone your experiences may the breeze in the sky sees me
