(Hello, ONCE) (SANA's here) (MINARI's here, too!) (What scene will they film today
in front of the green screen?) Right now... The solo choreography.
(They will film the chorus choreography!) We'll film the choreography. We'll be  "MORE & MORE!" The title of our song is "MORE & MORE." To make...
(MORE TWICE & MORE TWICE) ...an overlapping effect, we filmed the dance one by one. (TDOONG's choreography
still shines on their own!) We danced the highlight! We each filmed
the key points of the choreography. This...
(Explaining the highlight dance) This, and this. I don't know
how it will turn out. (Won't it be great?) (Lots and lot of
TDOONG will be on it, like this!) I'm curious to check it out, but since it's one by one...
(Dancer YOO is slightly awkward) (Going over the dance before filming!) (Nervous) (Awkward) (One more time!) (Twirling)
(One more time!) Gosh! (JEONGYEON's laughing but not laughing...) It's supposed to be
a harmony of nine, but since I'm dancing alone,
it's embarrassing. (But once the filming starts,
Dancer YOO shows up!) (Perfect) (SANA stretches
before the filming starts!) (This time, taking position) (Move) (Move) (Angel Sha's common way to prepare) (Flap) (Flap) (Smiling Angel Sha's
common way to prepare) (Tee-hee) (Heh-heh) (KIM SANA, happy as always, ready to go!) (Sha-la-la) Favorite choreography? This time...
(SANA and MINA's favorite choreography?) The dance was incredible. The part we just filmed is a highlight, but there's also a dance breakdown, and the verses will have
interesting choreography, so... Everything's the highlight!
(Highlight from the the start to the end) For "So, one more time..."
(SANA's Pick) I was supposed to
raise it beside my eyes. I raised it
near my mouth, but it was easier and it stuck.
(SANA's mistake changed the hand position!) I did it wrong, but it's my favorite!
(SANA's favorite is the hand gesture!) (This gesture!) (SANA's filming is finished
with perfect choreography!) Thank you! (Moving on to CHAEYOUNG's solo scenes!) (Stray Kitty) (Freeze) Don't blink,
and try to stay still. (No blinking) (Kitty Chaeng calmly
closes her eyes and waits) (CHAEYOUNG's all prepared! Ready!) (Blinking at "Okay!") (Watching robot CHAEYOUNG
is the next person, DAHYUN!) If we're filming in front of
a blank screen like this, I can't figure out
what the music video will be like. (TOFUbot, ready?) You can look forward to it! (DAHYUN's mission:
Don't blink, stay still) (Worried) (Worried)
Only mouthing. (Staying still, but
DAHYUN's Fun TOFU streak shows up) (Bounce) (Bounce) Stay still, like a...
(Robot!) (Mannequin!) (Shoulders) (Calm down!) Can't I dance? (I'm a robot... I'm a mannequin...) (Shoulders fixed) (Success!) Choosing one is too difficult. In your opinion...
(TOFUporter asks back) Which part's the prettiest and coolest?
(You know the answer) DAHYUN's rap part! I hope ONCE likes it, too! (This time, filming the choreography!) (Tougher than ever with the dance.
DAHYUN is DAHYUN!) (Baby Beast drinks up
before her choreography filming) (Nervous Baby Beast's rigid smile...) (Tough Beast shows up
once the filming starts!) (CHAEYOUNG's solo filming is over!) (DAHYUN's powerful dance!) (And TOFU's powerful laughter) It's ingrained.
What should I do? (It's) (okay)
Can you do it? More... Sexy.
(DAHYUN, Sexy! Provocative! Okay?) (Sexy TOFU) (Provocative TOFU) (Innocent TOFU returns) (DAHYUN's solo filming is over!) (NAYEON revises the dance before filming!) (Fresh) (Fresh)
(Powerful) (Tough) (LIM Tough) (Freeze) (Even NAYEON forgets
the choreography at times...) (One more time!) (Nervous) (Worried) (Positive Biggest Baby, you can do it!) (Despite her concern,
NAYEON's choreography is perfect) Honestly, there are
so many highlights, and so many details
we want to tell you, but even the harder
choreography we did before felt much easier. This dance is
quite complicated. It's exhausting, too, and the dance is
difficult itself. So, the easy part
we can dance along to... ♪ So, one more time ♪ This is the highlight.
(NAYEON's favorite highlight dance!) ♪ Yeah, one more time ♪ ♪ Time ♪ (Perfect) (One more time) (Dancing MOchine appears) (Here?) (Here?) Even closer? It's right here.
(The new position is harder to decide...) (Creeping) (Okay, one more time!) (Charismatic) (Pretty) (Perfect) My favorite dance was...
(MOMO's choreography PICK!) (Thinking) (Thinking) The group dance
when Verse Two started. Was it CHAEYOUNG's part?
Oh, CHAEYOUNG's part. (The part where
the nine members dance together!) Everyone does this and... Bam! We turn around together. The nine members move in unity, so it's the best
from this dance. (Dancing MOchine) (Ready) (Pause) (MO?) (Even MOMO makes
mistakes when she dances...) (Tough) (Powerful) (Cool MOMO's perfect dance filming) This is our second summer song.
It's somewhat... Compared to "Dance The Night Away," it's quite different, I think. I haven't tried this concept, so it will be a fun and new music video. (JIHYO's solo filming START!) (Park JIHYO, Perfect JIHYO, God JIHYO) (Okay in one go?) One more time! (Park JIHYO, Pretty JIHYO, Cool JIHYO) (How about this time?) Okay! Thank you! (Thanks to her perfect dance,
it's over quickly!) (last member TZUYU shows up!) (She also revises
her dance before she starts!) (The tallest Baby's
stretch is extraordinary) (One, two) (One, two) (Ready!) (TZUYU does a perfect job
even on her own!) (Blank background)
Will they add CG? Won't they?
(Puppy TZU) (Confused) I'm curious to see it.
(The music video is something to expect!) ♪ Try to hide how you feel ♪
(TZUYU'S favorite choreography!) ♪ Try to run away from me ♪
There's this verse. NAYEON said...
(Our Biggest Baby!) This part was... This part was very good. (ONCE... Try to run away from TZUYU...) (No, no TT) The choreography was incredible. We struggled to keep up. It was that hard. We didn't cover it yet.
(Currently unfilmed dance part!) In the post-hook,
we do this and this. That part's fun.
(Fun JIHYO) The entire post-hook is great. (JIHYO'S PICK
The group dance after the chorus!) The rest of the filming
today is for the group dance. There's a lot of group dance. We're saving our energy. I'll do my best
for the group dance! Cheer! (Cheer) (Cheer) If we do great,
it will end quickly! (TWICE! Can do you it?) We should do it well! I will do my best! (TDOONG) (Cheer!) I'll do my best
until the end! Cheers! Let's go, TWICE!
(TWICE, TWICE, let's do it!) (TWICE's last group dance filming!) (Dancing TZU) (Photographer Chaeng) (So, one more time!) (MINA's graceful stretch) (They all get ready
before the filming begins!) (Don't get hurt!) (Checking the dance together
one more time!) (The group filming starts rolling!) (So, TOFU spots the cam again!) (Heh-heh!) (SAIDA getting along as usual) (Happy) (Happy) (SANA, look there!) (SAIDA heart) (Make a heart TT) - Where?
- The second hook. We look like hippies.
(MORE MO & MORE Chaeng TV) No, we don't. "We don't." We're hippie princesses. (Huh?)
(Shameless Princess MOMO) (CHAEYOUNG... Say something...) Huh! This is my house. How is this a house?
(MOMO, where do you sleep?) (MO?) (MO?) - Oh, in the middle?
- If you go there, there's another room. It would be great
to have a house like this. (MO?) (MO?)
This is my house. (Do everything you want!)
I just... ...allowed them
to film this place! But your house stinks.
It smells like paint. Oh, I heard I'll have
a lot of guests coming over, so I got it painted. That's why. It actually smells good.
(Shameless owner) (If Princess MOMO says so!) I love my new place.
(Princess MOMO's bragging isn't over) (Huh?) (Get it?) This is the swimming pool. Ah! That's the second place. Check it out. There and there, too.
(The bragging of her house won't stop) What's over there? That's the barbeque... You know. (Get it?) You can have a barbeque there. So good.
(Bragging MOMO, reaction queen CHAEYOUNG) My place is great! The water's moving! Yes, it moves. I made it move like that. Ah, (Princess MOMO, that's enough!) So cool! Who? You? Me, of course!
(Of course I'm cool!) That's good. (I see, our CHAEYOUNG's cool) You didn't know?
(I knew!) It's a long day.
(Time flies slowly due to the filming!) Let's guess what time it is! 8:00! No, no. 8:00? Don't change it. I think it's 9:30. Give us the time! (Current time: 8:00 PM!) Hurry up and dance!
(The penalty is MOMO's dance) (That's my penalty) Come on! Dance now. (Dancing MOchine) (Broken) (MORE MO & MORE Chaeng TV)
- See you next time -) (Perfect) (Sync) (Monitoring meticulously again!) (Snap) (Snap) (Pretty girl next to another pretty girl
next to a third pretty girl) Huh? If we move,
won't we stick together? (MINARI moves) (Shy) (Distancing MINARI) (Adorable sweethearts...) (ONCE, take SANA's love!) (MOCHAENG taking a break!) (Dancer YOO shows up before MOCHAENG) (Dun-dun) (Dun-dun) (YOO JEONGYEON) (Fun JEONGYEON) (The choreography filming starts again!) (Dancer YOO reappears
in front of everyone!) (Are you okay?) (Hop) (Hop) (Good job!) (Good job!) (Rushing) (LIM NAYEON can't miss
this impromptu performance!) (NAJEONG/2YEON's dance time) (Good job!) (Are you okay?) (Dancer YOO changes
the target to TOFUCHAENG) (Once again!) (TZUYU eventually chimes in) (The baby's applause
makes her sisters dance...) (Good job!) (Good job!) (Fun SANA steps out) (MORE TOFU & MORE CHAENG TV) (Enjoy "MORE & MORE") (Wait and see!)
(I miss ONCE) (We love you!) They'll translate it.
(ONCE, get it?) (See you!) (Random talk starts) It's torn! (Yep) Your face could fit through!
(Random answer) (Fumble) What are you saying? (Cute!) (Blank) Are you okay? They're replacing camera lenses,
so we're on standby. Replacing lenses. (Glare) (Whoa) (Heh-heh) JEONGYEON! JEONGYEON! Yes? (Where did the dancer go?) (Shh) TZUYU! (What's TZUYU up to?) (Did you call me?) (TZUYU) (Zoom-in) TZUYU, you weren't like that. What? TZUYU bends over sometimes.
Yes or no? (Yes-TZU) She does! (TOFU's sound breaks the silence!) Wow! It still works?
(Boop) (Boop) (Boop) Yes.
(Of course) - I can do this, too.
- Really? how about this? Yeah, that, too.
(of course) Show us!
(The hand fart rap!) It's been a while.
(Shy) (Fun) (Fun) (A huge fan of hand fart) (Mute)
(Son CHAEYOUNG, you're a pro!) What was it?
(Pretending not to remember) (OK READY) ♪ This is Hand Fart Rap! ♪ - Did you dance after that?
- We were incredible. - She did. "BBA SAE!"
- Oh, that was the "BBA SAE." (JEONG-TOFU-CHAENG
suddenly reminiscing...) I memorized the rap lyrics. When the other girls were performing, I memorized it
as I watched. - Didn't we do the same?
- Did you? Like this.
Recalling the choreography! (DAHYUN practicing the hand fart rap...) (BBA SAE)
(Boop) (Boop) Introduction! (After the short break,
they start filming again!) (TDOONG's simply perfect choreography) (Perfect) (Row) (Scurry) (Chatting break time) (A vitamin shadow approaches TDOONG) (Dun-dun) (Dun-dun) (Dun-dun) (Biggest Baby's show time) (Vitamin NAYEON
makes them laugh again!) (Passing by) (MINAYEON's fishing game) (Wiggle Wiggle) (Gotcha!) (Brr) (TWICE is HAPPY & HAPPY
even during break time!) (Serious yet charismatic
during the filming!) (So, one more time!) (MOMO NG) (It's okay, MOMO!) (In the meantime,
a birthday song can be heard!) (April 23
That day was CHAEYOUNG's birthday!) (A surprise birthday party for CHAEYOUNG!) (CHAEYOUNG
One strawberry cake coming up) (Birthday girl) (Strawberry Princess makes a wish) It's going out! (CHAEYOUNG) (HBD) Thank you so much! - CHAEYOUNG!
- Yes? Happy birthday! Thank you. You even prepared the lighting... And played the song loud! Very nice. It was great. I loved it.
(The party was even better together!) (Dear CHAEYOUNG, happy birthday!) - Thank you.
- Strawberry! (NAMO steals the strawberries first) See? They're gorging themselves.
(Party - cake mukbang = 0) (Is it good?)
The cake... Mmm!
(CHAEYOUNG, say "Ah!") (Yum) (Yum) (Yum) (Only strawberries)
Even the lighting... Best birthday ever! Thank you!
(Thank you, everyone) (My baby, mwah!) (Everyone enjoyed
CHAEYOUNG's birthday!) (Working hard for
the last group filming!) (Happy because they're together) (TWICE's hard work paid off) (in the "MORE & MORE"
music video filming!) (TWICE wrapped up
the music video filming!) Thank you so much!
(Enjoy "MORE & MORE!") (TWICE, TWICE, we did it again!)
