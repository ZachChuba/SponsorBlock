take it I need some help with something what do you say I'll give you drugs sure anything for Molly this is no winter not my efficient capitalized on more than just quests hey everybody welcome back we last off heading into the wilderness and that's because we're going to the major arena in order to purchase some cosmic runes and a bit we'll be going to all card to mind some silver and so we're going to be making some silver jewelry particularly a necklace of passage so that we can teleport into the dig site during the golden quest and we also need at least a MU little magic because it will give six major bonus over the a mule of accuracy and as we don't have wizard robes yet that should be pretty hopeful when teleporting into the wilderness if you can see that the web up ahead has been slashed it might be beneficial to world hop as somebody has been here recently and they could attack you you never know same goes for when we get to the major arena itself however even though the two webs are slashed when I'm running by I just chance it because it only takes a couple seconds to hit the lever and move on alright now that we're safely inside let's take a look at what gems we have we have four opals four Jade's two sapphires an emerald and the rubies and diamonds we can't even use yet so we can make an amulet magic at least one if not two necklaces a passage as well as a amulet of bounty and a dodgy necklace and perhaps a dueling ring so for now I'm going to buy six cosmic runes there are fifty GP each so that's 300 gold I'm gonna use about five of them and then keep one in the bank for emergencies alright back at the bank we're gonna pull out our kitten some food for it as well as our boots of lightness best axe and pickaxe and the Dwarven rock cake home teleport to lumbridge and turn in the quest to get a thousand Slayer and cooking experience we need to get at least level 20 cooking by the time we do ghosts ahoy and since this quest currently gets us 19 we need all the cooking experience we can get after that go and take the canoe to the champions guilt to continue Dragon Slayer and then mind a full inventory of clay to turn into soft clay for some upcoming quests ok so there's actually two options here option a is if I needed to make soft clay and or to purchase more strike runes I would head to Varro Keys Bank make the soft clay get the runes and then pull out my pickaxe and boots of lightness and then minigame teleport to clan wars run north to all card mine and continue on with around option B is if I didn't need strike runes and didn't need to make the soft clay I could just use the clan wars teleport now either way once we're ready we're gonna head to the all card mine and fill our inventory with silver or the world hopping each time before we leave make sure to mine an iron ore for the Lumbridge ez diary and then head south to the furnace to smelt all the silver after smelting the iron ore we need to head back to the bank and prepare to craft our jewelry I ended up settling on a necklace of passage and emulate a magic a dodgy necklace as well as an amulet of bounty so we'll have a couple cosmic runes left over in case we need to make anything later on as well also pull out these small fishing it as we'll need to head south of the bank to fish some anchovies for a Lumbridge easy task alright now let's pull out our runes to enchant the jewelry and then prepared to do the golden quest we are going to pull out our desert robes nickels a passage boots of lightness RT cape steel pickaxe as well as a bird snare and of course the soft clay and water skins as well as some food now let's use the necklace of passage teleport to the Eagles eerie mine 5 clay to satisfy a desert diary task set up our bird snare to catch a golden Warbler for another desert diary task and then seal a feather from the Phoenix not only for the golden quest but also for a medium diary task getting a lot of stuff done here now let's run south east to the ruins of user to do the golden quest at the point where the quest requires us to go to the dig site we are going to yet again minigame teleport to claymores run west to the gnome glider take the one-way trip to the dig site and talk to Eliza in the northeast portion she sends us to the exam center who then sends us to the curator in varrock however before we head to the curator we're going to stop in the varrock east bank to pull out a vial the papyrus we got earlier as well as a pestle and mortar chisel and hammer all right now let's go north to the museum and talk to the curator one thing I might not have mentioned yet because it won't become imperative until after we do Merlin's crystal she lavrov and making history is that if you go upstairs in the museum and talk to historian - he'll actually give you kudos for information on various quests you've done the important thing about the three quests I listed a second ago it's that when you do those he will give you a 1000 experience lamp which you can use on any skill above 20 and I think you already know that we're going to be using those on herb-lore to avoid a lot of the early level herb-lore grime breaking news once again I seem to I forgot something take a look at the screen and what do you see it says that we can get a 1000 XP lamp for any scale / level 20 and I said we're gonna use it on herb-lore which is what level 18 and guess what I make the mistake later of grabbing the lamps prior to getting level 20 herb-lore so then I have to carry them around while I do the entire priest in peril karanji and jungle potion sections so don't be me talk to him now also once we get up to 100 kudos we'll gain access to fossil Island and then add 101 kudos we can go back downstairs and talk to the information clerk who will give us 2,500 crafting and mining experience which we'll be using to avoid some mining grind so that we can get up to 39 mining to use a dwarf and stout boost to my be gold ore for the career Jez diary I know that was a lot of information but it'll come up again as we do it alright let's grab statuette that we came for and then nickels the passage teleport back to the desert to continue the golden quest upon getting to the point where we go through the portal head to the end of the room and use your chisel on the throat to get to cut sapphires emeralds and rubies now let's head back outside to finish the quest getting us a thousand thieving and crafting experience bubkis up to level 30 thieving which will allow us to start the food quest and we'll card let's take the carpet back to Shantae pass head Northwest to the monk south of the bank to start shadow with a storm note that if you use the black ink that we had before on the silver light and then talk to the monk again he'll give you a free new silver light which could come in handy at some point after that we're gonna head north east to Olly Morrison to start the food quest so that the next time we're in the desert we can continue it okay let's take a quick pause to discuss our next milestones and steps so one of our next major goals is level 30 herblore so that we can finish up all the easy Diaries in order to use their lamps as they're unable to be bank fortunately the cur ramses ii diary is special in that it's lamb doesn't require level 30 and a skill to use however it only gives 1000 XP versus the others two and a half thousand while doing the cramsey diary tasks we can also do jungle potion which will give us yet another 775 verbal experience and as I mentioned before the last thing we need to do the Korea easy diary tasks is the 39 mining also to get the 101 kudos needed for the 2,500 money experience from the information clerk we're going to do two of this three quests I mentioned earlier Merlin's crystal which is almost done and she lover of the third one making history will come later once we do priest in peril and start ghost ahoy when doing those will also be limping in nature spirit and inserts the mire queue because they allow for faster travel through the swamp will should be super helpful in doing shades of Morden later on for that last mm of experience we need to get to 30 speaking of nature spirit because we're a little card and I'm not sure when we'll be near another crafting store or furnace I chose to go east to the crafting shop to purchase a silver sickle mold before making a sickle to use during nature spirit okay time to pull out the typical boots of lightness are to keep one in food for the kitten then teleport to kinder monastery before running to Sears in Sears were gonna bank and pull out the tinderbox black candle and bat bones as well as ATX head to Camelot to finish up Merlin's crystal and immediately start the Holy Grail quest then home teleport to lumbridge take the canoe to the champions guild and run to varrock east bank alrighty now that we finished Merlin's crystal it's time to do shield over of the thing of our Shield of Rob is it requires a partner so it'll take a little bit of time to find one luckily there's a clan chat called OSR SSO a that you can use to find a partner for shield over off and hero's quest later on in the meantime while we search for a partner we're gonna pull out of pickaxe and go south to the rune shop to teleport to the essence mine to mine at least a hundred rune essence 50 of it we're gonna use for the precinct pearl quest and the other fifty we're going to use for a little bit of levelling some diary tasks and a few miscellaneous uses I mentioned before that we need level 13 moon craft to make a murder and for the I sub glyph request and with everything I just mentioned we'll still be over 500 experience away so we could either buy more essence and run more inventories of earth runes or after we finish Shield of harav in a bit we can go to the museum and clean some more fines to get another XP lamp remember it only has a little over a 1% chance but we'll also get some mithril and coal or dart tips darts arrow tips Jade's opals and even some big so it's a nice little bonus as well we also need to get one more of those ten kudo artifacts too because apparently everyone in their mother is a member of the black armed gang it took us a while to find a member at the Phoenix gang for the quest so I moved on to the museum to clean some fines while paying attention to the chat I noticed that you could actually make a decent amount of money for a free-to-play or a low level account just by being a member of the Phoenix gang some people were paying fifty a hundred even one guy was paying 300k just to get done with the quests faster so not a bad idea eventually I found somebody who luckily hadn't yet picked a gang so once they saw my message they picked Phoenix message me and a few minutes later we turned in Shield of Arafah god our quest point in 600 GP now let's head back to the museum to reap our rewards back the museum we can finally talk to the information clerk again to get that 2500 crafting and mining experience I've been talking about so much we already have over 101 kudos because not only did I just get that last 10 kuda artifact I need but earlier when we were at the Museum for the golden quest I talked to historian - and got kudos for the quest we've already done however we can now go upstairs since we finished Merlin's crystal and Shilla merav to get those to 1k experience unfortunately I must bear this cross for a few hours the worst part is it means I have to take an entire extra trip during priests and peril because I don't have enough inventory spaces to bring the rune essence into trips so it's a little note to myself to read my own route better in the future as you can see the first trip we had went pretty well we got a little bit of coins five Jade's which would be nice for making amulets of passage later on sumithra and coal ore the arrow tips will be nice for making some arrows so we can use for a little bit of range training and the darts will be the same I'm going to do one more inventory and if I get the lamp that'll be great and if I don't I'll just mind the dang rune essence and go craft more runes there we go at the very end of the second inventory we got the lamp as well as 400 more coins a lot more darts dart tips and gems as well remember that these lamps require level 10 in a skill and since we're only level 9 runecrafting and we need 150 for experience until we get to level we're going to head back to vorak east bank and prepare for priests in peril as well as a few more Barak easy diary tasks alright so back at the bank we've pulled out our armor and weapons and food to fight the temple guardian during priests in peril we've got the earth talisman as well as our small pouch from the abyss mini quest which we filled with runes and then we're gonna fill the rest of our inventory with runes so that we can make some runes for the bar of easy diary as well as for that little bit of extra room crafting experience so we can use our lamp to get up to 13 or in crafting we've also got an axe as well as coins because there's a couple tasks we need to do in the sawmill also don't forget to bring a little bit of food for your cat now let's be on our way and get these tasks done want to thank everybody again for joining us on this journey if you have any questions or comments please feel free to let me know and I'll see you next time have a good one [Music]
