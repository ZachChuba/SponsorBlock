good today and today we are here with a long-awaited dovestream for our new event light the shadow and today we are here with cenia game designer hey senior how are you doing oh we can't hear you you're muted we can't hear you damn no can you hear me now yes you see me it's time for the event and obviously we are also here with dennis uh your favorite lead designer i hope you are doing good today dennis hi yes very well very excited i think there's like some volume bar over your name i'm sorry for the i think that that's perfectly fine okay so uh without further ado let's dive into our discussion uh we will have a lot to go through or all the event stuff you waited for as well as some gameplay changes that comes with the event so this will be a long one guys so i hope you're ready and uh as you know the stream will be i mean the event will be coming tomorrow so i hope you are ready for everything that's in front of us and let's start with our introduction section so uh this is actually our biggest event so far it will be also be pretty long which we'll do in a second and uh it will have new mechanics uh more of everything basically uh even a new time of day uh and yeah i can't wait to talk about it for you guys and then maybe a bo maybe uh who knows you know if you don't know it yet then it's don't don't i mean okay you guys saw the trailer right and yeah it's it's a topic that you guys have been asking for the weapons as well as the theme of the event so uh i think you will all really enjoy what's coming up and uh after this event our next event will be uh halloween's event so obviously events are an ongoing thing in the game now and yeah we will have more to come after this one is done uh yeah so let's start with a small overview of the event as usual so the duration of the event maybe you saw our hashtags on social media with the countdown but like the shadow is coming in one day uh exactly at 2 p.m utc tomorrow so uh for uh european central time that would be 4 p.m but you can transfer it to any region and it will start at that time and it will come to all platforms together and uh yeah uh we have a new event theme songs uh that you guys already i saw you guys commenting on it and loving it it's actually available on all major uh streaming platform uh with port software blend band so you can find it on spotify uh youtube music uh apple music and everywhere else so make sure to check it out and listen to it a lot it's called light the shadow makes sense uh and we have a brand new event page which comes with all events which you will see the first time to when you log in and it will look something like this so maybe senior uh if you want to say anything about that page uh in particular it's like uh like for every event we have like welcome page with our tutorial cards which can give you like a brief small explanation what's what is this going to do uh what you're going to do there so like sarah you can see like some some split in between like throwing axe bow and arrow or maybe not because we didn't mention this before right and and some new objects uh some even event items maybe some something that will help you to earn more points and of course like brand new hunters yeah and obviously we will show all that in a second so uh i think uh uh yeah so as cenia mentioned you will earn all the exclusive rewards and maybe even more this time if you uh participate and put in the effort and we will actually have some new activities or new ways to earn points compared to our previous events but we will go into details about all that and we will also have some new mechanics in the game that you can use to help out with the collection of the points uh and it will look pretty cool so uh it will be fun and as i mentioned yeah all the new ways to uh earn points and we will have a very first time as a time limited event store which where you can buy some awesome stuff but we don't want to reveal that just yet either so you will have to wait to see that but this is also a new thing we never had before and i think it's time uh to uh dive into the biggest portion of the event or at least uh the whole new thing that's completely different about this one compared to the others is the choose your path so as you guys saw in the trailer there's two paths you can choose and let's talk about uh these paths so you have two initial progression path you have to take one is for the throwing axe we cleave the shadow and the other is the hunting bow which pierces the shadow so you will have to choose a side but don't worry uh even if you choose a side after you complete fun you will be able to participate in the other one as well and we have a different reward progression for both sides and as i mentioned you can unlock the second path after completing the first one uh if you guys want to mention anything in particular like just in the overused side then it's maybe i think we should dive right into the paths and then okay i mean step by step we can sure do that so uh then i think the first thing we should do is look at something really cool [Music] i love it yep so our first path is the throwing x so after you select the screen you select throwing x let's say in this case and then you will unlock a progression path which will give you instant access to the throwing x tool um one second slow down here we we have something to talk about um so actually when when as you could see on the previous screen there's the screen with a two pass selection and also there is even like a disclaimer that don't worry you will be able to complete both of the passes and we are not locking you after the making the choice from another progression but you just need to decide where you want to start so it's been said let's imagine that you picked the scrolling acts pass which will lead you to the uh new event page which will show you a little bit later with the different rewards there and rewards there of course it's like a skin for legendary skin for throwing acts a new um new legendary hunter as well as blood bones hunt dollars and even trade for uh scrolling acts so that's the first time when we when you will be able to unlock trade with the event progression and the first unlock that's going to be in the in the progression bar the base tool this rolling ax itself so when you start the progression you will need to collect some points to unlock this tool so it's not initial unlock but it's like the very first unlock in a 100 event points and you will get an uh get access to the uh base tool yeah which is the throwing x and uh we will have a gameplay section a bit later where we actually talk about how the new items work but first we want to go through the event part of the presentation basically and uh yeah so cena mentioned the unlock tree so let's just take a look at that page now so maybe you want to drive us through it yeah as a quick thing before we do that um so we mentioned already like that you're gonna unlock these gameplay elements obviously throughout the event right just a very important point to to mention right before because you can already see some questions popping up here and there of course once the event is concluded these weapons these equipment and all of the stuff that will still be available the only thing obviously that will be event exclusive is the legendary content as in the previous events but anything that is gameplay relevant will of course after the event be normally unlockable through the normal progression we have but for the purpose of the event you have to kind of work a little bit for getting your hands on that's why choosing the path and this thematic differentiation is so interesting for us this time around but also the good thing uh if you will be able to get it with the event it doesn't matter which rank you are you don't need to wait like the correct rank to unlock or follow the like uh different variants to unlock the stuff so once you reach the unlock and with event points that's yours no matter which rank you are yeah so this applies to trades uh as well for uh the weapons so let's say you can see there's a trade unlock for the tomahawk it doesn't matter what rank you are you will unlock it during the event but obviously after the event it will be tied to the regular progression system but we will also talk about all of that exactly a little bit later first now let's talk about the events and let's look have a look at the progression for the throwing axe yes so as senior mentioned uh on the throw exact side you can unlock get hand dollars uh blood bones as well as obviously two legendary skins uh for items and then one legendary hunter at the very end uh as the last reward we will show you all that in a second as well and as she also mentioned if you uh finish the path you will be able to uh continue in the other part so as you can see you will be able to continue the hunting bull path after finishing the x1 but uh we have a video to show of the progression system so uh well i'm showing that maybe say i can explain how it exactly works in action yeah so uh basically uh the the progression contains like you're already like familiar with with our progress bar and different reward steps so we have some in-between rewards in this progression which are uh hand dollars and blood bonds and also like unique skins and even trade which you you're looking just like earning points and you're getting this trade and you can use it after this again no matter which rank you are also their daily caps will be presented but one important thing the daily caps will be presented on the first chosen path so if you pick the scrolling acts as the first progression you will be uh seeing like daily caps in this progression but if your friend chose uh the ball hunting ball pass then locks will be presented there once you will move to the second progression uh daily locks will not be presented there so you can move like straight forward forward to to to the to the end of the second progression uh the one important thing here that uh bonus points like overflow uh not i'm sorry not bonus points but event points overflow is not going to be transferred to the second progression you should keep in mind that you start your progression with a zero point so if you completed the the first pass you will be automatically redirected and then you'll start the progression with zero but another uh nice thing there so in in the start of each progression you will get two boost consumables for three for both passes but a little bit uh later we will talk about both consumables exactly we will tell you how the boost works this time because it will be also a bit different than uh usually and so basically in a nutshell what you get is two times the same progression it's basically two inventive two events and one at first you pick one path and then you pick the other one and that means lots of lots of rewards which is really really cool exactly there's a lot of reverse download guys like it's crazy and they look so cool so with that being said let's look at the reverse from the throwing axe path the path of the x and the first one is a legendary winfield marksman called biophoenix and it looks something like this it's quite beautiful i like it it's finally like a skin for the for the winterfield marksman i've been waiting for that for quite some time now yeah i know a lot of people have been actually yeah as we as we promised and as we always say like eventually every weapon will get their skin even with multiple sometimes so um now it's the winfield's turn finally yeah you will not get some lore reading right now but you will have to do that during the event to find out about the story of each weapon so we didn't want to reveal that right now uh the second one is the legendary throwing axe itself which is the tomahawk and here it is so yeah it's obviously a brand new tool and a brand new skin for it right from the get-go and it looks freaking amazing yeah this is amazing i love it and uh the biggest reward obviously is the hunter for this path uh the third son and he looks something like this yeah it's really cool that basically each of the progression paths has like legendary hunter at the end so it means that technically you can just unlock two legendary hunters just by playing which is like double the amount you normally get which is great so i think everybody is happy i'm happy exactly and uh that's it for the throwing axe path uh and let's uh take a look at the hunting ball and uh let's just look at it in a second [Music] now what these things next it could be i don't know i don't know looks like some weird sticks i don't know could this be aerodynamic some weird sticks yes so the hunting bow path uh so similarly as to the last uh path the first unlock you get is access to the hunting ball which is a brand new weapon and uh the hunting bow comes with two traits which you also unlock during the progression path uh in that particular uh path and then you can also unlock three custom ml variants but we will talk a bit about them later in the stream but i guess you can see a bit of sneak peek of them right here there might be some hints there i mean we won't say what they are but you can guess i already see some guesses in the chat uh you guys are right not not all of you though and then uh as on the last path as well you unlock two uh exclusive legendary weapon skins that you cannot get anywhere else just during the event and obviously the exclusive legendary hunter at the very end of this progression tree uh and uh we also have an image of the progression tree uh xenia maybe you want to drive us through this as well yeah so basically uh the hunting ball progression is like a bit different that we all got used to from the previous event when we have like legendary skins and some in-between rewards like boots consumables hand dollars blood bones we kept it for throwing up but this progression is a purely gameplay unlock so uh it's an in between rewards you are not actually getting like pack of consumables or hand dollars no you're getting unlocked for a custom armor or a hunting ball you're getting unlocked uh traits there so you can you can get your hands like first there and try it out so that's uh that's the pro this progression about so basically when you're choosing the pass um i mean keep in mind that the gameplay stuff will be available after event is over so like exclusive stuff inside the event it's like legendary hunter legendary weapon skins uh and when you're choosing the pads like what are you more interested in like to unlock gameplay uh gameplay stuff first or just earn maybe some blood bonds or maybe hand dollars inside the progression or like which hunter even do you like more yeah which i think is really cool it gives you that choice like you can kind of even like complement each other right like so one guy in the team plays with the throwing axe first and then the other guy picks the bone arrow and you can kind of support each other because we're going to talk about how you can earn points etc in a minute as well exactly and uh just like in the other path if you finish this first then you will have a chance to complete the whole other path as well cine also mentioned it just now so don't worry i still seen some people in chat not knowing or not understanding when you finish one path you uh can move on to unlock the other one as well so you won't miss out on half of the rewards you get everything exactly just just just one thing to mention maybe maybe it might look a bit confusing because we mentioned that daily caps will be presented only in one first chosen progression but here we see like on the both rolling x and bow and arrow but just because when we are capturing it always like first chosen progression for us so don't worry daily caps only presented on the first chosen progression no matter which progression you you choose yeah and they're basically just like in order to allow everybody to kind of like get into this and not have people like complete the event in the first 24 hours so it just helps us to wind up a little bit because as you guys see in the beginning that event will go for quite some time we're talking about like four weeks of eventum which is uh quite a lot so we want to make sure that everybody still has also the chance to really go and unlock stuff and play with things as the event progresses also daily caps to allow you to earn some hunter xp so exactly and in mid level in the background i already showed the rewards a little sneak peek at least but now it's time to talk about them at least look at them in a bit more detail so we have a new legendary conversion pistol which is called faultless and it looks quite fancy that's this one is really nice because like as you can notice there like it's also uh there's like a physical change to it the geometry change where we kind of smooth out the whole drum so normally it is kind of like a little bit with the with the rims inside like as you know they're called a conversion pistol but this time it's going to be smoothed out similar to what the lemur looks like which is actually a lot closer to like the the the old conversion pistols of that area um so we wanted to give this bit more of a vintage look uh like someone has been using this for quite some time and the second legendary is for the hunting bow itself the wayfinder looks super this is this this is really really nice uh like i mean the hunting boat on its own is is quite a piece of work i really love it but like just being able to just go around it thematically like that just just that's like one layer on top for me personally and uh obviously the last uh unlock of the path is the exile legendary hunter she's also really badass so it will be a hard choice which one to get first which will you go for bence i will probably go for the hunting bow just to mess around with it [Music] but probably since i had the privilege of being able to play this for quite a bit already um i'll probably probably go for the throwing axe that way i can i can support the people i play with because like throwing axe is really really nice as a tool it's very very tactical like the flexibility it offers and what about you senior which one would you prefer i mean everyone is vaulting for a bow and arrow but like i said the gameplay stuff you will be able to get anyway and i think that the swords on legendary hunter looks dope wow okay yeah chat you can like uh write hashtag uh throwing extra hashtag uh hunting ball to uh write your choice and i guess we will count them i won't but uh yeah but actually if you're if you're playing with friends so maybe that there will be reason to split your choices like we we are going to talk about it a bit further uh but maybe there is a reason to pick like different passes and play together it looks really speed split actually i'm surprised that's cool to see though which is good that we did something right yeah that's really cool all right let's move on let's move on to the event points so uh we mentioned you have a bit more options to collect points during this event but we uh obviously have the similarities between previous event so you can collect event points in multiple ways first of all by exploring the map and doing such activities you know you're kind of used to that already uh playing the objective so uh in this case getting hives armored or the bosses but we will tell you in detail in a sec and uh a brand new uh way to earn points which you have been asking for a lot of you is pvp so that's a brand new thing coming with this event i know a lot of you are happy about that and it will hopefully help you progress a bit quicker if you're a great player so it won't help us much but hopefully it will help you and uh yeah let's just take a look at each category one by one starting with exploration so in this event you will have two ways to gain points in this manner and the first one is destroying a pyre which will gain you uh two event points and uh i think i can even show you how it looks in game um can we actually slow down here a little and just like give more more appreciation to like amazing amazing like artwork around this and just to explain a bit how this works so actually since like it's already like not a spoiler and video is playing so this time event objects are highlighted in the dark side so uh every pyre that locates on the map and every second object which is like plane like exploration part it's also highlighted in the dark side so you can see on this video then you're like changing the vision to the dark side it's like it has like this nice uh nice roots and nice uh white white coloring and v effects there so uh to collect points from the pliers you actually need to destroy this and we have another object that will be objects that will be seeded on the map it's word um yeah there we are so uh we please do not destroy words we are interacting with them and we are lighting it up so they they they are working in the way that every every team or every player like let's let's talk about team because even like single player one player it's like counted as a team every team can interact with once so even if you already interacted with this there might be another team who will come and can interact at once and get points and of course all points are shared within the team all current points words are also highlighted in the dark side as you might see there and the thing is that first team that activates it actually lights up these torches there so when next steam is coming and see the torches are lighted up so they they already can draw the conclusion that there was someone before them awesome so yeah that's the two ways to collect points by exploration uh see i mentioned it's shared between your team and uh and yeah it looks quite cool and she also mentioned all the interesting stuff about dark side but we will actually show you that in a second as well in more detail and uh if you have nothing to add cenia i think we should move on to playing the objective uh so uh both paths uh i mean let's say both weapons have a different way to earn points for the hunting bull uh you can earn extra points by killing hives uh with the weapon so you just have to basically kill the hive with a hunting bow and you will earn two points and uh with the tomahawk tool i mean uh sorry throwing x but you can use the tomahawk skin obviously you will also earn the two points uh for your whole team so uh then it's also mentioned that it's good idea to take different weapons into a game because then you can actually collect with both for your whole team and i see i see the questions popping up in the chat that like will be points shared if people inside one team playing for a different path and that's why uh we mentioned that might be a smart idea actually to speak different paths because yes if you're playing for hunting ball and your teammate is playing for throwing at all collected points they're still shared so you consistently uh can use the hunting bow to kill hives and earn points and your teammate can constantly use uh throwing axe to kill armory and still earn points and they all will be from the same pool and will be shared within the team exactly so basically one bearing is a hunting bow the other brings the throwing next to the third brings the sticky bomb for the bosses so that's how you can maximize your points and obviously get four points for each post kill is that tied to weapons or is that no you just just need to kill the boss and that gives you the points basically so so you can you can kill them with the new tool and the new weapon sure absolutely but you can also kill him any other way it's basically just to make sure that you like the object if you try to get to the boss you try to be close around the boss and and grab those guaranteed kills there awesome uh and have you mentioned that there's a third way to earn points which is pvp so this is quite straightforward you just have to loot the hunter uh corpse and you will gain five points for your team and we have a small video to show you this as well because it's completely new to the game yeah what's what's important here is maybe just as a quick explanation so we thought about like okay how can we introduce pvp into this into this role set and um one of the most obvious things could be yeah you know but just rewarding when they kill someone that the thing is like this game actually lives and breathes not having all the information and that includes not 100 sure sometimes knowing whether you killed someone or not and just keeping this a lit a little bit off circulated obfuscated so we want to make sure that that's that we stay true to this concept and so you know what like you can get points from pvp but it's bound to corpses and as a side effect obviously this also has an advantage for people for example bring vulture or just like sneak in the shadows a little bit because they can still go and get some points from rooting corpses even if they haven't been part in that fight they still have a chance to to get some of these points but obviously primarily awards to people that's that managed to fight other people and therefore yeah secure the corpse in order to loot it okay so that answered a lot of people in chat so you can indeed loot uh one corpse multiple times and the points will still count to the whole team uh yeah you can do them once per team once per who's looting it the year guy looting it from your team will get the points for the team but you cannot get them multiple times but other teams that might have a chance to loot that body still they can get their points as well for example if they bring the vulture trade that is okay and another question i've seen is that can you only do it for uh hunters your team killed or can you do it to any death hunters that hasn't been looted but i guess the voucher any corpse that might be still looted exactly so it's worth going around the map exactly it's about the looting action not the kill action so you want to make sure that you can you can secure corpses obviously if you burn them you don't have anything to stop the burning well then you won't be able to loot them which means you don't get the points so it's just part of the normal strategy now you have to consider whether you want to get those points or not and then there's multiple options for you to go about that awesome uh so we already mentioned the points are shared within the theme so everyone in your team will get the points you collected and vice versa so you will get their point it will be one pool of points and uh you will keep the points even if you died during the mission so you won't lose them or just keep on half you will keep all the points and uh we also have a new accolade card for the event as usual uh which you will be able to see after hopefully the first mission you played if you didn't die in one second you will see that and obviously that will also have the different tier a system so uh bronze silver and gold depending on how well you did and i believe that's about event points unless uh there's something else to mention here but i think we covered all of it and if you guys have a question make sure to write it in chat and um kind moderators will collect them and hopefully we can answer them at the end of the stream if you haven't already uh then let's move on to the new mechanics which uh cenia already touched on a tiny bit most importantly that event objectives are highlighted in dark side but they have a range which is default by default 10 meters and i think here we can show the video for this year and uh then we will also tell you how to increase the range you will see these uh event items so basically initial range which will be given to like every player by default and you will see the icon saying like 10 meters it will be at the start of the game for any event objects and they will be highlighted in the dark side like you can see like even like they're on this shot like compared to the clues how they are highlighted there so that's a clear difference like between clues wards and pyres there so you can spot them and you can pick the direction where you want to move uh so default range will be given uh 10 meters to where on the distance where you can see event objects in the dark side um so it's like literally to take like quick quick look around you and to realize if there's like in any house or anywhere nearby any objects but you act you will be able actually to increase this range and this time we also have like uh known boost consumables they they they're called vapors and uh besides boosting event points like for any other previous event they will also boost uh highlight for uh highlight range for even even objects and maximum range what you can reach with the use boost consumable it's a 70 meters because range has 70 meters hard cap on top so you can't actually move like brother even if you're using like uh a lot a lot of consumables uh you still can increase maximum maximize your amount of points but maximum number of uh meters that you can increase with a boost consumable 70 meters and 70 meters that's a lot that's enough half a compound basically yeah so again 10 meters is the default and you can boost it up to 70 as a maximum and i think in the video we showed it was 55 meters or somewhere in the middle but uh it's quite cool and uh how the all the highlights work and i think it's like a really funny or fun new mechanic to the game that makes the event very unique and uh yeah so you mentioned the vapors the new consumables so uh let's just talk about them a bit uh we will have three uh different types of them 15 proof vapors for 40 blood bonds in the store and they will increase your points collected by 15 percent and the 5 meter range boost to the dark side enhancement uh i already seen people asking if it works for the whole team or just for you um yes both event points and like french meters they are shared within the team but like i already mentioned uh range has a cap 70 meters so all boots consumable they're stacking and if the maximum amount of boost event points that you can reach it's like 600 um but range will be kept at 70. so 70 it is the maximum uh yeah as we mentioned you get one of these items uh on the beginning of your progression to start physically two given time that's even better yeah uh then uh we have the medium-sized version of this which is 25 uh proof vapor for 80 blood bones and this will increase your points collected by a 25 and uh a 10 meter range boost to your dark side vision and then the biggest one is the 50 proof vapor for 130 blood bones and this will increase your points collected for the whole team by 50 and your dark side range for uh the event uh interactable items by 50 meters i would like to clarify one thing because like there is like in the chat like uh consumable increase your vision inside the dark side only for event objects so for pyres and for words nothing that we're highlighting anything else and you can increase the range like by buying the consumable now that's specifically only for event objects which are highlighted with this like nice white white effect there so event only yeah so it's basically just to boost your points for you and your team like you don't really gain an advantage over anyone you can just find the objects a bit easier and you gain a bit more percentage of points so you can unlock those legendaries a bit quicker and uh yeah we can also show you how it looks in the game with the example of the 50 proof one yeah so after that animation you will be able to uh as we mentioned you can see the numbers like change in the bottom left basically and then that's the stack for the team depending how much you boosted it so it's pretty much the same mechanic as we've seen from from other events where after consumption which you normally do in the beginning of the round the effect comes into effect obviously but you can also if you want for whatever reason wait and do it at any point exactly and uh i think that's about the vapers uh and you may ask at this point that oh are we having only 200 just just to hunt just two hundreds i mean it's it's only double the amount of the normal events we had last time right like just two okay we give you more so as we mentioned in the beginning we will have a time limited event store for the very first time and in that particular store you will be able to buy some legendary with blood bones so you can buy a legendary meth kit called the wax wing just in the store and just during the uh the duration of the event so you won't be able to buy it afterwards and a legendary hunter as well the wafer but if you want to get both of them then you can get a bundle uh with like 20 10 off and get both legendary uh hunter and skin together in a bundle um but keep in mind that those uh items and and they're they're event exclusive as well and they will be available only in before for the duration of the event so in the event store page where you can be where you could buy uh vapors and where like all other boot booth consumables locate and you can you can find the those items there but only for the duration of the event exactly so uh let's look at have a look and uh then we will also show you uh the store page so uh the first state kit as i mentioned called the wax wing uh looks something like this i really like that it goes very nicely with the hunters it's very thematic and now i can't choose between the quilt snap or this one i always base it a little bit off of the the hunters i'm using so i mean i have the full collection so basically it's like it's my little my little purse for my name a little purse for tuesday so i can i can basically match them against my hunters which is actually really really nice um so this one obviously will be my go-to for the event yeah i see some people laughing at first aid kit but let's be honest here first aid kit is one of the most used items in hunter like you will see it every single fight probably if you're not uh some crazy six star hunter uh and then uh we have the legendary hunter the wayfarer and she looks awesome what it allows for is basically that if you go in with a trio for example like each of you guys can have their own unique legendary hunter themed for the event so i'm very curious to see how many how many teams you'll see running around with with like a mix of these uh very awesome hunters yeah you like literally can reconstruct our trailer right yeah exactly i mean you can reconstruct it on both ends but i would suggest to use the one for the guys that actually kill the others and uh yeah here is the store page uh that i mentioned uh you can see uh the med kit costs 300 uh blood points the hunter 800 and you can also see the vapors there and uh yeah this is the wax pink in particular then this is the wayfarer super cool and then obviously uh we have the bundle i mentioned so for 990 blood bones you can get actually both the math kit and the hunter but keep in mind if you purchase like single item like separately hunter and separate the med kit bundle will disappear because like you already purchased one one one item out of like two this pair so like be careful if you want to obtain bundle better to obtain bundle it's it's a nice optional thing i really like that i mean just like with the vapers um i mean none of that is essential right this is this is um the chance for you to see hey i really like that i would like to get on top but you don't need the vapors to to unlock all of your other content you can just keep on playing and that's perfectly fine but if you want to speed up things a little bit um this is like your chance to do it and if you want to get more variety even then you also have the chance to do it by just getting these skins while the event is running exactly and uh i think some of you may asked at this point like oh are we only getting three hunters this time yeah it's really weak this time we should be ashamed of ourselves and uh we got you covered we have one more you might have already seen that one a little bit we've teased it a little bit earlier and with that being said let's just take a look at something quickly [Music] [Music] [Music] uh yes you uh saw it in the trailer uh there's a ford hunter and even more than that actually that uh you can actually or you get right now on steam it's available the buy rate dlc you can already get so you can even play with this hunter before the event which is kind of crazy but you can get it right now basically it's already available um as a as a dlc so if you only want to get into the mood for the events you can you can go to the servers tonight already using one of the four if you get the dlc exactly and oh only for hunter sorry we can't increase it this time but maybe next time you know and uh yeah so only only four hunters then yeah and only four hunters on the what is it like six skins seven i don't know quite a lot it's it's it's a it's a huge amount of content i'm really really happy how this all turned out so um you can you can maybe see our excitement a little bit here today yeah that's you seen it in the little uh trailer for uh favorite is the new legendary knife the new legendary springfield compact striker and the legendary hunter and uh we actually also have a small video just to show you the two weapons so let's take a look at those here's the striker looks super cool and the knife urban yeah i really like that yeah they both look really cool and they fit together perfectly with the hunter as well this is also something which is uh important to understand so since this is a dlc it will be available all the time right so even when the event is over this is your way still of being able to get a legendary uh like uh um like native american hunter and uh it will be available if you want to get it for christmas you can get him christmas you want to get him like middle of the year you can do it as well so he will be just a regular dlc and you can buy them whenever you you feel like it also worth to mention regarding the uh blood bond items in the store page so once you unlock them with the blood bonds during the event of course they will stay with you so it's not some something that we are taking away after the event is over it's a permanent unlock but it will only be available um to unlock um during the event time while the dlc just to repeat that will be available throughout the year once we introduce it and there have been some people asking the when's coming to console um as i know this will be also very very shortly um usually just like there's a bit of a delay in in some of these so expect that also to to come online very soon and very much within the the time frame of when the event is going so you will be able to play with all of those four hunters easily on all platforms while the event is running and while we're talking items in the event store page it's also worth to mention then in the quick play you will be able to find uh 15 proof press so not only only in the event store but also in the quick play matches because like i see i see um questions popping up there about like hey will be seated there yes and and there's a hint in there yes there will also be quick plays so um as you as you guys might remember from from the from the last time when we had our boss revealed scrapping event like scrapping obviously can't be in quick play so that's why we prioritized giving you guys a chance to experience a new boss this time around um things are looking very good so there will be a quick play from the beginning and hopefully also still at the very end so let's see how you break the servers guys but we're all very hopeful and it's looking all very good awesome and uh let's just take a look at all uh the skins as well including the dlc like for the other so obviously we have uh the legendary hunter uh do you pronounce it wraith dennis maybe you must so i i wouldn't be able to tell that with full confidence but so far i've always referred to him as tashi wrath pesce russo so he's included in the dlc and you will be able to read his uh backstory as well probably already on steam actually so just give it a look when you can and the two legendary weapons starting with the nice knife verbena which you already seen in the video looks really cool and the springfield compact striker over its hand which is also super badass with those drawings and markings and it fits the knife really well and the hunter as well so i mean it makes sense and i think that's about our dlc don't forget that it's already available and it will be available on console very soon and as dennis mentioned you will be able to get it after the event is over as well so that's not time limited or time based and uh before we dive into our game play a segment let's just quickly take a look at all our legendary advanced weapons that you can get during the event just so you guys won't forget and then we will dive into our gameplay changes uh for the ball for the new time of day and the throwing x as well also maybe just to wrap it up about the event so two progression you will be able to complete them both so in one you will get like only gameplay unlocks it's a hunting ball pot for throwing acts that also will be progression will be filled with some hand dollars and blood bones and also i think worth to mention that um if you already unlocked this the gameplay stuff like traits bass weapon uh or custom armor and if your precision during the event while event is running you still will keep this so you are not losing it but of course if event is over and you decided to prestige after the event of course you lose it and you will need to unlock it with the ranking system that's some really really cool stuff here i'm super super super excited and you won't have to wait much it starts tomorrow at 2pm utc yes okay and it's a time to talk about the gameplay before we head right into it didn't you say a couple of words so like so this this event is something which has been very special for us like um when we started um investigating into like oh what type of events would be interesting in hand showdown like what type of really cool like engagement do you go what do you want to offer you guys like the native americans have always been been one of our top choices and due to the way we implemented things and obviously like certain events like halloween like the dates don't move right so they they kind of kind of like affected our priorities a little bit in terms of how we organized our events how we moved uh to to implement it and make them aware to you guys so that that now if we finally have a chance to come back to to to this event which has been really really dear and precious to us and one thing that is also very important is that this can be a very tricky subject right native americans and specifically like the perils of indigenous people at the time it's something you have to be careful about because you want to treat this with respect you what you don't want to just like make an indian versus cowboy thing here right you want to be respectful of the setting you want to incorporate it and you want to give them representation and because it's important for us to kind of showcase this little but we also have a blog post that we released yesterday which gives a bit like behind the scenes impression to this so i think this will be posted in the link here as well for people interested so if you if you want to understand more how we went about that topic how we how we made sure that we want to treat this in a respectful manner but incorporated in a very interesting way into into the han children universe then read up on it in that in that blog post and i'm pretty sure you guys will like what you see there as well it's been a very very big pleasure working on this exactly you can find the blog obviously the hunt website or any social media will direct you to it so make sure to read it it's actually very interesting read as well i think and uh i mean there has been a few questions regarding the event but i think we can answer those at the end and uh first let's just introduce all the other new things coming with the event uh hand in hand basically how does it all play yeah exactly so uh first of all you guys have seen that we have a new time of day which we named sundown and uh this is our interpretation of task so uh maybe dennis you want to talk about that a bit and have it so basically we looked into like different times of days and and it's something we just over and over again again and again we're going to release new times of days because they they just add interesting things um like we we added uh initially to the golden we added like the neutral um we added uh the the um the the sun um sunrise um time of day with the early mornings and now we want to add one for sundown now we treat this technically as a low visibility um time of day so while we have at the moment on life we have um three times of days which are at daytime so our neutral time of day um the the sunrise time of day as well as the golden time of day we also have two low visibility ones which is fork and night and now with sundown we're adding a third which means we're gonna actually get like a fair split between them in terms of like three four no visibility and three for daytime and uh sundown will just basically appear in a regular rotation as per the rolls off of the low visibility ones so you just come across it here and there as a new time of day as you play the event and obviously it will stay around after the event for you to enjoy yeah so as dennis mentioned it will stay permanently after the event is over and it will be available on all three maps obviously so uh it will be just a brand new time of day in the game and yeah thank you for uh pointing out that i've wrote interpret day on but aeon is a great game so it's it's fitting there and uh let's let's just take a look at the new time of day in a few pictures uh it's quite beautiful actually i think so i really like it what you can also notice when you play this like the light sources they're much more much much stronger like a stronger contrast so you see like the the the fire effects and etc um so you see more than obviously you can see on the night map or on the fog map there's a further range but still like you kind of like need to squint your eyes sometimes to see what's going on because you're just like in this twilight like uh dusk setting where just there's barely any sun left and night is starting to creep in it has like a really nice transition uh in the colors it's like really beautiful like purplish almost i think it's really fitting actually we have a few more pictures to show you guys this is like off the edge of the map obviously so as i mentioned before basically sundown will have the same chance as neither [ __ ] to appear really pretty okay and uh with that uh being said uh i think we should talk about the part yeah let's talk about the ball everyone wants to talk about it now that's weighted enough let's let's get to it ball confirmed for real now so let's just look at it we will have so much stuff to show you here so you won't be disappointed so uh let's look at it as you can see it may have multiple arrow types possibly we've we've pulled that one before then so let's show them yeah okay so the uh hunting boy is going to be a new medium slot weapon you will have to hold the fire button to charge a shot just like you would do with a ball obviously you will be able uh to equip multiple customer monition on it as well if you unlock them obviously so it will carry four types of arrows including the base one so the base one and three new it will have four to choose from but it can carry two at a time basically as normally the single shot weapons yes every so yeah it's down to how you equip them before whether it's regular errors or any of the um custom arrow types that we talk about in a second what's also very interesting here is is that as a medium slot weapon right it offers a lot of different tactical options for you guys and how to how to incorporate it into your loadout like the for example it's always been one of the downsides of the crossbow or some of the more specialist weapons that um you cannot commit that if they are a large slot weapon right which makes sense because crossbow is a very powerful choice especially with some of the ammunition types it hasn't but the bow is much more of a flexible um weapon which we'll see in a minute as we talk about and actually see the gameplay so that's why we decided to make this a medium slot weapon so you can pair it up with quartermaster or you can go and pair it up with two medium weapons and since it's actually rather precise even at medium distances that actually still can go very nicely hand in hand for example with a dual wheel set or a shotgun or anything which is more close range so um it will be interesting to see what type of like kits what loadouts you guys come up with uh to combine them be that's like a special ammunition shotgun with it or be that's be that like still maybe like the classic uh more than obvious for safety purposes it's up to you guys will be very interesting to see on top of that it also comes with two new supporting traits so these are two traits that work exclusively for the hunting bow which we'll also talk about in a second and then yeah when the event is over uh this ball will be available for rank 55 sorry 54. um but obviously keep in mind that while the event is running so for the next four weeks you will have to unlock it for the progression of the event um so if you choose the the progression with a bow it will be very quickly unlocked but if you choose the one with the throwing x then you have to first complete that before you can go to the to the uh progression and then get it in the end of the day everybody will still be able to go and complete both progressions but once the event has concluded um and for example you didn't didn't participate in the event shame on you um then uh you will still have a chance to unlock the bow uh the normal progression so none of the gameplay elements are exclusive for the event they're just obtainable first through the events duration once the event is over they're regular part of the game and you can unlock them in a normal manner and the same goes to the ammo arrow types as well as the traits you for now you will unlock it through the event but obviously after that's over you will unlock it regularly like you do it with everything else in the game and it will come with a cost of 700 in the store after the event or even during the event right that's all don't do it you still have to pay for it still have to buy it uh but but uh yeah it's basically it's it's it's uh it's it's a i think a very fair price for what it can do with flexibility it gives you so yeah but again let's see if you guys uh think otherwise let us know give us feedback and as we do always i'm pretty sure the future patches might then adjust it up or down depending on what we see but let's have a first look at the bow now so as you can see now this has a charge mechanic right so um that means unlike the crossbow um just like pressing the button will not give you a very strong shot because it still pulls a little bit with a delay and then fires with a low power only if you keep the button pressed will it actually start keeping charging up and go to the maximum power setting so you have a trade-off with this weapon between being able to kind of like rapid fire or spam arrows even to a certain extent um obviously they drop off much faster they they actually have weaker damage and and slower travel time as a slower travel speed but you have a chance to actually keep on shooting which gives it much more flexibility however if you want to go for that precision shot this is when you have to pull in obviously you can't sprint during that time you know bow and arrow probably from so many other games so you kind of know what to expect there and it just gives you a chance to do like these mid-range precision shots also or just cut up close um just bring bring targets down much faster because of the higher power and therefore also the higher damage that the charge chart will do um straight forwards yeah so we can we can go the next one so um this one here is basically just like to see how this goes against grunts again if you if you shoot at the grunts uh depending on where you hit them sometimes it might not be enough to kill them just spin weak shots and the last one here has been a power shot obviously you must mostly kill like a grunt with the power shots uh unless maybe you hit him in the leg or so um so nothing really out of the ordinary there but that means basically if a couple of grunts are rushing you even with a bow and arrow you can just quickly usually fight them off if you have a couple arrows left and the fire rate is rather high for the low weak shot basically so you have a chance to fight them um quite effectively it's a very great tool technically or it's a weapon but obviously as a multi-purpose tool for you as a player in your in your sandbox that can complement very nicely uh like players or either running around solo or trying to prefer stealth gameplay um and it's a very nice alternative for example to the nikon pistol or dual negan pistol silencers or any of the large slot science weapons yeah this one shows the cancellation yeah so so basically um if you press the reload button you will you will basically undraw you will cancel the draw so you don't need to do any weird like quick swap weapons whatever in order to like like go off to another gun and then uh go back in order to cancel um you will just be able to just cancel it so in case you you're miscalculated or the target has been killed by by your but your partner before whatever you can just press the reload button and it will it will cancel the charge yeah and some of you already asked if you can retrieve arrows or not well here's your answer of course you can if you can find them but luckily for you guys uh the latest update also has um i've adjusted uh the boltz rate which also works with arrows so if you are uh if you would like the type of person like myself who just like loses track of all the stuff all the time like this trade actually helps you quite a bit in order to retrieve at least a good amount of them um in case uh you had a kind of stressful fight let's take a look at that once more uh meanwhile we can answer like some people ask if you uh is it special ammo or uh can you loot them from uh so this this is special ammo just like the crossbow bolts um you will get them from special ammo boxes um or your own ammo box if you bring one um that being said though um there is a higher capacity uh with arrows for example compared to the bulls just because um you have you have this higher rate of fire and the chance to also fire them as a weaker shots so this is a little bit uh um like down to you um that depending on which arrow types you kind of kind of put in keep in mind you have two ammo slots right so you can either bring two normal ones so you bring a special one or two special ones really up to you and uh have a chance to kind of adjust this to your play style as long as you can you can find them and retrieve them usually i never run out of arrows but in some prolonged fights it can really happen or if you start using special ammo types obviously because i mean some of them might not be retrievable um yeah so you have you have a chance to to do some really nice like tricks with this like so with the crossbow for example the problem is always that you have a very long reload time right so you have a very fixed time between shots here you can you can do combinations you can do your primes really uh powerful initial shot and if that doesn't kill uh you have a chance to follow up with like some weak errors like as you can see like you hit him around the tower then he's running away and you just give him like a like a small little weak shot which was enough in this case to down the player so just makes it very flexible um arrows do bleeding just like the balls do um so that means um if you if you get hit by a weak shot obviously that's that's a weak bleeding effect if you get hit by like a by a full charge shot that might give you a stronger bleeding effect so it's just something you guys have to play around with a little bit get the feeling for it um it will feel very intuitive very quickly like it's very satisfying to do to do kills with a bow and arrow and overall usually good fun what we've seen in testing so far yeah meanwhile we can look at the longer range fight scenario yeah here so like bone error is awesome but it's not it's not always winning so obviously the longer the range the more you will be seeing yourself at the disadvantage um as like you have to consider the drop you have to consider the lead time um i mean an arrow flies with things like 200 something meters a second which is rather slow um so in this particular case then uh it might be hard for you to actually use it effectively at longer distances but if someone is actually holding still if you if you've spotted like someone behind behind like some cover somewhere on the side peeking out you can do some really impressive long-range shooting with the bow and arrow as well if you hit yeah yes and then uh one of the south air gameplay as you can see like i mean it's like with any weapon you would have had probably would have made that kill but just like making that with a bone error as a science weapon it's just super satisfying it feels really really good so much of this weapon is about just the feeling of it's the play style and and just like uh kind of role playing a little bit playing like a really like like stealthy i mean just imagine like like the new models using them also even like like some of the more savage hunters we have like kane just running around uh with that thing it's it's it's very very impressive and makes you feel really cool if you make managed to like pull off some of these kills but then again you're up against rivals you're up against like like modern weaponry so a bone arrow isn't automatically always the best choice so that's why it's good to be able to complement it as a medium slot weapon with other weapons as well so that you can choose when right time for the bone arrow is and when to maybe resort back to your shotgun or rifle or some other weapon or maybe your second bow it's also a possibility and as you saw it in the clip you can insta burn hunters with style this time i mean you can't do the event points if you do that so i mean unless you put it out obviously okay and uh we mentioned that it comes uh with multiple arrow types as well so let's take a closer look at those yeah so the first one is the poison arrow um it kind of goes without saying it's rather straightforward um this one is actually very interesting because it's different to what you already know from the hand crossbow with the poison balls which on the hand crossbow it kind of like impacts and then shatters and leaves a cloud for for some time on the spot right that's different with the poison error the poison error actually remains intact because it has a normal pointy tip like like a broadhead and that means it sticks to targets uh it only does the the the poison damage though initially but it also does bleeding damage so you get poison and bleeding in one weapon and one ammo type which is really really powerful and on top of that you can also retrieve the arrows the downside however is that you only have very few of those arrows available so we're talking about like three extra errors compared to i think it is eight extra errors or this is from from from the regular ones so if you bring poison arrows they're very powerful but you want to be really taking good care of them because um like if you just bring two sets of poison arrows that leaves you at six plus one seven seven arrows and that's not not a lot um so you wanna be very very careful with that so sometimes you just wanna combine it with other error types or you wanna go completion but as you can see it like i mean it's super powerful you just hit ai anywhere right and they kind of die very quickly or like a power shot even a distance can kill can kill that armored it's it's a very effective uh weapon against against ai like all poison um ammo usually is it's it's favoring towards the e um and killing ai and because of the bleeding damage and the high damage you can obviously still do some very good killing against even hives with this one but you just have to understand and learn when to do power shots like when you charge them up or when you can maybe just like if you have good aim just like uh drop enemies briefly by just like doing a weak shot so mastering the bow is is a very interesting challenge and it's very good fun exactly and i think uh in this video you could even see how you switch between the ammo types which some of you have asked that right there i mean not ammo but arrow types this time yeah yeah but works like with the with the poison any hit would have just done it right in this case i mean we're talking about killing grunts obviously which is like the biggest offense you can pull off and in this game but still um like being able to just like uh reliably dis dismiss and dispatch like uh some of the ai is powerful obviously here like a powershot against an emulator with poison um allows you to to to still kind of make it blow up and die on the hive i mean if you hit the head that's still going to be the end of that hive mercury so the the the emulator um basically blows up because there's still there's still basically a tip right it still pierces the skin so it's the same way as if you for example use an axe against the emulator or bomb plants right they still go off but they die instantly in this case so that's what effect you've just seen there on the rail tracks with the emulator dying from the poison but still because he pierced the skin he blows up in his final act of defiance awesome and then we also have two other types of uh custom arrows so to speak let's take a look at frag arrows yeah oh this this is this is an interesting one so everybody goes like oh my god refract explosive no don't worry so this thing has an impact fuse but it's a delayed impact fuse that means uh whenever it hits um like the ground or an enemy whatever it takes like a second and a half roughly before it blows up so there's a delayed fuse in it which means this is really cool for for like shooting into rooms or or like being being a bit more tactical but it's actually not that good in direct combat because people can can get quite some distance to it before it goes up and this is also not lethal like um it will take some damage and it's inconvenient because it does the bleeding as it is a frac charge not a dynamite or explosive charge but this is more of a of an instrument to flush players out or enemies out obviously you can also use it against the eyes we will see in the video in a second but it's uh it's not the main purpose this one is something you can use in order to stir up chaos like you shoot it up in a hunting tower on the lantern's burst using it against ai is not the preferred way of using it and if someone is running away from moving around you will not be able to really lead that target in an open field and make reliable hits against them so this is a very weak charge so direct hits will not insta kill any players it's purely relying on the on the fragmentation bleeding damage and it's just an annoyance rather than a direct kill weapon for that you want to use your regular arrows but it's a nice tactical piece of your of your swiss army knife where you can just pull it out the right moment in order to get the tactical advantage some people are asking if you can diffuse it um i don't think so at the moment honestly um it's so much like the the bomb plants like that this this is internally consistent that it it is not diffusable we might add that at a later point um it might systemically interact with um with uh with the choke i'm not 100 sure how exactly that is in in the final final implementation we did but um overall um just the fact that it has a bit of a delay on it um and so you can easily run away from it's just you probably don't even want to run towards it honestly here's a really nice play using it on switching to the regular bolts or arrows yeah it's just like trying to flash them out there a little bit get a bit of splash but not much but you actually want to use the regular arrow in order to score that hit we have another pvp clip for the frog i mean that had to happen right the classic bell tower scene yeah oh the drop was oh that happens sometimes i feel that yeah i could afford to be fair but where the guy is up there right oh he's gonna take the letter down maybe not oh so as you can see the edge was lethal but the frag arrow was not looking at the father with death screen though what was important for us is like we didn't want to just replicate the weapons types or the ammo types that we've seen on the chrono crossbow we want to offer something new and uh um basically um for that purpose uh we we came up with the idea of like if we still want something explosive but maybe just do something with frag first off like the the chat will probably freak out the moment they read it until they understand what it actually means but also because we think it's really good fun so um in this case uh i think this is a very nice addition and i can't wait to see how you guys play with this technically and yeah blur people out this is going to be meta very much not and yeah with that thing so let's look at the third one which is also a bit of an extreme one i think which is the concertina arrows yeah so this is also an interesting one again goes three right away here um now this this this one is as tamed as the frank arrow is keep in mind we're talking about a very thin arrow we're talking about very little stuff you can basically attach to it so all of the effects are rather weak and subtle now they're still interesting enough that you can do some technical choices with it so for example you can use the concertina to i mean if you hit a play with it you can entangle them a little bit which is really cool for crowd control but like you probably would have just hit him with a regular arrow as well probably easier because the regular arrow fires with less trajectory right it's faster all these special errors are fracking arrow they're slower there they have more ballistics like more more curvature on them which means they are much harder to aim so i guess the direct attack isn't the best option of what you want to do with the concertina one but you can use it technically you can use it at windows you can use it at the boss layer you can you can use it just generally in situations where we're just barring the uh electron entrance just gives you an option of steering things up and in this case like i mean that doesn't feel very comfortable i can tell you sure you can't jump out anymore but still like this is not what you want to encounter and the same obviously in the ground level like if you have any buildings um uh doors etc you can trap players or you can maybe on the way when someone is chasing you it should shoot it behind you and just mess up that day because they they now have to find a different route so it's it's just a technical option do you want to main um like a bow and arrow with just concertina some people probably will but it's probably not the most effective but more of a meme option but combinate combined with maybe some regular arrows this can be giving you some really nice tactical choice oh he missed the bullseye on the back so yeah we'll be interesting to see how you guys play with it and and uh two like interesting situations um curious to read how many people got like theirs their life saved because of some really weird trick they pulled off with that thing let's look at it once more i keep in mind like all of the all of these special uh arrows they are very low count right so you don't have many of them um so you have really have to really have to be careful with your three shots you have um well four if you put it as the first because it's like the one that's loaded on top but it's it's not a lot and if you want to go for example like um two uh two bows um and each of them gets like uh two ammo types of concertina uh first of you're in for quite some money but uh also like uh it's still not a lot of a lot of things you can do with it right you're very limited so it would be interesting maybe for a round or two just to meme a little bit and try things out but that's not sustainable in any way and probably won't get you that many kills but you could technically bring into uh both right it's up to you i mean you can also bring bring four pistols into dual sets right now right i mean makes sense you can be fun it limits you and your tactical choices somewhat i guess but that is ultimately your choice okay and i think we are done with the arrow types but we also have some new traits for the arrow and the first one is a duke law so this trait enhances the melee attack for bow and arrow so you can even melee crazy with the bow and arrow now and it will unlock at rank 67 uh obvious that this only applies after the event as we mentioned before as well during the event you will unlock it on the event progression and uh it will cost to upgrade the points to equip hunter before we start the video on it um so so duke law is an interesting uh choice and we found this would kind of add something to it because as a medium slot weapon stockless right the bow will not do a lot of melee damage that's something to keep in mind it's a it's a it's like if you were to carry like an obverse or or like a like a zone of wind filters or dual pistols right like it takes quite a lot of hit so against ai it's it's really really weak to rely on the bow for melee but if you equip that trait then you have a chance that with a pointy um uh pointy arrows you have to you can use them for melee so as long as you still have an arrow uh you'll be able to kind of step with the arrow which is really really nice it feels also very satisfying and yeah let's have a look at the video let's do cloche t-shirt when let's hope very soon let's see i'll buy one i mean the trade artworks uh always looks super cool wow real legolas you can see that yeah it it it takes quite some stamina so this is this is like like uh we're talking about like um uh nothing that you can use against five grunts like it does this doesn't replace your your your knife but um it's nice to have this option and it's actually really really powerful and yeah kill with style that's super cool like then again like if you fire the last one at the hellhound you first need to pick one back up before you can do it so count your county arrows obviously like if you have like uh like an explosive or concertina tip like you still do the regular attack as you can see right like you won't be able to step with those special ammo times but the moment you swap over as you can see here now your claw is available and gives you a chance to to do that unless if you if you have a poison arrow and you do melee you also do poison damage on top which means we by accident just introduced our very first poison melee weapon exactly so that's the q claw but we also have another trait which is called hundred hands and uh this trait increases damage of a hunting bow shot at full draw by twenty five percent and also reduces sway was at full draw so this is basically a direct buff for for the full draw so um it takes just a little bit longer to fully draw in this case then because it's just a little bit more you can you can you can pull the arrow back so there's a time factor obviously you have to consider here um but uh then it just kind of boosts you a little bit so that the errors just do a little bit more damage and um also normally when you just aim with the bow and arrow in full draw you have a little bit more of sway step by step it's not really a lot but you will notice that you might have seen it already in some of the clips before so that like it starts swinging they won't because they kind of take some effort in order to to keep the keep the bow under tension um and that effect is also negated uh when you have hundred hands because just like that that force that that the tension is not um so demanding for you personally anymore so you just be able to manage this easier and so again this is just a chance for you to to kind of boost it if you want to if you want to like go bow uh with a priority maybe you want to put your security trade points into that and just upgrades that weapon a little bit and makes it a bit more a bit more competitive maybe exactly and uh as uh before as well this trade will unlock at rank 60 after the event is over and uh it will cost three upgrade points compared to the two of the previous trade and here is the amazing artwork yeah i really like this one you know united best again literally hundred hands one thing because this came up as a question in the chat um so uh whether whether 100 hands will be able to one hit kill um yes it will but also a full drawn bow to the upper body can also allow you at short ranges to do a one-hit kill already obviously at longer distances this is not thing but like the bow is a powerful weapon and if you take time to charge it up keep in mind you can't be as flexible maybe as the crossbow where it's pre-loaded right and you just need to release the trigger you will actually have to have to spend that moment or to pull it all the way back which in pvp is is tough but you might not have that moment but in case you're prepared for it um then you can actually do and strike on a player with a with a powerful like upper torso shot obviously headshots are lethal but um if you if you if you play this well um like with a crossbar you have a chance to to kill people and with hundred hands obviously a bit more damage there so it's a bit easier even pulling this off yeah as always you will be able to check yeah as always you'll be able to check out the stats for the bow in the menus for exact numbers of the effective range and uh at full draw it will increase by 25 basically i guess the damage the effect it will have is primarily on the on the regular arrow and the poison error right like this doesn't really affect damage wise uh like the frack or the the concertina arrows so so damage wise only the ones with a pointy pointy end will be be boosted okay but enough talk of the uh hunting ball and let's talk about our other new addition to the game uh a new tool uh the throwing x so we have a bunch of stuff for this as well uh this is going to be a new tool so not a new weapon but a tool so you'll be able to equip it in your two slot and uh you will carry two axes uh when you purchase it but it also can be picked up again just like uh the arrow was or the throwing knives in the game this will also come with a new supporting trait which we will show you in a second and it will unlock via the combat x progression after the event is over so uh you can go into the book of weapons and look at the progression with the combat x and you will be able to find the throwing x there so that's how you will unlock it after the event is over so it's not rank based like the bull basically but uh progression based in the book of weapons and the store price will be 60 bucks for this weapon yeah what's what's really interesting about the throwing ax is that it it kind of sits right between for example the heavy knife and the the throwing knives because it is on one hand it's actually still a quite decent melee tool so it has power it has even more power and heavy knife but uh it's balanced through the amount of stamina it takes so it's not a very economical weapon like it's similar to how we balance the the knuckle knife versus the dusters versus the knife versus the heavy knife versus the throwing knives now we have one more as part of this family right so the idea is that it's it's about being good at certain things and being a bit weaker and other things and it's down to you your choice on how you want to combine them so people can bring um the throwing acts as as as their like melee tool of choice as long as they realize that maybe against a pack of hellhounds or several grunts they might be in trouble because they run out of stamina before but then again you can still throw them so you might be able to just like melee two of them and then uh you throw throw the two axes like attitude to others and if you're good maybe that's good enough it's for you to experiment with this it's for you to try this out and uh it just gives you gives you a chance to to to play with it obviously the throwing x is better against specific ai than than uh and weaker against others so let's have a look at the videos and see how this plays because i think it's really interesting so yeah just basically aim as you can see like that it has a much stronger fall off so at distance it's it's not as as easy to hit than for example the throwing knives but um just like with those you can pick them up and use them again and i think just insect animation alone just just makes me want to pick that probably every time for an extra crease at least you could see that it couldn't penetrate the metal surface under the wood yeah yeah so it kind of kind of only sticks away to the surfaces that it can can attach itself to actually uh of that i so i've seen some questions about the arrow as well uh regarding penetration yeah so the arrow arrow is is working uh like the crossbow balls so they they stick to to to like non-metallic surfaces and obviously they stick to to limbs and and body parts um and um yeah whatever you've you've already trained to consider for the bolts is applying here as well so don't expect it to stick into metal sheets that makes sense and here meanwhile we can see the melee uh with the x like you mentioned the light melee is on the heavy one and the tires so this is basically exactly that's also again like the depending on how you go about it um you will be able to maybe even like kill like two grunts next to each other so let's just see how this all plays out a little bit in gameplay so this is actually using the legendary version um the tomahawk which is really nice as you can see like like just like two with one heavy strike uh kill the other one but now he is damines out so you could kill those four but if they would have been a fifth grander you would need to take a tired attack so again it's balance of damage versus stamina consumption where this uh capacity like how many you have etc so it should sit very nicely in the melee tool system and then it's down to you to pick the one you like and in this example you could also see that you can pick them up after throwing them easily yeah like the armored stake for example if you hit an armored in the upper torso like one one tomahawk is enough to bring it down which feels super satisfying i must say so like if you if you want to have like the heavy hitter um then the tomahawk or the throwing axe is for you um but i mean the moment there's more enemies coming you better quickly pick up that thing otherwise you might be in trouble um so you can throw with no stamina i just like the throwing knives but it obviously consumes stamina as you throw as well so you're still kind of repeatedly look at it again because you cannot do the midi attack so quickly the sword is satisfying to kill armored with one hit though yeah yeah but you have to hit him you have to hit him hit him like square in the chest or the right leg so the moment you hit the shoulder shoulder guard like the bony bony stuff on the big arm like it just embeds himself in there and just keeps on coming then you definitely need to use the second one and then let's just hop that around and then what about concertina armors i seen in the chat um so concertina armors will probably take like one more um to to to bring down but um try it out uh you'll be able to test it all um and and and unlock it and have fun with it when the event starts tomorrow on live service so we've seen some pva action but let's look at the pvp wow so i i was asked to show this because the token so many takes to record it and i think it's pretty amazing um so so you can see it from the other side as well so like it's very satisfying if you hit someone at that distance uh just like being able to score that that kill i mean you've seen that and you probably got like really really excited when you saw the videos that we released right like where like you see you see the the the the um the wayfarer i think was it one of the natives um like rampaging and throwing that that that thing around and destroying that one team and you can really you can really do that also in game here i feel like this shirt died in every video so far [Laughter] yeah obviously this this this is just frick adele that wants to show that he killed someone with it that's why he wanted me to show the video oh it's actually some very good fun that would be really scary to get killed like that to be honest like something flying in your face oh yeah good fun you guys will you guys will have so much fun with this um on the events and then also after the event so i'm very curious to see how this will spice up um like the gun play specifically and how many people bring it how many people will will go after the people who bring it and how many people just in general like engage with that stuff so servers are ready we are ready um tomorrow will be the day let's go very soon and uh we have a trait for the throwing axe as well we mentioned earlier uh so it's called assailant which i actually before when we prepared the presentation i mistyped like 20 times in a row but that is helped me fix it so you always got you always got the first three letters right i don't know why there's too many a's in that bird i feel like [Laughter] uh so this trait increases the male damage of throwing knives and throwing access so it also works on traveling knives wow uh so this this is gonna be like this this is like the little cherry on top here is that that um not only will you be able to use assailants to boost uh the throwing axe but it will also have a very nice effect on three knife which you guys will see uh as the last thing uh once we've shown accident on the on the throwing axe and the threat unlocks at rank 11 obviously after the event as always in this case and will cause two upgrade points and let's look at the artwork that's really cool i love it as well so so you've guys seen the malay uh attacks on the throwing axe and we just just uh shot the other clips a minute ago um so let's have a look at how this looks with the trade being active exactly so like they basically uh ascend gives you custom custom animations so like you have much different uh like swipes uh it just feels a bit more satisfying um obviously with the higher damage it does um this becomes even more of a threat up close so um there it is your it is definitely your competition to a machete but as you can see with this timing consumption you still can't do that many strikes so you better hit them or take a stamina sean alternatively let's show them with the other uh i uh does for the throwing knives we have yeah exactly uh we have it with no thread on first yeah so so just just to to remember so this is how the throwing knife does melee which i think very few people might remember because it's normally not what you do so it's like two times slash attacks heavy and regular is both slash but it's weak and uh like you you usually um don't want to use that um because it's just a small little flimsy knife but now let's have a look at how it looks when we put the tray let's see so with that we basically turned into a step weapon so i mean they're still very weak but if you do the heavy attack with it i mean now you're gonna have to hold it in order to to actually project some thrust there um but it can actually stand in as a replacement for the knife if you consider that it does uh consume more more stamina per attack for the heavy ones so you do get the chance now if you are daring to not bring a knife but just bring throwing knives and if you have the trait you can kill like the occasional grunt or whatever comes your way but you just keep in mind that uh there's gonna be i think it's like one attack glasses so one heavy attack less you can do so um you don't wanna like uh be caught down with your pants down by the ai when you do that so oh my god it's so cool how he spins the throwing knife before the heavy melee attack wow yeah i like the intimation work that went into like all of the weapons in general just like the love that we seen from the character art guys from animators from the designers audio people like this everybody has been pouring so much energy into this so i'm really really really really happy and proud like how this all turned out like this this is this is honestly like an amazing piece of work for all the new weapons the traits and then just add like this amazing event around that and i think this is just a winner package i'm really really excited to get the ball rolling tomorrow and then play with you guys exactly and uh we came to the end of the stream but we could do a quick recap just to remind you guys the event is starting tomorrow at 2 pm utc so that means 4 p.m uh cest which is european central time and uh yeah you can start your progression choosing your path and unlocking everything uh and now we can answer your questions uh that you may have for us give like a chance before we do that before we add i mean you guys can already start typing on your questions if you have any and we keep track of them but before that maybe let's do just a quick recap uh xenia welcome welcome join welcome back all right that's actually that's actually live stream right let's let's let's come back to the really important stuff which is just about like the event just to recap a little bit uh what people i mean for four guys who joined probably later and didn't catch at the start so there will be event that's that starts in tomorrow and as you might see there will be like two different passes so hunting ballparks and throwing axe pies and they're quite different by this like feelings or what you can get uh basically you can get in them uh throwing axe pads like you you first unlock your uh base weapon throw in axe and also you will be able to earn some in-between reward as like blood bones hun dollars and also unlock the trait what dennis just was talking about um but after the completing the first pass you will be able to proceed to the next bus so actually you can complete both of them so uh basically there will be four daily caps as regular we have this for previous events but those daily caps will be presented only on your first chosen progression so once you completed the first you can move forward and there will be like no daily caps after like last daily cap that which presented this uh suspended there um so if you are choosing the uh bo hunting bow um parts then you will be able to earn uh all these legendary skins that marked in this progression as well as gameplay stuff like uh custom custom custom arrows uh trade there there will be no feeling rewarded blood bonds and handlers so if you can earn some some currency so throw an act fast for you if you want to unlock gameplay stuff first that's for you uh but also um there is uh different ways how to earn points so if you are picking the uh hunting ball then you will get additional points for killing hives with ball and if you are picking the throne act that you will get additional points for killing armor it was a throwing act but tens points are shared and if you're playing together in a team and if you're playing with four different uh different passes that you can actually constantly earn points with your base base weapon or tool there so and accumulate points and like multiply them um so i thought there was like one question that was repeated all the time can i earn uh points for killing armors with this rolling axe if i peeked bow if i'm playing bow and arrow progress hunting ball progression yes you can because you can you can find a hunting ball and throw an axe in a quick play as well so you can pick it up uh kill armor kill hive and still earn points but that's the the only thing that is like inconsistent for you so while you are on the path of ball uh the consistent way to earn additional points it's killing hives or with hunting ball and vice versa for throwing axe uh killing armored with it um also it was this was mentioned uh quick play so far you will be able to find 15 pro consumable there in the quick play we also giving you the start of the each progression to 25 pro boost 25 proof vapors um two times at the start of each progression so at the start when you're choosing the first one get two of them if you will move and when you move to the second progression you will get them at the start as well you can also buy them in the event store page uh they will be presented three different types and boost consumable this time boost not only event points but also the range on which uh event objects in the dark side highlighted so right now we have uh two ways how to earn points with the exploration pass that's destroying pirates extinguishing pliers and interacting with the wards and those items they will be visible in the dark side even without boost consumable the default range when they are visible with c10 meters and you can boost it up to 70 meters with like combination of different type of consumable and of course bonus is stuck among the team but unlike um event points booths percentages range has hard cap 70 meters so that's the maximum range yeah i think that's that's what's really cool about that is that uh you'd have like one more reason to actually bring one of those consumables and definitely guys you got two two times two free use them because they're really really good in order just like to find stuff think of it like that like you you use the boost consumable not only to boost the score that you will get at the end right like the multiplayer but also you have a higher chance of actually finding the stuff so just having having that in the team i think is just over which is very beneficial and just allows you to unlock the stuff a little bit faster unless obviously you're the best player in the world and you don't need any of that which is perfectly fine because most of you guys are so literally the most consumable for this event like with this vapor is today carrying two mechanics like one is direct boost which is like boosting like you are collected event points and another is indirect boot because like the more you see of course the more you you will collect the more points you will earn and the more will be multiplied in the end um also just a reminder again that the points from the first progression will not be carried to the second progression so guys you are finishing at the 1000 point the first progression uh you will get the final unlock of this progression one of the hunter and then you will be moved to the second progression and you will start with zero because at zero point you actually get in there uh two times 25 proof vapor you we couldn't hear you at the end but uh um at least for a second yeah i think it's fine uh i seen it that's fine i've seen some questions uh compared to the other events when uh what happens if you completely complete the whole progression and uh like uh both parts if you completely complete both progressions you can start completely completing the bonus part which is like 10 000 additional event points which will be converted to hundred dollars with the exchange rate one to one yeah so this is basically just like a container right so there's always still something for you guys to do uh so even if you if you rush through events early uh as soon as you can and then just get the stuff depending on the day logs um you still have a chance to continue playing because at the end of the event they will just be converted over and you can just get something for it oh it's the important part because i i saw some questions in the chat the people asking if we can switch the progression when we already progress in there no that's not possible so once you like choose wisely choose the first one complete the first one start moving uh with the with the second one so there's a question what happens if you press these during the progression uh in the event because then you would reset your unlock for the weapons so do you can you still play with them or uh so if if you unlock uh base uh weapon or two uh hunting ball or throwing axe uh if you already unlocked a trade if you already unlocked custom armor custom arrows sorry for for a hunting ball that you st when you if your precision while event is still running then you do not lose them you keep them because you already unlocked them during the event event running like right now already so there is like no reason to take it away from you guys but if your precision when event is concluded um and over and now like the unlock is regular ranking progression then if you prestige there you of course will lose this stuff yes and that one one word of caution um i think it is also listed in the uh patch notes then um we at the moment so i think have one bug which we hope to be able to hotfix very soon as long as with some other packs obviously um that the first prestige at the moment might not give you the stuff back directly so there's a chance with that happening um so best piece of advice at the moment just play the first couple of days without proceeding until you see that one being fixed in the update and then you can proceed from that point on just to be on the safe side you don't miss out on the stuff minor inconvenience we're sorry for that but just so as a word of warning then for you guys so i've seen some questions regarding quick play and uh are you able to find the throwing x or the ball in quick play yes yes you can find both of those in quick play and as xenia was saying you can also find the 15 proof vapors also in quick play so if you don't wanna wanna spend blood bonds just go play a bit of quick play win the round and you get some as well some people are asking if it's coming to the test servers it's not it's gonna be live tomorrow at 2 p.m utc yeah we we're directing live service so we had we had the test server period 4161 already this is actually where we test a lot of the stuff under the hood without you guys noticing haha um and now that allows us to basically roll out uh all of these cool features directly to the live environment uh also thanks again to our to our external testing group um that has helped us over the last uh month and two um we're gonna play test with the bow a little bit and just get some initial feedback and impressions so even though it wasn't on the public test server we still had community people participate and give us their feedback and i think it really shows again like with the customer uh and and scrapping and all the other stuff we've been working on new map that's uh getting you guys involved um getting key people from the community to assist us is really really a good healthy thing and so thanks a lot for supporting us on this i would also like answer a couple of other questions that's popping up like constantly there i think we had so so so little time for details um another question like uh because like players got used to blues that we use in every event like this very specific themed clues this time the all clues will be regular and will not give you points unfortunately or maybe not so no clues uh but instead we have words and also like answering the question will words notify that they're like another team nearby after the interaction um i mentioned the start of the stream that actually the first team that interacts with the ward uh just a reminder that every team can interact with once [Music] while interacting so the first team interacting with the word they will light up the torches on this word and they will stay there so you can just see that someone before already activated you but it will not give you like any other information beside this so it's a bit like the clues where you can see if someone touched them before so you can tell that one team has been there but nothing else basically uh some people are asking about the bolt trover trade uh with the ball no that one that one uh is is exclusive uh for the crossbow so um the zia trait which also shares the name bolt obviously that's that might be a bit misleading to players because that one actually shows you also throwing knives the throwing axe arrow so it's everything you can throw and then can i have to retrieve from the world maybe in the future we'll we have to rename that had more different things it's useful for uh compared to initial release but at the bolt throat rate because that was the question that is specific to the crossbow and the bone arrow the hunting bow has has two exclusive own traits that help it instead actually i i got some clarification um from from something i couldn't answer earlier um um which is whether dauntless works for the frag arrow and it 100 oh it does actually that's really cool uh so some people asked about the dlc hunter uh you can actually already get it on steam right now so you can already play with that and about the necro shirt i've seen some people mentioning it you can also get that on amazon so just look up i guess necromancer t-shirt and showdown and you can find it and uh we always update our merch store as well maybe we'll have something for this event as well who knows you know so just keep an eye out for all that stuff uh does pitcher work with throwing axes no but it does also not work with the throwing knives so that's consistent in this regard picture picture is for explosives and uh not for weapons i had a couple additional bow and arrow questions here let me just quickly while put them up here pull them up um um okay this one we answered then when you pick poison arrows up are they still regular arrows then what are their poison errors or what they just remain poison errors so you can you can reuse poison errors if you fire poison arrow and you have poison errors as your ammo loadout you can resupply them um obviously if you don't have them you don't you don't have to don't have a chance to resupply them so you need to keep using the same ammo type but you will not be able to turn one into the other or or swap things out that way um then there was a question about um um whether we we're going to change the uh the tomahawk uh trophy slash achievement uh no no this will still remain exclusive for using the world uh throwing x or like the heavy extra wood x uh um and and the hammer basically these type of items so no easy way for you to getting that by just using the the the throwing x uh tool um there was also a question uh earlier about exploitation whether it's possible to just like farm people for event points and stuff so at the moment the rule is that you can only get per player these event points once per round so even if they're being revived and you loot them again you've already got them from that person so that exploit is safe there's no way for you to to to gather points that way uh i see that youtube chat asking if i'm reading this [ __ ] i am indeed reading you guys as well so facebook twitter i mean not twitter but twitch and the youtube i see you all so don't worry try to answer questions from each other uh there was there was someone asking whether you have to extract to get the points um no so so that's that's a difference that we always have when we have an event running if you are earning event points even if you die you get exactly those event points to progress you don't have to bring them off the mission because otherwise you basically have people playing it super safe and always running for the extract no nice fights happening so just consider this to be a nice side effect with a boost consumable you can get even more on top if you want if you had a good round obviously that that then pays off but you don't need to extract that you just need to earn them and if you die a moment later you still got these points and progress in the event uh so there's a question we are oh sorry go ahead i just wanted to clarify uh one thing that we said earlier that the boost consumable gives you um increased range for the dark side region but but only for the highlighted objects in the dark side event object like no no other vision we do not increase with the boot consumable so only for a collection only for ins distinguishing more pirates and only for insert refined and interacting more words there that's for what you can use consumable yeah no no pay to see for gameplay features exactly so i also wanted to uh just answer something that we have already answered earlier is that uh if you uh have uh completed the path for uh the arrow and uh you can uh and you are doing the let's say the throwing x you still get points for the arrow as well if you use it and also if your teammates are using the other weapon time type and are like let's say killing a hive with the hunting bow you will also get that point as well so it's all shared within the team there is actually one one important point in the comments that like we didn't even mention that so to complete each of the progression you will need to collect one thousand point so one thousand point four bow and arrow pass hunting ball pass and one thousand point four throwing axe so like once you earn one thousand points you will unlock the legendary hunter skin and of course like uh all rewards already will be unlocked for you okay so uh there's actually some questions about the daily caps because we didn't really go into too much detail on that so how are those exactly and how many days or how does that work so we will have actually four daily caps and they will be like uh milestones for you and place will be for only first chosen progression for you so neither either a hunting ball or throwing axe and there will be on hunting ball on the legendary skin on the legendary skin which like themed either hunting ball or throwing out skin and on the last hunter skin so when you're reaching the daily daily lock you can't earn points anymore you can't progress further so you are getting this unlock and then you need to wait until local suspended but instead of the uh getting event points you will be able to earn hunter xp so you keep you keep interacting you keep extinguishing pirates you can keep interacting with wars looting uh hunter corpses and killing the boss and instead of event points you will earn hunter xp exactly and uh how many caps are there just to clarify that as well or that's how i started my answer okay so yeah but uh so you have one on the first day and then on the second day third and fourth and then you are done with all the caps basically was it was it was a step 24 hours so first 24 hours then 48 hours and like 17. and we always end the cap that you always have a nice unlock exactly and you have uh uh like oh how many days i think it ends on the 22nd of next month so you will have almost a month to complete this event so the caps are only for the very first four days basically and after that you are free to earn points as you want so basically yes uh all caps they they they will be suspended in the weekend after we start in the event and then you you will have like three three weeks to earn like all rewards okay i think we answered most of the questions uh obviously if you guys still have questions uh we'll always try to answer it on social media or on discord so uh just make sure to leave your questions uh somewhere and we'll try to get back to you as quickly as possible uh but i think we had quite a long stream and uh dennis's dinner is probably already like called at this point so i thank you guys for participating cenia and dennis uh i know it was a very long preparation and also stream for you so thank you again uh and it's been a pleasure presenting it it's been amazing and i think this event will really really be shining and just keep in mind guys
