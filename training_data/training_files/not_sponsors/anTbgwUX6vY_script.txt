i don't have an obsession with call me carson okay you definitely do i don't i do not have it that's not even like my accent yeah first of all what is yes it is this swedish is the swedish shirt i'm mimicking you out [Music] how are you just throw 500 babies because there's definitely some accident going on there but i can guarantee it's not irish i thought that was a shark you just have another call me carson pillow what are you what is this now what is what's going on here are you what i'm here today look at the music man you just scammed them because you didn't actually mute yeah because what what's going on what's going on tell me what's going on please tell me what's going on this feels like the blame game right now you scammed them you scammed them how does it feel to be a scammer first of all you know we're you're really getting canceled this stream you just scan them [Music] you know what fine i'll me and chat will forgive you if there has to be one moment where i click my fingers and you just have to stay silent for 10 seconds and if you miss it well then you're double scammed and you're just okay breaking your chat's hard are you saying that at any moment any moment not right now any moment you're the whole thing if i click my fingers and you don't mute for 10 seconds well fine i'll take i'll take off on that offer okay okay what were we talking about i totally lost track i have adhd oh no i know it was something about it was about my ban that's what we were talking about yes please tell me yes so uh i'm obviously i i've kind of streamed less because of this because i still don't know why i was banned the day i was banned i had it was the day the simp intel stuff came out so i was like oh you know i i was a bit toxic i was like the only reason twitch is batting these words is because they're simps and they're the [ __ ] insults yadda yadda and then i the next day i'm [ __ ] banned so obviously my head goes to oh that's why but that wasn't in place until january but when i asked my management team they were like it's along the lines of um racism homophobia or hateful hateful slurs so i'm like okay so incel is a hateful slur and he's like i can't give you the exact reason on why you were banned though just along the lines so i'm like how am i gonna [ __ ] fix what i did mate if i didn't so i keep saying it's the intel sim thing because that's what i did the day before but then xqc was like minx is lying about all this minx is lying she didn't get banned for that and i'm like excuse me if you know what i got banned from me please [ __ ] tell me if you're in with the twitch staff if they don't tell you please tell me because i didn't even know i was banned first so i cannot do it again i'm on my last uh strike right now i'm pretty sure they said on my first band which was like uh two years ago for showing i i fell over and i cut my oh my gosh she's dead don't worry about it oh my gosh she's [ __ ] dead don't worry about it i'm gonna [ __ ] okay don't worry yeah yeah i'll keep talking while you're just dead right there okay yeah um well yeah so basically i don't [ __ ] know why i was banned i'd loved it that's why i've been salty with twitch lately i keep saying tell me apparently xqc [ __ ] knows because he said i was lying about the intel sim [ __ ] but i'm like you can tell him but you can't tell the person that was actually [ __ ] banned i've asked my manager and he just he said we can have a meeting about but like i can't tell you exactly what it is she's gone she's absolutely oh she's back she's this she's there's something going on here but it's it's bright bright very bright should have warned her about my epilepsy huh and she's trying to kill someone out too are you are you okay do you have epilepsy yeah i do have epilepsy but it's grand it's it's not for some sensitive but it's funny to scare people with it ah not i don't see you i i wouldn't believe anything sqc says i don't even think he knows half of the things he says i just want to know why i was banned they're not okay look i have a theory okay i think it's because oh [ __ ] me your head dude i know do you like it he lies just big yeah it's matching carson on the desk yeah like it's yeah you're kind of a big head too like a little bit like a little now hold on a second how come you can tell me that i have a big head but i can't tell you that you have a big head well i think because your hair just grew five times the size it [ __ ] was my head has been the exact same size so now i just feel like i know if that was an allergic reaction not sure what what went on there oh you're still huge from the angle i thought you just you just smiled too oh the smile you're just terrifying you know have what is about me that's terrifying i don't know it's just i think it's the fact that you can just grow your head about five times the size and just who the [ __ ] what oh that guy say hi miss minx look he likes you say hi what the [ __ ] is that that's a man you've never seen a naked man before no no no not naked man oh my god he's just flossing you're just fine when naked man flossing behind you yeah he's flossing for you it's a compliment he likes you well tell him thank you tell him i appreciate that yes she appreciates it oh she's got to know i'm there yeah my so my child has some control over my body don't worry about it it's something that happens every stream so yeah i have a uk yeah i'm i'm good i have a theory okay clear so actually here there's a there's a faster way to kill him hold on oh wait oops never mind just just killed him i was gonna actually actually kill him but my mods was like no we're gonna do this the safe tos way anyway so um miss minx i honestly think that are you okay i just you know you pulled out going there was about to kill a man right in front of me that's that's fine in a video game it's not in a video game in a video game in your video game and it's not worst it fits in the video game see you can be as violent as you want you know in a video game in a video game just always not in in a video game yeah but you can't install twitch stuff no no no see that no no no that is very valuable but you could do a whole bunch of violent stuff in here oh and also you can't do too sexy the naked man's back oh yeah right so oh right wrong weapon hold on so um anyway so so video game violence in on twitch is totally okay he's gone he's got wow that was that was cool right i like how you just killed a random man that that i'm sorry i'm like i'm trying to listen to what you're asking me but your background every time someone happens i'm like is that a [ __ ] eye mate i literally did not what is that peeping in at you was that there the whole time what do you what what are you peeping at me what do you not see the eye is that your eye there's an eye in the background oh that's just bad reflection math anyway don't worry about it don't don't worry about it it's it's just okay it's normal here yeah it's totally normal everything is normal so i have a theory i think the twitch moderation team is lovely by the way our installs oh yeah are lovely absolutely lovely we think you guys are great um but but if we were to say anything bad it would just be a joke primings yes slash j i'll tell you my bad story everybody knows about it but but you need to hear it yeah i do okay legit i have told this story like 20 times already but you know what i don't care chat um so i got i got down for the letter d right not really though so i had this feature where oh my god um damn and i still have the power to shut you off for 10 seconds too damn lucky you just sit there in silence huh how are you doing chat how you doing chat no scout this time no scam this time okay god i did my time what were we talking about we were talking about um [ __ ] dude no [ __ ] okay oh you're there when you got banned oh right right okay so so right i got banned the letter d and i had this feature wrong what is that what what are you doing with your brother now and now so i clicked my fingers you didn't mute so now next time i click them it has to be 20 seconds remember we said if i snap you mute for 10 seconds you kept talking so now i have another snap and it's for 20 seconds double scanned go on continue your story now scammer fine fine okay um so what are we talking about i'm sorry i gotta oh who are we talking about we were talking about your band all right right okay so um i got barefoot letter d i had this feature where if you send a dollar to my phone a letter d will pop up here and it was a joke that you can send mikko a d pig for a dollar you know like the letter d haha get it but um so twitch though banned me for for selling pornography because they thought i was selling real dick pics for a dollar yeah we won't say anything bad about the twitter team it's just sometimes we wish that the bands would be fair and justified equally throughout every single streamer i wish they would actually look in the contest because mr share said they will look into contact sasjay and then and then wait how lo how long was your bond for three days okay and did you appeal it yes i tried but they wouldn't they wouldn't read anything that i wrote that's what i don't understand i appealed mine and everyone was sure they're like just appealing and you'll be good so i appealed and i said like yeah we gonna be back the next day boys wake up in the morning and it's like your appeal has been rejected wait out your sentence [ __ ] they didn't actually say that but that's how it felt i'm so sorry miss minks that sucks you know what but we come back stronger than ever right mikko stronger than ever that's true when they ban usually that's when people talk about you more mm-hmm yes that is true yeah and then you have a bigger stream when you come back that is true that is true i wonder you know you know the girl that got can we talk about this the spreading the reality yeah the vagine how do you feel about that bond i didn't see it oh i saw it was it bad what i thought it was i was at first i was like i was pissed off at people for like uh like [ __ ] on her because what i thought happened was you know how if you're wearing like a little skirt or even shorts yeah and you know you sitting back you man spread your [ __ ] might pop out it is what it is yeah yeah [ __ ] might pop out that's what i thought happened so then i'm like i don't understand why everyone's like being so hateful towards her it's not her fault this is another [ __ ] movement because you're i oh she gonna pop out her [ __ ] do you love that enjoy that three-day band probably gonna be month for you ah and then but then i thought who oh no i didn't find the clip it was under a twitter thing someone some big streamer talked about um the ban and then someone had the video and posted it on there and i still don't think it's down by the way which twitter bad job on you wow it's dead ass like porn wait wait wait wait wait can you reenact it yeah okay so you gotta turn around you gotta spread your no i don't mean well i mean like like okay okay she like she she was bent over backwards you know her ass in the camera and she spread it and started wiggling and like pushing her you know like as if it was a cam show wait her eyes her it was it was the back of it but she was so bent over you could see like everything her ass and her [ __ ] so she flashed her butthole yeah and then they like legit spread like crap like crap pull that [ __ ] wide open like a [ __ ] coconut mate what did it look like a scarlet pit you know i don't even want to comment on another she she doesn't really she she looks good right she's the body of god i wish i looked like that i wish my coochie looked like that but at the same time i'm just like you know she she did say it was an accident because she accidentally recorded instead of she hit going live instead of recording it was for her her only fans oh but so i i you know what i at first i was like really or was this a public stunt move but now i think it was an accident because you know i've almost done that million times and i have a little freak out sometimes yeah so i'm like i'm like but at this same time something that harsh gets a three-day ban and twitch can't even tell me why i got a seven day back dude okay look i haven't the reason why they don't just just before i twitch this is all just slash j you know we're just kidding but i think the reason why they don't want to tell you exactly why you got banned is so that you can't argue back with them you know and be like you're [ __ ] wrong that makes sense that makes sense because i like no continue first because i feel like a lot of these bands are personal oh hey oh please she's at it i agree i'm just kidding but no i agree i agree what i've noticed is kind of not edgier people but like not that there's i'm not there it looks like from an outsider's perspective yeah his favoritism on on uh yeah from not my i've just read it thread on reddit this is not my opinion by the way but it does look like there's some favoritism in the in the twitch like do you remember um that dear girl oh yeah do you remember all that yeah yeah and like she literally threatened to just ban people if they went against her she was like i have power you know i'm gonna i'm gonna you keep talking [ __ ] keep doing it i'll ban you and it's like that's that's a threat you can't twitch in their two asses you can't make threats against others for no reason um the dear girl made threats against everyone and she's so high up in power and just seeing that from there and she put that to the cameras imagine what goes on behind the scenes like how it's just i i you know what's so [ __ ] sad though i love twitch i've always i've been on this platform for five years i've always like not shy talk other platforms but i'm like if they keep up the the way they're going youtube's gonna run them into the ground if youtube changed their [ __ ] interface and actually pays attention to the live streaming i think like my my opinion is after mixer gave up you know after a mixer lost i feel like twitch went more downhill from there i think they were trying for a good while they were actually trying hard and then the moment mixer's gone they're like no competition what's the point you know we'll just do it anyway and i'm like watch now the moment youtube changes their interface gets emotes emotion stops taking 70 30 for subs and donors they're going to rival twitch 30. for subs and donuts okay 73. yeah and donald's too like that's the thing about twitch donuts you get the full amount on twitch but um on subs it's like was it it's like 50 50 but on youtube for donald's and subscriptions it's uh 70 30. and i'm like that is that is greedy but if they change that because youtube gets a lot more view not a lot more views but you see that like among streams like they'll a lot of people on twitch will be having above 100k um that if they change the interface and everything they could be on a run they could be the competitor against twitch but i don't think twitch is going to change the issues they have on the inside and the outside until that happens and that's what's disappointing that they'll only kind of work for their community and help us when they have to and that's why i'm just kind of damn bad so like here's the so here's the thing that is kind of confusing to me is that so twitch moderation team is the one that has them that brings twitch's image down most i think you know like and like but the thing is you ask anybody that works for twitch and they don't even know who the moderation team is like the moderation team is like this really separate branch of twitch and like you you inspire a lot of twitch employees saying like like that's [ __ ] up like i don't know why you guys you got banned for that like there's like the moderation team is like a small part of twitch that like for some reason pizza just twitch doesn't know who they are they don't they don't have rains on them like i don't know what's going on i honestly really do think that um are you partnered yeah i'm partnered yeah they're supposed to apparently i don't know if this is true but apparently if your partner it's not just a bot that looks at you it's like a real person and then another person has to approve the band too um yeah i don't know uh but were you banned when you were a partner or an affiliate i was banned when i was partner oh okay yeah um i will say that i totally agree that if youtube gets their stuff together they will be they will compete against twitch pretty hard um and i am so afraid of saying anything because i was so afraid of saying anything you know what i mean well right no i get that i get that and that's another thing being being afraid to say something to upset them i already feel like i'm in their bad books so i'm like okay i guess so but it does break my hair because of twitch like after being i've been on the platform for six years but i've only been streaming for like five years yeah i i'm in love with this that even if even though i keep talking so much [ __ ] i feel like the reason why i really talk so much [ __ ] is because i want them to change yeah i want to fall in love with them all over again i just i feel like like exactly what you said there where i don't blame my manager he just maybe he didn't even know he was like i just know it's along the lines may it's not his fault i just wish the team not resource team not fire people not make people lose their jobs during a pandemic but have a sit down with them and be like we have to take this seriously you know like i understand there's so many people on twitch so i get it's hard for them to control it all hard to especially when there's mass reports and stuff yeah but but i that's the thing that's the thing twitch is huge to be fair so it is totally what it yeah but but like how many twitch partners get banned today because i i follow this twitter where this shows like you know what stream partners get banned and it's not like yeah it's not like a hundred of us get banned it's like six of us get banned a day yeah you think if it's only six partners get banned a day you that's true okay never mind that's gotta for a minute i was like oh there's so many but yeah i know that is it's it's rare because i remember like i did i i trended number two uh in usa when i got back they were saying free mix and i was like okay this like outcry this outrage they'll definitely look over it and at least tell me why but this is the the worst thing that is so sad it's like um the foursome thing when he he's back now but when he got banned everyone was writing you know he's 10 times as big as me but then after what a week everyone gets tired and gave up and that's that's where you know i think that's why twitch doesn't feel the need to change because it's like oh they'll they'll write about it for a bit but then they'll forget about it and i know um i'm not gonna say any names because i don't wanna get them in trouble with twitch but there's a few streamers like a group chat thing where not that they want to go on strike they just want to like try star a hashtag where it's like they want to be talked to more or they want like explanations and i'm like this sounds so fun and i want to take part but they won't [ __ ] care no matter how big you are even if like there's there's people bigger than me in the chat i'm like no matter how big you are they won't [Music] you
