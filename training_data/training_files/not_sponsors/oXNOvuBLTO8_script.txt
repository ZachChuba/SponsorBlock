thank you I'm gonna start with the fillet of boule in a okra jelly reduction please Garcon I don't have the crispy rock thighs with we got a shambling salad dressing on the side please and we want to do black pudding for dessert thanks for dining with us as we learn about these fantastic beasts and how to eat them on web DM this episode is well pledge now link here and in the description okay Jim let's talk about some beasts and all the tasty bits and everything in between chew down to the gristle let's get to the to the heat of the meat and down to the bone yeah first and foremost what beast in D&D above all others do you want to eat that's kind of tricky right because like you could eat something like say a cockatrice and see if it really was tastes like chicken yeah and you could do like like something that regenerates because it's flesh probably isn't that isn't as tough Amy maybe I really though because like you're thinking about you think about it like you want to eat something that is eating things that you would otherwise think is yummy right so like pigs who've been you know fed acorns what is the thing you're eating eat mmm-hmm and that's probably going to be going to affect how much it you know what it tastes like yeah maybe Apple if you know they're like big catfish that just then raises the point of like are there any magical benefits for eating certain types of TV monsters because that would certainly change my answer considering what it what is it a Zorn that eats like precious Joe probably tastes a little rich i that little brainy i managed you could even get through it or someone loses or cube or something like a gelatinous cube like a jello ball just the silliness of it i think like eating monsters and using monster parts in your characters cooking is to me like a natural extension of the fantasy world that they're living in and one of those things that when I was first keyed on to just you know rules for it or a concept of it was just sort of like holy [ __ ] why have I not been thinking about this like yeah it's what it was one of those like ideas in infinity RPGs but it really was like how would the world am I just now seeing people talk about this and discussing and so for me it was like DV blogs from about a year or so ago would have a lot of thoughts about the matter and some people would post up you know their own home brew systems or something like that a lot of them were for retro clones or older versions of DB gonna be a home stew system a home Stu says I'm certainly young but then this year the joy of monster cooking came out of the DMS guild and and had some fun stuff in it and of course it's an authority I'd has has since come out since when I was thinking about all this and it's got said cooks utensils there and what I found was just sort of like when I went looking for it there's like rules support for a game in which monsters are harvested for their parts and and recipes specifically specifically like magic recipes that impart some sort of benefit on you would become like a normal part of your adventuring day because I dug deeper it was like wait there's already kind of rules for all of this already and this looks suspiciously like alchemy like just it would you know with the serial numbers sort of switching around and so I was like this is really kind of a like let's talk about this let's let's see some more how we could explore this idea the things that you could get from it how deeply do you think this should be ingrained into DMS games whether it's just like one player who wants to do this or if you make it a part of regular downtime activities or it's just one a one adventure fleeing are you you you do like the whole campaign like like a friend of the show Doug borrow Vic he had a whole campaign when I started starring down it was a shared universe but his whole deal was they were on a ship it was basically a magic reality TV show like it's like like chopped or whatever and they go to different planets and they have to go hunt something and make something from it and be judged on it I mean it was the fool like cooking show experience you know and he had rules for it all it was great I think of all of the symbolism and meaning and ritual that surrounds eating and cooking and food preparation and all the like where they animals raised the sources of the food like all of that and like many things that we we talk about here on web DM it starts with like what's going on in the real world with this thing what are people doing in actual real life that we can draw inspiration from or like extrapolate to an absurd degree or whatever it is to make fantastical and and it seems like such a logical step no you know these ingredients have symbolic meaning the way that you prepare them has a symbolic or cultural meaning and the fact that you're using you know magical ingredients using magical cooking techniques with magical you know utensils even maybe like it it creates a world where magical feasts are common where the king you know hosts a banquet and it's like they're serving you know roast chimera and Manticore it's a world where you know your your character gets turned to stone and someone has to harvest the glans from a basilisk that converts the stone chunks back into flesh so that they can eat it which means that they've got to go in there and properly clean and gut the animal and I have to prepare these glands a certain way and and you know then you they can be used to restore restore you to flesh and that's what I mean it's like get there what's the difference between that and creating say a potion and using those glands to create a stew or something that you feed to the Petrified you know person or something so I I i find that my mind just like wanders in these crazy directions whenever I think about eating monsters and preparing them now and it's it's fun like you said using reality as a touchstone I mean like the the most simple thing of a hunter going out and taking down the prey yeah and giving proper respect to it and then you then you eat its heart to gain its power like real world hunters did that so what happens when you do that to a dragon and you go straight Khaleesi on its heart and you eat the whole thing in one batch make your constitution save like maybe for the rest of the day you get pebbly skin and you get a +2 natural armor bonus for like a day or for like a week just like temporary bonus is almost like ciphers from from the cipher system you know just like a little thing it lasts about a day but it would incentivize people to really think about the things that they're going out and it's not just like oh I want some XP right that's what you were saying like what kind what is the structure of this how do you incorporate it into a game like you could you could have that sort of situation where they're going out looking for specific monsters and for specific reasons to get specific bonuses and and maybe you just extrapolate that into a full-fledged monster hunter type game where the point of this you go hunting the monsters not necessarily for XP although you would you know probably advance from that in some measure but you're there because they provide other benefits that you want not just the experience of it you you want to see what happens when you combine certain organs from these creatures to make a composed dish that is invigorating in a magical sense or protects you against something you might have a situation where it the monarch or a king or something is putting on a party and you're the ones in charge of having to go and hunt down the beasts and make sure that they're killed the proper way yes they're prepared the proper way make sure that all that stuff yeah you're on the party planning committee right you got to make sure that Michael is happy with his at a king's anniversary or it could be something different you're trapped somewhere subterranean and it's having to you know your your surface food is slowly dwindled until it's nothing but crumbs in a burlap sack and and now you're scraping lichens and other forms of subterranean vegetation off the walls you're eating you know disgusting grotesque things that you never would have thought of before and it's changing you but you can't even see because it's so dark it's been too much much time eating those things and you find that yeah your eyes are a bit more attuned to the depths down here and you know what I can hear really well or or you know my sense of smell is it's become so potent that I rely more on it than I do anything else and it's because you're eating the you know you're / - have become a part of the local ecosystem which is suffused with magic which influences the creatures that live in it and like once I start thinking of my dandy world in a holistic sense like that once I stopped going like magic is a thing that intelligent people's engage in through the practice of spell casting and I know magic is at every level of my campaign and I like a blend of science and magic I like using scientific concepts and thinking about them in turn in magical terms and vice versa so I you know maybe magical food pleases the enchanted bacteria that live in your stomach or something or maybe magic food is a way that you can even get some of these superhuman abilities that some D&D characters have maybe it's that the fighter is is responsible for finding enemies that have strength and vigor and and an agility and using their parts for taking of their hearts wearing their skins eating their you know muscles or drinking their blood is all part of imparting those qualities to yourself oh yeah total barbarian right there you go oh yeah no but you've got it yeah that's sort of you might twist things up for that especially if you know you're gonna drink the blood of a strong whatever maybe a bowl be sure or whatever and that's you know that's how you get that 17th level flight ability because Red Bull gives you wings and I do agree with that completely in even to the extent of just like that's how you get hit died back on shore arrests you got it because you're eating these these magically infused ingredients do you see like where you set a limit on that do you see a limit on that because like like I would say an example I really like recently we played of interest of Middle Earth in like a whole honey cake yeah yeah it's really cool but but can you see how somebody might abuse that yeah just so you know just like oh I never have to worry about anything cuz I've got like an like a duffel bag full of this item that I make all the time if the resources that are being that you use are kept limited you could do this a lot of different ways maybe the only magic benefit comes from organ meat you know yeah I think just the organs you know in animals process all kinds of things you know what if it's basically like the equivalent of a magical liver that filters out you know harmful magic in in their environment the stygia lorg ins that interact with magic that are inside these creatures and you know you you're not eating the whole body necessarily or maybe make the rest of it just gets turned in a regular jerky or something you know but the ones that have the benefit are are you know number one I would say you know you don't just take these things out like you there is a skill role involved in the extraction and harvesting of these ingredients and and that's assuming that there's not also skill roles and the finding of them and then the actual hunt itself which may or may not be conducted as combat it might be conducted as they say a skill challenge so there's a lot of different ways along a line that there's that that what they want can be placed out of their reach and if the really good stuff is placed with like really rare monsters and if you combine this with a naturalistic encounter table that says like not every monster can be found in every environment or even ones that they're always found in it's like we need the crimson high basilisk for for this one particular dish what's like you can really only find them in this one very limited area of the world and they have cycles that they go through sometimes they're in hibernation sometimes they're out like it's an opportunity for the players to both learn something about their world that they live in and like care about the monsters that are in it or at least like want to interact with them in ways that are not just like let's kill them and get the XP it's let's find out where they are how we can best take them down and kill them in this certain way or apprehend them in a certain way and or trap them or whatever well it sounds to me like you're actually trying to turn your players into conservationists where you understand that sometimes you need to hunt them for they're obviously valuable ingredients and useful ingredients but if you're not you want to protect them we want to keep others from poaching them yeah and that's that can that can actually introduce a I don't know a more in-depth and nuanced look at the monsters other than just a bag a hit point so they give you a bag of XP right what about the locals that live there and and if there are monsters there that that consuming them or parts of them give certain benefit then what the locals not have that in you know sort of like caught up in their cuisine and as part of their or or just didn't even touch on the non-food uses for all of these creatures because normally these beasts are normally just like well you kill it skinned it take the teeth yeah usually but it that's I don't think it's really leave their you know you're gonna leave a carcass of a Manticore behind for a dragon to feast on that's how you get you know carrion dragons it's better than checking your dragon the price is to check a dragon what point does the food become magical is this something that anyone can do is the practice of it is an inherent in the ingredients like all of these things are gonna be determined by the background magic in your world and and I I just think it's a good place to have like non flashy non whiz-bang style magic it was just like yeah you know we there's a certain dish that we cook at a certain time of year that confers benefits or you know we we brew this certain drink you know or ferment this certain drink distill this certain spirit in order to induce a certain state of mind or it's a part of a spell component or something like that there's a lot of ways in which you don't necessarily have to like create new systems for magic food although like I said the framework is already there in addition it could just be that like you substitute certain types of monster and what you know for spell components you know do you want to cast fireball then you need to get like a fire lizard gizzard for your wizard fire lizard gizzard for your wizard well I would name him Rizal right use them to be that you'd eat an adder stomach to cast acid arrow right right you know you had to like actually take that snake stomach and eat it before you could project an aesthetic arrow that's sort of an intermediary step where you're not going with the whole hog I'm made up a subsystem and people are like collecting parts and they've got their monster inventory sheet I have a refrigerated bag of holding it keeps all my parts fresh that's another one another sort of limitation of it is how long does this stuff keep does it you know how long is it potent tell yeah you know when does it go bad well yeah I mean I I love thing about that being a pharmacy tech like when two things expire but also in the crafting of them like if you don't if you screw it up while you're harvesting it yeah or creating it that affects how long it's good for in the potency of the effect with trying to harvest these things I think it can also it can be one of those things that well when you kill something that's going to breed like scavengers carry on everything around and you have to harvest this stuff immediately and so now you just got done with an encounter you're trying to pull all this stuff out now the bushes start shuffling you hear the cries of the vulture you know lizards overhead and how are you gonna really stick around like now it can get overwhelming running a party there's a lot of considerations there and and you know if you're not hunting monsters for a specific or a specific reason and especially like an in setting reason then most of this just gets glossed over you never really think about it but you know considering those things how long does it take should you use the monsters hit die as a gauge for those kinds of things or should you not use their size category or something I think a lot of this can be extracted into sort of a generic skill challenge type situation where you're looking to get X number of successes before three failures and the players kind of you know have a hand in dictating which skills they're using as long as they're not using the same twice in the same encounter and like that's a good way to abstract it I'm I sit on the fence with skill challenges sometimes I like and sometimes I don't I think this is a good use to especially the zenith ARS section on combining skill and tool proficient oh yes yeah so now you're combining your Archon if it's a magic beast you're combining yurikano with your either you know you're Tanner's tools to skin it or you're cooking tools to extract the proper organs certainly certainly and and you know what you said you know you get three successes or three failures and you you ruined that dragons you know fire clan yeah that you needed to you know drink and spit fire are you good works just like a potion fire breath mhm maybe that is what a push for fire breath is those glands or morgan meat or something but like you're saying where it's like you're combining tool and skill proficiencies you might it might be like are you skilled and survival and cooks utensils then maybe this isn't a role for you maybe the only reason you might roll you know it's for something else or or it takes it from a skill challenge to a simple just once situation yeah where it's easier for you you can combine those you can say like well there's just no role needed for this period because of how skilled you are but i think like if something comes with a benefit then there needs to be some sort of risk or cost because otherwise you might get a situation where there provides like stuffing their faces full of magic food and you're out with all kinds of buffs but that'd be another one where i might be like yeah eating that much eating that many magical calories is gonna have an impact on you i think we were talked about this other day but just like the takeoff of like eating Fae food cherie or magic food like this i mean if you're not an inherently magic creature maybe it starts changing you yeah and not for the better it could be a thing where it's almost it could be an addiction yeah or it just starts changing you what if what if you eat too many magic fish and and all sudden you start growing gills yes and you find it kind of hard to just walk around all day and I need to go swim now cuz I'm getting a little light-headed cuz you're not getting enough oxygen from your lungs which are slowly dissolving as the magic calories build up in your body they sort of like form a concentrated mutagen either changes you or it becomes like a dependency thing you can't survive without imagine food maybe magic food is so nourishing and so sustaining that to try to go back to regular food is like trying to eat paper mache or sawdust there's a couple of calories in there but you got to eat a lot to find that maybe you find that your magic users and spellcasters have to engage in the sort of like hyper nutrient magic food because it's the only way they can get the energy to survive spell casting like otherwise normal food does not give you the caloric intake that you need you will hurt you will literally burn yourself up now you dipped into I forgot the character's name in Scott Pilgrim but it was like the second evil elects the vegan you had all of us like special powers from being vegan but if you eat normal food you lose all your poster sub classic I can imagine a monk's subclass based on that I can imagine a sorcerer class based on that definitely a sorcerer class yeah where you're just like you know you're balancing the internal magical humors of yourself and or you reduce certain things that didn't even touch on magic points like when you were talking about like in a certain like monsters of a certain area well there's gonna be certain flora that that they come up in that area so it's all gonna be part of the cuisine of the people of that area so you're gonna have to go in and grab multiple things or in order to eat this beast you have to prepare it with this spice or flour otherwise it's deadly cooking techniques which turn deadly monster parts into edible food and you know like this is another one of those where in our own world there's like how many foods especially fish right hey it's me Fisher I know it's a whole other world down there and many of them are taught that was a lad damn it part of your world part of you I've been like well you know if you cut out this part of the fish and very chilly then you can eat the rest of it would be fine how many people did it take to learn that how long did it take for someone to realize that that you could eat say this variety of puffer fish and not die or yeah you could take this fish and mix it up with salt and buried in the ground for a while and that's the beauty of adaptation and survival of the fittest Jim Rice eventually you figure it out they're like what you gotta do it this way so in a D&D world maybe it's the central salts you know maybe it's mummy dust or or something else which incidentally was also a big culinary item in our world which is why there's not a lot of mummy dust left we snorted it you know you bury them in that or a salt from the elemental planes or anything that saw from a sulfur yeah salt from the quasi elemental plane of air and water yeah which are no the earth and water briny whatever man let me tell you you'd think sea salts good oh yeah really have a lot of fun with thinking up magical ingredients thinking up ways to like incorporate them into your game and send a piece of say social encounters you know are you trying to like entertain someone at that you're you know you're special abode and and cook them a magical feast that will impress them yeah the magical feast has enchantment laden into it that will charm and and delight the senses maybe it's worked against you right like I'm thinking of the Turkish Delight from Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe where it's like eat this confection that you've never had before that I've got an infinite amount of entice the the player with some sweetmeats that extension of like the the Fae always offering you food because they give some kind of power over you because you feed them something right right we'll do that eating consists of like an agreement to a contract yeah right so that's sort of like like didn't say ice and Phi Song of Ice and Fire or a lot of those like fairy tales like breaking bread eating you know taking a bread and salt for and salt is is a custom is has a meaning and a thing we are we talked about in our curses episode of like everyday curses and and this maybe is one of those that I could see the magic of this being that if you abide by the the custom that you gain this benefit but if you break it you are cursed and maybe food doesn't give you nourish proper nourishment so you start gaining levels of exhaustion even though you've got plenty of sleep oh sure that take you a day or two to realize like everything you eat just kind of goes through you doesn't give you anything because you have offended the spirits of the household you know that's that they are there to ensure that custom and tradition which includes the ways that food is cooked and eaten yeah are respected and not you know those are sort of like I don't know just wild considerations that run through my mind and the thing is is there's a lot of a lot of inspiration a draw from yes out there I mean like you can pick any personality on the [ __ ] on the Food Network yeah and that can be a version of a D&D character I mean you have some personal experience with with Emma yeah our lovely a lovely communications director came up with escape from town last year she she just gave a flavour Italian we were we were sort of like sat down like what would be in a kind of like magical industrial kitchen you know and not just like a cozy you know cottage you know stew pot or like these are sentient meats different sauces that provide certain bonuses and like you know the idea of food transforming you into a monster like you eat something and become that kind of creature or take on their aspects we covered a lot of it for that one shot and then really only since then if I that was sort of when I realized that like gosh there are a lot of people out there who've been thinking about this and writing up systems for it I hate myself and I can't remember the anime the manga of delicious and dungeon well there's that one but there's also starts with a tea or Oh Toriko tarik oh yeah yeah I've seen more than a few episodes of that that's just it's so amazing like Halla each monster has like a level and a you know whatever that it gets you and I don't know it's like I mean that kind of stuff it's just it's bits to me it's beautiful because it's a whole different like and the idea of fighting a monster and the way you fight them is also how you prepare them for dinner yeah and that the techniques that you're using are you preparing them to be skinned you're like a culinary fighter subclass like a blade like a blade master type yeah it's you know as their sous master their slices cut off fillets and you get done and there's just everything's piled up and I've got your sauces here and you just start the campfire and you start cooking it right there just managing like a Benihana chef right they do the whole thing in the middle of combat including the little steam volcano like if they have a searing sword then then they could cook as they cut yes they kind of slice off cutting and it's fleas it back to their friends to the henchmen that are back there back preparing preparing the feast so the second combat is over by turns around there's a full prepared feast right there man that's I mean I feel like that's that that's just showing off like they're just yes that's trying too hard if that's your whole deal you know some people want to rule the world some people want to overthrow governments I just want to prepare a good a damn good dinner it's a lot of like just concepts and ideas and and there is a lot more where you're talking about but I'm I'm interested in like the mechanics of it like and I think number one if you go and look at nay I believe it's the players handbook you'll find that food like needing to eat and drink has two separate rules associated with it if you don't eat you automatically gain a level of exhaustion but it's possible to stave off exhaustion from dehydration by being really good at Constitution states it seems to me that should be reversed since you can only last about three days without water in like a couple of weeks without food and with the dehydration there's a you know you're saving to avoid taking on two levels of exhaustion instead of one you're gone might we get one but then the same if you fail you get to where is it's just automatic one with food so I would probably like merge them together and just you know use dehydration but with a different time onset for food because I do like the idea of you have to save to do this so that's sort of like the base rule there's already rules in here for eating for for whatever there's already a variant rule that says you don't get your hit by back until you've been able to eat and drink and rest and so in that sense the part is part of the foundation that I was talking about the other ones that I would the rules that I would look at are the foraging rules from travel which are in the dmg which just kind of tell you how much food you would get forage action while traveling that can represent collecting of spices herbs smaller things that you might eat you know this is a lot of discipline around the magical food and the like but there's nothing stopping you from eating the dire rats and a dungeon because your rations got spoiled you know which is we just really sorted the whole basis that I had for this video was like doing something more with those two weeks worth of rations yeah you know most of the time you write it down at character creation and you never think about it after that but you know if you're trapped somewhere you got to eat what you got to eat then you might be glad that you gave it some thought well but what if there's only like sentient creatures around cannibalism and ads really the eating of sentient creatures is a a you know it's something that you'll want to discuss with your group certainly now I have I know what happens in my world it's that if you eat a dead sentient creature you become a ghoul eventually and if you eat a live one you become possessed by the spirit of you-know-who which is basically Windigo that's how I've handled it there you know demons will will are attracted to that kind of taboo behavior but maybe they're not in yours and maybe the eating of sentient creatures is no big deal because maybe there's like 64 different kinds of them and so many of them there's an infinite variety out in the multiverse so what does it matter how many there are you would want to think about that though because there are some situations that you're you'll find yourself as a player in that say eating a party member might be the only way your character survives you know you might be trapped somewhere where cannibalism is just sort of what's gonna happen maybe a hinge for the first fellow party member but those are obviously things that you want to like talk about with the group beforehand and if you're curious as to why this would come up at all and what the hell we're talking about and I have a crazy number of RPGs in which cannibalism is directly addressed with a variety of that it was consequences and benefits for it so it is a thing that comes up in some games and just watch the movie alive actually don't do that if you don't really have to but you might get some you might get some penalties from that you know magical prions or something like that you know it's a be careful with what you eat so especially like a mind flayer brain oh yeah would be the greatest delicacy of all maybe really turn other brain maybe it's like a moray eel and like you're not supposed to eat like eels another big fish like that because like all of the toxins and the water buildup in these apex predators like what if all the magic brain talk that are from all these fantasy arrays from drinking potions and having magical spells live in their brains you know and all these kinds of things get built up in the mind flair and if you eat a mind flayer brain then he might choose psychic apotheosis or you might get turned inside-out like one of those right yeah like restraint Cronenberg to kind of return a bit to the mechanic stuff this is why I would include mechanical benefits to these because you can avoid those things by say a series of good spell check or skill checks the use of spells and ingredients to counteract certain things you know in a really detailed system like this you could keep track of which foods cancel out which other ones I just thought of the fact that there are certain ways of even eating and you know constructing a diet which would be every time paleo Atkins diet my drawing all kinds of different move well beyond those well you do a Paley Oaks you probably just like travel back there you know get the kind of food that you need bro you've harvest it you've identified where the modules you've harvested you've got your magical plants you've made your survival rolls your nature rolls your cooks tools and all that stuff and it comes down to like actually preparing them you know is this a downtime activity that's done that camp that you you know sort of engage in is that tied is the act of eating these things beyond like getting a little magical benefit is there anything like that do you get back hit die for them do you get back some sort of resource maybe there's magic food that restores spell slots or maybe there's food like honey cakes and adventures of middle-earth that takes away exhaustion yeah you know and you you know maybe you gain more benefit the more complex the meal is you know so that the more things you've gathered and the more items that you have you're eating that maybe it restores more of whatever it is that you'd like to but I do think this is where you have that final Constitution saving throw because magical food poisoning should be a thing like it'd be a risk you know you're eating dangerous food strange dangerous food you know you would want to have some sort of guidelines in place for what happens when it goes wrong and it comes back up or it wasn't prepared right or or it goes completely right and you have some magical tea and biscuits and your god yeah this teton the best yeah the very very absolute best it gives you a you know a benefit and a drawback for you find that at first it gives you a really great benefit and then the more and more you eat of it the less and less you get of that benefit until now you're like dependent and if you don't have it you suffer drawbacks oh yeah you know that's the sort of addictive quality that you were talking about yeah oh yeah you're addicted to t become a tea expert but you constantly refer you know you constantly say I I really like chai tea all the time and everybody's like but trust me I'm the expert but I think of like other mechanical considerations for this I'm struck by the fact that the alchemists as written and as the time of this filming their alchemist is not or not out bizarre artificer as written which is still in play test has a really like just a perfect correlation between the kind of character I envisioned and the way that the artifice of practices their magic through the use of tools I really could probably I might probably would use the alchemists and just have like a vegetable person that there's they're much less you know like one of those early modern portraits of the habsburg if that's just kind of it like they're always at their stew pot cooking they're always gathering ingredients to cook I was drawing something preparing something doing this that the other they've got a little vegetable person thing that helps them out me it looks like a rat it's like ratatouille help you cook you wouldn't have to do much with an artificer to make them a cuisine mage yeah gourmand yeah you could use that gourmand feet from that one unearned unearthed Arcana which are off top my head it's like extra hit died whenever you take a short rest bonus two saves versus disease they're like maybe one other benefits I forget but it's a nice feat of probably one of my the more interesting ones from that one but if you're looking for stuff that's not in you know published materials then I would recommend to outside sources the one the first one would be the joy of monster cooking from the DMS guild and it's got a select number of monsters that have like full recipes of how you would cook them as well as suggestion of what the benefits are I like that plus the fact that they've got a more expanded skill system than what Zenith ours has for cooking utensils and then the other one is the Monster Manual which is on the [Laughter] tasty punch which is available on the coins that Scrolls blog and it's primarily focused on first edition D&D but it's a rather system agnostic document and so it has in there like all right what all the likes a regular animals taste like it's got a column for the intelligent humanoid species they like what does a goblin taste like or it's a hog wound or something but then for the really fantastic beasts each one of them gets a description of how you would prepare that dish a description of what it tastes like and then a chart that you roll on after say making a save versus poison or a constitution saving throw depending on your system and it's got everything on those charts and like there's one for each monster from catastrophic disaster to the best you could you know hope for as like those two combined would give you an idea of like what you could do with magical monster food how you would cook it and and kinda like completes the mechanical support that fifth edition provides to the baseline so for dessert Jim let's uh let's have the steps of quick considerations for trolls and other regenerative monsters because you don't want your troll to keep growing after you eat it you don't you really don't we did have a discussion about this and we do have acid in our stomach for reason so maybe you could just eat just eat small bites eat small bites yeah I ever yeah yeah you don't want to get a big chunk of troll flesh in there because then there's gonna be too much surface area of that troll blurs that's not being dissolved by acid yeah so you either troll meat noodles or like bait like Trobe it's like bacon bits but troll just kind of sprinkle on your salad yeah Grom the punch is a Warhammer goblin that ADA but it's like when one of the first Warhammer iconic characters I came across and I was just fascinated by this goblin gorged himself on troll flesh got enormous gained the reserve properties of the troll flesh and then we you know let a big goblin raid on the pile such successful but like there's just something about it where it's it has stuck with me and so I there's usually either someone in a campaign that'll have or reference of eating troll fleshed against some kind of you know regenerative ability or something and and my latest iteration of this is that the viv Amman sirs and bio mages of the the shimmering coast used trolls and a lot of their experiments right figure it rolls pretty adept at its surviving you know magical experimentation they probably have accelerated evolutionary cycle as well you know given how how quickly they regenerate and it just led me to these bizarre thoughts about a lot of them were a bit of all around food of like would you have to give it an acid bath before so it doesn't grow any bigger you know or why wouldn't you just like keep a bunch of trolls around and cut off flank steaks from them and eat them you know other than it being cruel and probably wicked if you are a troll any pieces of yourself to stay alive do you even time starvation if you're a troll and then it just got into a very bizarre situation where it's like troll surgeons who are taking their own limbs and organs and grafting them into other people as a way to like provide medical services for them or like a troll chef that like shaves off bits of their body and cooks them up as a way of like you know I don't know being a troll chef or something you're saving money on expenses you're not having to buy meat and so that's a pretty big cost to run a business from there I just started thinking like okay what are all that you know the kinds of monsters that you might have in the world and and how would you eat them for some reason trolls just one of those that I didn't get off of recently I'm alright that's all I needed they kind of grow on you or in you there's a lot of fun things you can do with trolls graph board of their arms onto yours and see what happens or like a little gory graft or you eat too much patrol and that grows out of your stomach you're like wat cuatro quad a lot of settings that I've seen a lot of homebrew settings I've seen with like where the Tarasque fills that function and you know sort of a city that's built around a Trask whereas civilisations built around tarrasque that that just like munches on this creature all day long there for centuries in the Trask's case and of course produces all wild you know mutations and problems for the people that eat it the Beast of Plenty is what they're called in in land between two rivers cornucopia beast and they are not as big as a Tarasque with pretty big and it's just every part of them is useful every inner organ can be used to make some kind of potion their meat is good and last for a long time tastes delicious and it's just like a thing where you're I can't revise like inspired by something or if it seems like this would happen just like why wouldn't the mages and druids of the world create a creature that's like all your one-stop shop for all of your nutritional and material needs that's what the benevolent biome ages of Lantry two rivers have given that dying hellscape of a world to help the people there survive we're about combining alchemy with magical cooking because I think that's the sort of the natural connection there yeah when you start mixing in like magical sauces and spices yes to the cooking uh-huh and now you you've blended spell-casting and alchemy cooking and it all comes together like I mean that's that would be like if heroes feast was something you didn't just cast yeah but the act of eating it was also the act of casting and you have to go through the whole thing to get to the end and to get all of those benefits yeah but I don't know I mean I I love that kind of stuff it's already in our stories in our fantasy you know from Alice in Wonderland with with eating different things to grow small and short and and and just substances that change your perception whether that's just your perception of reality or you actually like you eat substances that change your reality it changes the next is the next step of that I mean that's all it is is a natural extension of what we already do that's why I love it so much and because it's like it come it knits together the the all the background magic of the world you this touches on say harvesting monsters for making magic items for making potions for making other kinds of things harvesting monsters for spell components and and the things you I need for that it's like if you're playing with these rules you're not hand-waving them you're not saying like okay two weeks of rations you're never gonna worry about food again all right you wrote down a component pouch or you have that arcane focus you're never gonna have to worry about that stuff that's spell casting again like not every group wants to have to deal with this kind of hassle which some of them will see it that way but it's also an opportunity to have like this rich or more complex world that has all these inner moving interlocking parts and the more of that there is the more opportunities the players can go this part of the world really interests me and I want to explore more of that and that's when you make the switch from I'm gonna run the game that I want to run and they're just going to deal with it too I want to run the game that the players want to run because they are interested in something in my world yeah you know what I mean like that's how you get to that place by investing a lot of time effort a new world because then you can finally have like the master chef assassin that creates an entire meal oh man that once you eat it all it will enact a poison and of course he's there eating it too except he has the one extra ingredient that he put that it's in his wine cup and he's having a great time and he's just enjoying watching and he's from the very end of the tables they just start dropping like it's like it's Aria and in the house Frey and then he just finishes his meal and has dessert as dessert walks out peace and quiet the host there's limbus bread right there's the fact that you know there's you know you eat just a nibble of this thing it will sustain you and not just that but it's like it suggests a spiritual sustainment as well but it's not just going to give you what your body needs but like eating this will be comforting eating this will get you through the dark places the promise of exploring this in our bejesus that's what sort of like holds for me what a spicy angel wings taste like homeless angel women probably be there from bonus angel wings I bet you that they're really good you either gain like some healing or some other kind of celestial benefit of them or they're like so pure and wholesome that you really shouldn't eat one yeah I would think he would literally die of happiness you might for it and so euphoric like you literally transcend to whatever plain words coming out of body experience and you're like why would I go back there uh-huh I've already I did it all yeah yeah screw it it's time to go if you're a fan of the movies look Robin Robin Williams we hook with Rufio has a great scene of just what I consider magic food and like when I think of conjure food and water I think of that same ER it's just like a bunch of colored foam you know it's like whipped blue whipped cream and pink icing in many ways I sort of think of that like spells like say create water or create food or heroes feast or something as as creating something that's so flavorful it could never match you know real food can never match it so nutritious real food can never match it you better not eat too much of it because you will really your stomach will change to be like incapable of processing real food if you continue feeding it this magical substance and so that might be how I'd change like those sorts of those sorts of spells like prestidigitation will make that taste better but it'll make it taste way too good it'll be like that time where you're just eating chips and you get like the double flavored one you're like oh this could be so good this thing's practically red with cheese and then you eat it and it's just like oh oh you know it's never as good as you think it's gonna be well that might be my last rambling incoherent thought about the magical food but if you eat the right amount of steak it should give you a flanking bonus Oh God if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and subscribe web DM exists thanks to our patrons on patreon the web DM daemons if you join the
