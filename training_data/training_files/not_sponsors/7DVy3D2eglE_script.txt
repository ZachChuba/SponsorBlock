in this video which has been sponsored by audible but more of that later I shall be talking about secret shenanigans behind the scenes underhand dealings in which Britain was involved and even if you are British you might not know about these because they were kept secret from the British public for many years this is to do with the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982 the military hunter in Argentina decided that it would invade a bit of the the sovereign territory of another nation and see if he can get away with it and as it turned out it didn't get away with it the task force was sent now then what made up this task force well you would imagine that if one nation does something so definitely and flagrantly illegal by international law then it could possibly be expected to get away with this and the whole world would condemn this action so naturally the British thought well okay all our friends let's put together our force and and see these Argentinian invaders off now the EU didn't actually exist at the time but the EEC of which Britain was a member they were still already moving towards that that idea of cooperation for mutual benefit so you can imagine that some of my close European allies might have had but no no none of them none of the European States offered Britain any military help at all and they they might save things they may have said things like it's terribly bad what happened you definitely wrong good luck but that didn't really matter because we had other other ways of getting allies because the United Nations yes the United Nations which United but what the entire world almost all the nations of the world even the Soviets were in the United Nations all Italy the Soviets tended to vote to the other way with for most issues but anyway almost the entire world was part of the UN in the UN and even the Soviets didn't vote against this one but you and absolutely the sipper ously condemned the action of Argentina and right Argentina no bad Argentina go on get out you definitely shouldn't be there you've quite flagrantly invaded the territory of another sovereign nation you're in blatant breach of in flagrant blatant means loudly by the way in flagrant means is visual thing just in case you ever wonder about the difference in blatant and flagrant you're in flagrant contravention of international law so get out and what did the United Nations do about this what nothing there was no United Nations task force put together but there was a bit of finger wagging and that was about it but I didn't matter because Britain was a major player in the biggest most powerful military alliance the world had ever known that's right NATO the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a threat to one member of NATO was a threat to all don't mess with us if you if you encroach on the sovereign territory of one of the NATO nations you could be sure that you would you would attract all to yourself the combined anger of the lot of them because I what did NATO do nothing sorry guys the Americans the the biggest members of NATO they were actually backers of the military hunter in Argentina and they thought it'd be a bit diplomatic ly inconvenient you know embarrassing to be involved in a shooting conflict with regime that they were actually backing so yeah sorry guys you are our closest allies and everything but our you're on your own here and it's all right wait let's not forget the Commonwealth fact that giant friendly League of Nations and to what their New Zealand is as far as I know unbidden came forward and said ships we've got ships do you want ships we can give you some ships and there's some military ships and the British as I understand it turned down this generous and appreciated offer but what actually ended up happening happening I believe is that some New Zealand warships took on the duties of some British naval warships out in the Pacific which then freed up those British warships to then take part in the in the task force and so that was a bit of help from one of our Commonwealth allies that was greatly appreciated however all the actual fighting all the actual shooting all the actual putting themselves in harm's way in order to get the job done was done by British forces so Britain was despite everything completely alone fast forward now to 1999 if you were from Chile or from Britain you may remember that General Pinochet v one-time military dictator of Chile was visiting London and got arrested by the British and then put in house arrest while there was great debate as to what to do next now a lot people were saying well General Pinochet was a military dictator and an awful lot of people on his watch mysteriously disappeared and he you know he should be put on trial for that sort of thing you know things like this should be paid for he should be punished perhaps but either way he should be put on trial while some people were saying okay is arresting him in London strictly legal because we're not sort of it isn't even if it is legal is it ethical and even if it's legal and ethical it is actually a practical thing to do and shouldn't the Chileans themselves be the people who decide what punishment gets meted out and if we could extradite him is it right that we extradited maybe to Spain or to some other country where possibly we can't be sure that he'll get a fair trial and if we send him somewhere forcibly to somewhere where we think he might not get a fair trial are we not being complicit in that injustice and yeah that's good he imagined it was quite complicated a conundrum a lot of arguments went both ways and but one voice one rare voice spoke out in criticism of the way that Pinochet was being treated and this belonged to one Margaret Thatcher she was no longer Prime Minister of Britain but she was still a much heated political figure and she said that Pinochet had been a great friend to Britain he may have done terrible things to other nations and to other people at other times but he had been a great friend to Britain and so we should treat him as according to how he treated us and he was a friend to Britain and if we treat our friends like this then pretty soon we will have no friends this is not a good way to behave in international politics and it was interesting that not a lot of other people joined in and she didn't sort of back this up she wasn't saying how Pinochet had been a great friend to Britain thing is though that she couldn't now in Britain and a lot of other nations that have a legal system derived from the British one Canada Australia and other places there was something called the 30 years where all I say was because I believe in Britain now it's been changed to a 20 year old but anyway there was something called the 30 year rule which meant that all government documents just automatically become publicly available after 30 years I say all it's possible that certain particularly sensitive ones maybe they refer to the identity of a particular spy who's still alive and the enemy still hasn't found out about this spy yet so that's still sensitive so some things can be delayed and they get stamped with to be published 20 years hence or whenever but in general military signals government memos all those sort of things get published automatically after 30 years and they're publicly available and historians wait to pounce the 30 30 years on from some interesting event which they want to research and so they suddenly get their day at their hands on all the documents pertaining to those things now the Falkland Islands were invaded in 1982 in 1999 the 30 year old still hadn't come into into effect with regard to the Falkland Islands so Margaret Thatcher couldn't actually say what Pinochet had done to help the British during the Falkland Islands that didn't come out until 2012 now when in a video that I made recently on bombardment I went off on some bizarre tangent sorry about that and started talking about the default plans and then went on the tangent of the tangent to started talking about how it was pretty amazing that we got no help thanks guys from all our supposed allies I got a message from one dr. Alejandro Velasco and he said well actually that's not the whole story while it's true that the British did all the actual shooting and putting themselves in harm's way Chile did play quite a significant role in the the Falklands campaign and to make it clear to me that he was quite a reliable source he pointed out that his mother worked for the Chilean Navy for over 30 years and became one of their top experts in electronic warfare and here's a here's a picture of her on one of the the southern cold windswept islands in in Chile that were contested by the the Argentinians and she's standing there next to one of the senior commanders Rivlin name of Pablo funda leash and a lot of these Chileans have German surnames and some have English surname so but anyway the point is that the human this this this doctor who wrote to me was someone who was in the know and he sent me this book my secret Falklands War by Sidney Edwards and I just read it and it's lovely in short it's under a hundred pages I do love the book that's short anyway so in all of the fully understand what's going on here I have to go back a bit not to 1982 I'm gonna go back again come back I'm gonna go back as far as 1978 now in 1978 Argentina decided that it was going to have another go at conquering a bit of Chile and there'd been a long-running dispute of three islands that were bordered on the beagle channel which is way down in the in the south of the of the of the land and and down there it's extremely windy and it's not very populated largely because it's so flippin windy there's a tribe there I read once I went to a lecture about a tribe that lived there and the tribesmen I had these big shields if they weren't used for war they were go into walking anyway you had one of these big shields to just protect you from the wind so there you go there's another use for it for a shield live a digression there but anyway so 1978 Argentina quite publicly put together an attack force and he was going to conquer a bit of Chile in fact it wasn't just these three islands that were threatened there was a military plan that was not kept secret that the Argentinians were going to try to cup to the whole of Patagonia which is the whole of the southern cold windswept bit and into a big area in which about a million Chileans lived anyway they sent the task force pout this was in December and it was in what in that the world was midsummer and they hit a summer storm and this was a whopper and they had to call the attack off now the Chilean's had been making protests against the aggressive emissions of the Argentinians and they had turned for example to the Pope there was those Pope Paul for instance and they went to Pope saying do you know the Argentinians that they're trying to invade our country could you possibly you know make a ruling on this they'd listen to you because you're the Pope and the Pope's at all right this is yeah this this sounds quite bad okay give me all the details send me all the various ambassadors and I'll get my people to read through all the files and write summaries for me and I'll I'll consider it and maybe draft a speech and okay you were and then he died Wow so they went to the next pope there was a Jean Paul the first and he actually called himself I believe the first I think he was the first to call himself the first anyway and you thought he called himself John Paul after the previous two popes John and Paul I think was the first to do that as well but anyway he then said oh right sorry I'm going to file about this correct you start from scratch again tell me you who this could you write little reports and I'll get the people to start all over again but okay he was on the K and then he died he was only Pope for 33 days so they then appealed to Pope John Paul the second and talk about timely the storm hits the attack force the the outer genius didn't had to delay their attack and that gave the Pope time to read through all the files drafts speech and make a condemnation not sure if it was an edict or whatever there may have been some official title for DT but essentially he spoke out and said no Argentina bad I will not have some load of good Catholics attacking another load of good Catholics they're Chileans they build churches and they worship God in the correct way and we're not having this it's wrong and invading like this is wrong don't do it and it seems this actually had the desired effect within Argentinean military hunter that was still very ambitious well we weren't then for a bit and this was because there are so many a very devoutly Catholic people in Argentina that if the Pope had publicly spoken out telling their AG not to do so thing then you know that meant that they really didn't have to take heed because the population though oppressed might you know get even more surly now they looked around for another target because if you're a a military hunter you've got to you know you got to do military stuff you've got to convince your population that the population is threatened by outsiders and build up your military and your strength and therefore your power to oppress and you've got to defend against possibly fictitious threats and you've got to make conquests and so forth he's got new military stuff cuz you're a military dictatorship anyway they looked around thought ah the Falkland Islands yeah that about a million Chileans lived in Patagonia but only 1820 people lived on the Falkland Islands and the Falkland Islands was just defended by a single platoon and it was thousands of miles from Britain and be almost impossible to recapture much easier target oh and they're not Catholics either brilliant okay this is our new plan we'll take the Falkland Islands so in 1982 that's what they did by a bit of subterfuge and military might they took the Falkland Islands it wasn't really that difficult because as I just said he was only different there's only defended by a single platoon which put up a reasonably successful but ultimately token defence and then had to surrender to the invaders and then we go back to the rest of our story task forces put together and then sent off to liberate the Falklands from the invaders now about a week later after the initial invasion our man Sydney Edwards the author of this was mowing the lawn when he was suddenly summoned by the Vice Air Chief Marshal was Hey his name was hare and know exactly what he was being summoned to but he guess because the Falklands got invaded a week before he thought okay and he was summoned to RAF Northwood and came into a room filled with just wow so many medals and ribbons it was amazing all the top brass were there the chief the chief of all the various services and all sorts of very senior civil and yeah there was a lot of military might command might in that room so straight away from okay and being involved in something pretty big and he was given this impressive introduction to the other people in the room despite the fact that he didn't actually know why he was there he was told that later he was going to be sent to Chile to act as a sort of air attache but there wouldn't call him that because that would be too obvious if a new air attache was sent to Chile at just that moment it'd be pretty obviously the Argentinians if they found out what was going on stay he came up with another job title for himself but essentially he was going to be an air liaison officer and the RAF man on the spot and he was given the job having been the air attache in Madrid and he spoke fluent Spanish so he was very well qualified he'd trained in the 1950s flying all sorts of planes including hunters that the jet fighter hunter and the Chilean Air Force had some hunters as well anyway so he was given the task and he was not allowed to tell anyone very very few people were in on what his mission was the British ambassador knew about it the Chilean ambassador knew about it and Joint Chiefs of Staff and hardly anyone else he wasn't even allowed to tell his wife but she was a service wife over many years and she she knew what the drill was and so she accepted that she wasn't going to be told because this was strictly needs to know anyway so he flew out to Chile avoiding Argentina and pretty quickly settled in he arrived he managed to get sure see how different cabin security procedures are these days he took his ceremonial sword actually he had it can be in the the locker above his seat on the plane how times change ii-i've had so many pairs of nail scissors confiscated could you say because anyone ever a hijacked a plane with a pair of nail scissors I doubt it but anyway he had a sword anyway so he got down and and very quickly within a couple of hours he'd met the top brass and he was introduced to the various chiefs of the hunter there who were running things and there's a guy there it gave him an abrazo I'm not sure how to say this it's spelt like this a brazeau a browser whatever a big bear hug back slapping thing showing it yeah this guy's alright I accept it we're we're genuine and warm and trusting friends and this went down extremely well in the room and a lot of people thought okay right so this guy can be one of us now who gave him that abrazo well it was the Chilean and did the former Chilean air attache to Madrid so our man knew that air attache and knew the Ambassador to to Spain at the time who was also known of course to the Chileans and it was that ambassador who'd given him a reference saying this guy's a good'n yes you can trust him please give him all available assistance at all assistance you can you can afford him and this shows that he was very well-connected now Tommy will say that oh he only got the job because he was really well-connected it's not what you know it's who you know whom you know but I put it to you that he was able to do the job as well as he was able to do it because he was well-connected he but he didn't just get the job because he was well-connected and that's how he landed the job he was able to do the job so much better because he was very well-connected and that's a good reason for giving him the job in the first place so sometimes yeah it should be whom you know anyway he was then going to work directly under general Rodriguez who was the head of the Air Force and he was also one of the military dictatorship the hunter there were five main members there was General Pinochet the head of a lot and then the heads of the various services and this made life quite a bit easier for instance the first time that he had to walk to the embassy from his hotel he actually set out before remembering oh yeah there's a curfew in the city because I'm now living in a place that's you know it's a military dictatorship and there are police so I'm not really like the British police they're more of a more of a branch of the armed services they they have guns quite big guns some of them they have a reputation for being a little on the trigger-happy side have armoured vehicles and they're like another army really only they're sort of officially the police and anyway he didn't run into any of those and he thought maybe Spencer I just move in to the Embassy it'll be I won't have to do this journey and it'll be quicker and safer but once he'd been accepted by the general rodriguez rodriguez could make things happen and immediately he was given a chilean identity card driver's license curfew past oh okay well yes there are some upsides of working with the military dictatorship although I suppose learn the downsides are more appreciated by the general population of that country but for an era tache working and needing to get things done quickly yeah it was actually pretty handy working with military dictators because and it happened anyway what sort of people was he dealing with well when he went to see the head of the SAS in Britain before setting off he remarked in his book that the head of the SAS hat was wearing two pistols one of each hip and he thought this was pretty extraordinary not seen that before but the head of the SAS had reason to believe that his life was in genuine danger and that members of Argentinian agents might actually be after him and would consider it quite a coup if they could kill him so he for his own defence even in Britain was wearing a pair of pistols but to a British officers eyes that was very very strange well anyway he was in Rodriguez office at one day and rejig eyes had opened his briefcase and it was balancing little precariously on the corner of the table and it got knocked off the table spilling papers all over the floor and a pistol two clips and three grenades yeah he had three grenades in his briefcase this is the the head of the Chilean Air Force but these people were all really friendly and helpful and these were the people he was dealing with he was aware that he was dealing with a military dictatorship but he was as I say aware of the upsides anyway before the crisis before the Falklands cry at this point it's was known in British media as the Falklands crisis because the shooting hadn't started yet the Labour government the previous government in Britain that which had been labour had refused to sell arms to the Chileans but the current Conservative government under the current circumstances thought that this was perhaps a good time to change that rule and start selling arms to the the chileans and of course the the military dictators who are having a lot of trouble getting arms because an awful lot of countries around the world were embargoing arms sales to these military dictatorships in South America they were finding it more and more difficult to procure arms and so this was an opportunity for Chile to be nice to Britain for a bit in exchange for maybe some some bargain arms and they british sold them six hunter jet fighters which were fairly obviously they were mothball in britain but they were still useful enough in in the context of south america and a lot of surface-to-air missiles surface-to-air missiles notice which you good for defense not so useful in attack so that was alright surface-to-air missiles and some and some semi obsolete jet fighters so and that was the sort of deal that was a sort of carrot that they could offer the Chilean's for a bit of help now you understand that the Chilean's had a very strong motive beyond that to help the british because they knew that if the Falklands fell and the Argentinians got away with it they were next they didn't just suspect this say they didn't we weren't just relying on some reports of rumors or were the work of some secret agents or anything the Argentinians were quite open about it to general Galtieri the head of the the hunter in Argentina had made speeches saying that this was this was the his intention he was going to conquer large swathe of Chile well if the Falklands went Chile was next and the Chilean army was no match for the Argentinian army they had a reasonably good fleet they had an Air Force but it was tiny in comparison with the Argentinian Air Force and their army was much smaller as well so they had very good reason to help the British and this it seems that they did now just an anecdote oh man you know I was talking about how he was trying to work out the sort of people he was dealing with and they were always telling me about how terrible things were before the dictatorship in Chile about how the Communists were so incredibly corrupt the people in ordinary people were starving how anything was available in the streets they had no freedoms but meanwhile the senior members of the Communist Party were just rolling in luxury goods and everything was fine for them the corruption was horrendous and and the the previous president president alland you know he had to be he had to be removed because he was so corrupt and at one point they were Air Force planes in the air and the president the Communist president wasn't entirely sure which way the Air Force was going to go with the airport side with him or would it decide vote for the with the military coup that it was what's happening at the time and one of the pilots that Sidney talked who said that he was the guy who launched rockets from his aircraft at the main gates of the palace and blew them off which sent a very clear message as to which way the Air Force was going to be aligned anyway so the they'd swept the power of these people using military force and those are the sort of people he was dealing with but there was a crisis now greater offer anyway so www.automationdirect.com a windswept series of islands in the middle of flippin nowhere a very very long way away from Britain so the logistical problems were horrendous plus you know the Argentinian air force was really big not all of their aircraft were that were the latest but it was pretty big and pretty powerful and they had some pretty advanced jet fighters sold to them some of them by the British but actually largely by the French and they also had Exocet missiles gleefully sold to them by the French and although I have read recently that French engineers who were involved in getting the electronics of the missiles to talk to the electronics of the the jet fighters carrying them they because of the the conflict they actually left the scene and the last few exits missiles that the Argentinians had presented the altitudes with a bit of a problem because they didn't know how to get the missile electronics to talk to the planes electronics which is rather unnecessary to launching them in action but the exercise missiles definitely that they did have them dude proved very effective indeed thank goodness they didn't have very many of them anyway so a bit of a sidetrack there and so the the british relied principally on the sea harrier which was a fantastic piece of British engineering oh yes his vertical takeoff showing the world that you could think out of the box and come up with a radically new design and and before the Falklands the British had been trying to sell sea Harriers and various Harrier Jump Jets around the world and not having a huge amount of success but they were so spectacularly successful in the Falklands war there's suddenly immediately afterwards towards i-safe Oakland's war Falklands conflict because it wasn't there wasn't it wasn't the war no war was ever declared by either side on the other this was a policing action it was a conflict it wasn't a war that immediately after the conflict suddenly people around the world were really keen on buying these Harriers the Americans ended up making them themselves actually under licence in America anyway the British really didn't have very many of them they had two carriers to operate from and they had to provide air cover for the entire task force the fleet getting there and then once troops were on land they had to give air cover to the troops on the land too and that was a big ask for a small fleet of aircraft and one of the problems with the Sea Harrier was that it took quite a lot of time to repair one and it's something to do with the design essentially it's almost whatever it is that you need to get to is behind lots of other things you ended up having to take half the sea harrier apart in order to get to the bit that you needed to mend you'd then mend that better they'd have to put the whole sea harrier back together again and patrolling the huge sea area around the huge area of the Falklands was going to put a huge strain on the airframes and the engines and the limited number of pilots available and the amount of fuel they could carry patrolling a vast area against a air force that hugely outnumbered them that was an enormous problem so information early warning if the British knew how many of what sort of aircraft were taking off in the direction of the Falklands and when and when attacks were to be expected and where then they could patrol enormous Lee more efficiently and give the impression to the enemy that perhaps they had far more aircraft than actually they did and then give better protection to the fleet and air cover over land this became possible because of information supplied by the Chilean's the Chilean's had radar stations not particularly advanced ones the the British flew in another radar which was a set up and manned by four SAS men in secret in in Chile and the the Chileans agreed to share information all the way down the line so that the information would go straight to the the the chief of the Air Force in in in Chile who would then pass it on to the British could then signal it to London and London could then signal the British fleet and that might sound a bit complicated but it worked they got that this system of communication working fast so they so it was proved extremely valuable to the British how valuable well it's very difficult to measure these things but it's noteworthy for instance that when things didn't work bad stuff happened which suggested that when things were working they were working quite well now one of the things that the chileans agreed was that they would delay the the usual servicing of the radar site that they were operating on and sharing information with the British so they were they would the service state would come and there was okay we won't actually shut down and mend it and service it and said what cake would keep operating it because the hostilities are carrying on and they kept operating it and kept operating and eventually it broke down it hadn't been serviced and on the day that it broke down that's when the citrus room and the segala had were hit with the loss of many many lives forty five were killed and a hundred and fifteen men wounded many of them very severely by those attacks and then so that gives you some idea of the importance of this information at the towards the beginning of the the shooting stage of the war of the conflict sorry the air kills were about one to one it was about parity between the two air forces the British and the Argentinian later the British partly because they were sold signed winder missiles by the by the Americans thanks for that guys bit like but thanks that the the odds started to swing in the favor of the RAF but at first it was one to one and the RAF could not afford a one to one kill ratio because the Argentinian air force was so much bigger so it looked actually pretty desperate one thing that was clear at the time actually was that this was a very close run thing this could have gone so wrong I remember for instance that when one of the ships went down I mean the thing went down at the same time as the Atlantic conveyor anyway they listed in the in the British press they listed what was on that ship one of the ships went down for instance carrying loads and loads of helicopters which is why so many of the British forces after landing had to walk everywhere the British the British Army tabbed and the Marines jumped and for a while the word jump went into common parlance because it was mentioned on British television so often and tab tabs just not jumping us that's a much better word isn't it if you if you have to you know get a load of soldiers with loads and loads of Khitan marched them at fairly high speed across a wild wooly terrain of the Falklands would you want to jump or tab you want to jump don't yeah so it's just a better word it just did sorry army but it's just a better word anyway that was because the helicopters well what was sunk and also listed with thousands of rubber coffins the planners the British planners for this task force were were planning for expecting much higher casualties than actually they ended up suffering and the British lived in constant fear of the carrier's being hit because with no carriers there would be no air cover and with no air cover a naval task force was extremely vulnerable and indeed the Argentinians were putting out all sorts of propaganda including publishing pictures in their newspapers which widely believed in Argentina showing pictures of British carriers hit and sinking and on fire and so forth they were giving the impression to their own population that they were winning which was a mistake as it turned out anyway that radar information was super valuable now in order to improve on that sort of thing a signal came from from hair saying how about to sand that those are his actual words nip out the sand Felix a island and see if it's suitable for a an airbase because the British wanted to send a Nimrod Nimrod was the bizarre the expensive British air reconnaissance plane and now son Phoenix island is about 700 miles west of Chile which is you may think a very inconvenient place to to base a reconnaissance plane this meant to be looking at what's going on with the war the other side of the continent but it could be kept secret and this was pretty vital because they did not want the world or the Argentinians to know that there was this cooperation between the Chileans and and the British afoot now our man Sydney flew out with general Rodriguez himself to this island and in his book he says that the reason that the de general accompany him himself was that it was strictly sea needs to know only and he was trying to keep the number of people who knew what was going on to an absolute minimum even the commander of the base that they were visiting was only told to expect an aircraft of some sort and looking down on the island this is tiny volcanic rock in the sea Sydney remarked that it looked like a Bond film location and generally agreed yesterday more than you think actually anyway they landed on the island he was introduced told the commander of the island was told to give him all cooperation and he inspected to see if it would be suitable for landing Nimrods on and bit of a long story but yes it was it was going to be a little tricky to land an emerald on the the landing strip was only just long enough but took up almost the entire length of the island it's very small island but just before they went at general Rodriguez sit down some stairs and there was a huge hidden from the air underground naval base looking even more like a bomb set than than Sydney had has realised anyway so Nimrods were going to fly out of San Felix Island there was a problem though and that was fuel it took so much fuel to get to and from the island that Sydney realized pretty quickly that they're going to need an awful lot more fuel and perhaps somewhere else to refuel and concepción which is a town on the coast of western Chile was used at night now this was another advantage of working with a military dictatorship they could just stop everyone from quite a wide area with with military checkpoints just going anywhere near the airport for a bit and this Nimrods actually who would developed former a civilian plane and they do look from a distance pretty much like a civilian plane of some sort and the Nimrods were given a pretty pretty neutral looking paint scheme they were wearing RAF roundels and the correct serial numbers and so forth but quite quite discreetly painted on on the sides quite small and the paint job yeah at night it looks like some civilian liner so it could land interception refuel and then fly out to Felix which I mean it would arrive with a much much better fuel situation meanwhile also an c-130 Hercules aircraft landed on Easter Island which is way way way to the west of it or the remotest places in the world I would know this it does actually belong to Chile it's part of Chile so they were able to land one of these secretly in this very remote place and then repaint it and when it took off it was then apparently in the Chilean Air Force they was painted in Chilean Air Force colors and that that then few of supplied San Felix with loads and loads more fuel that the Nimrod would be using okay so the British then had Nimrods that they could fly out and then do high altitude and and super high-tech reconnaissance of Argentina flying not over Argentine airspace but flying along the Chilean border at fairly high altitude which is something was a capability that the Chile Chilean Air Force didn't have some of their radars weren't brilliant at seeing over the Andes either so the oh one thing that happened at this point to our guy when he was flying from one place to another he was hit by one of these horrendous storms he's just I suppose he puts the anecdote in in it but it because he very nearly died but also to illustrate that the winds in the in the southern part of South America are just so horrendous they are all strapped in to this aircraft that was just being thrown around such that they would just throw up like rag dolls in their seats one of the doors burst open and banged and flapped loudly and badly but nobody could get up from their seat to to close it again because it would have been suicide to take your seatbelt off and they're being flown right there was a woman captain who was also being transported who just screamed incessantly throughout they were trying to calm her down she screamed and screamed and screamed and they heard the airframe twisting and being tortured by this extreme turbulence and they did think that the whole aircraft was going to be just ripped apart in the air but fortunately they got into just less turbulent air and eventually managed to get to where they were flying to and tried to land they came down low deployed the the flaps and immediately rolled upside down and this point Sydney in the book says despite the thought well this is it then I'm going to die but at the controls were clearly very skilled pilots that managed to get it right way up again and realize what have happened was that the wings had been distorted by the turbulence to such a degree that the landing flaps on one side didn't work so when they put out the flaps they made the aircraft very asymmetrical which flipped it onto its back and then they did a sensible thing which was fly to another airport which had a much longer runway so they could do a high-speed landing without using the landing flaps at all pure I aggression wasn't it but anyway it's very windy I suppose is what I'm saying here's a photograph of the tree growing in that part of the world and yeah a lot of the trees look like that it's it's very windy down there anyway so I'm and Sydney got woken up very early in the morning one day I was 2 or 3 o'clock what what and it was expected there was a crisis on something pretty bad that happened the Nimrod had very nearly been shot down what the hell had happened well the the Nimrod crew suddenly found itself being approached by a load of jet fighters and assuming them to be hostile Argentinean fighters then went into a steep dive and tried to accelerate as much as possible to get away and this looked very suspicious to the oncoming fighters that were actually from the chilean air force and thought well they're making a getaway so presumably he's up to no good right we've been pursuing and they were just about to shoot him down when they got the order not to what had happened was that the radar station that was monitoring at that part of the world for the chilean air force only had one guy who knew about the secret nimrod that was operating in collusion with the british and that guy was just nicked out to the room for a moment to go to the loo or something he was just on a short break and that was when the Nimrod appeared on the radar screen and the other guys in the room went quick scramble some fighters fortunately he just got back from provision whatever break it was and he said oh no no no no that said no that's all right that's I recognise that call signed up say it's fine just don't tell them not to tell them touch who that was really really close how close was it how how close I think well it was closer than that they really did very nearly get shot down but you could say that the British nearly lost the entire campaign the whole Falklands task force mission could have could have ended there because without the Nimrods information it would have been very very difficult to to win the win the campaign and if the Nimrod had been shot down it would have been extremely difficult to keep that secret and then when the collusion between the GU Chileans and the British had been through that discovered then it could have been that the British would then have lost that cooperation and without the chili corporation things could have been so much worse that one missile shot from one aircraft that not found that Nimrod could have scuppered the entire campaign something I've not mentioned is that though our man Sydney was the the air at a shape that wasn't the only health at the chileans were falling to the British because the chileans were also massing troops along the border particularly up in mountainous regions quite a long way from the from from the Falklands and that meant that the Argentinians had to mass troops of their own to stop whatever plans that the the Chileans possibly had with the Chileans threatening to invade were they looking at this opportunity ah looks like the Argentinians are busy fighting in the Falklands then maybe this is our opportunity to to carry out some operation against the Argentinians elsewhere in the country that's massive load of troops along the border oh dear we've been discovered and some of the units with two brigades of specialist elite mounting troops that would have been extremely useful fighting against the British in the Falklands but instead most of the troops that the British powers and and Marines and others were fighting in the Falklands were actually conscripts and not that good and not that well-trained all highly motivated or experienced those mountain troops that were kept away from the front by Chile and land forces might have been freed up if there is oh oh I see that you let the Chileans it's all just a ruse by the Chileans okay we can then send all those all those elite troops to the Falklands so yeah if that Nimrod had been shot down the consequences could have been really dire for the British task force anyway the next big thing to happen is that HMS Conqueror a submarine fired a torpedo that sank the General Belgrano now in Britain this is a notoriously was extremely controversial the Belgrano was outside the so called that the exclusion zone the British had declared an exclusion all around the Falklands and had said that if any Argentinean ships were seen within that exclusion zone they would be fired upon but the Belgrano at that particular moment when it was Sun wasn't in the exclusion zone and so the the morality or legality of that action was was was questioned very severely in Britain and Thatcher Emira Thatcher was given a huge amount of criticism for that act because everyone knew that she must have approved it which she did she she freely admitted that she did approve that what she couldn't say though but what has since come out because the documents have now been released is that it was actually known that the Belgrano was under orders to attack the British task force and not on its own and the Belgrano though it the the actual hull the ship was quite old it had a lot of guns on it to the British fleet was actually outgunned by the Argentinian fleet and the Argentine fleet was far from in substantial and with a half-decent bit of air cover they could have put up a terrific fight and could well have sunk the task force's fleet I'm not here to say which way that battle would have gone but the thing is that there would have been a big naval battle and in a big naval battle many ships would have been sunk on both sides and an awful lot of lives would have been lost and though it is of course hugely regrettable that 321 that men died when the General Belgrano sank the number of lives that that saved is almost certainly enormous ly greater after the sinking of the Belgrano the Argentinian fleet confined itself to Argentinian terrestrial waters and it was no longer a direct threat to the the Task Force so well I'm not going to say whether it is the right thing or the wrong thing but I'm just saying that we now know it is it is now an established historical fact that the Belgrano was under orders to attack it would have had it not been sunk and the British knew time it was going to attack so the two days later hms sheffield got hit there was an exercise missile and i remember this now it's possible that i don't think I've been saying our when I refer to the British I've been saying the British task force etc but if ever I do say our I hope you forgive me I normally try to avoid saying our when referring to the British or the Western Allies or whoever it might be in my videos but I think I'm I'm more justified in saying our in this video because I was actually alive at the time this is part of my childhood of course I played no part in the conflict but I was following it on television and radio not completely understanding whether I was I was learning but I can remember they did something which in Britain is utterly extraordinary fact I cannot think of a single other occasion in my life this has happened they interrupted normal programming on television to to go live to a statement for the Minister of Defence and I can remember the British newsreader who appeared on it on our screens all around Britain the look on her face was so grave it was immediately just from the look on the newsreaders face you knew that this was going to be really bad news and don't forget we were terrified that we're going to lose our carriers and that they're just they were just you know a couple of ships one missile could have taken out the carrier and suddenly the whole enterprise could have been doomed it was the Sheffield being sunk yes very bad news but at least it wasn't one of the carriers and anyway a man Sydney got woken up again something like 3 o'clock in the morning and something else had happened a British burned out wreck of a helicopter had been found in Chile and a rather angry Chilean Air Force commander wanted to know what the heck was going on thing is that Sydney didn't know no one had told him he guessed that maybe this was some special forces mission that he hadn't been told about because if we need to know only and it had gone wrong maybe the evidence was that it had landed and then been deliberately scuttled rather than had crashed and there were there were no crew members or passengers anywhere to be found and the Chilean army and forces were then looking for these men and this was huge media story in Chile don't forget that the Chile's role in in this conflict is secret from the British public and the Chilean public and so the the Chilean media is up in arms that what this into foreign troops on our soil what's going on these British what are they up to and there was a manhunt for the de croo eventually they were found and the story had to explain what they were doing there our man Sydney didn't know he got in touch with his boss back in Britain the air vice-chief smart and she thought he didn't know either because it's strictly need-to-know and but eventually found out that this was part of something you can look up it's called Operation Mikado I think it's probably a good idea Shin Mikado never went ahead I think that the the drawbacks of it were probably greater than the potential upside but who's to say I'm not I'm not priests into or whatever the the opposite of precinct I don't know that I don't know the truth of everything so Mikado was a extremely dangerous one-way trip into Argentina itself to destroy the last xsn missiles that belonged to the Argentinian airforce so the idea was to land to do what the SAS was originally set up for it was originally in world war ii for destroying german luftwaffe assets on the ground behind the lines and this was going to be an essayist mission doing pretty much that taking out the last of those Exocet missiles and the helicopter that had been found burnt out had inserted a group of SAS men into argentina who were then going to watch the airfield through binoculars and other forms of surveillance and report on what to make sure that the Exocet missile were actually there and how they were guarded and what was going the base and what they were they were then guide in a very daring raid that was possibly near suicidal of about a hundred SAS who were going to lend actually on the air base on the runway and just in a very bold move pile out of the aircraft and blow everything up and then trying to get out of there yeah but it was a one-way mission as I say because there wasn't enough fuel to get all the way out there and all the way back with all the equipment they needed so they in the helicopter inserted the SAS men dropped them off and then went to Chile and scuttle itself the idea was for discover itself out to sea but that went wrong in the ended up having to scuttle it where it can be seen on land so how to explain this well they came up with a reasonable story about how they were they were they they thought they were in Argentina and that they suffered a malfunction in a in a storm fortunately they actually was terrible weather so that back that all checked out and not knowing where they were they accidentally landed in Chile and so they scuttled the aircraft course if they know they're in Chile they wouldn't have done that but they scuttled their car thinking what if this falls into the hands of the enemy and then they they scattered into the countryside and hid from the forces that they thought were Argentinian then later they realize I were in Chile we can just hand ourselves in everything's fine and a press conference was was organized and this story was put across and we was good enough it seemed that the public bought it but there was one media reporter who just just wasn't letting go and he he kept this story alive and kept referring to it again and again and man Sydney remarked Rachid report on something else because it'd be quite good for this this story just to die and and and supposed to be able to go get on with it without the distraction of this and that people being reminded of it and possibly putting two and two together and it seems that that journalist was visited by a couple of burly gentlemen one evening and those those heavily armed burly gentlemen made it very clear that they would be unable to guarantee the safety of that journalist if he were to continue harping on about that particular news item and that maybe he should report on something hmm so again you could say that's that's a benefit of working with a military dictatorship things like that can be made to happen but hmm personally I'm rather glad that I don't live under a military dictatorship right now I say that I think it's a good thing that they didn't go ahead as it happens the the usefulness of the the exit missiles came to a halt and if the mission had gone ahead yes it might be very spectacular and everything or well the SAS aren't they amazing and they've carried out this daring raid but that would have been an attack on the Argentinean mainland and that could have that could have politically been used against Britain as a lever to to lever away all potential allies I think Britain internationally would have lost a lot of sympathy including a lot of potential sympathy even from South American countries Peru was on the same side as Argentina they were they were there were other countries in South America that could have been sucked into a greater conflict it's probably a good idea that that raid got abandoned the the the SAS called it off I think that was a good decision anyway the the British needed more photo reconnaissance and there was a plan to sell Canberra aircraft to the to the Chileans and for this purpose to have flown to Belize to a British base in Belize and that actually ended up being subject to an awful lot of delays diplomatic channels got a little bit clogged plus the Argentinians put around a false rumor that these were in fact phantom jets and that they were being sold to the Chilean's for her aggressive purposes which was wasn't true but it did have the effect of throwing off a lot of the the diplomats who were not in on what was going on into a bit of a panic and that caused more delays and that whole plan actually got called off and as he rather mysteriously of this book puts it other means of aerial photographer Geographic reconnaissance were arrived at I am pretty sure he's making reference to satellite information from rather belatedly to the British by the Americans which was another bit of a help that the British got from the Americans but it was of the non putting herself in harm's way kind and he was also at least secret for a short while thought for long enough for it to to be secret right so now there was in that's fast Ford now to the end of the conflict and the task force was successful and the islands were liberated the British flag was very incompetent Lee I remember raised over the island the British unlike the American military who who are all very good at raising flags cuz they get a lot of practice in it's quite clear from the way that the British do it that the most of have never done it before and they made a bit of the pig's ear of it but anyway that famous for the footage of the British flag being raised over Port Stanley by some Marines I think it was was televised all around the world and there was a huge party to celebrate in Chile a man was there and they were so happy because because that had that campaign had been successful from the British point of view the Falkland Islands had been liberated and the hunter defeated the Chileans could breathe a huge sigh of relief and their role in the whole matter which was very very important very very instrumental possibly even decisive was kept secret until 2012 this book was published in 2014 and it was a you could say bit of a win for Argentina as well because the military dictatorship in Argentina fell the following year largely spurred on by that there the failure in the Falklands right so there you go oh that's a pretty interesting interesting tale about subterfuge and how a small number of people and working behind the scenes can make a huge difference to the outcome of a conflict [Music] Sydnee man [Music]
