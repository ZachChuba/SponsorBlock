I could sit here and Rambo away for entirely far too long but the pros and cons in excruciating detail of this cooler but instead I'm gonna give you a sort of rendered look at the color and give you an understanding of it so that you can make up your own mind if it's actually any good and if you want one or not instead of me having to try and dictate that to you with that said asrock for sponsoring this video so of course there's a 500 cool event it's a pretty unique design in comparison to their existing product line remarkably at least styling wise anyway it doesn't have any RGB any LEDs are lighting at all which is something I didn't think I'd say about a corsair product basically ever again but there you go for some people that is going to be a massive selling point and for others a complete turn off button I thought I'd mention it anyway functionality wise it's a jewel tower cooler with 4 heat pipes and 2 ml 120 fans strapped to the sides actually there pre-attached out of the box which is kind of nice they are attached through fans roads which I assume is meant to be for maintaining the static pressure the fans creates but that's kind of wasted efforts as they've put a massive hole in the middle to be able to mount the cooler and actually the plate that's on top of it is has eight great so there's a pressure differential there and I would also mention that that plate is not actually connected to the cooler in any meaningful way it's just got a plastic plate underneath and connects to a plastic plate on top of the cooler instead of any back well like I said in meaningful way now that massive hole is sadly not big enough to fit another fan in it's only there for you to be able to mount the cooler and it's actually small enough but tall enough the Corsair felt they had to include what is ostensibly a rather light quality a very long necked Phillips screwdriver in the box so that you can actually mount the thing when it comes to mounting it seems to be relatively simple on the surface you have basically at least for a and B anyway a couple of brackets and some spacers you attach to the existing motherboard back place and then you drop the cooler on top and use the two captive screws with your extender screwdriver to be able to screw it in now it does have thermal paste pre applied which is nice to see but that was kind of wasted on me as you really cannot see the studs that come off of the the brackets that go on the motherboard and how they relate to the the caps of nuts that are on the cooler and so I ended up completely ruining the thermal paste and had to use the extra cheaper thermal paste that comes in the box to get it right which brings us nicely onto its performance I was testing with a rising 3900 X which is a 12 core CPU that draws about one hundred and forty five Watts when doing the blender and BMW test render I was using to stress the CPU 100 cent load and this cooler was seeing temperatures of around 83 to 84 degrees Celsius now that's not too bad especially for one of those higher end rising chips but for ninety pounds and expect a little better the thing is though I actually spent basically a full day troubleshooting this cooler to make sure that those results were accurate as possible I tried repai stting it I tried resetting it I tried different mounting pressures I tried changing the fan headers I tried changing mounting pressure on the fly to see if that made any difference and I actually even tried Arctic MX for thermal paste instead of course there's TM thirsty basically everything I could think of to make sure that there was no strike URIs and as far as I'm aware they are so compare those results to a somewhat similarly priced a IO save frankly as I&S 20 for a cooler I very regularly and highly recommend and that one guess about 5 to 10 degrees Celsius less on average than the a 500 while still being overall quieter than they 500 and honestly in my opinion a good bit more stylish although that of course is subjective now that cooler like I said is about 10 pounds more than the a 500 and so you do have to spend a little bit more and with an air cooler you do in theory anyway get mass of longer-lasting reliability in that slowly two moving parts in this and those are the phones and so you can always replace them they die whereas if a water cooler pump fails then you're pretty much out of luck with that said though if I was genuinely concerned about some long-term reliability and I wanted an air cooler that would seemingly perform pretty similarly I'd get some like artx freezer 34 eSports gym which I've tested on a regular basis and is an amazing cooler pretty quiet more stylish and less than half the price of this overall them I don't think this is something I would go out of my way to recommend it's not a bad choice by any stretch of the imagination and I suspect that on higher ISO power output chips you might have a little bit of a better time with it especially considering just how much physical mass there is in terms of heat sink here but for the average buyer I would generally either recommend if you want to spend about 90 to 100 payments go get something like the fractal design s 24 and if you want an air cooler specifically then go get some over the artic freezer 34 eSports Joe that would be my personal recommendation and/or of course there's the option of going with Noctua know what that said those are my thoughts and my my experiences with it and I would love to hear yours in the comments down below what do you think of a 500 what do you think of the no RGB design and also what do you think of his performance do you let me know in those comments down below if you want to see more videos like this one every Monday Wednesday Friday hit that subscribe button of the bell of Haitian icon if you want to check out the a500 cooler there is an Amazon affiliate link in the description down below that will take you to your local Amazon store where you can see pricing when and where you watch this you can also check out the rest links if you want to support the channel and more ways than just watching these videos stuff like Amazon and overclocked affiliate links don't cost you anything to use but massively helped me out we need to use them or stuff like merch for hoodies that this one our load of other cool designs and there's also stuff like streamers OBS and a lot of us stuff down there too you can also check out more videos over there I'll try and leave the fractal design task 24 review over there so you can check that out but otherwise that is pretty much it if you have any questions leave those in the comments down below and we'll see you in the next video
