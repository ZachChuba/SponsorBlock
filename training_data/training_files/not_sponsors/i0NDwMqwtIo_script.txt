hi guys my name is grace I'm back with another video and this is ugly this is ugly cuz I saw this music video came out 30 minutes ago I didn't even know was coming out today it was a my recommended and it was the earliest I've ever been like a half an hour so snaps for grace right now but yeah it's I read in solji's monster music video I'm not sure if Irene and solji's music is supposed to be on the same wavelength as red Velvets music but saying that red Velvets music their discography is like literally all over the place style-wise so I don't know if their music is supposed to be kind of red velvety I hope it's on the same length as psycho and bad boy cuz those are my vibes and that's what I'm here for but yeah I don't know let's see what goes on alrighty I've got it up so I will press play now oh wow look at that body soon I'm in prepares oh wait she looks like all badass and then she gets cute you'll dominate me also getting all hot and bothered up in here but I have a trouble telling the members of red velvet apart just cuz I do I don't know I can tell who Irene is if I see a picture of Irene but I can tell who Wendy is I can tell who Irene is but if red Velvets all together I can only tell who wendy is and I have trouble mixing up Sookie and Irene so [Music] come on focus [Music] [Music] it's giving me very twins from the shining vibe when they're in these dresses they're you know holding hands come play with us daddy I don't know if anybody is gonna get that reference you should but yeah oh I love that it's like a girl-crush concept that is always what I'm here for like I said and they look incredible I love silkies dark lipstick and her smoked out eye and the choreography looks really cool too yay I'm so excited okay okay okay also the girls are coming for us these past couple of years the the females of the kpop industry have been dominating in my opinion especially this year you know black pink a back even though that wasn't my cup of tea they broke a bunch of Records with it Maria oh by hasa such a good song that's such a good song chung is coming back I saw she released a song called play I mean now irenan soulgee are here like the girls are not coming to play right now they are coming for our throats [Music] I'm loving these outfits too I'm loving the construction of that the the little like peplum thing at the bottom of that corset oh so cool [Music] one thing I do have to say about things like this music video they they in in kpop there's a lot of fanservice you said especially see it with male idols where they get really close to each other or they start touching each other and like flirting with each other or whatever or in music videos and choreography they have to get really close to each other and like touch each other or act like they're about to kiss there's something and I know not everyone is super comfortable with that but a lot of idols tend to be forced into those situations oh wow and you know I don't want to be an advocate for it I don't want to speak out about it you know if these people don't actually feel this way but I do know personally some people are not comfortable with things like that so you see it a lot in these music videos and they use imagery like this and you know some people may not be comfortable with that and it's it's a tool used to pull fans in and sometimes there's a disregard for how the artists actually feel [Music] oh I'm I'm so obsessed with this choreography like [Music] they did this in bad-boy to where they got really close to each other or whatever but in their music video but commenting on the choreography the choreography there are only two of them so they're not filling up a whole bunch of space that's what they have the background dancers for and they can't do like really cool things just as the two of them they could be using their background dancers to help with that but they're not really but the way the person who choreographed this choreographed this they did such a good job of having them play off each other and dance together instead of just having them dance side by side it's really difficult to do that in a pair or as a solo without using all of your backup dancers like chung is a good example of a soloist using her backup dancers to fill more space but there's a difference between that idea and Irene and Sol these choreography where they're playing off each other [Music] [Music] I'm sorry to keep pausing but I'm wondering how that lyric is gonna fly out and the Korean culture because I know there are some tensions stemming from Japan's occupation of Korea during World War Two and the flag of the red Sun the rising red Sun and that there was a scandal I forget which girl it was which group it was the idol went to Japan and used a geotag on the snapchat and the geotag had the flag of Japan's flag during World War two which is the Rising Sun flag and it caused a lot of controversy within the Korean community but I don't know I'm not Korean and I don't know if this is a direct translation I don't know I'm not qualified to comment on that but it's just like [Music] Oh their contacts oh my goodness [Music] I'm I'm in love with these girls voices I I love red velvet's I think red velvet has the best vocals of the big three girl groups but these girls have deeper registers they're not hitting super high news count me obsessed but as I was saying about their vocals they just have great deeper register vocals and they have a nice color to their voices and it's just nice to listen to it's like refreshing to listen to it's unique for their scene SM outdid themselves with this one if I'm being honest in my personal opinion it was so good it was so so good I I love the dark concepts obviously that's kind of my thing that's what I'm here for that's what I live for and I really loved seeing them do a fully dark concepts like I am the monster and not just I am a hot girl dressed in all black there they're talking you know they are the darkness I have no words like it's just so good it's just so so so good um yeah and what TQ guys think of this obviously I'm here I'm loving it what do you guys think please let me know in the comments down below that's I read and sulji came for me gutted me ripped me apart my heart out but I let him I'm thanking them for it honestly bye-bye
