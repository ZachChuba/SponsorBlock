hello everybody and welcome back to a brand new video today we're back with another market analysis uh for the month of october now today i really wanted to talk about botting it's kind of been well i don't want to call it the flavor of the month because it's always around but there's been a lot of talk about bodine this month from stuff like the twitch prime promotion which happens every once in a while but also jagex has taken down a couple of bonding websites as we're gonna have a look if any of those things have affected the economy of specific items or just on a macro level as well and to top that off we'll have a look at anything else that was interesting in the runescape economy this month anyway guys i hope you enjoyed the video if you do i really appreciate it if you leave the video like always helps out with the youtube algorithm thank you so much and let's get started now a couple of days ago jakex finally got around to banning a couple of very popular botting websites for example rs bot and powerbot now these have been really old websites have been around forever while i'm pretty sure these aren't the most popular botting clients anymore it is still a move in the right direction and this is definitely good news overall now these websites close down october 3rd yeah so we go to powerbot uh it's closed down all of it's been shut down as so one of the more well-known body websites have been shut down and based on that information you would think that heavily bonded items would go up in price as there would be less bots well let's have a look at that first up here we have cannonballs let's have a look at the last week well if anything they've actually decreased in price a bit looking at the last month cannonballs have decreased from 160 down to 140 most likely to do with the twitch prime promotion now let's go ahead and double check that with a couple of other items looking at both strings over the last week possibly that could have been affected by the website shutdown but looking at the bigger picture here that is what the twitch prime promotion has done instantly dropping it from 130 down to 87. that's a big drop looking at red chinchampas actually the price is again decreasing and if you look back at the last month they've gone from 1.3 k down to almost 1 000 so that's almost a 300 gp decrease on that one winds up zamrak they're going down as well from about 1400 at the beginning of september all the way down to 1150 uh let's look at dragon bones over the last month yeah those have decreased a lot looking at the last quarter it's just been nothing but straight downhill green dragon hide has stayed a bit steady for some reason and finally here we have raw shark again kind of steady as i think it's fairly obvious that any decrease in body and activity caused by the rs bot website shutdown was fairly easily countered by the twitch prime promotion we definitely have gained more bots than we have lost in the last month or two now pretty much across all heavily boughted items they're going down in price right now now of course that is in part due to stuff like the twitch prime promotion straight up we're just getting more bots also though player counts have decreased a bit and with less legitimate players to buy up these items the price just will continue to tank as my theory is the amount of bot stays pretty consistent but the overall player counts fluctuate a lot with actual players and the final thing is just more on a macro level things have just been decreasing in price pretty much across the board so it is kind of understandable that most items have just been trending downwards now recently one of the more popular botted items has become the pharaoh scepter kind of interesting that pyramid plunder became one of the best mid game money makers for bots every time a twitch prime promotion comes around pyramid blender is flooded with hundreds of bots now obviously that will have a pretty significant effect on the price of the pharaoh scepter the main monetary reward now if we look at it we can see back in august that there was a pretty big dip from around five mil down to four mil now something i find kind of interesting though is that although there's a really big increase in supply right around when the twitch prime promotion started the price actually didn't fall much further than that sure another 200 300k which maybe is about 10 of its total value but not as much as one would imagine now if i were to guess i think people are also trying to take advantage of this and stock up on them as a merch as most of us know that the twitch prime promotion is not forever and when it does end the price is most likely going to shoot back up or at least that's what people think i think because of that reason the price has stayed relatively consistent even though there is a massive increase in bots in pharaoh scepters another interesting item this month is actually coal and when you think of increase in body activity most people think of price it decreases however the opposite is also possible for example here we have coal over the last month the coal has gone up a lot in value again starting pretty much when the twitch prime promotion came out going from around 140 at the beginning of the month all the way up to a peak of 207 that is a massive increase and brings it up to almost a yearly high now most likely this is due to the fact that a lot of money makers do require coal and a lot of bots have jumped on those for example making cannonballs or making bars at the blast furnace now another kind of interesting item this month is the freminit kilt not really sure what's going on with this item but if we look at the month graph uh it shot up from around four mil at the beginning of last month up to a peak of 8.6 mil which means it's almost doubled in value now in this case it did start to trend upwards before the twitch prime promotion came around as i'm not entirely sure if it's linked to that but still kind of a meteoric rise for an item that i didn't think was actually that useful now let's move on from bots to other interesting events that happened in the economy this month now one of the biggest price changes that happened over the last month was to the ancient teleport tablets and that is of course due to the fact that they were made to be craftable now this happened last wednesday as almost a week ago now and most of the teleports have dropped from somewhere between 15 000 and 20 000 down to like 1 000. the anacar teleport going from a peak of 20 000 gp this month down to 2 000 something like that uh the lasar teleport pretty similar story down to 1200 from around 16 000 earlier now it's pretty clear why this happened previously you'd have to buy those are teleports with bounty under points or some other weird iteration of that there was no easy way to get it but now that they are craftable it is so much easier to get these there's way more supply and thus the price tanked dramatically now one thing i found somewhat surprising and i was a little curious about is i'm surprised the price didn't drop before this update as we knew it was coming we didn't know exactly when but i think most people could surmise if this thing becomes craftable the value is going to drop really really quickly but actually from july till almost mid-september they actually doubled in price kind of weird that even though jagex put forward some pretty direct information that they were going to make it easier to get these yet the price didn't fall until the update dropped now there's an item that is kind of in the complete opposite situation uh something like the crossbow is looking like it could become way more scarce as jagex has made it extremely clear that they're looking to either nerf the revenant cave change something about it or even potentially delete it altogether now because of that there's a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen with the crossbow will it go to other content that could be harder could they go to content where there's even more of them coming into the game who knows but based on the price changes i think most people's assumption is that the cave is just most likely going to get nerfed in some capacity now even if the drop rate of the crossbow doesn't get changed if the overall loot of the cave or the difficulty gets harder then less people are going to be farming in general and because of that less wilderness weapons will come into the game even if nothing changes about them and so the crossbow has gone from around 6.5 mil all the way up to around 9 mil has a pretty big change this month and well this week really a very similar thing with the vigorous chain mace going from 2.3 mil actually all the way up to 4.2 mil almost a doubling in price and well yeah nobody really cares about the thamron scepter too much uh so not much of a change there and the final somewhat random item i wanted to have a look at is the uncut onyx is once again dropped down below 2 million gp bringing it down to once again one of the lowest points we've ever seen and it doesn't look like anything's really going to change about that but yeah pretty interesting price trajectory this year going from around 2 mil all the way back up to three mil and once again down to two milligan and finally here i want to have a look at the trend of pvm items this month as a pretty good indicator to where the market's going and well in general it looks like the market is still going down even over the last month the dragon warhammer has gone from 50 mil down to 45 but that's another pretty solid decrease just in a month keep in mind though the bigger picture a year ago today that is pretty much what the price was anyway i think we have the direct enter lance which again has seen a pretty significant decrease of almost 10 mil this month bring that down to a yearly low uh so if you were looking to pick up a lance i don't think that would be a terrible decision i normally don't try to give any real investing advice the dragon enter crossbow continues to decrease going from 95 mil down to 90 mil looking like it's probably headed for a yearly low as well and of course we have the trusty twisted bow i've seen a bit of a price decrease of around 10 mil but not too significant actually i don't know the twisted bow is one of the most consistent items of all time it seems now question that gets asked a lot is why is the twisted bow not decreasing i mean there's more coming into the game every day while that is true there are also more people who are finally able to afford the twisted bow pretty much every day as well the twisted bow is rare and expensive so those two factors do somewhat counter each other sure eventually the twisted bow might decrease but considering it might be arguably the best item in the entire game i don't think it's probably going anywhere anytime soon and uh finally here we got the osrs bond continuing to go up in price ge tracker is actually showing a 6.3 mil offer price which is kind of crazy we're getting pretty close to the peak of last year not quite there yet got another 500 600k to go but i think it's a pretty safe bet that we will get the most expensive bond we've ever had so if you are trying to grind it a free to play for some reason better do it quickly anyway guys thanks and a few other awesome perks thanks for watching guys and i'll see you next time
