so all that's left to say is happy shopping and enjoy today's video that's a full-on jump she went from there to there ho liquor hey everybody so good morning to you i'm driving into work and i'm going to be taking meg out in an enrichment walk just arrived at the sanctuary today the enrichment walk is going to be slightly different we're going to take make out let her do a thing and then once she's settled down i'm going to fire the hashtag ask make questions at her this will be part two in what diseases can lions get in part one basically outlined the diseases and then we went straight into coronavirus and its transformation into fip or feline infectious peritonitis today we are going to be talking about pan leukopenia so if you don't know what that is stick around you're not going to want to miss out on this one hello my girl we ready to go rocking and rolling hey she is ready for her walk gently huh [Music] slowly slowly somebody's happy to go walking [Music] oh boy yes scratch scratch scratch okay so meg really doesn't need much persuasion really doesn't need much persuasion to go walking this is look at it oh boy it is like a little a little lion cub hey meg you're definitely not acting your age okay sweetie let's go then you go [Music] right as easy as part mega is loaded and we are ready to rock [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] that mind is working overtime just taking in all the senses and the scents um she's just really the mind is completely overwhelmed by all the smells in this area so it takes a while before she'll get into the mode of of walking again but this is about her it's not about me so i'm quite happy to just situ and let her do her thing and she's rolling around like a like a little cub get through that little surface tick so as you walk through the bush these little guys if you can see him a little pepper tick and they are waiting on the ends of the grass like that and then as you brush past this little guy you see he's there and as you brush past boom he's on you wow look how this is all just dried up sure hey my girl this is crazy this air this area just ain't got any [Music] bed to uh keep the the water in it's just the clay is not it's not good enough i mean it has got clay soil here this is definitely black cotton soil but yeah it's just interesting we've had quite a bit of rain this season so i didn't think i'd be walking through this riverbed oh look how the lilies are all suffering this had this had water in it guys about a week ago sure maggie [Music] [Music] that's a full-on jump across this water it's insane i can't believe she did that i thought she was going to jump to that rock over there but no she went from there to there ho liquor okay found it [Music] here's a favorite spot of his [Music] wet you're wet you're wet she's a wet contact you seriously with that in your [Music] face [Music] okay so perhaps this is a good spot to ask meg a question or two about pan leukopenia in lions oh my god you make me lie in the most horrible places it's really hot you smell like the dam she smells you smell terrible feline parva virus basically it is a virus that attacks the gastrointestinal tract it suppresses immunity and it can cause all sorts of neurological conditions too ah meg so she doesn't like it when i talk about the diseases guys so it's a real horrible disease and it's also quite a resistive disease it can it can withstand um conditions for quite a while it can persist in the environment for a couple of months and even longer if the conditions are right and it's carried obviously by a host individual who then uh either vomits it out or excretes it after other bodily fluids or feces so the unsuspecting um let's let's take a lion for example um comes along smells they're always using their sense of smell they smell this vomit or the species or these bodily fluids and they um they they lick it up or they take it in and boom they've just taken in the virus and then obviously these symptoms are going to start to show and what are they what are the symptoms of pandocopinea well basically lethargy lack of appetite they start to get dehydrated they start to be anemic because what happens is the disease attacks the red blood cells and it also lowers or weakens the white blood cells i found out what pan leukopenia means or the meaning of just helps you understand it better pan means all [Music] leuco means white blood cells and pina means lack of so it's the lack of white blood cells which as you can imagine you need white blood cells for fighting infection and fighting these diseases and if they are being compromised that obviously puts you in a predicament because now um you are susceptible to other infections as well so these these diseases can also cause secondary infections that are hard to treat as well so it's like a double whammy and the question that i get asked is is it treatable uh yes it is and the other question i get asked is um can we vaccinate against and the answer is yes we can in certain strains there are many different forms of pan leukopenia but there is vaccinations that we can give against against certain strains what else meg have we covered pen luke it's a real debilitating disease i i lost a dog uh puppy um when i was young to parvo virus and uh it was it was not a pretty sight uh you know animal with diarrhea vomiting high fever you know lack of appetite you know anemic dehydrated but so lethargic that they can't even um that you could put water next to them but they don't even have the energy to drink so it's a real nasty disease and probably uh one of the diseases that the vets are most uh cautious against all right guys so um it's been a really cool walk meg he's pretty tired she's taking a
