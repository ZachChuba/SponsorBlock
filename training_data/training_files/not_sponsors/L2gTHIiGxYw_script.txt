all right do you want to pull into nothing bundt cakes and I'll buy a cake really quick we can all right why do you want a cake just cuz cuz we're here another beautiful day in Texas oh wait let me take my sunglasses off can you just like throw those in the back yes somewhere another beautiful day in Texas it's a great day to be testing a Toyota TRD pro 2018 Toyota TRD pro or runner 4runner yes specifically we're doing their entire big day the turd line yeah I can't I can't not see that when I see TRD it's alright so a base price for one of these is around 35 right yes sir yeah $35,000 $35,000 for the base Toyota 4runner as this one stands it's closer to like 50 53 53 yeah so this is a fifty three thousand dollar model aspect out that's the top of the line TRD pro version of the 4runner mmm-hmm now it ranges in between a lot Toyota makes a lot of different trims of the 4runner but yeah as this one stands 53k so not so not cheap for an SUV reasonable I mean you can yeah that's like comparable to to some of the lesser expensive SUVs but for an off-road vehicle which I think this is that's more of what this is supposed to be yeah definitely a little bit pricey it's a little pricey especially when you compare to a Jeep Wrangler base price of Wranglers I mean they started like 25 like thirty thousand yeah for like they're really really based two-door models which definitely aren't as practical as this if you go out to the Rubicon though even the Rubicon it's about 45,000 starting when you're still cheaper than this this is also about the same price as a Ford f-150 Raptor the Raptors start about fifty to fifty five thousand dollars as well now the Raptors can get super pricey though yeah they can go up much beyond that but again like base price of a Ford Raptor is it's comparable to comparable to this yeah where do we want to start looks we usually start with looks yeah looks are good and this is a two-sided coin because I think the outside and the inside are very different yeah on the outside this looks fantastic I say so I love the front I love the little cutouts by the headlights I think that makes it look really unique and aggressive but on that flip side on the interior this is very dated looking it just looks old it's a little plastic and a little cheap feeling inside if I'm being honest in some places in some places yeah the looks are kind of cool in some spots like they've got this fake brushed aluminum spot here on the dash on the passenger side which is kind of cool but you touch it you can tell it's just very cheap plastic yeah and then it's got this faux I assume it's fake carbon fiber here carbon fiber dipped or whatever cupholder fiber pattern area holders the infotainment is also like it's just very primitive and basic I would describe it as it does have a GPS and a navigation system that you can use integrated into it but it's just small and for me not entirely helpful yeah it's it's got some features it'll show you the weather and yeah that's about it that's about it yeah there's not a lot of features at all in this it has no adaptive cruise control Wow no Lane Assist it's lacking a lot of kind of stand standard things that modern cars have so like the technology in this car is cool for off-roading because it does have Bilstein shocks yeah it does have crawl control that's cool and it has actually a manual lever that you use to shift between four-wheel drive and regular yeah like two wheels this is a personal machine it's just lacking some of the modern conveniences on a lot of ways this interior has not been updated very much since the 2010 model year okay so make sense that's why it feels the way it does however Toyota is redesigning this in 2020 apparently so the 4runner will get a fresh new interior next year 2020 is gonna be a good year I feel like it's a good restart year for a lot of cars like we're gonna yeah onco or getting the hybrid Mustang thing the Tesla Roadster desolate roaster a lot of good stuff is coming in 2008 stay tuned that's gonna be a fun year yeah and also to be fair like this is a Toyota and the reliability and the resale value are both very high on this so for somebody who's in the market for a car that's just or an SUV rather that's really reliable and that is gonna be very practical and have very high resale value they're not really gonna care about I feel like not gonna care about the interior quality of this yeah because ten years from now this is still gonna feel dated but no one cares after uh because it's a practical reliable car you know you're gonna get another fifty hundred two hundred thousand miles out of it you can hand yeah so and you know if Toyota keeping it simple in here fits into that philosophy yeah you're not gonna have any like super fancy parts that are gonna break and be fiddly to deal with and stuff like Yeah right that being said you could look at that as an excuse for Toyota to say you know this is entirely practical so we're gonna spend a whole lot less on the interior yeah there's that side of the coin - yeah there's two takes to everything I guess yeah first impressions doesn't feel as slow as I thought it would feel it doesn't feel underpowered yeah it's not slow but this guy's got a v6 270 horsepower 270,000 to 70 80 pound feet of torque yeah a little-little light for a car of this size but it doesn't feel like it suffers yeah you can get going if you're getting on the highway and you need to get in front of somebody really quick you can do it yeah I really like both the ride height and steering response and just how it how it feels to drive this thing yeah I generally don't care for four trucks all that much but this one's nice other cool little factoids about this locking rear differential yeah you have a locking rear diff you also have a terrain management system which is pretty dope that's handy so you can adjust it to whether you're driving over different types of terrain like when I'm not wind sand or snow or rocks rocks yeah those are the three sand rocks and snow are the three you can choose that's pretty cool I mean hopefully they add driving over wind future that's pretty dope I mean yeah be cool this could fly I guess plenty of storage space I would say all around the car including here in the center console the glove box is surprisingly small that's like as small as the the Polaris slingshot honestly Wow really we're almost yeah Wow that's pretty incredible yeah which is really surprising this actually feels like the cheapest bit and the entire cabin yeah I love Fox yeah I like how you have two ports what is it it's like two electrical outlets in the back in the back yeah your passengers you've got your standard AC AC or DC I'm not an electrical boy it's your standard house plug yeah there which is really cool you got two of them which is nice yeah so you can if you're if you got a passenger who needs to do some work on their laptop they can just plug it right in port in passengers yes good yeah that single-handedly makes it a great road trip car for me I I would actually say this would be a really good road trip car better yet not to compare too much with the Jeep but it would be better than that agreed yeah it's comfy er it's quieter more room more room electrical outlets just all-around nicer for that yeah and you've got if I can reach success you got two cupholders in the armrest back there dice is really nice [Music] this just feels a lot smoother in comparison to a Wrangler yeah it feels a bit more responsive too yeah I would agree with that it's more responsive its smoother it's quieter it's more pleasant driving so if that's kind of what you're looking for you care more if you're going to be commuting a lot I'd probably take this over at Wrangler it doesn't drift at all like the steering wheel in some of the cars we've driven there's a little bit of play like two or three degrees yeah either side this is rock solid and when you when you start giving it some input it will turn immediately yeah it's great alright so back on some more curvy roads here talk just a little bit more about performance at handling this doesn't feel like it wants to roll nearly as much as the Jeep does but I still wouldn't take these turns and much more than the posted speed limit which is 25 one other thing is unlike the Jeep which you or the Tacoma for that matter that you can get in a manual transmission this only comes in a 5-speed automatic transmission I have speed 5-speed automatic so that's a little dated yeah and I also found out that this does not have Android auto or apple carplay all right so as a complete package specs wise very outdated this car yes very outdated into inside yeah it's not what you're getting for yeah you're getting this DAF Road you should get this to offroad because if you're not gonna off road it you should just get the base TRD yeah there's no reason to get the TRD pro unless you just think it looks that cool and you're willing to drop like 20 more thousand dollars on something just because it looks cooler yeah which if you're that guy I mean whatever do you think but I wouldn't do it yeah I personally wouldn't so I'd only get this if you're really actually going to take it seriously off-roading and yeah because I just don't think it's worth that $20,000 upgrade if you're not yeah [Music] okay we've come to the hardest part got it right it's all right so JT the first thing we're going to do and talk about here is performance it's tough to say with any certainty because we haven't taken this thing off road it looks capable it looks mean yeah there's just not a lot of opportunity for us where we live to take it seriously off-roading you know we would get shot if we tried in terms of just driving it around town and dealing with the irregular commute potholes and all that stuff it's pretty capable honestly I wish it had a little bit more power to get up to speed on the highway but it's not sluggish it's not slow I'm gonna give it based solely on what we've used it for today I'll give it a 6 I'm gonna go and give it a 5 Wow just a little harsher the speed and everything else holds it back for me on performance now that leads us into being practical and as a practical car I think this is perfect I think this is about the most practical vehicle you can own thing this is great and I'm gonna give it a 10 Wow I'm gonna dock it just a little bit I'm gonna give it a 9 yes this car is not fast so it would not suffer if it were to be made a hybrid which would give it much better gas mileage that's fair I am partially a Toyota fanboy to be fair to understand also so like that maybe I'm a little biased maybe towards Toyota's but still I'm gonna stick with that and this leads us next into value which is debatable yes yes it has a very high resale value but I price to begin with it's got a high price yes it's almost $55,000 for this TRD pro spec can get cars or vehicles or SUVs for less that I'm nicer interiors you can which docks the value for me but still it's a Toyota and the resale value and everything else and I give it like a 6.5 I think yeah I was gonna say a six and okay that brings us into the cool factor next which is kind of yeah it does look cool yeah especially if you got this in the blue paint with the black trim I think this would look fantastic yeah but this doesn't attract that much attention I think people would say this is a cool car it looks cool yeah but so I'm gonna turn any heads if you roll up to the club in this yeah I'm probably gonna give it a three honnestly so three from Jade see I think I'd give it a I think I'd go a little higher with a four personally just because of the off-road capabilities which is cool yeah now we've already got touched on this a bit but we're gonna talk about quality next which for me is a little low this interior is dated the navigation is clunky the dials are clunky yeah so I'd probably go with a sick yeah I don't know that's not terrible I know it's really not terrible I'm gonna give it a six and a half I'll go with a six because it's got leather wrapped bits and there aren't that many cheap plastic pieces there are a few and yeah you got a docket for the old fashioned choices and the the dials and all that stuff but yeah overall it's not terrible and then that brings us to the fun factor next which is also kind of I mean if you're driving this and you're not off-roading it's very it's 10 M old or yeah it's very tame and calm yeah I wouldn't say boring is not the right word it's yeah tame and calm yeah it's probably how I would describe the exciting ride no I think I'm gonna go with a five on fun factor just again for the similar reason I did the performance no this is not a fun car when you're not off-roading but I know when you're off-roading it yes it's fun yeah so yeah I'd stick with a five on that I'm gonna give it a four because driving in around town not fun and that wasn't definitely Pleasant like I enjoyed driving it around but it's not fun yeah okay so with our scores added together average score out of sixty is a thirty five point five which is pretty good solid yeah I think that's pretty solid numbers mostly due to the practicality and aerated yeah the practicality carried this thing if it wasn't for that this would be much lower and be an overwhelmingly mediocre car yes yeah if you're in the market for something that's gonna last you like a decade this is a solid choice to last you for a long time and maybe have some fun off-roading and still keep your warranty and be reliable at the same time I hope you guys enjoyed this episode this is something that we're getting better at reviewing the less exciting cars we review a lot of sports cars and they're a lot of fun but I think the average person is gonna get a lot of value out of reviewing car like this yep so if you liked it stay tuned
