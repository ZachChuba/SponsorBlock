[Music] hey guys it's Chelsea from the financial diet and this week's video is brought to you by Rakatan and today I am here with some fresh newly chopped mom hair to mother you guys about one of my favorite topics which is shopping and how to do it better today we are gonna be diving into some dark Chelsea lore and talking about all of my unfortunate shopping mishaps whether it's the items I purchased and basically never wore or used or the money I could have saved if I was even slightly smarter about shopping these are the shopping regrets that haunt me to this day and since this list is nine whole items long let's get crackin number one is being afraid to put stuff back now I don't know if this is something that you guys ever experienced but for me the more broke that I was at any given time the more I felt compelled to buy things once I was even slightly into the process of shopping for it I had massive insecurities about seeming poor so like for example if I pulled an item that I needed to price check if the price was too high I had that like cringy moment of like I can't me like this is too expensive and put it back I just got to suck it up and go through with it and hope my debit card doesn't get declined this was of course doubly the case when I was shopping with other people who I either wanted to impress or at least didn't want to seem poor around and as we discussed last week on this very channel there are specific psychological tactics used by salespeople to further encourage these feelings as well as to create a sense of trust and intimacy with them so that you feel very awkward at the least backing out of a purchase and weirdly I have found that as I've gotten more financially comfortable I am much less concerned about that pressure or the perception people might have about things I don't end up buying I am very clear about asking for prices and if it's out of my price range I'll just say a little out of my budget today I do not care the puppy-dog eyes the salesperson is giving to me I always ask about coupons at the register I ask about upcoming sales and I am never ever afraid to back out of something if I'm not totally in love and sold on it without a doubt my biggest shopping regrets always came from stuff that I knew on some level wasn't right but felt compelled to go through with anyway so I don't do that anymore now unfortunately number two is an item that I can't even blame on a pushy sales person or a peer pressure because I bought it while drunk and alone two o'clock in the morning in my studio apartment many years ago and that is my literal child's couch so basically I can't even say that this was like some kind of like emotional spiral I honestly think that what happened was that I was like at a party or something and I like regretted not having a couch but I had like no money at this time so I couldn't afford to just buy a decent couch so I just like started browsing online after like I had like several drinks and people had gone home or whatever and I found this couch at IKEA like at the IKEA website that seemed incredibly reasonably priced but it was it was really cute was like all white is this really nice shape and I was like hell yeah sold and it was like my last dollars to buy this couch and I was like so excited next morning I woke up and I was like oh my couch has come in lo and behold the counter fives like a week later and it is built for a child I don't know like a quarter of the size of a normal human being couch and I kept that couch for like I don't know I want to say like at least another year that I lived in that apartment because I couldn't even afford to like send it back just like I guess I have a child's couch now and here is a photo of me on my child couch for you guys to enjoy so long story short like clearly this is not the worst thing someone can buy and I made do with it I was able to like sit on it myself which was nice but to this day any time I'm like shopping online works like don't buy a child's couch also I know I mentioned this before and it is a flex but my husband is six four so you can only imagine what that man looks like really have like that like giant that that you and McGregor's character becomes friends with and anyway yeah my literal child's couch number three is not using the right apps sites or plugins one of the biggest ways in which I consistently cost myself money while shopping was by not having the right tools up front when I decided to buy something especially when I was shopping online for things like children's couches I used to feel like signing up for these programs or installing these plugins would be too much of a hassle and to be perfectly honest one of my biggest weaknesses was shopping is that I can be incredibly lazy but it turns out that it's actually super easy and taking these few steps just ensures that every time you're buying something that you already wanted you're getting a

times when a lot of us think of renting an item for example I was just at a black-tie wedding where a lot of people probably opted for like a Rent the Runway or something that allows you to get a really really upscale item for not so much money because you only need it for one thing but there are so many more things that can be rented including for example lots of items around the house my husband and I are just about to move and so many of the key items that we'll need for the process are things that we'll probably only need once or twice in an apartment the size of ours for example something like a full length ladder or more heavy-duty power tools you even rent moving boxes plastic ones frankly my home is a bit of a boneyard of things that I bought because I needed them for something and only ended up using them one time and very well could have rented and if you've watched our video about things you can do at the library you probably didn't even know about you know that actually the library is an incredible source of stuff that you can rent for free everything from camping equipment to passes for cultural events and museums are there for the renting for free anyway long story short unless the item you're buying is something that you know you're going to need again and again it's always worth taking at least one quick look if you could rent the item and if so if it wouldn't be a better deal just to rent it number five is any party shoes so one thing that's great about being thirty is that you can look at all of the terrible stupid pointless stuff that you did in your 20s and be like chapter closed and among those terrible things for me are things like freezing outside of a nightclub in a bandage dress and no coat because I wanted to look cute or getting shoes for a party or like a big going out event that I was so pained by that I would literally be holding them and walking barefoot on city streets by the end of the night probably getting like tetanus and all kinds of diseases from the ground because I think we all know what New York City streets are like I just feel that at 30 the time in my life when I want to be walking down the street being at McDonald's while holding a pair of shoes in my hand is like that's over it's not my journey anymore and it's terribly sad because I have a few pairs of shoes that I very recently when I did my big closet purge had to just suck it up and donate because I was never wearing them again I got this adorable pair of strappy heels for the tfd book launch in New York City that were like sky high strappy black on the front with like all these like beautiful jewels and stuff on the heel they're gorgeous but by like minute 30 of that party I was literally like pulling on my mom's shoulder because I was holding her so much being like I can't move it was in many ways the worst possible choice I could have made and that mocks them about how you should always spend on anything that comes between you and the ground is incredibly true I will never ever again put my feet in a pair of shoes that make every minute of that experience agony no matter how cute they are in fact I have created a quick four-point checklist that I have started using for all of my shoe purchases going forward and it served me well number one could I run up and down stairs in them which happens way more often than you think when you live in a city with a subway system number two are they not liable to be destroyed by inclement weather even if they've been weather proofed things like you know light velvet or light suede shoes like those are a no number three unless their athletic shoes do they look reasonably good with the majority of my wardrobe and number four can I get them resold or refinished at least a few times before having to get rid of them because honestly a good pair of shoes especially things like boots will last you for years and years and years if you take them to the cobbler in fact my favorite pair of heels recently snapped while I was walking and I've had those bad boys for like four years and worn them constantly so this was not really a surprise but they'd already been to the cobbler once and I took it back to my cobbler and I was like can you do anything please my crops are dying and he was like I'll fix it and all those shoes are fixed cobblers the new frontier similarly things that come between me and the ground on my shopping regrets is a crappy bed I don't know if you guys have heard but my husband's six for for two entire years in this apartment we shared a full bed every bit of that experience I have blocked out from my memory was so bad like every single morning I wake up like in his underhook and also the mattress and the bed frame everything was of super shitty quality so it like kind of sloped weirdly during the night and was also full size like Marc's feet would like poke up like something kind of like a children's fairy tale like some wolf when the grandmothers bought it anyway so that was horrible and it was funny too he is looking back I only like I now realize why we did that because we had to get rid of our queen bed because we didn't think through another way that we could have configured the bedroom in order to make the Queen fit and we were like you know what screw it let's just make do and get the full and because we had just moved just gotten rid of the bed we didn't ton of money to replace it with a nice bed so we were like alright well we'll just deal with the crap bed for a year or two and we'll make 2 biggest mistake of our lives like we should have skipped and not had like a dining table for two years rather than share a full-size shitty bed never skimp on a bed number 7 is monthly beauty boxes now you may be thinking to yourself Chelsea is that a bag of Halloween candy and it is not it is one of several bags that I have of unused unopened essentially unusable samples and minis and products from my Birchbox actually Holly who's filming me here I would highly encourage her to go through there's a lot of goodies in here that just like aren't necessarily a fit for me suffice it to say this bag is like 10 pounds and this isn't even the extent of it and to be fair sometimes I do use these items for like travel or whatnot but like do I need what appears to be a lemonade mix that makes your skin better or baggage claim gold I'm asked the world's least usable samples of lipstick okay anyway I mean some of this stuff looks decent but like I also like I have gotten like 7500 fragrances and I don't even wear perfumes so all of this to say like I I actually don't hate the concept of beauty boxes if you're like a beauty person but if you're like me and you wear the exact same makeup every day and you have actual skin issues so you're like pretty limited in the skincare items you can you can have like not worth it shopping regret number eight is not taking the time to try things on every single time I have ever been in a store and been like I'm in a rush or I'm tired or I have somewhere to be or I feel bloated or I just don't want to wear the lines too long I'm sure this fits and I just bought it without trying it on has been my worst decision ever this will frequently happen with shirts that I feel like I could eyeball like and it's not that it doesn't fit me it's that I just don't look good in it or would never have bought it if I'd taken the time to try it on and quite frankly half the reason of taking the time to try something on isn't just to make sure it fits properly it's also to make sure that you actually want the item because often the time that it actually takes to wait in the line to try it on to take off your clothes to put on the clothes to look at it to turn around by the time you've gone through all that nonsense you're like I actually don't need this or by the time you see that line you're like screw it this isn't worth waiting the line for so you need to lean into that feeling and make sure you are using the Tryon phase as a buffer between you and buying stuff that you don't really need or want the only time it's okay to buy things without properly trying them on is if you have bought that exact item from that exact store like there are certain tops now that Banana Republic makes every single year and I know exactly what I look like in them I know the exact size I know how it fits I can go in and get it in every color if I want to but other than that there's basically no way I can do that without really really running the risk of burning myself lastly number nine is not refurbishing / changing items so you can see here a couple things that I've transformed or just like changed a little bit things like painting stuff swapping out handles or drawer pulls making other minor cosmetic changes not only does that open up the number of items you could possibly look for when it comes to bigger-ticket things for example if you really want like a blue side table you don't have to get a blue side table you could just get a really good side table and paint it blue but it also makes you way more able to do things like shopping Craigslist and yard sales and consignment shops or even picking things up on the street this is especially useful for any items that tend to be expensive like wood furniture or light fixtures and also means that when you're bringing them into a new space or just even rejuvenating your own space you don't have to totally replace everything because you already know how to make those minor changes that make a big difference one of my favorite things to do in this regard is use contact paper I am all about now ordering decorative wallpaper and contact paper from places like Etsy so I can take like I don't know a boring credenza that I got on Craigslist and like wallpapering the inside or the outside putting up a little wallpaper behind a bed basically making something feel really rich and special and unique without a having to spend a lot of money or be doing something that you can't change back when you move anytime I've ever gotten rid of a good piece of furniture because I didn't have the vision to make small changes to it I seriously regret and anytime I felt that I needed to buy an item exactly as I wanted it rather than to make those little tweaks I regret that too
