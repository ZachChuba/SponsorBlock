like what's the king of Horrors own greatest fear if you look closely it's not big empty hotels clowns creepy children evil cars or misunderstood adolescents well he's spoken of some more obvious fears a lot of us share I'm really terrified of flying and I'm also terrified of rats so I thought of this story called the rats are loose on flight 62 there's one more unlikely monster that recurs throughout King's work laundry police department here and I am investigating a laundry machine with a bad case of demon possession we can see a dread of laundry in a wide range of Kings writings and

early 1970s King was earning a dollar sixty an hour to wash table linens from bar harbors finest seafood restaurants and sometimes the tablecloths would be left in the back of the laundry pickup truck on a hot summer day King described these linens they stank which was bad and they were squirming with maggots but I washed him and by god they came out clean he wrote of decomposing clams and lobster meat blood infected fabrics from hospitals that were put inside what the laundry workers deemed plague bags and even finding a set of human teeth but it didn't end there after a long day's work when King came home to write his typewriter was on a desk in the laundry room of his double-wide trailer so his writing took on the extra mental feat of escaping the tedious suffocating washing machines all around him much later on you can see how this period still figures into the author's psyche like a blood stain that won't wash out of your favorite shirt and see your dirty pillows [Music] in Kings stories laundry can play a literal part in dramatic foreshadowing his characters often hang their clothes to dry and that means they have to take their washing down before the storm arrives you know those symbolic dark clouds that are rolling into town in so many Stephen King tales just like we've seen in other horror movies there's something ghost-like about sheets moving in the wind but for Stephen King it's more than just visual there's an emotional dread often in King adaptations there's bad news between the clean sheets Carol we're leaving now in 1989's Pet Cemetery one of the first undead animals appears while Judds mother is folding clothes more misery plays out around laundry and stand by me in April my older brother Dennis had been killed in a jeep accident four months had passed but my parents still haven't been able to put the pieces back together again characters have some tough conversations sorting through their innermost feelings and secrets while literally dealing with their dirty laundry how did dad die car accident and in the novella that stand by me is based on King compares a young boy's dead body to so much laundry Ray Brower dreadfully mangled and thrown into a ditch somewhere like a ripped open laundry bag one of the most memorable examples is from Dolores Claiborne Kathy Bates plays the title character and she reflects on the worst part of her job as a line of wet witih sheets snot leaking off your nose your hands so cold and dry you stop wishing that go numb Kingdom Hospital begins with a backstory about a civil war mill where children manufacture and clean army uniforms deena shifts during the Civil War if there's any doubt that Stephen King is obsessed with laundry just remember he wrote the Mangler the story of a killer laundry folding machine that's right the evil in this movie is a laundry device that kills its workers have you considered the possibility that machine might may be haunted it should come as no surprise that he dreamt up this story while working at the industrial laundry in Maine this guy can't get away from the horror of washing linens and we might say all this negative emotion he connects to the activity in his work reflects Stephen King's own fear of being cast back to the laundry period of his life he's one of the richest authors in the world but it has made many were relatively wealthy very yet on some level he still worries that he might have to go back to the worst job he's ever had cleaning maggots blood and teeth off of tablecloths and sheets Kings mom also worked at an industrial laundry so this could be a greater symbol of the working-class life he escaped from we see this upward mobility dramatized in Dolores Claiborne when Dolores his daughter avoids a life in the laundry because her mother sacrificed for her to go to college incidentally she goes to the same College stephen king's sons attended don't right this minute and you can just stow that Vassar [ __ ] so King invests himself in both the parent and child figures in the story as an author his work involves letting his mind roam free and create worlds with total control he said that his fear of flying is about not being in control so it makes sense that he'd fear being forced to return to a monotonous Sisyphean task that never ends because there's always another load this would rob his mind of that independence to explore thoughts and stories as they occur to him researchers have linked boredom to many negative effects in individuals including lower quality of life work strain alcohol and drug abuse and it's impossible to measure the spiritual cost of working at an unfulfilled job you hate to go on to the next and the next I thought you know what oh she stretched out 20 years King has said I was made to write stories I really can't imagine doing anything else he's even said that if he couldn't be a writer I'd be dead I would have drunk myself to death or drugged myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing so this symbol of drudgery represents the prospect of losing everything he's achieved laundry is at the inner circle of Stephen King's personal hell for Stephen King laundry is punishment in the Shawshank Redemption and the novella it's based on it's bad enough that Andy Dufresne is in prison but his work assignment is doing prison laundry and that's how it went for Andy that was his routine Andy's at his most miserable in this part of the story terrible things happen to him in this place he's attacked and violated after he gets out of the laundry he may still be incarcerated but the story turns in his favor what's more the film suggests that if Andy hadn't gotten out of this situation it would have defeated him and I also believe if things had gone on that way this place would have got the best of it this is a man who isn't broken by serving nearly 20 years for a crime he didn't commit but the laundry would have done him in likewise if King hadn't become a writer the laundry business would have killed his spirit the world wouldn't have gotten the shining Creepshow not even cat's-eye an entire sub-genre of film and literature would have been lost in the wash both Andy and King had to clean up others laundry so this fear isn't merely about cleaning one's own clothes it's connected to the degradation and humiliation of being forced to endure other people's unholy messes he writes that while working in the laundry he would ask himself why are people such slobs why are people such slobs in Shawshank Redemption the wrongfully convicted Andy is portrayed as a Christ figure suffering for the sins of others symbolically taking on the dirty laundry of his fellow human beings the story also plays with the double meaning of laundering money as Andy cleans the warden's ill-gotten revenue streams stock securities tax-free municipal I send that money out into the real world when it comes back clean as a virgin sonic butter his line about the wardens river of dirty money mirrors the river of [ __ ] red leader says Andy has to crawl through to freedom and into frame who crawled through a river of [ __ ] and came out clean on the other side as if it's really the evils of his fellow man that he has to suffer through Andy's trampin escape mirrors Kings own carefully plotted clean getaway from the job he hated into a life of doing what he loves Reds language describing Andy's breakout centers on the character becoming clean he came out clean on the other side as if he's laundry himself he emerges somehow unscathed from a system powered by negativity cruelty and inhumanity which have infected so many prisoners and broken them from the inside maybe for King the laundry invokes that internal cleansing of the demons that every human being wrestles with writing is an exorcism of all that darkness and dirt yeah I'd say there's somebody fairly creepy inside but that's a harmless creepy person because it comes out in the stories so ultimately the reason laundry haunts Stephen King adaptations is twofold it represents a life of manual labor he almost lived and it speaks to the emotional work he helps us do through his storytelling for the take I'm Kevin Moore the woman's dead and that machine is running right now or use promo code to take to take 10% off an annual subscription [Music]
