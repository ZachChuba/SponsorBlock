them later but for now strap in for the ride of your life are these things supposed to cover your nipples or oh hi there my name is Logan and I'm the host of a game show so terrible that I'm one of the contestants some people call me the jack of all trades which confuses and infuriates me to no end I tell them that's not my name my name is Logan I just told you then they explained that Jack is a general expression for the common people and I tell them I'm not a common person I have a lot of skills and I'm a lord so how dare you say that to me anyway I'm not Jack and welcome to using your skills now before we get into the thick of it let's meet our other contestants all right let's move on to our first set of challenges athletics this is your Olympic ability and is used to attempt a handful of physical feats so for our first contest we are going to have them cross a treacherous body of water and see how far they make it [Music] unfortunately I am deathly allergic to water our second athletic trial is the long jump a skill almost exclusively used to cross ten foot pigs yeah that's that's not good that'll probably sit the pace for the rest of this train wreck won't it here we go yes mr. Jackson moments ago he crossed between three states with a jump of course oh I lost my glasses these are more like goggles than classes I don't like them now let's move on to acrobatics acrobatics is the skill that determines how fancy your footwork is and how precisely you can control your center of gravity given polearm weapons the jacob will attempt to knock logan off a small raised platform [Music] after witnessing that display I realized that neither of them can use polearm weapons that was terrible at least I found my glasses our next challenge is sleight of hand where our contestants will have 24 hours to steal something from the other contestant and get away with it we're going for mass overvalue here so the larger the object the more successful the contestant let's see what they can come up with I don't even know how that happened but it did our next contest is stealth stealth is when you hide [Music] okay I forgot he could do that I guess he wins I mean not really because he's about to spend two weeks alone in a room either editing or acting it's it's not easy but we can't all be winners now can we now on to Constitution which I've prepared a few of my own challenges let's see how well they fare challenge one don't sleep challenge to survive without food or water challenge three receive news about your close family's recent demise by mysterious means and don't cry about it cope with alcohol which will pretend as a drinking contest now they [ __ ] pass those grueling physical tests let's take a look at the results which I can't see so Wow that sucks for the person who's losing will dang it maybe they can do better soon using the incredible power of intellect their memory reasoning skills and how much they've paid attention during their lives will be put to the test we've prepared a number of questions to test each of their unique mental skills starting with their arcane knowledge Arcana is a person's knowledge of spells rituals symbols and other planes their challenge is to name as many outer planes as they can over the course of 60 seconds you work definitely gonna win maybe [Music] I don't actually know what oh what a Lulu shoot shoot I'm forgiving a lot of the main names I know we do what's that damn it okay all right I couldn't remember this one and I know what it is because a player been there before and I can't it's not perfect the one that's like the perfect place and it's just happiness you leave you leave you've got damn it I know that what's the hunting heaven be slits it's just the beasts yeah it's just a beast Lance would you put aa bite opium mechanist night hell's up his mouth Celestion be slit so I got six you probably beat me Mount Celestia get an ax bad two worthy of this Elysium and the River Styx maybe and then I actually forgot the name of my topia so I put between paradises I told me along the river Styx runs through the night health and the risk oh it's called the nine hells of major [Applause] yours you're the one that made the plains video alcohol has destroyed many of my brain's history it's literally just your memory of events like wait what you've seen in what you've been told history question one what did Jacob have for dinner last night do you remember cuz I told you that's why it's a history - oh you actually told me yeah okay I think Jacob had meatloaf for dinner last night yeah dude you got it that's what I had good job guy what you have Kung Fu Panda history question - what caused Rome to fall I am NOT a smart person but I did put and maybe politics I don't that's right Jacob the incredible success of the 2013 film gravity caused the collapse of the Roman Empire and to the victor goes a bonus question what is the ancient ritual used to summon soldiers made of sand [Music] huh for investigation our team went out and murdered two innocent people we then set up a scene and filled that scene with clues that just might help our contestants recover the body investigation is not perception this skill grants you the ability to draw conclusions from what you see so it's like you still need perception to see the things that you're investigating and that's confusing and dumb let's watch the skit the dishes are still damp I know what that means having done the dishes implied that the victim required food but didn't have the utensils which means they either went out for lunch or got finger foods this leads me to the bedroom they found the victim eating popcorn here and judging by the placement of the pillow the fact that the chairs knocked over and the door being [ __ ] open means that they took him outside Oh body which I can't show on screen because I'm not Logan Paul I'm Logan Reese now let's see how the jacob fares use this to possibly I have dead into myself D do you get the joke it's cuz I wear law hats so it's like a metaphor my name is still not Jack nature just like history but about plants and rain and [ __ ] you think it's gonna rain onto religion the same as a couple of the others but what you remember about like gods and those kind of rituals religion question one what is the one person from the Bible who has never died ready go PewDiePie with 100 billion subscribe god damnit Logan am i right no the Bible Elijah 280 the lousy religion question 2 what spells did Jesus cast and what level class combination was he when he died okay okay Jesus casted crane food and water greater restoration on the below the lepers be vilified and oh [ __ ] wouldn't even find me raised it he was probably a 20 from mystic because they're the only ones that get the ability at 20th level to come back to life after they die and probably had prestidigitation for that wine as you can you can flavor a drinks so the Bible never said they got turned it just tasted like wine [Music] now moving on to wisdom how much is the universe taught our contestants and how sensitive are their senses animal handling it's in the name weirdly the main thing that this is used for is calming horses but horses cost more than the remaining ten cents in our budget so this is what we came up with hey come out I love you insight is the power of emotional observation and using it allows you to see through spoken words to know the truth behind hidden eyes for this test one contestant will ask the other a question the opponent will then answer and the questioner will determine whether or not their statement is true or false my question for you is it's got to be this got to be true I actually watched stranger things so I didn't want you to Netflix thinking oh I just think that's the truth because Jacobs so dumb see this is my insight I should be able for five hours would you watch would you watch game grumps he got me on a technicality do watch stranger things onion it was truth false it was soup it was through you watch stranger things on i watch like to jontron videos before then nice man what are you craving right no my coffee that I left at home okay I'm gonna say false you know I'm bad at insight I mean I was trying to throw you off to irrigate you mind my expressions you had no expression yeah that's what you think you have the big brain is the art of line I am NOT good for our pair of medicinal tests logan's quick reactions to sudden illnesses will reveal his knowledge of remedies and Jacob Willem diagnosed his symptoms good well it's poison and you're going to die in five minutes unless you can devise an antidote with this an egg yep and this be careful what is this devised an antidote otherwise in one minute your nervous system will shut down you will still be able to move around but you'll get to deal anything but then after that happens you're going to lose your sight so you might want to start thinking really quick then you're gonna lose your hearing and then your toes will fall off well that's a weird side effect didn't really consider fixing that one okay well you should still be able to think and move diet is both up based on its symptom so every day that I do poop oh oh completely different also my foot just shakes on its own sometimes just like randomly while you're pooping or just randomly both oh yeah Wow I mean it's it's hard to do work with that happening and I'm very depressed I got rid of mine no for real that you don't get drunk as fast drove some work on you as well substances you neither you were incredibly thin you have muscle spasms and your poops weird and you don't eat as much you just have a really high metabolism oh [ __ ] I didn't know about that one [ __ ] dude have you just thought about being happy see it works that's not how you solve depression perception how well your dang ol senses worked with the eyes in the using the nose for this set of challenges Jacob will strain his precious ears to understand a distant and muffled conversation and Logan will attempt to locate a hidden Jacob you got a fat neck you hag I'm glad to be rid of you what about the sons of Jacob I don't care he's got a big head [Music] for survival we drove the contestants far from civilization and gave them four days to survive using only the wilds let's see the result that Jacob is dead it's a good thing we have several backups moving on to our last ability charisma to kick it off we have a test of deception this is the power of confidently and cleverly hiding the truth or twisting it during a challenge involving insight our two contestants attempted to deceive one another let's try a different test more focused on that ability all right Logan I know you took the sugar where is it I swear I don't know hey I think clearly I can clearly tell that you do I'm going to write I think that you are in tracks lying alive a liar performance the honed skill of entertainment which neither of these guys are good at both of our contestants have attempted to entertain you before but how well can either of them perform musically our next challenge is a contest of their ability to intimidate one another maybe I am do you have a problem with that yeah cuz I'll just ducks you online then I'm gonna take it just take it just take it or you're gonna get swatted during stream - oh and the final test is persuasion screw those other guys cuz I'm gonna do this one have you guys did you go give them your money okay good now let's finally take a look at our winner who will be celebrated by me editing a picture of their face there they are who is it funny what about this one do you like it is this video any good at all I already know the answer by your faces looking just gingerly kissed my thigh did it you're saved here's the antidote here it is used coffee grinds hope to add to w eating it open your mouth now here okay now is straight vinegar nice nice awesome you earned it even though you probably weren't supposed to use that one yet okay I beat the Constitution save you did Congrats well that was dumb and it was really dark apple juice so if your YouTube and you're watching this [ __ ] off what's happening I forgot hey witch caster gets the least can trips paladin I get none is that counter they casters I guess that would count other than that [ __ ] I didn't think about that though cuz they technically Ranger exhume get cramps you see they're so excluding paladin Ranger okay wizard it's part they get to I have a daunced to the mem he touched a my donger and and told me my guts have the gay died it sounds like you have bad something bad going on and it was diagnosed via your penis or maybe that you're gay I've gone to the doctor he looked at my phallus and told me my stomach is a homosexual you know this was an incredible waste of time I spent over a week working on this video it's very long and I like this to actually get it clear you saw in the in the in the memory tests where it wasn't and I couldn't do anything with it because the chroma key wouldn't work because it was there was we were too close to the can you buy a t-shirt maybe [Music]
