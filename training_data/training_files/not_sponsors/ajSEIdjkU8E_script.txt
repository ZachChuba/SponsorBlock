home it's the American dream neighborhoods filled with these homes are considered a great place to live and raise kids because the single-family home is so important to our culture to our psyche we've zoned a huge amount of our cities exclusively for single-family homes no retail no employment allowed most of our cities are sort of zoning monoculture in this video I'm gonna make the case that the single-family zone known in most zoning maps is our one needs to be eliminated before I make a case against single-family zoning I wanna make sure all on the same page with what zoning is actually zoning is when a city is divided up into districts or zones and the zoning code says what type of uses are allowed in those zones as well as how the buildings can look and function if you're familiar with the game Sim City or cities skylines already get this industrial commercial and residential zones of varying intensities from low density to high density are common in real life too let's look at a real zoning map here is a generalized zoning map for the City of Seattle their actual zoning code is much more complex with many more zones but they provide a nice general look at their zoning here see a lot of yellow on this map yellow is the standard color for residential and light yellow like this is standard for single-family residential in the City of Seattle 80% of the land area is zoned single-family residential in Mini zoning codes this is called r1 zoning for residential at the lowest density one I'm going to be calling it r1 in this video so I don't have to keep saying single-family zoning over and over 80% may seem like a high number but it's pretty common for US cities to zone the vast majority of their land is r1 that means most of land area is covered with single-family homes now I want to be clear I'm not attacking single-family homes but I am making a case against zoning most of your city so that all can build are single-family homes that's terrible for the environment terrible for segregation and hold on what's that clicking oh hey sorry I was just trying to leave an angry comment on this video stop trying to take away houses that everyone wants Steve Eagleton Dave well don't believe a comment you're in this video with me we can just discuss it together okay that sounds good I can tell all the reasons that you're wrong and can fail to convince me that you're right sure we can have a debate it's actually pretty useful way to discuss this topic it's almost like I wrote into the script what's that now nothing so why am I so wrong in thinking that single-family zoning has to go okay I'll lead with the obvious one people like to live in single-family homes that's what we've zoned so much land for them can't change preferences first of all yes many people love living in a single-family home but tastes and preferences change many young people for example view a big house in a yard is more of a burden than an asset one of the problems with r1 zoning is that it's been around for so long and employed so widely that it's constrained our choice and our imaginations all we know is r1 and in many places it's the only housing choice available it's like going to a store that only sells Cheerios and buying Cheerios can really call it your preference maybe if you're a die-hard Cheerios person but with only one option it's hard to call it everyone's preference furthermore eliminating r1 zoning is not about changing people's preferences it's about dropping the requirement that only single-family houses can be built in a large part of most US cities why not let lots of different types of housing get built and see what people's tastes and preferences are once they're given a choice what so want to let developers build high-rise housing next to single-family homes are crazy what about the shadows in the street parking those two things do not belong next to each other okay allowing for housing at different densities does not mean developers are automatically going to build high-rise housing high-rise housing is often built because of the amount of land is owned for multi-family housing is so constrained developers build up to maximize that scarce resource if look at places that don't have r1 zoning everywhere say cities in Europe don't see forests of residential skyscrapers see pleasant-looking mid-rise buildings and townhomes it's gentle density that's so nice looking Americans paid good money to take a vacation and walk around in it r1 zoning creates this house high-rise dichotomy and leaves out what planners call missing middle housing like houses in the few places where housing like this has been built it's been very popular the demand is there but our one constrains their supply sure those neighborhoods are nice to visit but who would want to live there can't raise kids without nice big backyards plenty of families in the United States and all around the world raise children in dense cities there are 1.1 million students in New York City public schools many of whom live in town houses condos and apartments and it's silly to think that city kids turn out any worse than suburban kids near public school kids have gone on to win Nobel prizes fields medals oscars Grammys Olympic medals and elections a yard is not necessary for raising children and again I'm not saying we need to do away with the yard or well at least that's not what I'm saying in this video I'm just saying we shouldn't be mandating yards for 80 percent of a city's land area yeah yeah yeah bring up New York but New York is always an outlier actually actually I'm gonna turn the tables on for a second I'm gonna make a case against single-family zoning and can tell me why think it should stay well okay great one of the big problems with single-family zoning is inequality now may think that r1 zoning only came about because people demanded it or they thought it was a good place to raise kids but r1 zoning turned out to be a pretty useful way for upper income whites to exclude poor and minority households institutionalized racial segregation and residential areas was struck down by the Supreme Court in Buchanan versus Worley in 1917 but zoning which was gaining in popularity at the same time allowed for segregation by income wealthy typically white families could afford these single-family homes and the segregation effect was largely the same r1 zoning basically makes households buy land in huge chunks often a quarter acre or more at a time only middle and upper income families can buy land in that quantity and this creates affluent neighborhoods imagine if wanted to buy a car but the only way could is by buying them three at a time only wealthy families would drive opportunity and amenities are unevenly distributed in cities and metro areas wealthier neighborhoods are generally safer and have better schools building multi-family housing would help these residents access those opportunities and improve their quality of life but aren't the suburbs more diverse than ever the idea that the suburbs know where most of the r1 owning is is being all-white and affluent is an outdated concept Wow yeah that's true Eagles in Dave I'm actually proud of that's some top quality planning knowledge II just dropped well thank mm-hmm yeah here's the thing single-family homes in the suburbs are primarily owner-occupied and yes minority households are buying homes in the suburbs at increased rates but white households are still over-represented in neighborhoods within suburbs are still segregated by income and race okay now that we've covered inequality let's move on to the environment r1 zoning requires houses to be separated from other houses on Lots r1 zoning often mandates large setbacks and lot sizes which means homes are spaced far apart this reduces overall density and increases the length everyone has to travel to get anywhere we still rely primarily on an internal combustion engine cars to get around and longer trips mean more emissions larger Lots also mean that new r1 areas require more space than denser housing types like duplexes and row houses this means neighborhoods take up more land and potentially transform more natural areas in animal habitats into lawns and driveways so what will happen if we get rid of single-family zoning in cities probably not a lot right away but likely see a greater variety of housing types as developers respond to a less regulated market we may see more townhouses which is a great housing type that's compact good-looking and often even as a small yard for the kids out back fun fact 35 percent of households with kids in Philadelphia live in a row houses may see more accessory dwelling units or small granny flats and backyards may see large houses that are just too big gets separated into duplexes and for plexes just like many of the large old houses a few generations ago all these outcomes increased housing choice and housing supply and will likely increase housing affordability while not making a big difference in the overall character of many Arwen neighborhoods well it doesn't matter if it sounds good or not r1 zoning is sacred nobody's just gonna let it go away there are places in the United States moving towards eliminating single-family zoning what where Minneapolis adopted a land-use plan that sets three units as a residential minimum no more single family home mandate California recently passed a law that allows homeowners to easily build up to two XS dwelling units on their properties effectively ending single-family zoning in the entire state this doesn't mean there are no more Arwen zones on our maps though cities still have not up zoned or unknown there are one in any sort of meaningful way but as planners and communities begin to realize the cost of single-family zoning that tide may yet turn that's it beautiful there's a link down in the description thank
