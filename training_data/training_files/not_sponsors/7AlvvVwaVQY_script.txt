make your next move with Squarespace this is why you fail at your goals how many times have you started a new year like this oh I feel so out of sorts in my life but it's a new year a new me I've got my goals let's go well I couldn't have anticipated how busy I was gonna catch it sometimes life gets in the way of doing life I still have nine months I can't even bring myself to look at these okay time to rip the band-aid and see if I can salvage this list at all oh no this is bad this is really really bad okay I had a salad for lunch I think that can maybe count for this one yeah but you had a lot of ranch I don't really know if that counts you're right okay okay I'll start that one tomorrow but then I'll really do that one what vicious cycle why is it basically a cliche at this point but you're not actually gonna complete your goals well I think I know why but you're not gonna like it I do want to start off by saying though that I'm not criticizing anyone for setting goals okay the very fact that you know you're attempting to better yourself probably means you're more motivated than most of the population so no I'm not one of your hilarious friends who loves to make super original jokes what is that you've got there oh it's just a list of things that I want to accomplish this year do you mean like resolutions more like pollution right because you're not gonna do any of those things and it's a waste of paper it's not good for the environment to waste paper do you do you not care about the environment what great person to be around no I'm coming at this from a position of love and hope every time you snap second goes by and every second that goes by you're one step closer to death I want you to accomplish your goals life is short thank you I'm glad someone understands new year new me well hang on okay because that's kind of silly too like as if just because we swapped calendars somehow your very nature is gonna change oh yeah that makes sense oh I feel so lazy and unmotivated stop me now here's the problem we set ourselves up for failure it's in our nature okay this time I really mean it I'm finally going to achieve my dreams why why will this time be different I'm not trying to be mean I'm making the point that it's not about setting goals goals are just future disappointments and I know this flies in the face of every self-help book and motivation guru guru out there oh I can't believe this smug youtuber says the goals are useless that's that's not what I'm saying what are you saying I'm trying to say you're not going to do something just because you wrote down that you want to do it you may do the thing you wrote down but it's not because you wrote it down it's because your attitude and your habits and your behavior took you in the direction of the goal let me let me put it this way there are two types of people in this world there are the people who are goal setters what I really want to live intentionally and authentically this year and just be a better version of me let's tackle our goals then there are the people who don't sit around talking about doing things they just do them see it feels good to plan to do things because there's no risk there it's not hard it just triggers that part of your brain that feels like it's accomplishing things without actually having to do any work but in order to truly accomplish your goals things you need a confidence discipline and patience but it's hard to have even one of these things let alone three at the same time and that's why people fail at their goals because they think that these three ingredients these three magic items are just gonna appear to nowhere one morning for breakfast I really need to get my life together these goals are my only hope of making progress in my life wait wait a minute if I change the ALS to D and it spells God these goals are my god very well you can't just expect the stars are going to align for you and that things are just gonna work out one day you like you're gonna wake up and feel motivated for once in your miserable life you gotta just you gotta get started don't make a big deal about it just do it and then stick with it even when it gets tough now let's see hurt someone's feelings inspire someone make at least one video this week looks like I've already accomplished three of Michaels this year how many of you accomplished that feels good stay that squarespace.com slash Cal next week on messy Monday's big head kid makes his goals for the year I really should start my youtube channel again I just need to do it no more empty words what's up guys welcome to my 3-6-5 it's me again she's like day 56 I stopped at day 55 but now it's time for me to start again thank you God for New Year's Eve for January first this is the only motivation I out of my life has to do anything if I could just duplicate this day copy and paste I would be a totally different human
