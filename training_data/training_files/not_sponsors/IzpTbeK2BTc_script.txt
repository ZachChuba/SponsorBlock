see psychic the heart of your system hi rahem - Gamescom 2019 this will be another voiceover video because it's from an exhibition but I hope you will still enjoy it let's go [Music] we are here on the stage of the case king booth from Gamescom 2019 this is where all the magic happens and I will just give you a small tour around our booth we have some vendors in the background which we will meet later so we will pass by our O's and also the farming simulator because I have to take a picture with my cow once we're done with that we will visit also for example Corsair and msi before we go to the vendors we will just walk around at our booth and on stage we are doing some really really crazy shows and some yeah the cringe level is out of control enough cringe for now let's continue with this beautiful 8 pack system which is standing next to me an APEC who's my colleague from overclockers UK gave the APEC supernova XL an update so it's the new version which has a completely new water cooling inside and what I really like is the way how the other reservoirs are mounted and with this light box on the bottom it just looks absolutely beautiful so Mary what do you think about this creation from Ali would you use it this is a creation from ali abbas who is my colleague working at caseking he is a full-time model working at caseking he's very successful he won multiple championships when it comes through life modern competitions which you can see by all the trophies he collected on top of this desk [Music] choo-choo [Music] we are now in Hall 10 we just passed the course a booth where you can see that there is RGB just all over the place we will visit them later but for now we are on the way to msi both to participate in a livestream welcome all right so better known as if I were obviously yeah dad Bauer yeah sound German yes I just spotted something really funny at the booth of MSI I saw that some of their rigs use windows and windows is not activated and behind me we have lit Sangha which is a partner of myself and they were selling CD keys and licenses for Windows 10 for example and so I'm on the way just to contact listen go and ask them if they want to maybe help out MSI with some spare keys so we can save their booth [Music] have I caused a huge mascot single one all right now back to Ali's hangover and now I'm next to Jessica who is working for its anguish is also my contact there and we're now just heading to Emma's I they have no idea what's going on and I'm going to just talk to Dirk who's also my contact at MSI I'm just introducing him to Jessica telling him that she's working for Li Chang and asking him why they're using and non activated windows and he's like yeah I don't really know so I'm just entering the Windows key I got from the tango activating the windows and they're good to go and the booth is saved two weeks before games come I announced on my channel that I'm going to offer a free deleting workshop and also other workshops at the caseking booth all the time during the games come and I just ask people to bring their CPUs with them basically any CPU like 6700 K 17 700k 8700 K everything that's using conventional thermal paste was very easy to delete and people really loved this workshop I think about 20 to 25 people stopped by every single day and brought their CPU but not only 7,700 case or 8700 k also very unusual CPUs like an old AMD 3000 plus which also turned out not to be soldered which was also kind of a surprise to me I didn't know that all those old Emmys were also not soldered we prepared the CPUs with some fresh conducting out liquid metal and glued them back together sometimes we had such a high demand that also Mary was taking over at the same time and was doing one CPU deleting at the time and I was doing the other CPU at the same time sometimes if there was not such a high demand for disability leading we also offered a hard tube bending workshop which she was doing in addition we also did some iFixit phone repair workshops showing for example how to repair this iPhone 7 plus with a broken screen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I have no idea what I'm looking at [Music] - that best oh yeah it is if you okay back to Tom who's also working full-time at caseking he's mainly doing some very special water cooling bills and also taking care of some parts of the caseking YouTube channel in this case we were also doing some workshops showing how to equip 20 atti with some EKF water box full cover blocks for people who never did this before and wanted to learn how to upgrade your card to a water cooling full cover block then we randomly had this guy is stopping by with some deep fried crickets I never ate them before I was a little bit skeptical but I had so many people just standing next to me and they were like come on Roman you have to do it you have to do it so I decided to taste them and there were honestly not that bad they tasted a little bit like some salted nuts not too bad Mary was also brave enough to try it and she also said it's eatable it's not too bad it doesn't really taste of much but yeah what it was a cool thing that this guy is stopped by and we had a chance to try this back to CPU deleting I already told you that we had some very special CPUs they are doing the week besides the old AMD 3000 we also had some 9900 case that were soldered some guy wanted to have it deleted for direct dye and he was afraid to do it by himself then we also had this guy stopping by with a 5 930 K which is also solder it's for socket 2011 haswell-e based and I did one deleting video about those CPUs back in those days and I really strongly recommended not to delete those chips because you have a row of capacitors directly underneath IHS it's possible to live to delete those CPUs but if you take off the IHS it will always remove one row of those caps you can solder them back technically it will not kill the CPU itself so if you solder them back to see if you would still work but it's just yeah a massive amount of work but this guy done afterwards that the CPU was dead anyway and he just wanted to have it as a collectible and wanted to look underneath to see how the CPU looks like then we also had an i-5 90 400 F which turned out also not to be deleted there were some rumors when the CPU was released that initially it would have conventional paste and then afterwards it would have solder the CPU was recently purchased and also distributed still had convention thermal paste I think probably all 9400 F still have this pace [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so much about games come 2019 I hope you enjoyed the insights you got from his exhibition again with voiceover simply because it's not possible otherwise for exhibitions but next video will be shot again twice thanks and see you soon [Music] [Music]
