hello guys so today we are going to have a very relaxed sit and chat with me video because today's video is going to be a little less structure than usual I want to talk to you about something that I think is quite interesting for the usual students and that is whether you can have good grades in your final exams without ever going to class so first of all I need to give you a little bit of context first so last year I was in my second year of my master's in law and I decided you to the fact that I hadn't started working yet that I really wanted to pursue this dream of mine which was having a history degree so I knew that I would have to start taking classes in the afternoon in order to use the rest of the day for my youtube channel and writing my thesis this means that I knew first of all that I would have a lot of issues in going to class however my first semester was a little bit more relaxed because I was in that initial phase of investigating for my thesis and structuring my arguments and since I wasn't rushing I decided to go to a few of my favorite history classes in the afternoon so for all the first semester went quite well also since I was doing my history degree out of passion and not out of necessity I also knew that my final grades will be quite irrelevant what I really wanted was to learn to investigate more on the topics I was passionate about and be more involved in the academic community again without feeling that urge and that needs to be the best student in class so after the first semester things took a very different turn so what happened was when I got to my second semester of history I also had this major deadline which was turning in my thesis on the 1st of April of 2019 the problem was my history midterm took place during March and of course because I had to finish my theses before April I couldn't go to any of my classes that semester when I understood that I wouldn't be able to go to class I decided that it would be very fun experiments I wanted to try to enter the question do we really need to go to class in order to have good grades is class really that necessary so this is basically my experience what happened was I had four major classes or four major courses I had a pre classical culture and history course a classical culture and history course history methodology scores and an archeology course the one that I liked the most was pre classical's and the one that I disliked the most was archaeology so I couldn't go to any of my classes during that semester and when my finals week arrived I had to pick up my textbooks I had to pick up my materials and I had to start summarizing reading learning investigating and so on and this is what happened exactly I had four exams in one week my first exam was pre classical's that's the course that I like the most and I had the equivalent of an A plus my second and third exams which for methodologies and classical history and culture had average grades and finally the fourth exam which was my archaeology course which is the one that I really disliked I actually flunked which means that I have to repeat that class again in order to graduate from history so if I could go back in time and talk to 23 year old man Yemen this is what I would tell her if you can go to class go to class and that's not because your class is particularly interesting or it can actually be a waste of your time in terms of your learning process but what happens is when you go to your exams sometimes what you read in your textbooks and what you read in your materials the PDF provided by the professors sometimes all these things do not come up in the exam sometimes the specific topics covered in the exam are those tiny little details that were lectured in class and this is why I know this right before my exams I asked one of my classmates for some class notes I wanted to see exactly what topics they were covering and what was the type of structure that was being news in class and what happened was her class notes were so incredibly different from the contents of the official textbooks and the official materials provided by the professor that I was so confused I thought I had been studying the wrong thing all along and I think that the problem here is that I had a very different experience in law school in law school and I think in almost all of my classes the professor tried to rely as much as he could on a very particular textbook from a highly reputable author in the law field that we were studying most of the times the professor's would follow the structure of that official textbook so even if we couldn't go to one class or two classes we had a textbook and we could rely on the textbook to study of course that the textbook was very insufficient because it was basically the theory of the practical cases we had to solve in the exam but at least we knew that all information was there and we wouldn't have any surprises in the exam and I have the exact opposite experience in history so in history we didn't have a textbook we had a bunch of different materials that interconnected in the way the professor would like them to connect also I feel that in most cases the classes were a little bit less organized because there wasn't that major textbook to follow so the first advice would be to go to class if I can second advice would be if you have back-to-back exams which was my case here and I never had that experience before because in law school we had one final exam per week on a total of four to six weeks depending on the semester and now I have my four major exams in one week only so if I have back-to-back exams ever again I promise I will promise please that I will start studying at least one month in advance because as much as I like to feel proud about my time management skills I must admit that my time management skills then were not ideal because I was so interested in this one particular class which was pre classical history that I decided to ignore all the other classes and I couldn't cope with that in terms of scheduling study sessions and make sure that I was reading all the materials also I do believe that I have at a plus in pre classical history because I not because it was an easier exam or because the classes covered what was in the textbooks but because I was so interested in the topic and I researched so much about Egypt that I basically ended up studying almost everything that internet provided me with and out of probability I think that I studied the exact questions that came in the exam so most of all I think that when you decide to not go to class and still go to your exams you can be very lucky like I was in that particular class and study the exact things that come in the exam or you can be very unlucky like I was in archaeology and I remember looking at that final written exam and thinking I don't know any of the answers it is and I started laughing during the exam and I really I'm not sure if anyone noticed but I remember that I thought I have been setting for this for a week or so and none of the materials that I studied are here so I think that if you make the decision to not go to class if you can make that decision because sometimes we cannot make that decision life just gets in the way and we are not able to afford that time so if you can make the decision I would urge you to go if not out of interest and maybe out of the usefulness that the material provided in class will be to your final value and most of all always remember that when you are taking a class although your effort is very relevant and it's very important sometimes the stars aren't aligned and sometimes all of the effort you've put toward an exam or an evaluation doesn't pay off in the end because simply the questions you are most prepared for are never covered in your evaluation and sometimes those things that you really hate will be the ones that will be covered in the exam so this is my experience I don't know if this was useful to any of you but at least it shows you that sometimes in terms of school university things are not that linear sometimes they're really weird and sometimes you don't understand why you had a very good grade or a very bad grade and I think that it's important to convey to you experiences that are not always positive and experiences that not always end in a good note as what happened to me in my last semester of history but I do not to get your first two months of unlimited classes for free so I really hope you enjoyed today's video and that we'll see you next week bye guys [Music]
