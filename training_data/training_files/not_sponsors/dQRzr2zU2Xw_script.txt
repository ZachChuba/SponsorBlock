hi guys and welcome back to the second part of a series on the economy of EVE Online I am so grateful for all of the fantastic comments left by the EVE community and regular channel viewers on the last video not only because it's nice to be recognized for putting these videos together but also because it gives me the excuse to make another video on EVE Online which is just fantastic because it is so interesting there is one big problem with Eve that is a common occurrence throughout most massively multiplayer online games leveling up gathering resources and most importantly earning in-game money is most commonly done through a series of very repetitive and very tedious tasks any savvy economist or anybody who has read the video title might be putting two and two together here and realizing that machines are really good at doing repetitive and tedious tasks and so they may just make the world's best MMO player in the last video we looked at this amazing document produced by the developers of EVE Online called the monthly economic report in this document there is a section that lists how all money is created and destroyed in the game this is commonly referred to as a currency Fawcett and a currency sync respectively the largest source of esque the in-game currency is from this section here bounty prizes for non EVE players what this means is that a player will fly their spaceship to a group of hostile NPCs kill them and get a cash prize directly debited into their in-game wallet every twenty minutes now there are certainly players that will hunt these bounty prizes themselves by actually playing the game but it is incredibly easy to instead just write a program that will fly to these groups of NPCs kill them and then move on to the next group while keeping an eye out for anybody who might want to hunt them this issue of botting or using robots to play a video game is actually forbidden by the game developers and anybody found doing it will be banned from the game but it is incredibly hard to police and even if the account does get banned it is easy to set up a new one and just up botting all over again what this means is that at any time in the EVE Online universe there are teams of robots printing money 20 four hours a day 365 days a year through these bounty prizes unsurprisingly this has caused inflation in the eve economy and while it is not at an alarming level to the point where it is ruining gameplay just yet it is well beyond what you want to be seeing in your economy running at about a 10% inflation rate per year over the last five years for reference most modern nations try to keep their inflation rate between 2 and 3% a quick side note is that these down ticks in a cash supply here in EVE Online were caused by the closing of player run casinos yep that's right Eve online had fully staffed and player operated space casinos but anyway the game developer has actually taken some pretty serious steps within the last few weeks to address the issue of bahding in this game making changes that will make it a lot harder for these robots to detect hostile ships coming to attack them this is likely to see a large-scale reduction in the amount of botting taking place but at the end of the day it's an arms race of the borders versus the game developers okay so EVE Online is definitely anti robot but let's just say for example the developers overseeing the economy of a different massively multiplayer game did not take action like this against botting hypothetically let's just say to be silly that they actively encouraged it and took steps to make it easier to automate things in this game what would that kind of game look like well let's just run with this idea and call our hypothetical game reality offline in this game automation has become a larger and larger part of the economy because while bots aren't perfect they are consistent and scalable and a lot cheaper than using real-life players let's say that in this economy the game developers do not allow individual players to produce their own currency and that they control all the faucets and sinks for their in-game currency well what is an enterprising bot developer to do if they can't farm currency all day maybe they will instead produce items that can be traded at the games auction house well this actually has the opposite effect on the inflation rate to what we have seen earlier okay fair warning here comes the educational part of this video those of you who are just here to see cool spaceship feel free to click away now so inflation despite what most people assume is not actually a measure of how much money there is floating around an economy but rather how expensive things are this is measured using the consumer price index which is a selection of goods and services picked out to be indicative of a standard household budget it will include things like groceries fuel electricity rent and a whole lot of other things that would normally give an idea of the general price level of stuff in an economy if the price of these selections of Goods goes up that is inflation and if it goes down that is deflation simple enough if you print a whole lot of money that means that there will be more money flying around which means more people are able to buy stuff at any given price which means more demand which means higher prices which means inflation this is what we have seen an eve online with the teams of robots printing money through these bounty prizes but in reality offline you can't print money remember and instead you have to produce goods with your robots so this does the opposite the same amount of money is floating around with more goods being produced which means more supply at any given price level which means lower prices which means deflation now we have probably all heard horror stories about hyperinflation in countries like Venezuela Zimbabwe and post-war Germany the pictures of people bringing in wheelbarrows of cash to pay for a loaf of bread will haunt most economists dreams but what most people don't realize is that deflation can be just as bad if not worse for an economy which doesn't really make sense on paper goods getting cheaper how is that a bad thing well to explain this we must turn to the holy John Maynard Keynes probably the most influential economist in history he noted that there were problems with both inflation and deflation inflation is really bad because it makes things unaffordable reducing demand it ruins people's savings and means that people will not want to trade in your currency knowing that is going to be worth less the future this is simple enough to understand but deflation is also bad if money is buying more and more every single day it discourages people from buying anything knowing that the one thousand dollars in their bank account might buy a car today but could buy a house in a year's time means that they will just hold on to their money and not spend it or invest it or employ anybody or do anything that actually makes an economy tick Keynes concluded that inflation is actually the lesser of the two evils if kept to a controlled level and that is why today the world's over developed countries target a two to three percent inflation rate even line is a great model to look at to see how economic changes like automation or policy changes like restricting automation will affect a real-life economy the similarities are staggering and little model economies like these are likely to tell us more than we realize about what our own future will look like thanks for watching guys I
