[Music] if you like me you find it fascinating listening to other photographers and in this case street photographers talk about how they think about the work that they do when they go out and shoot the decisions they make for and against particular things what they want their work to communicate or say and how over time as they shoot more and more they define a style that's recognizable as theirs in my last video I said that this year I want to experiment with shooting more videos with other photographers as well because I feel like I'm not doing you any favors if I only show you my work and I tell you my way of thinking about things and putting this photography journey for you in my box and I don't want to do that I want to expose you to other people in how they think as well so hopefully in the aggregate of all this you can see that there's many different ways to think about doing things and then you can make decisions for your own work as you define your style so in that spirit today I want to introduce you to a friend of mine Joshua Jackson Joshua and I only met about a year ago but in that time we built one of those friendships which are the sort where you know artists journey together and we talk a lot about it and work we don't need to agree about everything we don't need to see the world or the way that we shoot the same way but those conversations we have every couple of weeks together over coffee and when we go out and shoot together and we just talk as we're walking around I find so valuable in being able to bounce thoughts off somebody hear their thoughts and that mix that soup of ideas that we chuck around between us good stuff comes out and and both our work hopefully grows because of it I always have to remind myself the Joshua's only been shooting street photography for a couple of years now which will shock you when you see as images because they already feel like they have such a recognizable style and the work itself feels so mature and I think that's testament to the fact that Joshua thinks really deeply about the work that he does he's not lazy about any part of it he's constantly mulling things over he's gone back and he's read the history of street photography and he knows way more than I do about that because he wants to look at the work that greats have done not just copy them but take the next step forward for photography and he knows the city incredibly well that he works and he walks it obsessively and notices every fine detail and I like all of these things and the hours that he puts into shooting means that he's quickly Honda style that he can call his own there are two things you'll notice immediately about Joshua's work and the first is the beautiful rich and vibrant and consistent color theme he pulls through all his images especially this theme of deep saturated Reds that really make the images pop off the page and the second thing is you'll notice if you look closely that the subjects in all his images are very rarely clearly visible they usually hidden somehow they're in shadow or they're a silhouette or they're being shot through some kind of translucent material through reflection because he doesn't want you to clearly see who he's shooting and when we were out in the street the other day I was asking him about this and why he does this and he shared this great concept with me that he's found called the curiosity gap which he uses as sort of a rubric for his work and a bit of a loose direction about how he wants to capture people on the street and I found it's such an interesting idea I thought I needed to take cameras and let him tell me to camera so I could share with all of you so I will keep quiet now I'll catch up with you at the end of the video and let me let Joshua speak for himself [Music] [Music] I started shooting at night initially because I struggled a bit during the day I mean when it's daylight you can everythings of potential photo opportunity and sometimes it's quite hard to know where to focus your time and attention whereas at night time the only things you have to work with are the light sources so in a way you're a little bit like a moth and you're kind of drawn towards those you investigate those light sources see what the opportunities are and then you maybe move on if there's nothing happening so you're kind of looking for light first and then you know you're waiting for subjects to be in that space with a good light but it's light first for you yes so my approach at night is almost the complete reverse of what's happening during the day so during the day I'm very subject driven generally and then at nighttime it's about the light and then whatever happens within that space is just up to chance so when I look at your Instagram the colors are really striking do you kind of think about looking for colors the same way you think about looking for light yeah color is really important to me and I find that it helps tell the story that I want to tell in a way which is living in a vibrant multicultural cities such as London and you know the colors kind of reflect that in some way and I find that also it's another way to adds another layer to the photo for the viewer to interpret so knowing a little bit of color theory can help to have a gut feeling as to what will work and what won't but also it's interesting getting feedback from people who have looked at your images that are in color and people have different takeaways based on their thoughts feelings and ideas associated with those colors so red is something that appears in my photos quite a lot and to some people that could mean love or passion and to others it could mean war and anger so I think just having that extra layer of color can bring something else to the image I think when I head out on the streets of London I'm always I always have an open mind about what I'm going to see or even where I'm going to go and I always have no fixed expectation but I try and look for anything that's slightly out of the ordinary or something that we wouldn't normally see every day and I try and tap into the things that people were generally overlooked so a bit just a small detail and try and form in an image around that and one thing that I'm doing a lot of the moment is I'm incorporating temporary things into my photos to create kind of unrepeatable moments so it could be a temporary light source from some car headlights it could be a window display on Oxford Street in London it could be it could be a construction hoarding just like we have here I mean this is going to be gone in a couple of months and if you can get if you can create photos out of these opportunities and it creates things that could be more unique and unrepeatable so that's something I'm doing a lot I took a photo in Soho about a year and a half ago incorporating like a temporary window vinyl which I was really happy with I went back the next day and the vinyl had been removed and it's a photo that I could never ever repeat again we were walking through Chinatown the other day and you pointed out a dustpan and brush on a step which you've shot a few times which to most people who seemed like quite a random object why shoot there I enjoy the temporary nature of it so I walk through Chinatown every single day and pass this particular supermarket and there's always a dustpan and brush lens against the wall and every single day the way it's the way it's been left or put down is different and it just so happens one day the light was hitting it and I knew as effective that I had to take so I guess it's the kind of temporary nature of the photo that really jumped out to me but I know it's just a dustpan and brush but also I suppose there's maybe the sense of time and place there as well and also I'm a big believer that you can see the character of a place in the street through things other than people [Music] [Music] when I was designing my website I was reading quite a lot about marketing one of the concepts that I stumbled across was something called the curiosity gap and it's something that marketers and filmmakers would be very familiar with but it's also something that we as photographers can use to drive our work forward and essentially the curiosity gap is creating a hole or a space that the viewer needs to fill in some way you drive the desire in them to want to learn more and what we can do as photographers and what I certainly tried to do is hold some of the information back from the viewer that pushes them to lean in to learn more about what's going on there's a bunch of different ways that we can create curiosity gaps in our photos my personal favorite is using abstraction so in wintertime in London there's a lot of windows with condensation on them and we can be creative with our focus to create a sense of mystery in the image as to what's going on for the viewer we can also play around with shutter speed so we could use slow shutter speeds to have a sense of motion we could use silhouettes we could use deep shadows and we can even use things like double exposures but essentially what we're doing is to try to mask the obvious from the viewer a lot of people are obsessed with you know finding an interesting subject and just shooting the sharpest possible photograph they can of that subject but you subvert that and almost do the opposite on purpose and try and mask the subject so what's the philosophy behind it what's the wire behind it well in street photography there's lots of different styles and approaches so there are people that do humor in juxtaposition and they do it fantastically and I admire that style and approach there's also people that do kind of documentary reportage style and then there's people like myself that are probably more forum driven we use we lean on abstraction to create those kind of curiosity gaps for the viewer and I guess selfishly I find it more of a challenge it forces me to look at things differently it forces me to think more deeply about how I can compose photos and projects something that's a little bit more unfamiliar and also I want to create photos that I want to hang on my wall as well and that just happens to be the stuff that speaks to me it may not speak to you and also I want to challenge the viewer a little bit more as well and I want to maybe create photos that forced them to think a little bit more deeply to stay with it and if we think about comedians you know I prefer more of the storyteller so the punchline takes longer to deliver but if you stay weather then ultimately it's more rewarding now every photographer shoots differently and the point isn't to try and go out there now and rip off Joshua's star because at the end of the day you'll just be a pale imitation of what he's trying to do instead I hope what's inspired you is listening to another photographers why why he chooses to do what he does and why he captures the way that he does and what he wants to say with those images hopefully it challenges you to think about your wife why do you shoot what you shoot the way that you shoot on what do you want to say with it it certainly challenged me let me give you some specifics one of the ways Joshua challenges me is he reminds me I don't work hard enough I I went out on the streets with Joshua in Soho about a month ago and we met up about four o'clock in the afternoon as the light was coming down here in winter and we started walking around and shooting and taking shots probably got to about 10 o'clock and I was okay well you know I'm gonna I'm gonna head home now so I'm gonna walk down to the bus and he walked down to the bus with me I said you're not you're not heading back as well he's like no I'm staying out for a while and I said what time do you head back and he said well probably when the Sun comes up maybe about six seven o'clock tomorrow morning it's easy to dismiss someone like Joshua's he's just naturally talented he's only been doing street photography for two years and look how good he is already it must be innate in him so I don't have to work that hard because I could never reach that because he's just so naturally good but that's not the truth at all in his case he works so hard so many hours and hours of walking around in the cold on his own with sore feet taking terrible image after terrible image that gets into those absolutely brilliant images that he produces we can't use innate talent as an excuse with Joshua you have to look at him and respect his work ethic another interesting thing about Joshua is even with that crazy work ethic an hour upon hour trudging through the streets taking images he says he probably only gets about two images a month that he's really happy with and that really challenges me because I do things quite differently I go out a few times a week take a bunch of shots pick the best ones edit them up and I try and post one image a day to Instagram that's 365 images a year now there is no ways they or be of the standard that Joshua is talking about with those two images and it's got me thinking that it's fine to do what I'm doing with Instagram it keeps me shooting it keeps me posting but I should also have that other tier like if I presented my 20 best images to you it would look very very different from just scrolling down my Instagram feed and I should always have that upper echelon those different levels to the way that I'm thinking about my images but there's no substitute for getting out the door with a camera in hand I get so many photographers getting hold of me saying Shawn I'm really struggling to define my style I don't know what I want to say and how I want to say it and I often push back and say well what are you shooting and how often are you shooting it and the response is too often well you know I don't really have the motivation to shoot pretty much because I don't know what my style is I'm not sure what people expect but let me tell you it's not gonna happen that you're gonna sit at home and have hand-delivered in your brain some prepackaged style that you can just get out the door and shoot with straight away that's not how it works the only way you can define a style is by getting out the door with your camera by taking tons of bad images a walking miles with sore feet and coming home with nothing day after day until you get one or two images that give you a glimmer of hope and you start to build a style around those and let me warn you that won't be your style you'll choose against that in a year's time and you'll slowly change direction again and again and in all this mess in all these hours all this sore feet are walking around and and and feeling like you're not getting anywhere a star will emerge but I don't know another way to do it than to just put in the time and another thing Joshua challenges me on is if I want to be a decent Street photographer I have to get to know my city intimately walking around with Joshua is amazing it's like getting a tour of your own city but of all the crazy little mundane tiny details that people walk past every day he points out all these little minutia I like so and so will stand on this corner every day and she wears a blue coat with red buttons on it and if you stand by this shop here every half an hour they bring rubbish bags through that through that door with the shiny metal on it he knows all these tiny little details he can feel the rhythm of the city just because he spent so much time walking it and he's not out to try and travel the world and shoot tons of different cities he's honing in on London and to get to know her so intimately that he can capture her intimately and that intimacy definitely for me comes through in the work that he produces like many great street photographers he reminds me that the best images aren't at the end of an expensive flight and staying in expensive hotels they are probably just around the corner from your house if you pick up the camera and take the time to go to stay to walk around and to see what's really going on so I hope you've enjoyed taking a look at Joshua's work and his way of thinking and that has challenged you and your own work make sure to go across to Instagram and follow him at Josh K Jack and what's gonna put a link to his website down below so you can go and dig in and find out more about him if you want to just to let you know that I will be in amsterdam next weekend I might do some sort of meet up there I'm thinking if there's enough people who are keen so follow me on Instagram I'll put my link at the end as well and I'll announce something there and we'll meet at a point and just walk around the streets and have a chat and shoot some images together also thank you so much to those of you who have bought books it's nuts but after two weeks I'm already down to under half stock so if you were thinking about buying make sure you buy soon because they'll probably all be gone I won't be printing previous years once this lot is gone think of them as limited editions they are finished and the next time a book will come around be in January of 2020 and thanks again to of your first purchase [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
