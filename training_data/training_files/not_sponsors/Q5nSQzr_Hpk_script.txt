over the years there have been a lot of strange youtubers but I believe the most peculiar out of all of them is marina Joyce and today I'm going to be telling the tale of her very weird life in 2012 a lot happened to Gangnam style became the most popular video of all time grumpy cat was the most commercialized meme to date and Obama was re-elected President of the United States with many proclaiming that a Republican would never be elected again our story begins here because it's when the channel AIA raindrops X started to take off where a young girl named marina started becoming popular as an Internet personality for quite some time she ran a simple enough channel which acquired an impressive 1 million subscribers but the mystery begins in 2016 when things started to get weird on her Channel and subscribers started to notice in the months leading up to the controversy marina had already begun acting very strange this was evident by her comment section which was filled with fans set off by her new man yer isms they stated that in comparison to 7 months ago she now looked a lot skinnier and jumpier interestingly in a common chain from weeks before the controversy she attempted to address the issue with fans the conversation played out as follows is everything ok I don't think so she is pretty sick already what's wrong with her what do you mean by sick if you compare her older videos to her newer ones you'll see a huge change in her personality she's either on drugs or is depressed I think she does have depression and that's why she's taking drugs marina then replies to these comments with yes and an emoticon shortly followed by no this was very vague and unhelpful the mystery would stay within her fan base for months until July 2nd 2016 when marina uploaded the video date outfit ideas currently sitting at over 43 million views it would become the catalyst of the controversy now based on the subject matter of the video it doesn't seem it's that out of the ordinary for her channel but when you actually watch the video it raises a lot of red flags marina seem dazed and confused often repeating herself and overall just acting very erratic this behavior wasn't present in her earlier work and making it all the more confusing additionally there were many other oddities in the video that seemed to imply some kind of malicious intent for example at fifteen seconds in somebody's finger can be seen to the left of the screen instructing her on where to go this was suspicious because she usually didn't have anyone filming her why would she need to be directed like this next she appears to make a look of fear and then smiles some speculate this cue was because someone off-screen had instructed her to do so even watching this video today it's not hard to see why so many people were concerned and those aren't even the most questionable Clues visible bruises can be seen on her arm as well as her back and perhaps most infamously 13 seconds into the video of faint help me can be heard in the background noticeable bruises and cries for help it seemed like things were escalating very quickly behind the scenes so after months of just sitting by and watching marina completely changed personalities fans now felt the need to go out and speak about what could potentially be a dangerous situation so they began sharing the video and others even attempted to contact local authorities unfortunately it seemed as if the authorities weren't able to help one commenter who spoke to police about the situation asked them to check in on her and provided an address she had written in a previous video unfortunately police reported back that they didn't find her there according to estate agents she had moved out three months prior as the video began to gain traction marina disabled ratings on all of her videos but discussion continued elsewhere there were now three main theories as to what could have been going on the first was that she was dealing with a drug-related issue be it addiction or withdrawals in regards to the drug abuse Theory viewers found out that marina was close friends with Alisha rarr she was an open recreational drug user with a bit more digging they eventually found an image on Instagram which showed marina and her friend at a rave together moving on the second theory was that she was dealing with mental health issues that were not being properly treated finally the third and most interesting theory is that she was being held hostage either by a lone kidnapper or by terrorists in the event of a hostage situation and many speculated that the kidnapper could have been her boyfriend one example of this is a comment from July 24th in which a youtube commenter replies that she only began changing once she started dating that quote really funky looking guy there is nothing substantial to back this claim up however this controversy would come to a head on July 25th when a document was posted to the website just pasted on it discussing the situation at length written anonymously the author seems extremely fearful for marina it would become one of the most cited resources throughout the controversy currently sitting at nearly 850,000 views it details the author's own analysis of marinas other videos which seem to show even more concerning signs the first was her video everyday makeup tutorial where a gun can be visibly seen containers are also visible on her nightstand which the author speculated could be some sort of medicine as well as other drugs later on she reacts to a car by quickly shifting her eyes back and forth and then talking faster in the outro of the video you can see just how much thinner she has become in a short amount of time the next upload examined was her question and answer video where she again continues to talk in circles the author notes that she also blinks a lot more than normal the author believes that all this could be side effects of the drug called speed marina then begins to enthusiastically discuss one of her favorite bands before noticing something off-screen and stopping she then looks at the ground and the video jump cuts to the outro what is your favorite band safety suit I love safety suit thank you for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to give me a thumbs up the author notes that the description of recent videos seem to have less information than or older uploads they speculate this could be due to the kidnapper taking control of the channel which could mean they're also the one replying to comments saying everything is ok the author continues I have the feeling along with many other people that someone is forcing marina to make these videos most likely her boyfriend but it is possible that she could have been kidnapped or she's overdosing on drugs her eyes keep trailing off behind the camera and her body language makes her seem incredibly uncomfortable almost like she's repeating what someone else is doing she can barely stand still she's shaking and her body appears stiff and wobbly that day Marina posted a comment in response to the growing concerns stating simply I don't know what to say she then posed to tweet including the hashtag save marina Joyce saying this is very sweet guys but I'm ok seriously I love you all so much this didn't suffice since they believe there was a strong chance she was under the control of a kidnapper once the document was released Twitter erupted and supports July 26th and July 27th would become the peak of the controversy people began using the hashtag saved marina Joyce to both discuss the case and submit their own evidence one conversation that was dug up and quickly submitted was a comment on Instagram from a user who supposedly had met her he writes I saw you out the smarm party on the weekend we checked in on you a couple of times because some creep --is-- looking guys had their arm around you strange we were on about seeing if we could find you you seemed lovely didn't realize you are a big youtuber / Instagrammer in an attempt to learn more about the bruises armchair investigators deep dived into twitter and found tweets from years ago referencing eerily similar incidents apparently in 2014 marina had posted photos of herself with bruises on her arm stating that her life was in danger these tweets have since been deleted the fact that this is now a reoccurring issue made things only more unsettling how long could she have been suffering in silence because of potential hostage to Aereo was quite honestly the most scandalous this became the most popular narrative during the controversy almost every single supposed clue found by viewers was interpreted under this premise despite the just pasted document making it clear that it could have been something less sinister for example it was noted that if you zoom in extremely close to Marina zai you can see what appears to be the reflection of a man in a ski mask similarly in a clip of marina jumping to show viewers her socks so rattling noise can be heard some interpreted this as proof she had literal chains around her feet they felt the effort was a subtle nod to the viewers I just tried really hard Ben but unsurprisingly users began scouring her other social media accounts most notably her Instagram in one case they pointed to one of marinas selfies where she vaguely appears to be crying on the counter next to her were what looked to be condoms and a kettle this led to even more theories as noted before even from the beginning marina had always been quick to respond to their concerns and throughout this whole situation she stayed pretty adamant that she was okay but those invested in the story simply didn't believe her because they weren't even sure if she had control over her own account anymore and even if she did if she were in a hostage situation it would have been too risky to say anything directly so instead they explored the idea that marina had be giving them signals for help indirectly take for example one of her statements from the 26 where she wrote I'm totally fine guys I am feeling very good today and it's actually so heartwarming to see so many people care about me instead of just taking this at its face value viewers began looking for coded messages and then arbitrarily found the words it's lie laid out in to tweet vertically in another tweet she writes hope everyone likes pancakes it was pointed out that the first letter of each of these words spells out help in many of marinas photographs she can be seen donning two blue lines drawn on her cheek while initially disregarded as a simple quirk some interpreted this as another clue a viral tweet paired an image of her makeup with this excerpt a blue line could often mean a victim is crying for help from domestic violence kidnap and captivity if it's two blue lines that means the victim is in serious danger and is signaling for help interestingly enough the actual source of the sex herb is difficult to track down searching for the direct quote only leads to a Wattpad story which has since been deleted however we can view this page using the Google cash feature whether or not this is the original source of the quote is up for debate but coincidentally its italicized similar to the screenshots in the context of the story those two blue lines were said to be on the wrist so you'd be the judge of how valid this assessment is to make there were also numerous screen caps of tweets asking marina to put a certain emoji or phrase in her bio to signal if she was in danger they were then followed up with images showing that she had actually done their requests this was also done with her live streams afterwards the validity of these are questionable however since they'd be easy to fake but by far the most controversial speculation of the entire ordeal was the eventual suspicion of a terrorist attack on July 26 Marina tweeted out meet me at Bethnal Green at 6:30 a.m. if you would like to join partying with me at that event bring a friend so you don't get lost this was already well into the controversies so even initially it was seen as suspicious almost to impromptu so many speculated that it could have been a trap remember no one even knew if she was running the account at this point and even more damning was the fact that the shop in question wouldn't have been open at the proposed time bethnal green opens at 9 a.m. at the earliest a meet-up at 6:30 a.m. was simply impossible as viewers began researching the background of this shop they found out that in 1943 173 people had died at the location in a single incident sure realistically this was unrelated but at the time came across as suspiciously coincidental people were so paranoid that of course they began accusing this meetup as being a terrorist attack some even went as far as to attribute Isis as being her kidnappers take for example this post from Instagram warning her fans about attending it reads the party marina is supposedly a terrorist attack on London don't go she's in California don't go she doesn't have control over anything just don't go the California claim is apparently due to marinas IP being traced to California nowhere near the meetup location eventually it was determined that this meetup wasn't actually an impromptu event and wasn't even going to occur until next week however this didn't stop people from continuously speculating in one video where she discusses the meetup her arms move in a way that somewhat resembles the sign don't go in sign language apparently American Sign Language became another suspected method of secret communication as this was also done in her Instagram page in this photo where marina can be seen hugging a tree they claimed that she's signing either the word violence or terrible but this isn't even the most absurd supposed clue the most crazy was from the video that started at all apparently some looked into the background of the date outfit ideas video and Confused the blinds in her house for iron prison bars this idea was mocked for how ridiculous it was which considering all the other crazy conspiracies is quite sapped as if the clues based on reality weren't causing enough drama the hashtag eventually became a breeding ground for trolls fake tweets messages and videos of marina began circulating one of the most successful examples of this was a supposed clip of marina warning her fans not to come to her Meetup it's claimed that the video was a tweet that had been deleted quickly however it's long since been debunked and that was a video fake tweets are even easier to make some of the examples of this were phrases like I need help he is armed another one was I am NOT okay I have been abused for the past few months I can't do the heart on my wrists he will find out don't come to the party send help please it's my boyfriend he's taking over my account the second tweet in particular was the bunked because the message went 63 characters over the Twitter limit at the time with all these hoaxes and leads that went nowhere are many were starting to lose hope that anything would be discovered about the situation this was especially troubling for those that felt Marina was in serious danger but soon we would get closer to the truth and we'll link will also be provided in the description down below on July 26 sixteen after months of speculation the enfield MPs figured out where miss Joyce was currently living since so many requests were coming in the police department tweeted out that they had visited marina and that she was safe and doing well it's worth noting that throughout this entire situation her friends consistently stated that marina was okay and was simply dealing with personal issues however upon official confirmation that everything was all rights the vast majority finally stopped pressuring them news outlets began picking up the story and eventually save marina Joyce became one of the most recent cases of online mass hysteria marina came out of this ordeal with an additional 700 thousand subscribers however with all that being said past the conspiratorial mob investigation what really did happen to influence her personality shift firstly it's safe to say that we can fully rule out the possibility of a hostage situation not only did the police already check in on her but the fact that all her family and friends are opposed to this theory is enough to completely discredit the notion there'd simply be no reason to continue this facade but if that's the case how do we explain all the other clues that seemed to be pointed in that direction like the bruises or the directing of the videos well to put it simply they were debunked in an interview with marinas mother Cheryl she explained that the bruises weren't due to domestic abuse they were because marina was clumsy and fell over in the park marina elaborates on this story herself in an interview with Philip DeFranco the bruises that people keep pointing out where they from and I went to the first once and then Mike I stacked them or something and I got really bad because I said I bruise quite easily but like I had why Terfel and it wasn't very good so yeah because I'd like to go adventure in the park and do stuff like that and I ended up will you know that and I tend to do like oh yeah basically that ended up happening and then it goes near loads of bruises and then yeah I just ended up having all these bruises and that's the reason why everyone said save marina Joyce so that's how this happened really as for the help me whisper that was a pair not even marina speaking but her mother marina had apparently asked her to hold the camera and during filming her mother would help instruct her she whispered stand like me which was later misinterpreted as a cry for help as for the rifle scene in a room marina said that that was simply a BB gun this leaves us with two theories that it was either a mental health issue or a drug issue while there's no hard evidence for either of these with sunlight searching you can find testimonials from supposed friends claiming that she has a serious drug problem marina refutes this in her interview of philip defranco but some online choose not to take her word at face value her official explanation for this personality shipped however was religion six months a lot of people pointing out from around four months ago it's it's kind of changed to the most recent video which seemed like complete opposite of you and I think it's because advocating Christian and because I had like this whole speech request in my life but like I'm a Buddhist now but um basically I had this Christian living life and it scared people are and because of that and people who suck so there you have the story of marina Joyce and just to be clear no one is a hundred percent sure what the truth is some think her story was legitimate others think that it was a mental breakdown and a lot of others think it was a drug addiction on top of this I've seen a lot of other people claim that this was all just a publicity stunts although that doesn't make much sense to me considering her channel isn't doing the best right now so I guess it's up to you to decide and until next time thanks for watching you
