hi I may not know who you are but I know yes it is true I have never made a good game in my whole career and the fact that you like any of my games means that you must be a truly contemptible person thank you for your hard earned money sucker enjoyed the nouveau maliciously yours Todd Bethesda hey everybody it's your friend and your guy and your favorite Linux ambassador gardener what can I say I am a diplomat if you want to see these there so head over there check it out it's a good time I don't know why we all keep falling for this I really don't I mean a game comes out from a big publisher and then a couple weeks later after all the reviews of come in and fit you know after the game has been sold and the product is out there on the market all of a sudden an update gets pushed and the game has been hobbled in some way that's what happened here with unfortunate timing I released a video on April 1st about how to actually play Doom eternal through proton on Linux right personally I despise April Fool's and I just wasn't thinking I didn't realize oh hey people might not believe me if I put this video out on April 1st but I did people like thought that I was like pulling their leg and I yeah that was a mistake but the game worked on proton that's what I'm trying to say the game worked on proton I had few issues with it and I was really excited I want to share that with everybody but it seems the arch-villain of video games Todd Howard got a bug up his butt because he realized that there were some people out there playing games from his company in ways that they wanted to and that he didn't personally sanction and because of that it actually pushed an update for doom eternal now doom eternal comes with a rootkit called de nouveaux anti cheat for anyone who's not familiar de nouveaux is synonymous with malware in the PC gaming world they use kernel level drivers to impose whatever restrictions the publisher wants to impose and yes it's the publisher it's always the publisher now keep in mind that de nouveaux anti-cheat is different from de nouveaux DRM the the the DRM measures that are meant to prevent people from pirating doom eternal or whatever game comes with de nouveaux doom eternal did actually ship with with a de novo drm scheme imposed but it just so happened that somebody at it conveniently forgot to remove the DRM free version of the games binary from the retail release thus giving crackers a head start on play on removing de nouveaux from the game and giving everyone access to the non evil version of doom eternal which is hilarious but this has kind of become a virtual thing for them rage too shipped with a DRM free binary as well also on accident in it really kind of seems the on purpose like it seems intentional at this point doesn't it and if it is intentional I have to ask why hasn't it gone independent from Bethesda or maybe it dependent oh but here's the problem the nouveau basically has ring 0 access to your system which justifiably raises security and privacy concerns for anyone who has the software installed on their system I mean if a program has that level of access to your computer it can do literally anything that it wants snoop on your web traffic sure why not check if your torrenting definitely spy on your work emails sure delete system32 yes literally anything can be done at that level of the operating system and what's funny is that their marketing department knows this to swage and potential fears the nouveau says the auntie Qi only runs when the game is active and Bethesda's patchnotes similarly say that quote use of the kernel-mode driver starts when the game launches and stops when the game stops for any reason quote no monitoring or data collection happens outside of multiplayer matches said de nouveaux anti cheap product owner mikhail baryshnikov de nouveau does not attempt to maintain the integrity of the system it does not block cheats game modes or developer tools de nouveau anti cheat only detects cheats and if we lived in a fairy tale that would be true look they're basically saying we know all these problems could exist but just trust us alright come on trust us come on seriously don't trust them anyway I bought doom eternal when the game came out because I heard that it worked with proton and I was excited about that I wanted to play it if you want to play the single-player campaign by yourself you still have to have this software on your system and running and for some reason Windows rootkits don't seem to play too nicely with proton there's absolutely no reason for this I mean it is unjustifiable first like I said I am a single-player gamer I have literally zero interest in playing an online triple-a game none you won't ever catch me doing that it's like a it breaks the compatibility with proton I don't know if that was intentional or not maybe I don't think they really care about much about proton to be honest but third and most importantly the nouveau anti-cheat is a Windows rootkit it behaves indistinguishably from malware and many antivirus software Suites detect it as such so it'd you know given the fact that Rage 2 and doom eternal both accidentally shipped with DRM free versions of the binaries I find it hard to believe that this was your idea right I feel like this was something that was imposed on you by Bethesda if I'm wrong I'm wrong but I have a feeling that I'm not and TOD Bethesda whatever your name is I've had this for a long time the rule is don't buy games from triple-a publishers Electronic Arts 2k you soft you guys I don't do it I had a moment of weakness when I bought doom eternal it's I'm a big fan of the doom franchise and you guys took advantage of that you took advantage of that but I'm smarter now I have learned my lesson and I will never buy a game from Bethesda again never and it if you want me to be a customer in the future and I really do want to be a customer of yours in the future you need to go independent get out of Bethesda they are so evil dude alright if you like what I do here you can support the show on patreon I have a lot of fun making these videos
