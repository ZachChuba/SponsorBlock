lymph node his lymph nodes would be yeah sure you have with your outfits yeah i guess i guess you would they're all over your body whenever i think of lymph nodes i just think of the ones near your like uh your neck or whatever is that like a precaution like if you get rid of all your lymph nodes you need those i think they're an important part of like uh your immune system limping worm limping worm what are you doing try to figure out what to do i don't know what to do oh i thought you just sorry i'm never so scared sometimes i just get really really i don't know why my background's

what piglet is the sack worms were both burned to death oh my god that was [ __ ] brutal damn at least you got coffee no i'm the underdog that you definitely can't attack me that you're really now you're really kidding me i'm still the underdog because i've got 10 less health than you so you can attack him in fact i will do exactly that why why would you go after coughing worm why would you not attack the people with the two words i was just trolling dude i wouldn't do that to you don't you see after all we've been through hey uh you little [ __ ] bastard down there oh you make me mad no blood piglet steve oh protect me now tomorrow where all the underdogs the only right thing to do would be to attack yourself a token of just how much i like it kind of sounds like a british cory you better take your shot tomorrow sing all of hamilton go alexander hamilton that's not the start i don't even remember no tomer and jackson brought me over to watch hamilton one night and i really made jackson sad because i hated it it's okay i have no comment i've never seen hamilton oh no no no i liked like one [ __ ] character the king he was a man called hamilton he was going all voting around that's how he will take us he's going all voting around yeah a vote around voting around yeah because he's an american he's an american citizen he says it's time to vote he's america just like george licker just like george the whole first part of the the show is america doesn't even exist yet yeah you're right in the first scene he's like hmm sorry i sure wish i was voting right now oh i wish america existed but chris really likes the king the king was [ __ ] funny it's a consolation dorm all i'm saying is if you ever show me anything similar to that again kovar if you ever show me something you don't know what the 100 guarantee that i'm gonna like beforehand i will block you on everything not only will i block you i will send you funny [ __ ] to your door with a website i found yep is it called bunny [ __ ] it's called funny [ __ ] the tomarsdoor.org it's an oddly specific service well i have to come up with something it only delivers to tomorrow he's the only address i know you really don't have to dress up memory on top of your head yeah it's like tyson avenue damn it yeah go knock out that door that was the place where you two both lived some long long time ago right yes sir yeah and my [ __ ] remember the best thing about that place was corey slept in a room with a broken ceiling that was covered in like shards of glass and they'd randomly fall down and almost kill him oh tyson was that how yeah yeah i guess the house was owned by like an art museum or something at some point and so they had yeah they had like a broken glass like a broken mirror basically all of the ceilings it was only the mirror shards yeah it was like shots of mirror but they would fall because they were glued like 10 years ago or something so they would start falling down randomly like once every month or something like one piece would fall down it was scary hard to make as long we're kind of rusty ain't we yeah we're real rusty i'm usually pulling off these crazy shots making everyone scream in the comments but not today usually i'm known for like great shots i don't want to brag or nothing but oh that was a good shot i was the underdog yeah we all had like a similar health yeah i think we all [ __ ] also you've been trying to [ __ ] drop empire state pennies on me like all goddamn games you're not the underdog i don't have the high ground doesn't [ __ ] matter it matters to me [ __ ] you go for the holy hand grenade uh let's see if it works oh oh my god i almost did oh oh you got it in that little like shrek goiter thing shrek glitter i don't know the whole near shrek's neck is that what that's called a goiter glitter is an ad it's an additive thing right it's like it's an extra yeah you see i can't even get out of this stupid thing anyway and the jet pack just feels cheap this late in the game did you ever think that your prison would be shaped like this it's true i think the scary part is he did that's the scariest thing he had dissipated this poor phil i'm just a feel and i'm only here for you oh you're lucky his hand was there oh i got really tricked this week i saw a picture of bama agera where he looked he looked just like phil like uh someone someone posted they were like look how shitty bama jara looks and i was like god damn he looks like as bad as phil but it turns out someone just photoshopped to make him look really horrible the photoshops are uh they're pretty easy to fall for if it's subtle enough yeah no but then she wasn't subtle they cut his like his eyes out and like they put phil's entire face on instead of bam's eyes no oh [ __ ] [ __ ] poor shrek he's a little something here shrek is made out of [ __ ] swamp mud just like in the movie wait a minute wait a minute you may like it wait you made it what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] [ __ ] oh my god [ __ ] you that's beautiful that's a kill oh that was a grenade too cauterized dong was the most bullied worm in this whole [ __ ] game and that was the first thing that actually hit him by the way i saw someone posted a record recently apparently the current record is chris with seven in the lead me and lyle tied with six and zach with one with one how do you like that so i'm i'm i'm really i'm gunning for you zack i don't want to hand this to you because i don't want you to feel like well that even snappy you've said that you're feeling legitimate now it'll feel like you put the kid gloves on now i am rooting for you oh i'm sorry no trust me i'm trying to kill you i'm gonna try to kill you oh don't worry tomorrow i just i just i just wanted to have an honorable fight here don't worry yeah i'll only use grades of luck even though i have a beautiful airstrike waiting to be [ __ ] used i'm not going to use all right i'm just going to see what this does with the slight weird bit of leftward wind no that didn't work at all that slight wind was not enough what do you think phil's thinking about uh that's a good question i don't know he he looks really like he's a deep thought do you ever think he misses being the funny fat guy on tv i would i would i would miss that even though everyone treated him like [ __ ] kind of yeah he was definitely an mtv star that was close if that had been a cluster bomb it probably would have killed me or wait was phil the one that he would he would treat like [ __ ] or was that [ __ ] veto or whatever that was definitely phil it was phil phil loved it he loved having his [ __ ] titty slapped around by his eldest son he loved being bitten on and sucked on you like being sucked his titties on he lo he loved that [ __ ] there was an extended scene where he got his titty sucked out and he was like he's looking down into the camera he's like oh you can see the silhouette oh no hey my my torso just got blown off by a grenade the way it blew up my torso where's my face it doesn't sound like this oh god oh god even that was way too much zack the tub is full of [ __ ] all you gotta do is flush him down the drain all you're doing is making me hungry you're not motivating me lyle i'm sorry i forgot that you ate that thank you you're gonna have to hurt phil to do this just so you know that it's gonna it's gonna take a lot out of me you're gonna yeah you're gonna have to take his temple away i am so [ __ ] i am so hot at least phil's face remains look it's a little sliver he's too faced now he's got a little pencil head too low oh it was full power i didn't think it would drop that much aim up [ __ ] stupid zack this is it dude you can do it dude should i have right there i think tomorrow's exhausted every conceivable believable mist that he can't oh my god died is that a play on stop and frisk no it's just oh stop it go oh stop it they were all opposites tom are you stopping for his people though right he does [Laughter] you're an [ __ ] tomorrow you did that on purpose how could i have made this happen on purpose look at what i'm standing on yeah i saw that happen you did that
