so back at computex when intel did that weird demo on stage where they had this like this like chilled liquid cooled 28 core overclocked processor i don't think anyone could figure out what exactly it was they were trying to accomplish even intel themselves didn't seem to know what was going on because that same cpu although not cooled by chilled liquid was actually on display the next day with their board partners like asus only to be quickly yanked away and then we haven't heard anything about it since then except for a leaked road map that seems to suggest that intel is planning what appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to amd's 32 core threadripper 2. a 28 core based on as far as we can tell a similar platform to their existing xeon platinum now i don't know what segment they're going to target with this workstation enthusiast people with more money than brains but whatever it is i realized something we actually have in our hands both the 32 court redripper 2 and intel xeon platinum 8180 which rumor has it will be very similar to the upcoming enthusiast chip albeit without overclocking so today we are gonna put them head to head as a preview of the ultimate heavyweight showdown of cpus we're not sure who is going to buy video and more check it out at the link in the video description so while ivan puts the finishing touch on our lga 3647 bench over there i'm going to walk you through what our otherwise as identical as we can get them test rigs so in here we've got a threadripper 32 core we've got a knock to a 120 millimeter tower cooler we've got a zenith extreme motherboard with what i believe is 32 gigs of ram 32 gigs right yeah it should be and then we've got a gtx 1080 uh samsung 840 pro ssd and an rm850i power supply now bear in mind that any results that we show you guys for this guy have to be taken with a significant grain of salt because intel will have at least i think a couple of months to tune the consumer version of this before you would ever be able to buy one not that most people would ever be able to buy one like this is 10 grand so we don't know how much or how little they're planning to slash the price compared to the pro one but like it ain't gonna be cheap so this guy right here has got uh same power supply same cooler sort of except it's like a modified version that works with lga 3647 thank you noctua for sending that over we've got them both hooked up to power meters and then it's running in asus z11 pau 12. it's got the same geforce gtx 1080 founders edition and then it is of course running a xeon platinum 8180 now the ram this is something that could affect our results but we had to use what's compatible with our cpu so this is ddr4 2666 ecc memory the same stuff from our six workstations one cpu project hey it's done here we go is this broken this cpu what what what what okay adding another boulder sized grain of salt to this whole experience is that this latest bios we just flashed no longer supports the 8180 cpu probably if i had to guess because of its massive 205 watt tdp so we're gonna have to go back in time to another bios in order to run our comparison and four hours later we finally have the solution you know what screw it we're just gonna run we're just gonna run the light of a thousand suns directly into ivan's eyes sorry about that anyway we're none of the bios's we tried worked and we downloaded like one of the earliest ones that should have been the same as what we had and it was corrupt right off asus whatever it doesn't matter point is we're just using our dual socket board with a single cpu where the only real consideration performance wise is we have to make sure we use a pci express slot that is connected to that socket so everything's hunky dory this is effectively the same apples-ish to apples-ish comparison and we are ready to go so naturally i'm sure the first thing you guys are going to want to see after the task manager porn 56 threads on this one 64 threads on this one it's probably gonna be cinebench right it's gotta be cinebench boom who will finish first wow those are both super fast but one of them looks a little faster one of them looks a fair bit faster whoa amd is a good 20 percent ahead which makes sense because even though thread ripper 2's performance per clock is lower than intel's sky lake architecture they do have a core advantage so they have four more cores and watch this we're going to go ahead we're going to run the test again and we're going to have a look at what our clock speeds are while they're going so you can see here amd is turboing up higher when you're hitting all the cores compared to intel so round one goes to the threadripper 2990wx test number two the v-ray benchmark from chaos group so we're running the cpu benchmark here here we go our amd processor is pinned our intel processor is pinned amd's looking pretty good here too wow and done okay no matter which one of these things you buy you're gonna be like going super fast and three seconds doesn't seem like a lot of difference but three seconds out of thirty is ten percent faster for thread ripper two this is great tell us more about your gear are you overclocking liquid cooling or anything else ingenious for getting a performance boost does it show that every time or is it just when you're like bananas i don't think hey anthony you ever seen this in the v-ray benchmark it did it on both of these i wonder if there's some kind of a threshold clearly that's a tailored message yeah no we're not doing anything ingenious just spending lots of money so for our blender test we're going to be rendering the classroom scene and this one will probably actually take a couple minutes so we'll come back in just a moment here man that's a lot of cores it's beautiful you can even just feel the heat coming off these things this does seem like a good opportunity to remind you guys though that this is not the actual product this is just the closest thing that we have to it now this is cool though compared to that burn test we were running before it's turboing much higher in real world applications even though the usage is 100 so it looks like they might be detecting stress testing applications and throttling down anyway so that's interesting to know terms of power consumption this is one area where intel is looking a little bit better our threadripper 2 machine is pulling 380 watts from the wall remember this is before we've even touched the gpu and this is with no overclocking on either of them because our xeon won't overclock whereas we don't know what intel's planning to do with the real chip that's coming and then intel's pulling about 265 watts it's crazy they both feel like space heaters you know with the the fancy even with these fans running at full speed and these are nice fans oh boy this is not looking amazing for intel right now thread ripper 2 already chewed through the first segment of the test and i think it's done wow  just under five minutes for classroom whereas intel we're at 5 15. and it hasn't even finished the initial render 5.45 i don't think i ever thought i would see it again amd's top of the line versus intel's top of the line and it just being a a blowout so that concludes the productivity segment of our testing and now we're going to do what neither intel intel nor amd is going to be particularly stoked on we're going to fire up some games so starting with cs go well if cs goes anything to go by intel looks like they're going to have a bit better of a time when it comes to gaming with that said csgo is known to heavily favor intel's current chips versus amd's uh zen-based chips oh boy average frame rate 310.21 versus 297.85 that doesn't seem right because this was so much higher hex i have another bite yeah i don't know what just happened there there's like there's no way okay well take those results with even more salt than the rest of this video because there's no way that's right that doesn't make any sense all right our test is done we can go ahead and quit the game okay so these are more like the numbers we were expecting to see in cs go that brings us to our final game shadow of the tomb raider how to benchmark on the same account with two pcs at once you gotta do the ethernet cable shuffle it goes like this ah a game here we go now this is closer this is really close with all these character models intel is actually enjoying a pretty significant advantage average fps 100 average fps 87 so a significant advantage but it should be noted that a gaming advantage from one of these cpus to the other is not particularly meaningful if you wanted to game you would run out and you would buy a you know secondhand 7700k and overclock the snot out of it oh right thermals we're not done yet so we already have a pretty good idea of what we're going to see here simply because the power consumption on intel's platform was so much lower yeah so this is consistent with what we saw before with intel's course coming in about five degrees lower so there you have it guys i said it before but it bears repeating take everything you saw here with a grain of salt because we don't know what if anything intel will change about the real product that they're supposedly coming out with i mean something like an increase to the all core boost frequencies could make a significant difference to the results that we got today but what it looks like for now is that for the first time in over a decade in a pure who's got the biggest willy competition because i don't know that we would necessarily put a two thumbs up recommendation behind either of these depending on pricing amd might have the bigger willie who to thunk it and this will measuring description to learn more so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video then clearly you're not into like you know heavyweight title fights because that's basically what we saw today but if you did like it hit that like button get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff at the link in the video description just like you know you like you open up your wallet you start you know pulling out the cash and then the credit cards you know what forget it just just just take the whole thing right um so what else was i gonna say right our merch store you can
