[The members are playing with Gacha machine that the fan presented] So cute. - The letter presents from BUDDIES!
- It's a Gacha machine. The BUDDIES and GFRIEND are the happiest when they are together. Ooh! A cookie! Hey, this is you. Is it me? [We drew an UMJI cookie!] Cookie with UMJI! - It's so good!
- I know, right? [SOWON tries one too] Is there something inside? 'I'll cheer you forever. Keep walking on a flower path, GFRIEND.' Alright, let's do just that~ [She got another SOWON cookie!]
What! Thank you! I'll enjoy it very much. It's so cool! [EUNHA cookie that SOWON drew] SOWON got my cookie, But look what UMJI did... When did I have long hair? Oh, it's the Time for the moon night era, right? No? Maybe it's LOVE BUG. Ta-da! But it's so cute. Back when I had pink hair. - I drew this.
- But I didn't draw that one! - You cracked it.
- Her leg came off! Her leg came off! Gacha fail. Oh no, my leg! There it is. Thanks for the cookie~ Who made it? [The fans did!] The fan did such a great job! 'LOVE BUG' 'LOVE BUG', M COUNTDOWN. [YERIN remembers it clearly]
