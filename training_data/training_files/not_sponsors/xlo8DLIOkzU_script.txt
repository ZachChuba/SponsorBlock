hello now editing your on scape photography is a massively important part of the proces it's as important I think as sometimes capturing the picture because it can make such a difference to the final image it can be intimidating for beginners getting into the computer and really making a difference there and for those of us that are amateurs enthusiasts or pros were constantly trying to improve our skills in the editing room so I thought go through a few pictures today to just show you a bit of my process what I'm thinking about to try and make a really natural-looking edit and final image and hopefully that will give you some tips and tricks that you can go away and use for yourself before we get into that your next move with Squarespace right so for this video I am assuming that you're shooting in RAW you should be shooting in RAW for your landscape photography so let's get into the computer and have a look at what we're talking about okay so we're into the computer and this is the first image that we're going to be looking at I'm using Adobe Lightroom here you can use any any photo editor to do this kind of thing a lot of them now do very much the same thing so this is the first image here and this is the original because we're using the raw file that is just a digital negative essentially it's capturing all the data into that one file and it's essentially not how the scene looked at the time it's just captured all that data there's very little sharpness in there very little contrast color that kind of thing and the white balance is gonna be all over the place because I'm just usually shoot in auto white balance because you can then change it in Lightroom so the white balance is put in here is not necessarily what I saw at the time so with every landscape edits hit the day to go into the develop module and I'm gonna go and try and straighten the horizon and make sure I've got the horizon straight because there is nothing appealing about wonky horizons I'm just gonna go and hit R to bring up the crop tool and then click on this little thing here and you can just drag your line across here and make you horizon nice and straight one of the big things that I use for almost all of my edits is software ND grads you know I don't use the solid physical nd grads because I don't think they're necessary if you use a math totally cool I don't because it's just so easy to sort out in Lightroom it works even with this single raw file this is not a bracketed image or anything like that it's just gonna work with a single raw file so I'm going to start by hitting that and bringing that exposure in the sky down so bring up the software grad and just drag down hold shift down to keep it nice and straight and then release and we have our grad in there you can double click on effect to return everything to zero and then I'm going to just bring the exposure down on that by about two stops and you can see the detail start to appear in the sky there and that looks great now the other thing is white balance like I mentioned I'm quite happy actually with the white balance in the sea but the sky is starting to look a bit too it's not far off but I know I'm gonna add some vibrance and things like that so I'm gonna bring up the yellows and remove some of that blue from the sky to about there and there is a tiny bit of color that was more clear than this when I saw it so as you can see from the video and I want to introduce some of that sort of pinky magenta back into there so I'm just gonna increase the magenta back into there by a bow to about there and then the sky's looking nice and I don't want to have any magenta in that foreground so using the grab to do that is really useful and just bring the highlights down a bit as well to further increase the detail in the sky and then once you've done that it's gonna bring the shadows even darker as well if there are any shadows in your gradient area so you can just bring the shadows back up to get that detail back into the clouds or whatever else you might have within that gradient area particularly good for mountains because as you bring that gradient in the mountains are dark the sky is bright so bringing the shadows back up on those mountainous areas is really good good technique to use for software nd grants now let's turn that off and then just we're looking to affect these sliders I like a lot of contrast in all my images so I'm gonna add in probably forty there that looks good I'm going to bring the highlights down across the image even more to bring some detail out in that sea and the foreground probably you bout there and I'm gonna increase the shadows again to bring the detail back out of those groins then it's just a case of bouncing you white any blacks and you just do that by using the histogram up here or you can just start dragging on the slider hold down the option key or the Alt key on a PC and then just see when that white starts to appear sort of dial it back a bit and I'm about right there same thing on the blacks bring that down and you can start to see the black appearing in those groins dial it back a bit again now I'm hitting black there and that is starting to look very similar to my final image and then just add in a little bit of vibrance like I said and a bit of saturation very subtle be as subtle as you can you don't want to go crazy and make it look really unrealistic I want to just be subtle and is about right there so that's all it's taken I try not to go into Photoshop as much as I can I haven't needed to with this image and that's pretty much the same as my final image stop cutting with that right let's go on to the next one and we'll talk about something a little bit different so this is an X age this is the lighthouse at Flamborough I captured this during a thunderstorm pretty much as you might have seen on that video there was lightning going off behind the lighthouse it was raining it was difficult condition conditions to shoot in I was at ISO 3200 to in order to get the shutter speed up to freeze that lighthouse beam and it was difficult conditions because of that I did not quite get my composition 100% correct so this is the original image and it's obviously this is the sort of 3x2 that the camera produces but this area in the foreground is just doing absolutely nothing I was trying to get these colored flowers into there but it just hasn't worked I didn't compose it correctly because it was tricky and I was trying to keep the lens dry and all I kind of thing so all I'm going to do is to crop that out now I thought a little bit a little while ago about getting getting in writing camera it's more about getting the composition right in camera because the only thing you can change in post-processing and round your composition is by cropping it you can't change perspective you can't change overall composition that kind of thing so that's the bit you need to get writing camera not the exposure or the color a lot of stuff but all I'm going to do with this image is to crop it down and just bring it into a bit more of a panoramic style image I get the horizon a bit closer to the rule of thirds which looks nice the lighthouse is nicely on the rule of thirds but now we've got it on nearer closer to these two points here and then we've got the beam going up and lighting up those clouds so just hit return we have a much more natural a better looking image there and now it's just a case of going through and editing it so with this one I also used a nd grad - sorry Lindy grad to bring up the detail in the ground as well because you can you can do the opposite way with these software grads you can use it to specifically control foreground interest as well and you see just do it upside down and drag up from the bottom like I have here and all I'm gonna do is just use that to drag the exposure of the foreground up very slightly subtle things all the time and you're working together with all these different sliders different grads different brushes and that kind of thing and there's not much editing gone on with this one in fact it's just a case of sort of quickly going through affecting the white balance again because it didn't look like that original raw file get that up to somewhere like that start to get those colors in that I was seeing at the time it was imposing it was dark and that's that's as simple as that you're getting then drag a drag a grad him from the tops reduce that exposure down increase contrast bring the highlights down increase the shadows and just by going through like this we end up with that final image one thing I did do on this one which I don't normally do is bring in a bit of noise reduction because if 3200 it was quite noisy even on the Canon 5d Mark 4 so I'm just brought in a little of the luminance noise reduction and a little bit of the color noise reduction as well and that's just smoothed it out a little bit and removed some of that noise you do lose a bit of sharpness when you do that as well but I thought it was worth doing in this instance when it prints out it looks great and I've lost nothing overall from shooting at ISO to 3200 you can see all the edits I've made there I've used a couple of grads one from the top one from the bottom easy so onto the final image and with this one I want to talk about color so here you can see the original image from this shot that I'm really happy with from the other week in Suns end also and you can see there's not much this so flat so so flat from that raw file and this I promise you you can see from the video as well it did not look like this so we need to do processing to get these images back up to what we saw what we felt at the time so again it hasn't taken much to take this from this image here to this final image here I'm not going to bore you with a full edit of that but let's just have a look at this final raw file here you can see a slight reduction exposure contrast er highlights down shadows white says we've done and then you can see a small increase in vibrance and saturation I've added a medium contrast curve as well and then the white balance is not much different to that original file as well and this blue color that was there at the time that's come out naturally from that that original file but I have also added a brush you can see which areas I have manipulated with that and it's just a case of putting the brush over the the cliff here to bring some of the detail out of that and then the one here that just brings a detail I overall over those clouds to affect that at all I've done is increase contrast increased highlights here that you can see here and then brought the blacks down and that's just naturally brought out that slightly blue color haven't changed the color on that at all because I don't try to manipulate color in my images that sometimes I will if there's lots of green in an image I love yellow it might bring some of that down a bit but you can see here with this one I haven't used much color at all I've increased the magenta a tiny bit in saturation but that's it that's it you can see with the hue that's all the same saturations are saying luminance is the same it's just a tiny subtle boost of some of those colors and that's what brought out this image because I've captured it right at the time the raw file might have looked like this if we reset it the raw file look like that Bob it's all captured in that raw file so it's just about bringing those details out of the Royal file in the most natural way that you possibly can and if you've got it all right it will end up looking something like this now like I said I try not to go into Photoshop too often I've had two on this one because you can see there's a little something-something on my sensor there so I've just gone into Photoshop and removed that with a clone and then I've cooked it down a little bit just to make that final picture pop a bit more get more of the color in the frame so very simple very easy and let me know if you like these editing videos it's such an important part of the photography I want you to see how I do things totally to get too bored with just going through sliders all the time though so let me know okay so please leave a comment down below and let me know what you think please do share the video because that really helps me and first purchase I'm Adam this is the first man photography
