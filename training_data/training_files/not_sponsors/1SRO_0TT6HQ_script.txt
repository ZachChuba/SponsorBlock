communicable diseases are diseases that have been caused by pathogens a pathogen is a microorganism that causes a disease and there are four main types of pathogen so we've got viruses bacteria fungi and protists so we're just so because I currently have been infected by a virus we're just gonna focus on viruses today and viruses are microscopic pathogens they're super tiny like really really small much smaller than bacteria and have been said to be about ten thousand times smaller than a grain of salt so viruses are on the boundaries of what is considered life so they contain nucleic acids making up either DNA or RNA but never both but they lack the capacity to independently read and act upon the information contained within these nucleic acids they can't reproduce or replicate on their own and viruses are basically groups of genes surrounded by protein gel called a cap spit and the cuspid itself may be surrounded by a membrane layer called an envelope these shell components protect the genome and include structures that help the virus to infect specific cell types so they have cell surface receptors like two puzzle pieces that fit just right together many different viruses can bind to the same receptor and a single virus combined different cell surface receptors so what's getting into the body via wounds or respiratory passages viruses attach to a host cell the virus time transducers are seen them into the host cell so it injects it into the cell and this can happen in a few different ways some viruses such as HIV which has an envelope fused with the host cell membrane and is pushed through another envelope virus the influenza virus is engulfed by the sell some non-enveloped viruses such as the polio virus create a porous channel of entry and burrow through the membrane and once inside the viral genome hijacks the hosts old materials and machinery to make copies of itself so new viral genomes and new viral capsid components the invading virus also blocks the synthesis of any host DNA or RNA or proteins this feature forces the host cell to only viral proteins and copies of the viral genetic material once made the viral part self-assemble into new viruses which are also called wire ins which may burst out of the infected cell to pursue infectious careers of their own examples of viruses include Rhino virus and corona virus both of which calls the common cold which is what I have now there are more than a hundred different serotypes of the Rhino virus which are responsible for the common cold the corona virus cause I'm cold indistinguishable from the rhinovirus common cold with about 15% of adult common colds being caused by the corona viruses the transmission can occur through the air by respiratory droplets just inhale it pretty grim or by hunt on spread of mucous membranes the preaches this is also pretty grim and then we have a group of badasses called retroviruses so retro viruses are infectious agents with mean mean ways of replicating themselves a retrovirus possesses our RNA genome inside a capsid the mean is really begins after the virus has infected herself so after transducing the while genome into the cell once the virus employs its own special version of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase which is a protein that creates DNA strands based on RNA templates so basically the opposite of what occurs during transcription so the retroviral reverse transcriptase makes a DNA version of the viral genome once made this reverse transcribed DNA tino integrates into the genome of the infect itself so basically this means that the retrovirus mixed its genome with that of its host and makes it part of the host genome this is bad news for money for example the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV is a lentivirus which is a subgroup of retroviruses which causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS and this is work as a little bit technical so once the HIV is in the bloodstream as glycoproteins bind to the cd4 receptor on target cells this cd4 receptor is precedent high concentration on T helper lymphocytes which are cells that make up part of the immune system but these cells are actually referred to as cd4 positive T health how their cell suppers of cd4 receptors and lower concentrations which can become infected by HIV include macrophages monocytes on central nervous system dendritic cells the following HIV bonding to the cd4 receptor the viral envelope fuses with the infected host cell alarm capsid entry and normally immediately after infection people often suffer mild flu-like symptoms these past four and these can pass and for a period of time and factor people might not know they're infected at all but a cd4 positive T cells decline over time either at months or years due to the infection your immune system is getting weaker and weaker and opportunistic infections can then develop this is generally when HIV becomes AIDS there is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS although many scientists are trying to find what and at the moment those who have been infected are given antiviral drugs which can slow the development of AIDS but for the most part your body is darn good at fighting off infections from pathogens which is something we'll discuss in later video this video is purchase of a website or domain thanks for watching bye
