Squarespace hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video Prussia's rise to power Prussia need not have existed the world could have done without it but it wanted to exist no one had invited that small country into the circle of European great powers it demanded acceptance and pushed its way in Sebastian Hafner rise and fall of Prussia today we'll be examining one question just how was Prussia able to climb the ladder to the top of the european power hierarchy despite being one of myriad principalities that composed the holy roman empire as always to answer our central question we'll need to provide some context contrary to what you might think though this story is not one that begins amid these slopes of northern Germany or along the windswept beaches of the Baltic Sea rather it begins in 12th century Accra beneath the sweltering Mediterranean Sun ten years before the turn of the century a religious order known as the Teutonic Knights had been formed being charged with controlling aquas portholes they did not stay there for long however relocating to Transylvania in 1211 to assist the Hungarians against the ever encroaching humans during the latter half of the 13th century the Teutons roundup fighting alongside the polish against the pagans inhabiting the baltic coast we can see right off the bat that this society of warriors would go anywhere there was fortune to be won but there was something peculiar about the Baltic coast it was a time of Christianisation and colonization along North Germany something that became appealing to the covetous band of mercenary Crusaders but colonizing the Baltic in the region of Prussia was no easy task the process was significantly more brutal and involved the near total extermination of the native people known as the old Prussians consequently little information about the history and language of the original Prussians survives to this day it would take hundreds of years until there no more pagans to take the sword and cross to and the order eventually became embroiled in a sequence of wars with Poland and Lithuania hostilities ceased after the second piece of thorn in 1466 and the order lost its independence to Poland West Prussia was taken over entirely and East Prussia remained under the orders jurisdiction but was officially recognized as a fief of Poland in 1525 Grand Master Albrecht von Poisson brought about an end to the order he led converting to Protestantism and installing himself as Duke of Prussia in order to elevate himself to the status of a feudal ruler this would be an easy transition as Albrecht already had kinsmen in power and he was part of the house home and so learn the ruling family of Brandenburg a small German state based around Berlin a union between the two states seemed inevitable but it would take almost a century for the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg to inherit Prussia in 1618 the new ruler of Prussia a direct Frederick died airless and John Sigismund the ruler of Brandenburg would use that opportunity to finally inherit the Duchy forming the country of brandenburg-prussia what followed after this union was the combined States involvement in the 30 Years War by the time the devastating conflict ended in 1648 the Hohenzollerns were in control of five geographically disconnected strips of territory that's right border war doesn't just happen in paradox games it was even worse in reality each principality had its own laws and customs and the nobility of each wanted to retain as much power as possible it would take the great elector Frederick Vilhelm to contend with these challenges in the mid 17th century and although no territorial gains were made though homs' rule did see East Prussia being liberated from Poland and being placed under his direct control in the wake of the Swedish polish war but it would be the destiny of his son to wear the crown of a king not his own that son was known as Frederick the first the King in Prussia as of 1701 Frederick was a great patron of the arts and science he was considered excessively extravagant by some accounts including that of his grandson Frederick the Great certainly the more famous Prussian King before we discussed his rule we do need to cover the reign of Frederick Vilhelm the first known as the soldier king men i esteem above the greatest riches Frederick vilhelm declared before long one in every nine men was made a soldier increasing the size of the Prussian army 283 thousand men to maximize the amount of potential recruits the soldier King welcome two new immigrants into Prussia even constructing schools and hospitals to accommodate this wave of emigration but this was not unusual for Prussia even before Frederick ville Homs reign one-third of Berliners consisted of Frenchmen in the year 1700 many of them French Protestants furthermore waves of Protestant refugees from South Germany fled to Prussia each year to escape religious prosecution in Haffner's words this state created for itself a people at people of immigrants who upon arrival found a ready-made state and a ready-made administration and had their land assigned to them fertile land a land of unlimited opportunity for those who worked hard and efficiently even though his temper was a thing to be feared Frederick Vilhelm was an effective and detail-oriented ruler who left his son a burgeoning economic and military power one poised to expand its reach much like his father one of the first actions Frederick the Great took was increasing the Prussian army this time to a hundred thousand men a number that doubled during wartime but how is he able to accomplish this the answer is Prussian thrift which involved four-fifths of Prussia state revenue being spent on the army as French writer Voltaire poet where some states have an army the Prussian army has a state despite what you might think this absurd investment in the Prussian army did pay off as Frederick succeeded in seizing Silesia from the Austrians and West Prussia finally from the Polish during the Seven Years War he defended Prussia from a coalition that included Austria France and Russia three of the biggest military powers at the time military conquests aside Frederick the Great is considered a quintessential example of an enlightened despot having been a devotee of the humanities as a youth he was keen to and patronized his favorite artists and philosophers Frederic was in some respects a combination of his father and grandfather combining the best elements of both of his predecessors to claim his place in history in the 19th century Prussia continued to expand although it was subdued by Napoleon along with the majority of Europe Prussia regained much of its territory and even gained new holdings by the end of it though including the coal replete roar at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 about 50 years later Prussia became the core of the North German Confederation as well as its successor the German Empire but that's a topic for another time now back first website or domain purchase thanks for watching I'd like to thank the armchair historian team and my general staff on
