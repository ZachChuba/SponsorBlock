hey yo what's up so yeah today i'm going to show you how to use your hands with the oculus quest 2. if you think about it your hands make a fantastic vr controller i mean you already know how to use them they never need to be charged and best of all they are really really hard to lose if you mainly have a vr headset for watching movies socializing with friends and browsing the internet then hand tracking is enough to get you started it's far easier cheaper and more natural that's what i'm going to show you in this video it's going to be amazing so i hope you are going to enjoy this video now it's time to jump into the metaphors and check it out let's go cool beans so here we are inside the oculus home from here we can start using the hand tracking what you want to do is head over to the settings device scroll down until you bump into hands and controllers click on that and over here you can enable the hand tracking by simply flipping the switch that's all it's super straightforward i know and if done you can close the settings and put your controllers on the floor your hands should now appear in front of you yes and this is what they look like in vr they are transparent so you can see what you are selecting uh within the menu and when i turn around it's it's still able to track my hands just fine it's a true magic and trust me the first time you use this it will blow your mind so enjoy but let's dive into the basics if you want to select something in the menu you do that by pinching your index finger and your thumb for a short moment like this you see and that's how you navigate through all of the categories in for example the store and with that you can scroll down or scroll up and go left and right you can do this with both hands but i'm right-handed so that's why you see me using this one the most yes last but not least but most importantly if you quickly want to go to your browser to your social page tv store and home then you can do that by holding your fingers together for a longer period of time this is how you make the quick actions menu appear or or disappear so let's uh head back to the store and let me explain to you how you can figure out what game supports hand tracking and which game doesn't so the easiest way to find out is by going to the search bar and select hand tracking and then it will show you a couple of apps that work like waltz of the wizard elixir the line and the curious tale of the stolen pets if you want to double check just go to the game's details more info and then it will tell you if it supports hand tracking this is the icon you wanna you wanna look for this is the official uh rating yeah if you find one of these uh interesting then install them with just your hands welcome to the future and you do the same when you when you buy a title just fill in the details and before you know it you are inside the well for example the curious tale of the stolen pets okay so let me also demonstrate what the browser uh looks like in the browser you will be using the keyboard the most but you can also use these uh shortcuts that will take you straight away to the website you want but let's say you are going to use it then this is uh this is how it works you can type with one or two hands i like to use one because uh the keyboard is far away if it was just here then i would do it the casual way but i can't maybe oculus will uh will update that that would be really really useful for sure because that will make you know using the menu even easier and more maybe do so lets me know uh you care the future of gaming is going to be all about vr glasses haptic suits gloves simulators and loads of other next level stuff on my trip to asia i got to discover this wonderful world and learn tons about how virtual reality is slowly shaping the next generation of gamers you can go full screen too of course immersion overload what a pleasure for the eyes one of the companies that i got to visit during my adventures was cat vr a passionate team of people that have taken the lead on bringing omnidirectional treadmills to consumers they had invited me to come over and give feedback on one of their prototypes that's the browser in a nutshell you can change the video quality etc etc and when you sign into your favorite website you can also leave comments like things and and more so what i'm trying to say here is that literally everything in the menu works with the hand tracking it's all compatible the settings the share features like recording take photo go live and cast and even if you want to add some friends that you might know then you can do that too so um yes why don't we dive into one of the hand tracking experiences i have a few but uh my favorite one is definitely waltz of the wizard so let's do that it should seamlessly take me there without me having to worry to grab my controllers if i do launch an app like onward that does not support it then it will ask me to grab my controller so there's no way you can cheat the system so let's do waltz of the wizard yay we're inside this is one of the most magical vr experiences that you can play and it shows perfectly what you can do with hand tracking so let me show you one of my favorite tricks in this game i can turn my my hands into a slingshot seems legit oh oh oh i'm not done yet i'm on a roll no you've missed five given up huh what whatever whatever yes hello hey don't forget to like this video thank you thank you so much for letting us know so let's try one of the spells supersize it is a wizard once became annoyed at catching two small fish so he made a potion that would make them bigger on his dish [Music] oops gold i love gold oh try to catch it nice one let's now make things tiny [Music] who had a closet full of junk she imagined too small too small oh no oh no or well you don't really have a nose oh what happens if i throw you into that be careful whoa okay one more one more transmute a single touch from cursed hands makes objects fly and flutter crazy this game is jam-packed with with spells so there we go oh oh let's play some music if you drop something in waltz then just do this i'm a wizard after all [Laughter] oh i'm a unicorn now look at me go look at this special potion what if ah eating home phone what the heck the pot is not intended as a child's play oh i know oh what a landing what was that oh i can reach the upper shelves now is that the golden egg do i now control the oasis that would be uh fantastic so to end up this video let me show you how you move in this uh in this game so you point your finger like this and it works with smooth logo too it's genius it's one of the best mechanics i've ever seen little ah oh so with that being said let's jump to the outro and end this video let's go if the hand tracking is this good then you start to wonder why are we still using controllers and why is oculus not bundling a quest 2 with just your hands because that would cut the price immensely it would make it so much cheaper because the controllers are quite expensive and remember when facebook said they wanted a billion people in vr they weren't only talking about the gamers they are also talking about folks who want to use their standalone vr headset just to watch movies with to socialize with friends and browse the internet in that case hand tracking will do the trick and i'm curious if if oculus will push towards that idea where they are going to cater different audiences with different bundles i would be totally up for it because i think it will uh you know bring us closer to the tipping point of vr going mainstream let me know in the comments below what you think i'm i'm very eager to hear your opinion on this subject but yes hand tracking is accurate enough to uh to serve the the bigger crowd uh it's going to be uh exciting for sure to see where it's going to take us but with that being said i want to thank you so much for watching and now it's time for me to well sign off and as i always say and i see you all next time see you in the metaphors bye-bye oh and like this video if you thought it was useful thank you [Music] you
