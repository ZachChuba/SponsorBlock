hi there hello there I have been very very busy doing work my gallery show okay today we are painting him again right my idea for this is to have him sitting in a bed of color and having the color reflect in his eyes goodbye there you're just going but before that skill share and it is something that I use and would recommend it so cool and now we go into one of my skills which is fine art painting I'm a fine artist I think I do and the idea behind this piece is to paint my cat gave me this shot at the perfect time I don't just like smiling I could hold it inside yeah you right yes oh okay anyway yes we are painting do you thanks you want attention more love I'm about immortalize view into paint so you've got enough attention going for you getting the idea by shoes the idea behind this piece is that he is going to be sitting in a bed of colors and having the colors reflect in his eyes lovely eyes are using a blend of oil and acrylic today my favorite combo we are as always going to do a complete undercoat and acrylic paint the reason of this is because painting looks better in layers it does doesn't it cutie here Tony get up yeah yeah so I've decided to paint him in acrylic - his eyes because is either gonna be really colorful and match the same colors that are surrounding him when the paint's done the paint will look very ninh tones what it's completely drawing and I can furnish it it'll all look oil paint is interesting because it does take a while to dry you can mix other things into it to make it dry faster you have to be a bit careful though because if you use too much of something like linseed oil which has a yellowing tone when it's dry it can turn yellow later on the lovely thing about oils is you can continue to mix them they blend really well and they maintain their color so whatever color you mix that's the color you get with acrylic not so much and sometimes about the colors will come through as well you never really know what the correct trial-and-error just define it I'm quite excited to be painting him actually because it gives me a chance to work on hair textures something to remember when painting hair is that imperfections will make it look more perfect paint all the hair straight and going the same direction it's gonna look a bit stiff so don't be afraid to go different directions different tones will have the undertones are there the above ones you can do whatever you want at the same time though art is kind of a balance of making something look idealistic and realistic so for your paintings if you want to pick the best angles and the best tones at the same time you want to make sure it maintains the life and you need to incorporate something that means life to you and for me life is imperfect and so imperfections make it look more like I am using a lot of colors here and I'm trying to blend them all together at the same time so what's this piece is dry in a few weeks I'll probably go over it again with the topcoat in certain areas to make some colors pop up more than others and create some more shadow tones if you want the painting to have more depth you do need to have darker shadows overall I'm really happy with how this piece turned out I really like the black and white tones and contrast the rainbow tones below I think go ahead and add some work how their tongues to cure it rather than just keeping them completely in black and white so there are some green red and yellow tones a little bit of blue in there and I'm happy with that what do you think and can we guess the meaning behind the piece you're as bright as how you choose to see yourself so surround yourself in life with all the colors that make you think you're good just kill Sheriff response from the video if you do want free trial there's information in the description also I do have my golden giveaway so if you'd like a chance to win a Golden Pen place a nice comment down below and I will announce the winner next week thank you for watching I'm excited for my gallery show I'm excited to see you guys it's over in the city and I will see you guys again next time bye all right bye spice [Music]
