hey what is going on you guys it is mr. nose sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you guys loot from 1000 SEK us girls the very first clue scroll loot video of this whole entire series and certainly not the last you know one of the reasons that I avoided doing clue scroll videos for so long was mainly because I just see so many on YouTube and I'm really a bigger fan of PVM inge at the end of the day so that's kind of why it took me a year into this series to start this but if you guys enjoy this video you enjoy all of the 1000 caskets that we are going to be opening at the very end of the video then feel free to let me know in the comments section below and I certainly have no problem doing mediums hards as well as elites in the near or far future now before we get into the video I do want to say two important things number one I want to give a huge shout out to another youtuber on old school runescape who goes by the name of shenanigans smash and the link to his channel will be in the description below the reason I want to give him a shout-out is because he is the one video that I did see that provided with the most efficient layout to do easy clues Scrolls you know as most you guys know to do clue Scrolls you need a lot of energy a lot of teleports and you just have to be able to pretty much go anywhere in the game that is required of a clue scroll step so thanks to his video which can be found in the description below I was all ready to go on basically using all of the teleport tabs that you see in the inventory from start to finish and of course we had to replenish them a few times because I guess I underestimated how many teleports I would actually need for this video and of course how many Gourmet emplyees I would have to be searching it to get all of these 1000 clue Scrolls so yeah big shout out to him and the second thing that I want to mention is that you may be curious did I actually do the master clue Scrolls that I did get from all of these Easy's and the answer to that is no the reason for that is because this is a video just about easy clues Scrolls we are going to be looking at just how much you can make or just how much you can lose and I didn't really want to get a master clues involved with that as you can see the video is already close to 18 minutes but that just means that I owe you guys a master clue scroll video in the future and I'm sure that you will hold me to it so with all that being said let's go ahead and get into today's video so as you guys can see you know most of all these clips are pretty heavily fast-forwarded and the reason for that is because you know at the very bottom right of the screen we didn't bank those caskets a single time so you're gonna be able to see them grow from 1 all the way up to 1,000 pretty much recorded this whole entire thing as soon as I got a casket that would make the clip and then of course you know I would save all of the caskets towards the end and that would take up a huge chunk of the video as well yeah I hope I don't bother your guys his eyes too much with all of this fast-forwarding but this was basically how I wanted to lay out this video and yeah in general you know starting this easy couse girl grind I really didn't know what to expect you know the only thing that was out of the ordinary for me was really just building all of the hidey holes which is something that I had to do before I started this video essentially what a hidey hole is is anytime you get a clue scroll step that requires you to equip a certain set of items and do a certain emote around the game you can just build that stash unit hidey-hole whatever you want to call it and you can place all of the items in there and then you can just you know repeat the process and you never have to bank and consistently bring them back and forth so I had to do that beforehand and of course I had to buy all of the employees that I would need in order to get 1,000 clues obviously the two most popular methods in this game of getting easy clues Scrolls would be pickpocketing ham members in the ham hide out underneath lumbridge and of course the number one method of them all searching gourmet employees now since I was an amateur at these easy cool scrolls I actually thought that buying 8,000 gourmet in planes would easily give me 1,000 easy clues girls well I was wrong I believe I actually ended up buying close to 30,000 of the exact numbers and calculations of course will be at the very end and yeah I mean if you're an iron man and you don't feel like going to Perrault Perrault stacking up all those employees then definitely just go ahead and get your thieving up in pickpocket ham members I remember back in 2012 when zamorak pages were so expensive in the older enscape but that was actually a good money making method was to do easy clue scrolls I believe Sam Rock pages back in those days were 5 mil apiece and now they are just hovering over anywhere from 100 to I believe upwards of 300 K each maybe not even that much so yeah it's going to be interesting to see you know almost eight years later if we can still say that easy clue Scrolls is a good money making method and yeah you know when you're doing the pickpocketing method in order to get those easy never gonna be spending any money and that is the key here because you know when you're doing the implementing money so the real question at the start of this video is are we going to profit or are we going to lose money and as you can see we are already at 900 caskets overalls yeah these clips were pretty fast in the grind itself was pretty slow I was averaging anywhere from 20 to 23 Clues Scrolls per hour the guide that I did watch in the efficiency that I have seen from other people some people can actually do up to 35 to 40 clue Scrolls per hour um and that's just according to some you know I'm not too sure how accurate that is but just remember that cou scrolls can and should be done at your own pace you know no matter what account build you have or teleports you have unlocked don't worry too much about those details just have fun with it and hope to get lucky so here we are at 1,000 caskets overall went by pretty fast and that first things first just to check the collection log to show that we have an overall easy clue count of 71 completed prior to this video and to also show that we obtained zero out of 131 unique items that can be rewarded from all these clues with 1000 caskets to start opening of course I was hoping for all 131 slots to be filled but that of course will be a mystery until the end what won't be a mystery though is that I unfortunately had a master clue in my bank for the first 500 openings now although I was not planning on doing the masters I still wanted to see how many I would have gotten through the course of 1,000 easy clue Scrolls so you guys gonna have to forgive me on that one just keep in mind that it is a one and fifty chance to get a master clue while opening any easy clue scroll casket now I was of course live-streaming the opening on Twitch and you can find that link in the description below so shout out to everyone who attended at the opening of all these caskets we started in the crafting guild and we ended up all the way in varrock west banks so yeah shout out to you guys now early on into the openings I did see some beautiful uniques especially ones with the higher-value you know such as those flared trousers alongside that we also got these staff of bob the cat pretty strange items not gonna lie but some of them do have some value behind them now of course I wanted to see as many high valued rares as I could you know such as the team capes the decorated amulets the pages etc and it isn't important to note that the highest-valued item from the level one clue Scrolls is the cape of skulls during the making of this video it was actually around 22 mil now I believe it's around 21.5 it would certainly be a huge boost to the overall price check and help ensure that I make my money back from this video or even profit if we were able to get that Scholz cape or a decent amount of the team capes and speaking of these team capes you know looking at the screen here I know that a lot of this is fast forwarded but anytime that I did receive a significant item or something that stood out I tried my best to just kind of slow down the fast-forwarding and as you can see here you know our very first team cape that we did get was just shy of two hundred caskets in and just a few after receiving the first one we did receive the second one so yeah the Luck was looking really good in the beginning of the video and just a side note I did mess up a few times during the banking portion of this video you know you can expect to receive Kois and sleeping caps and blessings from these level 1 clues scrolls and unfortunately for me I actually had a very big coif and sleeping cap collection as well as some blessings and the bank so after opening a few hundred caskets I did realize this and I quickly just put all of these items in my inventory so that they wouldn't mix in with the clue scroll items and as it goes for the blessings I just decided to drop those on the ground so that the blessings that I would get from the clues Scrolls could pretty much just be new in the bank and everything could be 100% accurately accounted for and even if there is a minor mistake at the very end of the video we can just go ahead and check out the collection log and that will tell us everything that we got from all of these clues Scrolls so yes that is why there is 2.8 million coins in my inventory I promised I was not trying to flex it just definitely made things easier and as you can see while opening all these caskets you know we saw a lot of everything a lot of variety some rewards being just in the 3-digit category some being in the 6 some much more than that you know while I was banking all of this stuff I wasn't too worried about organization especially in the loot tab you know I didn't want to placeholder this video or anything like that just wanted to let it all flow naturally so after everything was opened I did dedicate about 30 minutes to just cleaning and organizing all of the drops that I did receive so yeah I do apologize to those with OCD I know it looked messy for a while especially on stream I made sure to make it look really nice for afterward now at around 500 overall easy cool scrolls opened I did receive the large Spade this is basically just a fashion scape accomplishment achievement item whatever you want to call it I really don't even think you can dig with it which is pretty strange because you know it is a shovel and alongside the halfway point shovel you know during the course of all these caskets I did see some nice uniques as shown already you know a few team capes as well as that amulet of power trimmed with the amulet being 2 mil you know this did help the price check out quite a bit saw some other uniques that weren't as high value but still pretty colorful you know such as that golden apron of course the rainbow the pantalones think that's how you pronounce that a bunch of Bob shirts and much much more and excluding the uniques you know you do see a lot of fire lighters add up over time as well as a lot of teleports and those teleports are decent value as well because you know those teleports are the ones that actually speed up a lot of these clues scrolls numerous different tiers essentially just being a shortcut to wherever you need to dig or whoever you need to talk to next so those teleports do help the price check I mean even the coins that we were getting you know leaving all of the GP at the very bottom right of the inventory right next to the caskets the sleeping caps and the coif you know at this current point in time we were over halfway in and we were already at 245 K cash so yeah every single detail really does matter here when you're trying to make your money back or when you're just trying to see if something is profitable even those steel pickaxes the willow short bows and everything in between you know it all does count towards the price check and as it goes for actually getting these easy clue scrolls you know the way I was doing it of course was searching these gourmet emblems and as I mentioned at the very start of the video you know being completely clueless and just buying 8,000 of them expecting to get a thousand clue scrolls well the actual rate of getting an easy close girl from a gourmet in playing is one and twenty five so that kind of gives you a good start at least you know for the amount of employees that you want to buy if you're ever to go for a thousand Easy's in the future probably a good starting point would be 25,000 gourmet emblems and of course there's another employee that does provide easy clue Scrolls as well and that is the young imp Ling it's about 1 in 50 from that and last but not least the baby n playing which is 1 and 100 now the easy cool scroll itself was actually released into the game may 5th 2004 of course it's Members Only is actually not the lowest tier closer anymore it used to be but now the lowest tier is beginner clue Scrolls which in all honesty don't ever waste your time doing that they're more difficult than Easy's and yeah completely useless content don't mean to bash them but you know just given my honest opinion there now if you do ever happen to get an easy close girl and you just can't be bothered to do it then you can also feel free to high alket you will get a whopping twelve GP so yeah if you're not a fan of them at least you got that but if you do that then just keep in mind you won't be able to get as lucky as I did in this clip yes we did actually end up getting the cape of skulls the highest valued item that you can get from an easy clue scroll big shout out to the reaction there you know like I said I did not expect to get this this is the rarest item that you can get and certainly above the 1 in 1,000 drop rate that I had so yeah really the highlight moment of the video the real question is are we going to be lucky enough to get a second one after receiving already at this point three team capes and now a cape of skulls the anticipation was just building and building now you will start to see some master clues come in finally that is because you know as I mentioned before I did have one in the bank for a majority of this casket opening so you know when you do see them that is why but like I mentioned I just dropped them on the ground wasn't too worried about them and I know that is annoying to some people but again I will be doing a whole master clue video in the very far future so keep that in mind overall though it was a solid week averaging you know over 200 viewers on twitch when I was streaming this every single day and really was a lot of fun you know at the very end while we were opening all of these 1000 caskets we did actually reach over 1,000 viewers so I'm glad a decent amount of you in the community got to see this live a little bit of a treat for you all I know some people may have considered that as spoiling the video but you know that's just a part of live streaming hopefully you guys just watched it anyway you know but you know here we are with 1,000 easy clue Scrolls completed big shout out again to everyone who did sit through this 60 minute session of just opening caskets yes I'm not kidding it actually took an hour to open all this did not expect that but yeah it was a lot of fun and we got a lot of items so the real question is did we complete the collection log how much did we make or how much we lose as mentioned before you know the bank tab was a complete catastrophe very very messy but after I pretty much finished this livestream up I went and just organized everything for you all and it is now time to look at the tab from 1000 SEK else here we go so from top to bottom we have the runes the pages the teleports of course the salmon the trout purple sweets all of the range equipment all of the black equipment fire lighters the bronze the iron the steel Bob shirts the blessings the leather the masks the robes the elegant the god robes the amulets the aprons the shovel I mean everything is here it's truly remarkable how many items we actually did get now if you curious how many emblems it actually took to get these 1000 caskets looking at the grand exchange history and adding everything up it looks like it just took about twenty-five thousand two hundred and I would say those two hundred extra employees were just because I was spam clicking them sometimes while trying to get the clues so there was a lot of unnecessary openings that I could have avoided but I'm not known for my patience now overall we did spend about 70.3 mil on all of the employees that we use for this video we'll go ahead and we'll add another two mil from the teleports and all the transportation that we did have to do during this video as well so let's just call it 72 mil in supplies spent and now it is time to see how much we ended up with so first things first let's go ahead and price check just the MPEG LA this is pretty much 25,000 gourmet employees all of the random drops that you can expect to get from them as you can see those frog spawns are untradable so just ignore those with the jars and everything included we have our first number for the price check at 26.4 mil although I didn't sell these items on the video I am pretty confident that these numbers are accurate it might take a while to sell we might be a mill off but for the most part everything is accurate and now it is time to price check all of the clues scroll items so the very first price check all of the runes and some of the pages comes out to be 5 point 2 mil looks like we did complete 3 out of 5 of the books we were off on Bandos and I believe we were close on armadyl as well now the second price check this is some more pages all of the teleports and a little bit of the junk as well as 300 purple and this one comes out to be five point two mil once again now we move on to the third price check this is all of the black armor the black weapons as well as the fire lighters the dragon enchantment Scrolls a 450 K that we did end up with and now for the fourth price check all of the irons some of the steel as well as the bronze kite shield trims just about three point six milk being some more of the black heraldic armor small price check from that one point six mil now we move on to the sixth price check this is the blessing some of the studded leather some of the masks and hats got about four point two mil the seventh price check pretty much is just the elegance of the amulet of magic trims we ended up with ten of those also shout-out to the flared trousers nice to see those 6.1 mil from that and finally we get to the most expensive price check of them all all of the rares and the final price check all of these rares coming out to be just about 37 mil we ended up getting three team capes and of course the cape of skulls overall clue scroll loot ended up being sixty four point nine mil from 1000 SEK uh Scrolls not to mention the additional twenty six point four million fling loot meaning that if we add these two numbers together we made about ninety 1.3 mil total spending seventy two mil approximately 20 mil profit overall as it goes for that collection log how many of the 131 items did we receive one hundred and thirteen we were missing some of the monk robe jeez the golden chef had one page and not to mention another team cape now overall I did actually end up being ranked 281 for easy clue Scrolls before that I think I was in the thousands so that was pretty cool and yeah to conclude you know at an efficient rate you can do thirty five clue Scrolls per hour and if you manage to get lucky and get that cape of skulls you will most likely profit but it really is all about your RNG all about how lucky you are and you know that's what really determines your profit as it goes for easy clues Scrolls I hope this video was informative and entertaining for you guys I'm not too sure how it turned out honestly but you guys are the judge of that so let me know in the comments section below thank you all for your kin you'd support it's been a pretty hectic day doing this voiceover was really difficult but I finally got it done just didn't have a lot of privacy today so yeah with that being said thank you guys very much for watching and until next time mister no sleep out
