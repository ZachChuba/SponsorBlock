for 50 years we've been stuck with the same old lightsaber look and it's got me thinking what we could just break out of that little box and make it look as cool as we wanted but we're going to do just that in this video with the combination of realistic choreography cutting edge camera tech and brand new visual effects techniques we're going to reinvent the lightsaber the lightsaber a classic weapon elegant weapon for the more civilized days the concept of an energy sword has existed beyond just a lightsaber it's not something that's specific just to star wars and if you look at star wars i feel like there's been a lot of stagnation in the idea of an energy sword if you look at what a fight scene is supposed to mean you know two human beings dueling to the death it's intense emotions it should be the height of storytelling but oftentimes lightsabers end up being showy flashy acrobatic displays hollywood has a bit of an issue here they get scared of reinventing things and so we've taken it upon ourselves to see if we can reinvent the lightsaber through reapproaching choreography to changing how we would approach visual effects i think we can make an energy sword that feels more visceral more real and perhaps more dramatic than the classic lightsaber from star wars we're going to shoot a little cinematic short film about a school that teaches sword dueling we want you to feel the life and death drama of this sword fight which means shooting things smooth and cinematically no handheld shaky footage here however we don't have expensive equipment or a big crew so we're gonna be using the new ronin 4d from dji to get this done so can we improve on lightsaber duels from star wars well follow along with us here and you'll see a finished short film at the end of this piece and you can be the judge so let's start with probably the most important thing the choreography we've reached out to our good friend luke lafontaine who is a sword expert you might remember on a react episode a long time ago the first time luke joined us he went on a little rant about lightsaber fights do you ever notice when these guys all swing really hard they make these power swings the blades made out of light it doesn't weigh anything why would you have to swing it hard and so we want to put that into action we want to actually go out there and make what we think a lightsaber fight should actually look like i had this thing that was plasma that was burning in a million degrees and i touched you with it how would you really fight with it so even though we're in a fantasy based world i want dramatic intention and reality and i want the audience to be scared and i'm not scared if this guy does a triple backflip and a butterfly twist in the middle of this deadly sword fight where it's like well while you're in the air i'm just gonna cut you in half how's that the beginning of this fight is tentative movement nobody really wants to commit the minute you cross blades it's literally like well you can kill me i can kill you so let me temper this with a little bit of ocean i've got to pay attention to my technique and get focused now because this isn't a fist fight just fight what are you gonna do you don't punch me in the face i get a black eye you break my nose who cares sword fight all you gotta do is flinch the wrong way and i've opened up your forearm i've taken your hand off i mean a lot of the classic star wars movies how many people have lost their hand these are energy based weapons all i'm trying to do is go move your blade that much i'm going to cut your forearm and take your hand off i don't have to do more than that with a lightsaber bang whack i've cut your hand off now i cut you down through the body i win you lose typically the way swordfights are done in hollywood it would look like this he can very slowly show you how many different times he can hit me while i'm doing that there it is here it is both my arms have been cut off more than once i'm also noticing there's some footwork in that as you push in he's dropping back and keeping his range so you're very much paying attention to when you're in the the kill zone or it's not in the kill zone if you ask me what's the most important thing in sword fighting distancing if you as a swordsman could utterly master distancing you'd never get cut the choreography has been nailed down and now we need to make the camera part of the choreography so i'm going to be using this camera trying to figure out camera moves i can accentuate this make it look cool get you involved dramatically but also clearly show the fight it's my belief that a camera is the third participant in a duel between two people on screen because you can always throw the camera on a tripod and throw it in the background but it's boring you want to get in there you want to show the audience something you want to say something with your cinematography so after seeing all that on camera and working out some more character beats into the choreography and getting these cool sweeping shots i am really excited to shoot this piece so the first time in my life i got to spend a thousand dollars in lightsabers so i had to get the brightest heaviest duty lightsabers they had and i had to get two of each so back in the day when they did lightsabers they're just basically painting over the film frame the lightsaber itself was it was just stick it didn't shoot any light into the scene but now in modern times we'd have these things called leds which didn't exist back in the 70s and so now we can make lightsabers that actually emit light and our material science has gotten advanced enough where the blades don't break as easily who wants to whack a lightsaber that's a dream come true this is dope it's really cool it seems like there's enough durability in these things okay these things are sick yeah they are they really are cool what up son what up son here we are again what are you doing here oh you know i'm just here to help facilitate you know you stand in the background help people you know hurt watching these guys fight you know watching the skill levels really good yeah it'll be a good time it's a cool location we've already worked out the shot list niko's got in his head he knows what he's doing i just got to make sure nobody actually lops anybody in the eye or forgets choreography i think this is the first narrative shot on this camera action [Music] it's been taxing just the specificity of everything is really tricky luke has very high standards but it's good and the choreography makes sense so in that sense it's not hard at all it all flows naturally it's just like really dialing it in that's that's tricky so there's like a million things that are cool about this camera but this little guy which lets me do dolly shots on my feet is like one of the coolest parts so this shot i'm going to be nice and low to the ground i'm going to skim along it like this you notice how the head stays even while i'm bobbling with my feet that literally there's actually a sonar i believe on the bottom that measures the distance it's basically all the same tech from their drones but packed into a camera having that fourth axis stabilization is pretty insane this is probably one of my favorite ways to pull focus it's so good that sometimes i don't even need to do my job uh we just used autofocus and basically i could just sit here hang back eat an orange or something and just let the camera do pretty much all the work for me thanks dji for taking my job i'm gonna be getting this crazy single off these guys abilities all right here we go boys whole thing don't rush anything and action [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] nice work guys nice that was great that was good that's a wreck guys [Music] it was a lot for me to ask you after over 10 hours in the day to do it in a winter i really appreciate all you guys can work he's good he's good this was a lot of fun because i share some of luke's attitudes about movie sword fights it's very rare to actually get a sword fight that lasts where it's two characters having a conversation with their weapons and there's a lot of big battle scenes where people are like you come in you swing the sword you die it's just great to be able to put a fight together where you can see the story develop i think realistic sword fights are more exciting than than more stylized exaggerated ones obviously there's style has its place but i the really good realistic fights make you sit on the edge of your seat because you your body recognizes that that's dangerous we tried to show that there was actual you know thought and danger and decisions you know there's gravitas to everything with a fight like this you need you need that cinematic smoothness you need that that feeling like an omnipotent god looking at his creations like i was gliding and flying all over the place i mean there's shots i'm getting that would require thousands and thousands of dollars worth of like steadicam tech and you know a crew to do and i'm just like i'll try this like yeah matt basically never biffed focus imagine that imagine having a lidar and you just use that to pull all your focus the ronin 4d is the kind of camera that i wanted since i started making youtube videos to me that is the perfect camera how do you reinvent the lightsaber visually how do you make it look different how do you make it look better there's a lot of ways actually i've been thinking about this for a long time here's how i'm going to try to improve the look of an energy sword first and foremost the light right they're light sabers they give off light the look of the lightsaber that everybody remembers kind of comes from the prequels or it's the white core and the colored fringe and that's kind of how everybody does fan film lightsabers these days because the white core represents parts of lightsaber being so bright they're overexposing the camera and of course as it fringes off as it blurs out you can actually see the color there because exposure's low enough the problem is when you move something really fast the motion blur basically lowers the exposure and that white core should turn into the color of the lightsaber but that's not how they do the lightsaber effects they just draw a big white fan so i want to approach lightsabers realistically with how they would physically work on camera so in star wars the lightsabers are either cut out by hand frame by frame or they're tracking a cgi blade onto the lightsaber frame by frame that's very very time consuming and you also end up with something that looks artificial because you're adding something artificial to the shot i needed to come up with a system that was not only faster than the way that they do it for the star wars films but i wanted a system that more accurately reflected what would physically happen if you're filming somebody's swing a laser sword so here's what i came up with so as you can see here in the original footage this is the raw shot here the lightsaber is actually pretty bright they give off a lot of light on their own and the yellow lightsaber is also very saturated and has a lot of color so through a combination of chroma keying where i isolate certain colors and luma keying where i isolate certain brightness i'm able to create a mask here that just gives me the lightsabers as you can see here by the two white sticks so now i can pass that in to another section that will take the bright parts of the image and raise them even more and since it's isolated just where the lightsabers are it's basically just raising the brightness of the lightsabers so now i've upped the brightness of just lightsabers i can apply a glow filter to the entire image and because the lightsabers themselves are the only things in the image that have this brightness they're the only things that glow in addition i can also add something called lens reflection boom so this mimics how light passes through the different glass of the lens and reflects within there and then gets filmed so by combining the aperture diffraction which gives me the glow and the lens reflections i end up with a realistic looking lightsaber glow that glow as if it was filmed on set being that bright then as the sabers move and they're swung around and they changed kind of their hue and brightness so too does the glow shift and so too did the reflection shift very realistic and it changes the look from what you're conveniently seeing in a star wars film while still maintaining the identifiable look of an energy sword and it's much much faster than tracing it all by hand thing number two that i'm going to do differently visually i need to come up with a way to deliver the vibe of this energy source what makes it dangerous so rather than just having them hum and flicker i want them to feel like they're jets of fire weird like hybrid light and fire put together and matt took it and ran with it and did something pretty incredible we went in a dark room with a black uh little piece of foam and a glass of water and a flashlight all the light refractions that you get from shooting that light through the water gives you a stack of assets and then just layering those on top of each other additively adding some extra like jet flame elements in here gives you this see this is like an older star wars movie the light that's shining on his hand through the lightsaber there like that wouldn't be there yeah just having that practical light here just immerses you in the effect i'm so happy with it honestly it turned out really well number three if you're doing a fight scene it's crucial that people follow what's happening in the fight scene where the strikes are going how they're being blocked i want to enhance it and highlight it and make sure that you can distinctly see what is going on we have an idea here and that is to create sparks we leaned somewhat on like pre-made stock assets which are great but given how dynamic this is and seeing how we see the floor and and everything moves in such a realistic way we wanted to try and generate our own sparks so what i put together i went ahead and built a little spark emitter which basically can be aimed in any direction at any time and will spit out a little uh celebration of sparks basically all i have to do then is load in a still reference image of the background and line up that little spitter and we can spit sparks on literally any shot we want to and it's nice to have the reflections of those sparks and the illumination that those sparks create actually in the scene because it grounds it so much more it gives a lot of directionality to the strikes it really helps lead the eye it helps you understand what's actually going on in the chaos of this fight all right so we changed up the choreography created a new visual language for the lightsabers tried new sound design it's all done here's the finished piece please tell us what you think [Music] [Music] graduation day huh the student must experience a real fight before they're ready what makes it a real fight you have to kill your opponent [Music] [Music] you need two things to win a sword fight perfect distance at the right time right now the teacher controls both if the student doesn't start forcing opportunities he's going to get cut he's nervous he's scared your body doesn't want to cooperate when you're scared oh jesus oh god oh my god see this school is [ __ ] up this school breeds the best sword fighters in the world you want to know why [Music] so [Music] [Applause] this company's fear now he just needs to temper his attitude let's see if he wants it [Music] [Music] who are you this is my school want to join [Music] so after basically two years of not shooting anything narrative because of covid it's been nice to get out there and actually make some cinema again thanks to all of you for watching it really fun shooting this video on it thanks to luke kendall and steve for your awesome choreo jordan and porya for your awesome acting kevin for awesome sound design jordan matt for awesome vfx i can keep going you're probably already leaving the video by now so anyways bye bye consider subscribing leave a comment or something
