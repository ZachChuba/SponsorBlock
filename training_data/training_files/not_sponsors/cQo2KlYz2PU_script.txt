(Ambitious NAYEON
makes up for the previous game) (The moment I give up
at the Ambitionz' winning streak) (Their mistake is my opportunity) (Eagle Eye JEONGYEON
ended the song) (It's not over until it's over) (Next up: Tray Karaoke) (Team Bobby Brown is stuck) (Even after receiving a hint) (CHAEYOUNG only serves comedy) (With a clueless CHAEYOUNG) (Team Bobby Brown are stuck) What is it? (Will they be able to pull through?) What is it? Isn't it "meet her again?" "I thought I had forgotten her?" (She is too cute) I just can't! (Team Bobby Brown's 6th try) ♪ She was so pretty ♪ ♪ She was an angel from Heaven ♪ ♪ I loved her ♪ ♪ We were truly happy ♪ (Ugh... Not again) - It's "We were happy!"
- "We were happy." I'll be wrong anyway.
Shouldn't we just use a hint? (You had a plan all along) (MOMO's turn to pick) - Please!
- Please be "Replay." We can do it! We can! (What will it be?) "Show the lyrics
for five seconds!" (All right!) (Yay!) (Shown only for five seconds) Only your own part. (Here come the lyrics)
(One, two, three!) (Focus) (Focus) (Focus) (Time's up!) (Five seconds over) Wait. What just happened? (Feeling sorry) (Team Bobby Brown's 7th try) ♪ We were happy ♪ (Oh!) ♪ And she left my side ♪ (I knew it) (Yes, wrong) (Realized the lyrics after seven tries) (Oh, come on!) Let's go!

(The culprit apologizes) - Let's do this!
- Let's do our best! ♪ I was left alone ♪ ♪ I tried to forget her ♪ (Good, good) (Bam!) ♪ She was really pretty ♪ (I knew it! part.2) (9th try failed)
Is it "was so pretty?" "So?" "So pretty?" (So confusing! :'() (Team Bobby Brown check
their lyrics before their last try) "So I was so sad."
(So I was sadder) "So I was so sad?" (Is that right?) - Maybe it's "really sad."
- "Really sad." (Okay, "really sad") Please, "Replay!"
(Last hint before 10th try) Let's make at least ten points. We might get "Switch Seats." (What is Team Bobby Brown's last hint?) (Final hint: Reveal one verse) (Excited)
Which verse? - Which one?
- How about yours? - Do you know mine?
- I don't. - If I know yours, I'll know mine.
- Mine, then. "So I was sadder." - It must be "She was so pretty."
- "So I was sadder." ("And? "She?") No, that's not it. (The hint was unhelpful...) (Can we do this?)
I don't know. Just do it. (Almost giving up)
I don't know. Let's just... - Trust our hearts.
- Yeah, try our best. Start!

We'll show the lyrics. - Yes, please.
- Is it done? (Checking lyrics)
It's "The stars shone in the sky." (I'm guilty)
I'm sorry. We were so close! "The stars shone in the sky." (Only now do they get the lyrics) - So hard.
- I really don't know. It's confusing. Stay tuned.

See? Switch seats. (The others allow
Team Madonna to pick again) (Switch mics)

Good job, TZUYU! (50 points for Team Michael Jackson) - Team Madonna, 198 points.
- How do you beat that? Team Bobby Brown, also 198 points. Team Michael Jackson
just won 50 points, which adds up to 545 points. (Feels great to be first!) Shall we move on to the next game? TIME TO TWICE! (CHAEYOUNG is MC for Round 2)
Next, we have "TWICE in Silence." (Fired up) You'll wear headphones
