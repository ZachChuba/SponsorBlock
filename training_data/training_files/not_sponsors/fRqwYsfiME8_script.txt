this is an O Lord this is a wobbler and these are Steinmetz solids and they all have one thing in common they all roll with a constant center of mass but that's where the similarities end let's get started [Music] how's it going guys Angus here from makers muse many of you will be well aware of my descent into madness that is the creation of objects that roll I've made so many of them but they aren't just conventional forms there are all weird shapes that roll in some form or another several weeks ago I produced a range of these objects known as spirit cons and the response was incredible many of you suggested amazing other shapes I should try out so that's what this video is all about starting with this thing generally known as a wobbler the wobbler makes a great toy for kids and is geometrically the simplest out of the lineup I would say it's a modification of a cylinder where the form has been cut through at an angle to form these wobbly wheels the wobble is still rolls smoothly because the angled wheels can balance each other and the center of mass reigns along the axle and they're slanted and they're now big ovals but looking at a side view reveals that they're actually still a true circular shape this particular wobbler was 3d printed using poly alchemy elixir PLA in nightshade purple it's definitely one of my favorite colors at the moment and gives us a wonderful shimmering effect as it rolls a next roll in curiosity is the O lead even the name sounds exotic this one was the most suggested object after the spiricon in the last video and it's easy to see why at surface level it does not look like it should roll at all and even if it does roll it doesn't look like it should roll in a straight line but that's exactly what it does boys were discovered by Paul shots in 1929 so they've been around for quite some time which is interesting because I actually had quite a lot of difficulties 3d modeling the Oh Lord I'm not 100% happy with my I used lofts to create it and the O Lord is known as a developable surface which means it can be flattened down onto a 2d plane so you can actually make this from paper you'd get a 2d net and you can fold up an O Lord but that means every point of its surface touches the the 2d plane that's rolling on as it rolls so it has to be modeled perfectly to work correctly the center distance between the two circular sectors is critical in my attempts at using lofts and fusion 360 as I said gave me this shape it does roll but it doesn't roll out nearly as smoothly as I would like in the meantime however I came across this design created by Wild Rose builds it's a simpler take on the oled shape and it does roll a lot better so i'll link his design down below go check it out he also has a video as well showing it rolling but Angus I hear you say what if I don't have a 3d printer I really need one of these things in my life one of these Oh loads well I have good news for you check this out this is a handcrafted stainless steel Oh Lloyd it's heavy and quite frankly feels amazing in your hand it's got so much more mass than the 3d printed versions which means it rolls a lot more satisfyingly it's got a lot more mass and inertia to it when you roll it the team over it run in factory on Amazon set this across to me after seeing the spheric on video and you can get your own below it definitely makes the ultimate desktop accessory and paperweight and it just looks absolutely incredible kind of thing I would imagine if I was like a high-end CEO this would be my my paperweight it would be it would be on my desk holding down all my my contracts and purchase agreements something like that anyway next on our list of crazy rolling objects is the Steinmetz solid or rather Steinmetz solids because there's a few variations similar to our wobbler you start with a cylinder however the steinmetz solid is created through the intersection of two or more cylinders of equal size you can do it twice three times or as many as you like quite frankly from a variety of different angles each additional cylinder provides a new surface that the object can roll in a discreet manner so I find the two cylinder overlap the most elegant shape in my opinion it's known as a bi cylinder Wow a name that actually makes sense for once the BI cylinder is super cool because in an ideal world it's locked to two rotational axes of movement kind of like our 3d printers have like an you know an x and a y movement this can only roll in an X or a Y it's got a sort of pillowed look to it from the front looks like a square but then from those axes it looks like a circle I have been racking my brain to try to think of some kind of game or maybe a wheel design or mechanism using the BI cylinder I haven't thought of anything significant yet but if you have any suggestions please do let me know in the comments below adding another cylinder to it creates a tri cylinder as you would guess to be honest the tri cylinders somewhat redundant it still rolls in those discrete directions it just means that there's another option opportunity to roll at 90-degree intersections rather than 180 degrees making this 3d printable was quite challenging there's actually various quadrants that lock together to an internal core whereas the BI cylinder was just two pieces a lot simpler you can go absolutely nuts with adding additional intersecting cylinders of all sorts of angles to get different effects however like I said I think the BI cylinder has a simple elegance to it which I quite like this is my favourite steinmetz solid in the lineup and as a bonus guys I've done a few additional Spiricom prints since the last video this is a 200% scaled modified hex aspheric on printed with end spools so like bits of film and I had lying around which were quite short I'd mix and match them on my pressure mark 3 it's got some filament some gold happens I think it's called some just generic white and red pas from unknown brands and it just looks delicious and I couldn't figure out why it looked delicious till someone pointed out that it's got the same colors as candy corn yeah that would make sense that's why it looks like I want to eat it this is definitely going to become a prop for the set finally I've been combining my love of puzzles and strange rolling objects lately with the exosphere akan 3x3 puzzle even seen my video on this definitely go check it out I have this whole anything to 3x3 video where you can turn any shape into our 3x3 twisty puzzle and this is fully 3d printed and it even rolls like the original hex aspheric on which is a this bad boy here so it's the same design just turned into a a 3x3 twisty puzzle all the files in this video will be linked in a video description and if you did enjoy this video guys maybe consider subscribing to make his music this might aim to empower your creativity through technology and I'd love to have your board so guys until next time I look forward to seeing again very shortly here on makers muse catch you later bye
