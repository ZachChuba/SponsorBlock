what's up guys welcome back to the channel and welcome back to another video so the tesla traffic light and stop sign control beta only works when you're an autopilot and was really only good if you're going in a straight line through local roads with no turns whatsoever because it can't turn of course i really wanted to put it to the test to see how long i can go in a straight line without having to correct or interfere with the system besides giving it their approval to go through certain intersections so in this video we're gonna go about four to five miles from downtown l.a to korean town because i'm going to get my hair cut finally and really see a full self driving and the tesla autopilot system can make it all the way there there's only one turn that we need to make or one turn at one of the intersections that we need to make we're going to see if autopilot can get there without any mistakes whatsoever let's get into the video and if you're wondering what this is this is for my dogs i have two corgis they sit in the back here we just went to santa barbara a couple weekends ago so they sit in the back here so this is to try and protect the back seat from here but you can kind of see it doesn't really do that great of a job but i guess it's better than nothing i did make a video on this and all the other tips and tricks that if you have dogs or any sort of pet or animals or kids you want to put in the back there you want to make sure they listen to these tips and tricks or in these settings that you set in the tesla i'll put a link in the description or above so you can check out that video any of that please hit that subscribe so in terms of what version this is this is version 10.2 2020.20.112 it's not the latest version i do have one i need to update and download but i haven't done that yet this is full self driving with hardware 3. it is telling me that i should take the highway but i'm going to take the local road because to get there we're going to be going straight most of the time being and then make one turn and then going straight again for a total of about 4.5 miles for the whole trip so once we get past this light i'm going to turn on autopilot with full self driving and then we should see how it does to the traffic lights this is going to be my longest drive so far using the stop sign and traffic light feature feature so far and if you've tried it or if you tried it and you like it right so basically there's two ways to engage autopilot or full stuff driving through any of the lights it's going to stop automatically whether it's a green light or a red light and to have it continue through the light you either tap on the accelerator or hit the drive stock down for it to give the permission to go so i'm not going to touch the accelerator or brake or try not to touch it this whole entire time but instead i'm just going to hit the traffic stop down for for it to go through the lights all right so it's turned green my light just turned green so i hit the stock down and it's continuing through the light i definitely think it's going to glitch at least once during this whole drive i can't imagine it won't glitch at all we're running pretty slow right here about 25 miles an hour but the light up there is red so people hopefully won't get too upset be honest there is like a three-way merge right here down to two lanes so we'll see if autopilot or full self driving can navigate this without any glitches so here's the section this car on the right is going to merge in these cars already going to merge into my lane i forgot for a second there that i have to hit the accelerator to engage it so i'm going to i just hit it and it went through the light i also have to remember i need to do that every single light it just changed it to 35 miles an hour the speed limit but then what happened was this light was green so i tapped the stalk down to have it continue to go through the light but then it noticed immediately right after that it was a red light so now it just stopped at the light okay so this is interesting now it's saying autopilot unable to proceed please take over the system is still engaged in autopilot but i guess when the light turned green is just not going to do anything at all so let's see what happens okay so even though it told me to take over i just hit the stock on the green light and it's proceeding through the light okay so this that was a pretty sharp turn to the right it's freaking out a little bit it thinks this is a okay and that was interesting basically right there there was no stop sign but it detected the stop sign that was across the way and it just came to a complete stop even though the car behind me also came to a stop he must be super frustrated like why are you stopping completely so now there's a car right here that's turning to the right and i've already signaled to go through a light and it just slowly went through the light after that car pulled to the right so so far it's pretty nerve-wracking i would say it's kind of making its way by on its own but it's uh it's kind of glitching it's detecting really everything in all the intersections and stopping and being really conservative i guess you have to understand the logic on when each time it's going to stop predict that it's going to stop and then just try and give it the notion or give it the action so that it can go through so right now it detects this light but i'm just going to hit the stock so that it goes through it's kind of trying to figure out where the intersection here it's confused a little bit almost looked like it was going to get behind that rav4 and stop behind it because it's trying to follow this bus the bus isn't best to follow behind because it always stops to the side of it so it's never going to really uh pull to the right of it to the left of it so i just took over because it would basically is going to wait for that bus forever until it would actually proceed so now we're going to throw it back into autopilot and it's going to stop at this light right here so we've already once we've had to take over autopilot because it would have just waited beyond behind that bus the whole entire way that's one thing to keep in mind if you are in autopilot on local roads and you're behind a bus and the bus decides to pull over to pick up some passengers the alpine system isn't smart enough to go around the bus it's just going to wait in that line or wait behind the bus forever until the bus goes and really that's for any car that is kind of that pulls to the side like this garbage truck right here i bet it's not going to go around it it's going to slowly kind of that was really close okay that was probably too close for my comfort i took over the last second basically autopilot was trying to figure out should it pass on the left or should it kind of just like squeeze as close as possible and decide at the last it looked like it decided the last second was going to squeeze on by very closely and i just had to take over because it just looked like way too close okay so here again i'm taking over because we do not want to be waiting behind that bus this whole time probably the right lane is not the best to do this in local ride roads so we've already had to take over the autopilot twice if not three times i'm gonna try and stay in the left lane for the rest of this trip at least on the straight way and just throw it in alpine see what happens so this one is going to be interesting because it is in a passing intersection but it kind of curves to the left okay autopilot is not going to be good in l.a local roads maybe it's just l.a local roads but it is the third time or fourth time i've taken over the autopilot system it basically was kind of going through the intersection and curving to the left but then the car on the coming the other way was making a left turn across us and autopilot recognized the car at the last second braked as kind of a hesitation and then i basically took over and we went through that intersection so autopilot or the traffic light and stop sign control on local roads is still very glitchy i would say you'd still be very cognizant of how you're driving and navigating to the roads so it's probably only really good in kind of that it's kind of the same thing with alpine with the really empty really empty local roads or roads that don't have a lot going on uh unlike la which has just as a lot going on in los angeles but probably that countryside roads with the light the traffic lights where it can just stop you can kind of give it the confirmation to go through or you can wait at the light okay so the light just turned green i signaled all by it so it can go through the intersection pretty smooth it was actually actually it was kind of jerky on the acceleration there you can see my head kind of lurched back a little bit it looks like where it's going to be a yellow light right here there's no one behind me so i'm not going to try and run it and we are coming to a complete stop increase okay green light hit the stock down on the drive stock so that you can proceed through the light uh pretty smoothly there there is a car behind me there is another traffic light that is coming up its sprint okay so that car just went across the intersections and autopilot recognized it so it started to break it breaks pretty heavily and suddenly and now we're stopping at this light pretty smooth and that's it green light again so i hit the stock so they can accelerate that acceleration was actually much smoother than the ones before not too sudden there is a car in front of us and the light is red so autopilot's gonna stop it's already detected the light even though it's more than 500 feet away i would say and it's just going to slowly come to a stop okay so now it's green again so i hit the stock down so that it can go through the light we have another about 0.6 miles before the next turn this car is turning left it is a green line in front of me i'm just going to kind of wait behind it but now it's a red light so i'm going to stay that's cool so on the visualization screen there you saw some pedestrians walk by and before if i remember the pedestrians would kind of have to be in like a standing position and we kind of flowed on by but now you can kind of see or the screen would show them walking slowly across the screen okay so there's another intersection i hit the drive stock to confirm it to go through now it's going through the light pretty smoothly okay autopilot has already detected another traffic light or intersection 400 feet it is a red so i'm just gonna let it come to a complete stop okay the light turned green that was a little bit uh aggressive i would say you can see my head kind of lurch back there going 19 miles an hour looks like we are stopping these cars are turning left i've given it the signal that the light is still green so it's going to slowly go through the intersection in about 0.2 miles i'm going to make a right into the neck straightaway to see how it does but so far we've already taken over the autopilot system at least three to four times because it's either glitched out or just freaked out completely here's another intersection i've given it the go ahead and it's going to go across so now i'm going to turn off autopilot because we're going to make a right at this light and for our final straight away for another mile and what looks like a 1.2 miles for the rest of the trip okay made the right turn there we're gonna get into autopilot there we go i can i just engaged autopilot and it breaks pretty heavily right after looks like autopilot has already detected the traffic light ahead of us it is a green all right so autopilot did not detect that unfortunately it looks like it the system was just gonna lurch into that car even though the car pulled ahead and it just completely didn't stop at all okay it is a green so i just hit the stock down and it's going to accelerate slowly through the light there i can't seem to figure out sometimes it accelerates really fast and sometimes it just accelerates really slowly once you kind of give it that permission to accelerate from a stop the autopilot has detected the light and it's come to another complete stop okay so the light turned green we're making it through here i don't think the rest of the trip we should be able to we should run into any issues at all uh we're in the left lane so one thing so one thing we quickly realized is that the traffic light and stop sign control or really it's the autopilot on local roads does not do well if you're in the right lane or you're behind a bus or any vehicle that likes to make sudden stops or pullovers to the side because the autopilot will take the conservative route and it won't pass that vehicle would just way behind the vehicle or it'll try and sneak by it really closely and you might damage your car uh or your vehicle okay so we're just running to the car today that bus decided it was just going to slowly start making its its way into my lane pretty aggressively so i just decided to take over and accelerate past it oh man maybe it's just today people are the bus drivers in la are just super aggressive on the local roads they just i mean i guess i would too if i was driving such a huge vehicle so autopilot has detected the light we come to a stop uh there is a car in front of us and we'll wait for the green light before we give it the confirmation to go through the intersection comment below i'd love to hear what you think all right so it is a green light i'm gonna hit this stock i feel like it's the it's a little delayed from when i hit the stock and when i give that confirmation to go to the intersection and it starts to accelerate maybe it's probably just being conservative on the gap in needs between the car in front of me and my car i feel like it's just a little delayed all right so this is another section here intersection here i just hit the stock and it's going to go through looks like we're going to get to our destination and about 0.3 miles to finally get my haircut so that's where i'm going to go ahead and at all love to hear your thoughts all right guys i'll see you in the next one see ya you
