i've ever done a dk strip uh solo we're on their second trip and uh so far the setup is going pretty well hoping that we can uh sustain this however what is that a loop half of a key i want that i think i'm good like this i think we're set up boys i think we're set up let's hope but i was wondering is your computer set up against data breaches i've been partnered with surfshark for over a year on twitch now and we thought it'd be a good time to include the people on youtube if you don't know surfshark it's a vpn or a virtual private network by this point i believe all of you know what a vpn is but let me tell you why i use it a couple of weeks ago i wanted to watch the netflix documentary leaving neverland however it's not available in belgium netflix so i open surfshark click literally two buttons and i'm in the uk ready to watch the documentary i also always put surf shark on when i'm on the public mcdonald's or starbucks wi-fi because i don't want anyone breaching my data there's a windows and a mobile phone app which are both incredibly easy to use also a very good selling point for people in the stream was that with surfshark you can connect unlimited devices simultaneously this is the only vpn that does this they've also got extra products like the surfshark alert which allows you to scan your email credit card id to check if it's ever been breached with the link in the description you'll get 83 off for a total of 27 months 24 months plus three for free so if you calculate this it costs less than two dollars a month to get it also there's a 30 day money back guarantee so it doesn't hurt to try as i've said i've been talking about this on stream for a while now and 32 of the trailer trash boys actually picked it up and are still rocking with it truthfully this is the best deal within the vpn market and if you need one i strongly recommend surf shark the link is in the description muscular the task coming in this is going to be close barely any prayer left i don't know whether i should flick eagle eye probably a little safer ah we'll be fine we have 31 prey right this was i think we started at 94 this trip so a quick mass [ __ ] yeah 40 no 47 kill trip i think don't quote me on that i don't know math man that was too fast i was flicking and all that don't blame me all right 47 kill trip i'm gonna call it i i think that's right we can exactly if we get the amount the same amount of kills next trip we can complete the task in three trips which is super clean um i should not bring my zelda pit because that's kind of scary because if i get the pet of my inventories full then well gg pet but uh it's going well let me do these two clues and then get back on it here are the two clues from the dks let's see if we can get anything good oh yes that's my first pair of ancient i mean blessed eyed boots and i needed that for i think raids or something it is most of the time even a better option than uh ranger boots that's great and also a good one sarah doman i can use those for armadill no i don't i need sammy damn it whatever still great still good what's the elite clue obviously worse but you know i like my tooth halves because we're getting really close to a hundred crystal keys so i'm not too mad about that 100 enhanced crystal key video coming up soon what dragon x first loot we've gotten oh horrible not gray i mean i've already got to so not really needed no archer's ring yet the dk kosk is done we've got about 50 45 kc on all the dk's now last drop is an adam and x not great two two nine kc on rex no rings only one dragon axe to show for it hopefully we get another one because i absolutely love that task and one more task and we're into high scores for all dks so that's going to be nice too to add two more bosses to the high scores of the heart requirement and there is 95 attack is it a combat level no not yet but hey i'm going to get some just in the clan chat just only three four okay five i got five jesus i'm happy on the road to our first melee 99 i think attack is going to be before strength we're almost 94 strength too yeah blood vessel toss not much more to say next clip a hard clue i don't even know from what i got this i'm kind of confused oh yeah the blood felds right the bloodville task i just got we're getting 61k firelighters went up in price this is still a trash clue holy because the old-school runescape hd update the fire light is went up in price but apparently not enough that's for sure 61k let's do the smoke devil task the final step of this hard clue that we're about to complete is talk to osiak and people always say talk to oseak if you want rng hey have you talked to oziak before you got this drop it is the definite final step of this clue so if this doesn't give us third age i don't know what ever will these are two clues from the smoke devil task i am on right now and my god i would be lying if i'm not feeling any third age right now there we go the two most beautiful caskets i think that's already like the second elite blue third heart clue today if if only i could get this many clues on the clue man that'd be great all right here we go we're starting off with the hard which is trash but oh zach not only blessed our hard clue okay the three rune daggers what the [ __ ] it's gonna be an elite masterpiece okay a lot of daggers in those clues five of them to be exact maybe it's time to jump into the herblore stack in my bank yeah sometimes i say herblore sometimes i say herb lord deal with it uh here we go we're at narda and i bought a bunch of vials of water and i'm pretty sure uh zahur can make me a bunch of unfinished potions there we go that was four mil i didn't expect it to be that much that's crazy but we got a bunch of unfinished potions now i'll dive into my bank and actually use all the swamp tar i got from zara on my higher landers now and after i'm done with that i'll start collecting the secondaries of all these herbs i got i guess at least i got 86 banked and with 86 i can boost up to 90 for super combat pots which i really really really really want because i hate using these especially since i've been doing dks lately uh it's been pretty annoying to be using uh the strength and attack bots anyway let me dive into these and we'll see what level i get heart clue whoo sarah nominated body i believe that is a dupe however i think i do have that one yeah i do it's not the worst and also another scroll book which i've also got plenty of now 555k on that hard clue that is not bad that's why hard clues are probably the best clues next to mediums i know i'm jumping to everywhere i was doing herb blur i was doing slayer all that was but arrest 94 shout out to you just dropped 58 subscriptions to my twitch stream which means he basically can tell me whatever to do now because i am at his mercy and he told me to finally get a maxed house i've got i've had 75 construction for the last years my house has looked like [ __ ] i've barely upgraded it i don't have a jewelry box i don't have a portal nexus that's properly done and i don't have a good pool and i'm constantly complaining about it so eris just yielded some money at me and said do it now so that's what we're doing for the next two days the only thing i'm focusing on is 84 construction all right this should finish the 500th contract which is pretty impressive almost 2000 points we're 82 construction one more level to go and then the lost level i'm probably going to get by doing winter talk to 99 fire making and i'm hoping to get enough construction xp from 93 to 99 to get 83 to 84 construction so i can actually build my maxed out house now i don't have really have the money oh no don't drop the plank sack i don't really have the money to build my max house i only have like five mil left so that's not ideal however when we finally run out of these mahogany's i'm probably gonna do mithril cape uh mithril mythic cape mythical kate when we finally run out of these mahogany's i'm gonna do some mythical cape rex which i think is best xp or something or moist efficient xp per blank something like that but we're also very close to 2000 points so i can finally get the carpenter outfit and with that carpenter outfit i'm happy to stop doing mahogany homes and actually get some housework done because then i will feel efficient because i get 2.5 percent more xp little update on the herb lore in between the construction grind i am now 84 herblore getting closer to 85 and i'm making my terramin potions my serum 207s which if you guys don't know actually are one tickable this is why i saved all my ashes from book i can't talk anymore this is why i saved all my ashes from cerberus uh because they're so fast to make and they're actually really good xp and you have a billion terramins anyway from i'm misclicking everything i have a billion terms anyway from miscellaneous so why not use them on the ashes you get from cerberus because they're noted anyway and any other ashes i picked up along the way i got a total of 1 100 ashes or something and 3 000 something terramins so i'm not even close to breaking even on those it's still a good amount of xp it's about the same because they're one tickable than the big potions so i'm gonna continue hopefully get 85 soon this is probably the last level i'll get with the supplies i have and i'm kind of lazy to get the rest of the secondaries however i'll still do it this episode i'm definitely getting 86. i'm on my last batch of wine of zamoraks and stuff like that and i have a couple more taramine potions to make and then we are done with everything we still have 1 146 cadent tines that i think the white berries for so i don't know how i'm going to get that maybe do a couple of keras tasks or something while we're doing slayer anyway i got to pick up a bunch of dragon scales still and the biggest problem is going to be the meyer fungus there's not really a problem it's just annoying to get but yeah i'ma open up my miscellaneous in a little bit see what we get from like three weeks of not opening that it's gonna be a good amount of renaress so we can get back on the prayer pots but just want to keep you updated on the 85 herb lore one more level until the level i want this episode we'll get that for sure soon let's get back to construction i'm about to get six hour logs but this is the last contract i need for 2 000 points i got to be really quick here i'm about to get six hour long 30 seconds uh barbara please yeah baby 2003 points and we'll buy the carpenter outfit right after we log out hey we're not even logging out who did it yeah i guess i'll just manually log out then okay the carpenter outfit is now mine i don't know how much it does i don't know if it's actually super worth it or not but um it's nice to have it's four bank slots but i'll probably store it in my house eventually well we'll uh do the last couple of xps 50k until 83 and then i'm done for a little bit we've done this all in one go uh so far 873k is going to be 900k xp today so that's really nice let's get this lost level and upgrade the house after that 83 construction we're finally done crystal saw will boost plus three stool boost plus five that means we can finally make the biggest pool at this level 90 construction and i couldn't be more happy a seven hour eight hour grind or something from 77 to 83 so it was quite all right still we're finally done we didn't do one freaking go i'm pretty proud of myself and the stream for helping me out because all alone i couldn't have done it so thank you guys very much let's upgrade the house i found something in the bank i still need a lot of money for my house and i found some onyx bolt tips so i made some onyx bolts which are 8.1 k alks which is insane so for the next little bit i'm going to be alking these guys and doing some agility as usual now as you guys probably know pretty recently the roon light hd came out this is what it looks like in my settings it really does make a lot of skills a lot more enjoyable don't worry in videos i'm not going to be using hd it will always be sd but i just want to let you know that on my stream twitch.tv slash only underscore trails or when i'm doing agility and stuff like this i will probably be using hd just because it looks a lot better and it makes skills like agility just a lot more fun because you've got something to look at but for bossing and all that stuff i will probably keep it off because the plug-in is still in beta and it could always crash on you so i don't want to risk that on the hardcore of course but the clue man will also not be playing on hd just want to let you know that i do use it i do like it you will never probably see it in videos unless maybe i bring backseat boy back or another series where hd would be very nice to have anyway let's switch back over to the gpu there we go it's weird to adapt your eyes to that and i'll see you in the next clip but we're done with all of this and we're upgrading our house all right it's time to make the pool a pool i've never ever had oh i need to boost my air blur first of course where's my botanical pot there we go and we need a plus five for the jewelry box indeed in a plus four for the pool because the saw boosts plus three and then with stews you can boost up to five uh what else do i need for this pool um to your garden i need five golden leaves i also completely missed it and have a hundred days on the account which is unfortunate that i missed it but actually pretty cool to see which is i think that's 2400 hours if i'm not mistaken if i'm if my maths is still okay and there's 24 hours in a day that is 2 400 hours on the hardcore and it's looking pretty good i'm really happy with how it's looking lately it's in the best state that it's ever been i hope it really doesn't die anywhere soon because there's so much stuff i can do i can basically kill every single boss now inferno is on the horizon i'm really really loving playing this account so i hope it doesn't die anytime soon i would greatly appreciate it if because could just stay away for now and uh i can just run back and be a happy boy the obelisk is right there boys we're almost safe this is the deepest will they can get as long as we don't teleport to level 44 we should be chilling we can be out i really should stop doing this fully on stream because everyone could just log in and find out my world and kill me especially since that was malty but hey imagine a building being crowded am i right okay i'm gonna that that toxic comment is gonna make it so that i will die to a peak gear in the wilderness this is how the heart runs yes sir there we go max jewelry box and that is it for the house oh no i still have to get trollheim teleports but the portal nexus is there we've got a bunch of teleports barrows raider manor lumbridge west ardy falador carolyn lunar these are the best ones from me because i hate getting the fellow on ancients that's why that's in there and a bunch the rest is mainly for clues all i need still is trollheim which i'm going to get the salts for right now these two are the wilty portals i'm going to let them stay there i don't want to delete that room and it frees up a little bit of spot in the nexus got the full pool and uh yes we're ready i'm not going to build the salter i'm just gonna go for double deceptors eventually when i go for 99 thieving so i'm going to leave that there but apart from that it's pretty much maxed i want to say let's get those trollheim teleports and then we're done all right i realized i only have 33 more music tracks to get so i'm just gonna go in order and i'm gonna try and just get the music cape real quick this shouldn't take too long i know how scary this is i gotta enter and then telly out instantly okay get in the hell out of here man no get away from me hydra okay that's that one done all right another scary one coming in get me out of here next buddy sugar rush oh no oh that's for trimmed i don't need those i don't need those chicken out evil chicken layer oh this is a narus isn't it all right it's quickly time to get both of the wilderness music tracks so we can get the music at the end of this episode first thing we're doing is the revenant caves which should be right here what 100k all right i guess oh out of here 100k free music track whatever we'll uh we'll keep moving now the other ones is the wilderness slayer cave which is all the way on the west okay the problem here is that it's in multi so i gotta watch out chaos temple not the greatest place to be it's multi-combat i don't think i do those clues either way slayer caves should be down here and that's both willy tracks done there's the shards for the vault uh where is the vault i know how to get in there um this is the almost penultimate music track i only have a fire cape to get give it to the inferno i'll get into more old wreck and then jump into the inferno and then i should be done yes don't ask me again i don't know what i'm do do i try and complete this or something it's like the pokemon gym where you have to stand on those tiles that have the forward thing does anyone know what i'm talking about and then you'd like spin around the whole room all those pokemon puzzles what the [ __ ] they're healing oh crap oh my god stop healing is that fake i'm confused is he actually getting healed or not it's been a year since i've dyed a jet i would have been so pissed because i'm not on slayer tusk is he actually getting healed or not no it's a glitch god damn it that messed me up dude this is kind of dreadful not on slayer task i'm not gonna lie but there it is that is jad done beautifulness thank to 91 bro i've not failed chad in years literal years let me get the moral wreck uh show my cape and then jump into the inferno to sacrifice the cape and then we can get the beautiful music egg now to get this music cape trimmed we need to get all the holiday songs too but those i'll do later because obviously no holidays currently and i have done almost zero holiday events the only one i've done is the runescape anniversary one no easter no christmas so let's exchange the fire cape and we jump into the inferno this place will be seen relatively soon for some practice runs yeah we'll be doing some practice runs i i don't want to say soon but it won't take another five months after the league i definitely have to get another inferno camp in the league maybe it might be time to start doing the inferno on the hardcore and i think it's the man over here i want to say fallow the bard but that's not true it's mr olaf the bard who is going to give us the music cape about that music cape uh you don't know all the music in the land what do you what what do i still have to do then that's christmas love is mine oh [ __ ] all right that's done i actually have to fix the whole uh museum camp and everything to get into the volcanic mine i forgot money didn't i oh everything is standing in my way to get this music game and here we finally go we got the music cape it is absolute peak fashion scape and i'll let you guys in on a little secret i've got the perfect outfit in the back for this cape boys feast your eyes on this guy man this is such good fashion scape it's insane i even voice cracked how good it is look at that necessary emote with that air guitar uh is this skill keeping with the same one oh that's just the air guitar remote look at how sick i look man back in 2005 people would have been riling up behind me following me across the world just because this fashion scape is so peak anyway boys that was it for the hardcore video i hope you
