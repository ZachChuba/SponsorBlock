what if the Titans get a win this weekend it's really possible I think you mentioned it earlier they do kind of have the team of destiny feel right now they do that no one has given them any shot whatsoever to win either one of their games so far and they've they've physically dominated both games how about Doc hey like physical yeah dude rushed for over 180 yards of it yeah yeah it's runner attention you're he stiff-armed Earl Thomas so hard he turned him into his only daughter it was amazing I think that second one he did because Earl Thomas said that we're not gonna be scared to hit it like I think even only even remembered that was like oh yeah I thought I if I heard so I thought you guys he's in it what do you do to him you dive at his legs I tried to I one time I went to tackle Antonio Cromartie and Cromartie runs high knees me drive I mean he's a sprinter Antonio Cromartie was a sprinter that's why he was such a good return as he can get fast he could get his fastest very quickly he was just riding out here at a hole and I want to tackle him right up high one sack of my pie and I slid down to his knees mine he ended up down but I thought I might get CTE just from that I couldn't even fathom my Derrick Henry trying but it would be a what do you do he's what you doing the guy he's playing so good that they're winning and Tannehill is throwing for 70 and 80 yards a game no mistakes no mistake can help no mistakes here we'll take one shot maybe we'll take another one we'll get it out of your hands a little bit so we can open up but just know what we're doing here okay let's head back there let's feed him how have they not paid him yet hey and on the other side how long all year we've said you know Mark Jackson cannot throw the ball 59 times when when I walked in to get up this morning I was reminded that my big take after Lamar became Lamar right after them like week whatever eight probably he became a more like Lamar started becoming Lamar Jackson like captivating the world right was that week eight maybe weeks I was actually Kate after they lost to the Browns I think they were doing - yeah seven or eight in that I think like week eight is what had happened and that was after he said that he he didn't like running anymore because people were just calling him a running back so he took that personally that they weren't complimenting his throwing ability which was also good so he and Greg Roman were throwing the ball over 40 times a game there for a little bit they had like 45 or 49 attempts or something like that and they lost those games and then after that they decided they became this offense where they were utilizing what only one human probably in the history of the game had which was his incredible decision-making ability throwing and on top of that the ability to have 10 blockers in the best runner on the field with the ball which was the mark Jackson in the road that it may became must-see television and they got hot they got home-field advantage and all that stuff and then when they got behind just a little bit it almost felt like they wanted a desperation mode felt like they had to air it out it felt like they just got desperate it's like you're gonna you can score you can score 40 points right now it doesn't matter how much your mind you guys could score on anybody or maybe this is just the Titans defense being so stingy up front that they didn't think they could move at all I mean maybe it could be that I guess but for me it felt like they fifty nine times is like it's literally the seventh most pass attempted game in the history of the NFL playoffs Ben Roethlisberger hasn't even thrown that many times in a playoff game Eli Manning hasn't thrown that many times in a playoff game he's up there like next like Steve Young Drew Brees I forget who already knows Manning pastor's got you know what it's like just guys it throw Brady was up there guys have just thrown it's like you guys had so much success doing something else just because you hit a little controversy doesn't mean you have to change that I don't know I'm like too wrong but that just felt like that might have been a mistake Diggs during the regular season they were eight of eight on fourth and one they were Owen too on Saturday night like and and they were not good on third and short either that was pretty much the difference in the game hey you kicked that field will man yeah you keep the a you keep you got Justin Tucker man let him get some shine actually I respect the fact that they stayed with that they've been doing that all year correct mm-hmm it was like Tennessee finally managed to make Baltimore doubt themselves yeah and they changed like this like this right because I'm are still got loose he was still running a little bit but it wasn't the same it didn't feel like with the same Authority it felt like more like you said out of desperation than out of it you know enforcing their will on the opponent and even his balls I yeah is still an incredible game by Lamar but I just feel like those should have been reversed almost like fifty nine runs the Titan the Titans - they were stacking the box though they were putting eight nine guys up there yeah but that didn't matter all year mmm you know I mean all year everybody knew that was gonna happen Lamar was just making people miss I also don't love that they does that drop picked I mean they probably score there right that that that's wrong but skip off his finger picked they probably go in and score there and we're having a completely different conversation so I mean it got to the point this year where if there was an incompletion from the Marge axon like I thought something was wrong you know I mean he's playing seven on seven every ball there was no balls on the ground I mean very rarely was there any balls on the ground he would only throw away like 20 times a game but it was like 20 completions - it was there was a lotta and yesterday there was like maybe a six inches off and that thing gets picked off they're gonna go score there if that doesn't happen whole different ball game but the Tennessee Titans defense very very good well hello there get $20 off your first order from CT now back to the magic I mean very very good if you can run the ball and stop the run you went into playoffs that's been the same forever and the Tennessee Titans are proving that do you think the fact that they played in very few close games this year ended up kind of biting them in the ass cuz they just they just weren't used to like that I mean that they were used to just beating the hell out of everybody get you know with the exception of like two or three games you know I don't know about the close game win thing but I think that I think taking off a couple weeks mm-hmm I don't know man I just don't know how was on a team that rested right I was on Team we went 40 nano and then decided to lose last two games by benching Peyton and everybody after they play like a quarter they were playing the first game they played like a quarter and they came out last and played like a drive and came out and then we had to buy a week and then we play and then we made all the way to the Super Bowl and lost to the Saints and I always wondered like if we lose that first game is it immediately the bye weeks blame because we were really really good just like the boss marine it's really really good and you decide to sit out it's like did you walk away from a heater like should you have walked away from here not going to buy week you earn the bye week by being great stuff like that but that last week they completely rested and if it works if they win right now we don't talk about it at all but since they did it you have to be like what happened was there a little bit of rust was there a little bit off for these two you know maybe their bodies got comfortable for a week off and you know what I mean it's just like you never know you just you have to second-guess everything especially whenever your wins cure everything so when you lose it has to get questioned this thing might have forced Mark Ingram to like us Edwards averaged 7 yards of carry on Saturday night like forcing an injured Mark Ingram think you would rather have the 100% running back versus Mark Ingram did not look like himself hey Eddie George said Eddie George said he might be good now then as soon as he tweaks it it's over yep and I think that's what happened and I don't like that Mark Ingram was hurt for these two games he was explosive and exciting to watch this year and I enjoyed do you know the personality at the postgame press conference I enjoyed all of that but he is a vital part of that but Gus Edwards proved to be very viable I mean that's good news for them especially in a running team if you have a couple running backs are good good news for you I'm variable to never lose his member what's that Ravens gonna have to lose his member no no no he didn't say if we win I will no no I know Superbowl no yeah but he said he would to win us I think that is a misconception going around there's a lot of people like T's and peas for Amy Taylor the one is said you're gonna cut that thing off after the game I saw it what did it what an electric environment downer Remo talks trash to his own team to the other team I mean he he is electric then there's those videos I don't know if they come out this year where he was wearing boxing gloves at practice like going at that guy's that's like that whole team is like I feel like they are mm-hmm like I think that whole team's ready to go like you know if let's say for instance your friend is gonna get in a fight a parking lot and you're like sending out bird calls that are gonna join you to go fight the whoever's gonna be there I feel like the Titans are a group of humans and if they showed up they would all be ready to go like I think they're all they all have that like rables mentality I think has taken over the entire team and I'm not saying that these guys weren't like this before they got there I think the people that Vrabel has brought men and has got there are very similar minded individuals when it comes to competition is him and I'm a big fan of it to be honest I am I'm a big fan yeah I'll cut off my penis to win a Super Bowl yeah I got five kids I've already won a Super Bowl before I mean as Marino has it was Super Bowl mm-hmm then I feel like I had an okay career I was a half away from winning the Super Bowl never wants a pool he's already won a Super Bowl he's like to get another one he's like yeah yeah cut my dick off we're gonna do beat don't need to give me a bag that's what he said that's the type of person though that if you're in a competitive environment you would like to be around like okay that dude wants it all right I'm gonna sue that guy once he's gonna put on boxing gloves and box with the D lineman so they can you guys the head coach he's not he's hands I like what they got great mindset great mentality great mindset great team
