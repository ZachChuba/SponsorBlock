build a beautiful website you can do it all in one place with Squarespace today I have something very exciting a while ago my friend Jess gave me this little gecko printer which is basically like a miniature rizzo printer I think I'm not really sure how it looked into it but I'm I haven't used it and I found out my friend Kim who is an awesome photographer / Auto / maker I thought that it'd be fun if we could learn how to use them together also at the moment of about halfway done oh my god here's my hand for scale oh my god I also have some commercial work for the Cure which is a series of hotels it's like two perfectly illustrations but yeah I hope you enjoy this video and I'll see you in a sec oh my first comparison I played it through for so long yesterday these are the inks yeah oh man yeah what is it I also have these so just is like a letter of lush illustrator yeah so she like gave me this cuz she was clearing it out how cool is it from what I understand this is like the bulb house yeah so you put the bulbs in here you put your legs and it explodes and that's how you expose the screen yeah heartily when you handle the bulbs you should wear gloves oh it's like don't touch it you see us tomorrow is it Rizzo arise oh oh god I got a both wrong okay Riza I always say R is I well I'm give us a reason because you seem to be the knife use my colors right now do you have yeah okay [Music] this is the final what it's hopefully gonna look like I don't know if I use the right colors in the digital version but that than that oh nice it looks great did you like color match the colors you have like I tried to understand that they're like the typical colors everyone uses for razor prints but I'm just gonna print them with lots of borders yeah yeah yeah so you drew one color for the picture [Music] okay so what's the first step I'm gonna make a piece of paper on the pad I have it so that it's like scraps are being dressed bulbs wait oh okay one bulb huh yeah apparently you should wipe the contact on something so that it's like nice and clean should we do it at the same time or one at a time you can do it I can't believe this yeah okay one two oh right you also doing them anyway okay oh wait I'll have to hold it for a while oh no way to do together this is the pub where everything starts going really wrong we try and figure out these printers like an owl things do not go to plan okay why the same as long as one of us relax that's all that matters yeah that looks great okay so it's possible just not for me what are you some of my bulbs I'm sorry many or just like the waste of that yeah but that one wasn't full anyway right it's pretty full I've been looking at either other oh my god the bag which is the real one who's to say [Music] oh my god I know it's that I like RZA when all the people do it but I don't know how much I'd love it when I did it oh my god I'll make sure I put some close-ups in but holy crap I love it so much I think this is a start of something that I'm obsessed with now do a giveaway with a few of these and then maybe put the rest of my stole because I ended up making eggs I cannot wait to go back and make my stop it's so good I'll put all the details for the Risen area down below you should definitely check out a perfect silver lining to the fail that was my god I hope my chopsticks incorrectly just a little recap lying down once again I just want to repeat from a hundred time Rize is my favorite thing right now I'm obsessed with my own razor friends yes you had it here again yet another vlog where I'm obsessed with my work okay just let me have it sometimes we hate our work sometimes we don't please be in the center girl cry what they think is so weird is that the last vlog I did in this vlog both have a similar like thing I tried to do something it didn't work out and then I did it again and then I fell in love with it so I think the model of my life is if at first you don't succeed I think it's try again I'm not sure what the quote is I want to give away some of these prints so I will put most of them in my store but I'm gonna give away one on YouTube one on Instagram one on Twitter so can't firing in all these platforms if you want to win this cute little baby planet which I made with lots of love and care all you have to do is comment below I won't take home that cute little baby planet and then you'll be in the running to win a print if you want extra taxes when you print check out my Twitter and my Instagram if you can't be bothered to wait you can get it in my store but say something to be celebrated not to be hidden away [Music]
