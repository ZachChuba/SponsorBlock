hi guys welcome to another weekly vlog a what I got up to this week carry on watching oh good morning guys welcome to another weekly vlog today I've got a delivery from Urban Outfitters I ordered Vista who nights ago I think and I've already forgotten what I ordered it was like a late-night panic order you know nice late at night and then you start browsing shops and then you like oh I'm gonna use all the money I don't have on all this stuff that was what happened so I thought I would just unbox it with you at the start of this vlog so the first box I've got is just like a little tiny one and this has just got one thing in it before I show you this I used to have matching mugs and then recently I've decided when I move which is hopefully soon I have bought somewhere it's like in its very final processes so keep your fingers and toes crossed but I am gonna be redoing the bathroom the floor paint in every single room redoing the kitchen in time and when I do the kitchen I want some open shelves on the walls and I would like to put my mugs on it so I've been collecting along the way a few mugs that I really like and I picked up this one I'm very fussy about mugs by the way you have to have a good handle but this is the first one it's just got slots on look how cute that is what else did I buy God so much packaging this is like the best mug I've ever seen in my whole life oh my god I love it how cute so it's a cat and its tail is the handle and it's bottom of the cup is the feet of the cat and then the back is like the back of the cat this is so cute Lillian I remember what this is I'm so excited for the hit wanted one of these for so long and then I was watching my base Stephanie sue her vlog channel and I saw that she had one like on her bed or a sofa or something and I was like I need to buy this right now because I've wanted one for so long but they're so expensive this is so cute it's a pillow that goes behind you like that on the sofa and it like keeps you upright so it's perfect for Eddie oh my gosh I literally love this that's so comfy like I can already tell and it's got a little pocket on the side for your bass skips so that is everything that I got from Urban Outfitters I'm still obsessed with this mug I did get one more thing but it's actually a present so I'm not gonna show you that but yeah I'm gonna go and have a shower I need to wash my hair I should probably do my exercise so before I wash my hair I've been doing my seven-minute workouts again by Lucy Windham Reed I will pop the exact ones that I used below I do the arm on the stomach quad and the leg one all three in a row so it's about half an hour every day and honestly they make you ache they make you sweat even though it's just seven minutes if they really work you hard and I love them one more thing I've opened up my food Instagram it is just WWE underscore Gabriella so if you are interested in Weight Watchers or you're interested in people's food just what people eat feel free to follow it I've had so many messages saying that it helps you in your journey if you're able to see like what other people eat which I understand because the whole reason I made that account is so hot the postman just came but as I was saying the whole reason why I made that account is so I could follow other people's food accounts so I do completely understand that and I know that the way I post things is quite visually pleasing and that is also something I look for when I follow food accounts I don't like seeing people's like messy plates I like everything to be nice and like aesthetic I don't really know how to explain that but I do understand why people wanted to follow mine so I have opened it up just be nice everybody is on a different journey everybody eats differently and that's fine I'm gonna go tidy this mess up now and get on with my day oh my gosh I've just tidied all of the boxes away there now over here I've got so many boxes to take out which is bloomin annoying but we do have a really good recycling system so that's alright I've just tied my hair up and put a sports bra on and I'm now going to do my exercise guess what 10 seconds review that will go straight into me good morning everybody it's a Friday it is 122 I'm just preparing lunch then I'm gonna head out but I walked I didn't actually leave my flat at all yesterday but I think I still did close to 10,000 steps I was running around like a mad woman I was cooking I don't think I even showed you but I tidied I cooked chicken stew ready for tonight so if you remember my plate some bowls were on here but I wanted to change it's at my mugs run here because they were just shoved in a cupboard and I think they're so pretty but this isn't sorted yet at all like ignore this for now but I tidied all of my cupboards look at this that's Nellie's cat food bet then I've got the Cambridge wheat plan in case I ever have a life crisis and want to do that again then this cupboard has just got my pasta rice everything like that in its bed pots these pots were from Ikea and those pots used to fill this entire double cupboard like there was pots stacked up on everyone but I've decided to put my plates in there now and that honestly looks so much better I now have my tea I've got green tea in there biscuit Bru normal tea bags sugar and coffee behind easy empty and I now have that next to my kettle which is good because that used to be in the Far cupboard sweet snacks in here for Weight Watchers standing here I've got savoury snacks I have so many and cereals and stuff I really wish I could sort this out but I've got nowhere else to put the years but yeah my cupboards are so nice and tidy now time obsessed with them here we go this is my breakfast for today I've just got Cheerios you'll get at fruit yeah yes it is half won I woke up super late anyone else get excited to try a new mug or is that just me I'm trying a new mug today I'm actually excited it's this one from the Urban Outfitters little haul that I did I was actually gonna leave my flat today because I didn't yesterday and I usually go out every single day now which if he knew me a year ago or even a few months ago that is unheard of however I've got the worst period pain so I'm just taking it easy I'm just having a cup of tea I've been doing lots of editing is actually coming up to five o'clock its 456 so I've just been sat on my computer doing work we'll report back on how nice it is to drink oh wow what a boring segment of the vlog this is a good mug I'm sure you're all so happy I did this segment I've just realized that the airway part two is out on Netflix today so that is what I'm gonna do with the rest of my day I'm gonna watch that it's one of my favorite shows ever yay for lazy days [Music] good morning literally looks like I never leave my flat what a shock but I actually do I've been out this morning I've smashed out 5000 steps let's have a look mmm 4733 and it is 10:40 sick so it's not even 11:00 a.m. yet so I'm quite happy with that I've just actually been to weigh in if you don't follow my food Instagram you won't know but I'm not speaking about how much I've lost or gained or maintained or anything for a whole month I'm doing 30 perfect days on ww and then I'm gonna share how much I have lost fingers crossed yeah that's been my morning I'm now gonna sit and watch an episode of the airway I think I'm gonna head back out later but honestly today is just a lazy day I was doing a lot of work yesterday which you didn't see like whenever I don't vlog for a long period of time or just look like I'm sat on my sofa I am 90% of the time busy doing work so yesterday was a very very worki day on my laptop so I'm just gonna give myself a little bit of a chill today I don't sound anything like me [Music] good morning welcome to Sunday I think it is I'm off to the gym so I'm gonna head there now I really wanted to go at like 6:00 a.m. but my alarm went off and then I literally said out loud nope and then went back to sleep I can't get into the gym because it's access card only but I've literally only just signed up so I was going to go collect my access card and then go [Music] hello everybody once again I'm in my pajamas and dressing-gown this is not a flattering angle at all but I haven't left the house today actually went to the gym this morning today's a Sunday by the way so I went to the gym which is a new gym that I've registered at and I needed to go collect an access card to the building so I was like right I'll go this morning I was super in the mood so in the mood 8 a.m. on a Sunday offer go to the gym I got there and it said on the door that Sunday's our access card only so there was nobody at reception to give me my card so I couldn't get in the building and then I walked to a park nearby thinking that I would go on a bike ride and I got there got to the park to the bikes and I realized that I haven't put my watch on so I couldn't actually track my activity and I don't know about you but if I can't track my activity there's no point in me doing it because I I'll forget I've done it I'll make myself feel guilty and it's just like nice to know how many calories you've burned and stuff when you are on a diet because some days I do apply that to my food and I'll let myself have like a few more points if I've done a big workout and stuff I walked back home and I did a YouTube workout instead I did two of Lucy's workouts not the seven-day ones just like random ones and then I went on another walk to Tesco and I got some food and now I'm back home once again in my pajamas will you ever see me out of these pajamas in this vlog every time I'm just about to make my bed it's just been in the washing i'm fingers-crossed seeing my two friends tomorrow Lucy and Gemma Lucy has actually been in Vienna and she gets home where I think midnight tonight so she's gonna let me know tomorrow if she's too tired or not but fingers crossed I will be going to London to see them I really hope so because I'm quite a lonely week not gonna lie as you can see in this vlog I haven't seen it in anyone this week and sometimes I don't film when I see people I said this on Twitter the other day there was a tweet going around and I replied to it in fact I'll just put the tweet here cuz I can't remember what it said but there are some friendships that I don't feel I don't film relationship I only ever film if I'm with someone else who does YouTube because then I think they kind of understand it but then even some days they don't want to be on camera and neither do I but I'm pretty sure I will be vlogging tomorrow if I do see Lucy and Gemma anyways here's my bed before here we go nice freshly made bed is that honestly anything nicer than getting into a freshly made bed at night look how delightful that looks I've actually got a few p.o box bits to show you I thought I would show you them now before they gets too many and I have to do a whole entire video on it so firstly you've got this beautiful collection by NARS all of the packaging on this is gorgeous look at that so stunning so this is a blusher palette and look how beautiful it is I love that the actual blushes are like rippled like the packaging so stunning I've also got a climax mascara which is really really good I love this it's very good for lengthening and along with that I've got this I'm not sure if you use it as a blush or a bronzer if anyone knows can you let me know in the comments but look how gorgeous it is again now to smash it out of the park when it comes to packaging and stuff just beautiful then I've got this little travel-size set of lip products as well and also three of their lip balms so thank you so much

this is their new cactus blossom collection and when I first read the name I was like cactus how the heck is that gonna smell nice it smells delicious it really really fresh honestly I would urge you to go into a store and smell this then because I think it would be very universally light so first up we have got the body butter absolute classic from the body shop we've got a shower gel here a body yoghurt which I love nowadays because they're a lot lighter and then an exfoliating gel body scrub and then they've also sent across their white musk flora as I've said before I don't open at perfumes as they come in I kind of save them up and just use one at a time because I don't like wasting them but I will definitely smell that but it won't be until I finished my perfume now but thank you honestly to NAS Barry M and the body shop for all of these bits they look gorgeous totally forgot to show you that I also got sent Zoe's brunch date colour-pop range this is so cute I'm contemplating

too sure good morning happy Monday everyone I've just been to the gym as you can see by my friggin beetroot face oh I've just turned at 40 minutes on the cross trainer and ten minutes on the bike to warm up I did two and a half miles on the bike and then six on the cross trainer I can't remember I did a lot on have been 800 calories and that's more calories than I've been when I go to personal training so that is how hard I've just worked it's actually 11:15 now because I had the gas man come at 8:00 a.m. I'm just gonna hop in the shower I'm honestly worn out but I'm gonna wash my gross hair I was supposed to be going to London see Lucy and Gemma today but Lucy has had to cancel we're gonna have to do that another day which is sad because I was genuinely really looking forward to it but I well I'm dead [Music] [Applause] I had been a Wallflower for so long [Music] in number watching my [Music] but now I hear something that sounds like a love song birds in the sky [Music] [Applause] Sanford [Music] and I'm back about she got a little bit of her dilemma at the minute I'm about to message my estate agent just to see if my landlord has had this issue before but this bedroom the second one keeps getting infested with Lady Bird and I don't know what to do like I could show you some of them now I've actually just got rid of like 20 I hope my camera picks it up there's one there's one there's one there's one on the corner of that window was one two on that window there's one on the top of that window you can't Sikhs obviously it's backlit but there are so many of frigging lady birds and as I said I've just got rid of literally probably 20 and they just keep coming back every day and I don't know what to do I don't know where they're coming from because I don't have any windows open which means there's a gap somewhere that they're climbing through and it's freaking me out good morning I have put makeup on today and it's made me realize how much of a catfish I actually am so that's fantastic I'm about to film a video and then I'm gonna head to the gym it looks hot outside today and I'm stressed I don't have any clothes to wear or anything for the
