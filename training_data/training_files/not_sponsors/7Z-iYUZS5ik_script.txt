hey guys how you doing all of a sudden today I got a fantastic new feature I got the 12.6 update which enabled stoplight and stop sign automatic stopping on auto steer and autopilot driving down regular roads so it's pretty amazing I'm gonna walk through several scenarios I'm gonna walk through showing obviously stoplights I'm gonna show stop signs I'm gonna show audio summon I'm gonna show audio park and then how far all of these things have come there's one really cool scenario where I go through a downtown setting and in at a stop sign and then some people start walking out in front of the just kind of start crossing the street and a car pulls out why is the car was supposed to take off and go through the stop sign you saw you're able to see the car react through that and then Auto summon is pretty amazing so if you're but always remember to use somebody's work on getting to a thousand subscribers so let's jump right into it like I said I just got the 12.6 update and when I got in here it is telling me that I now have stoplight control as a beta and pretty excited so what it's telling me is how to enable it you have to be in part controls autopilot traffic light and stop sign control okay controls autopilot traffic and stop sign control okay here we go so this is saying traffic light stops and controls designed to slow down and stop for visible okay lights or stop signs that are detected when traffic aware cruise control or all the steers engaged all right driver accelerator or stock confirmation is required to proceed through traffic controls including green lights blinking lights and off lights alright the vehicle will continue straight and will not make turn so this is not gonna do turn yet the traffic like an stop sign control feature will not control for all intersections therefore you must pay attention alright alright when this feature is enabled the maximum set speed while using auto steer is limited speed on the road this feature may be conservative and slow down often at first over time as we learn from the fleet the feature will control more actually okay performance may be degraded in difficult environments okay pedestrians rain direct sunlight all right do you want to enable yes okay I think we're good to go let's let's try this out see what happens you can see the speed limit set at 45 miles per hour and for sure if I try to up that speed limit it is restricted to the actual speed limit so if you have this enabled no matter how I try it will not go above the speed limit so you like some people you know they'll try to set it maybe to always be a few miles above the speed limit you know between zero and five miles above the speed limit it will not let you do that it will only run the car at the actual speed limit that it sees so as you can see we're coming up to a stoplight up here and it's green look you see down here that this is what happens when you're green it still wants to do something so I have to confirm by hitting the accelerator and it'll continue through the light and you can also see how much brighter those lights are on the stoplights slow down car feels like it weights got a light to hit the brakes here you can see there's a truck here alright and even though all these cars go it will wait for me to hit it at this light and I have to confirm to go through so I just hit the alright here we come up here you can see that there's a stop sign way up here and then we'll look down here you can see it coming up so stopping slowing down see how it does it's kidding it it's getting it it kind of sees two stop signs because there's like some lights on that sign okay so now I'm gonna hit the accelerator once and it's trying to take off all right there it goes so there's a kind of a pause they're like you hit the accelerator and then it doesn't really move much like it'll it still just kind of starts willing to get up to speed it takes kind of a little ways to get speed so here we are at a railroad crossing and it's gonna slow down for that oops and I have to Oh accidentally hit the brake that was my fault okay so we're rolling slow here I'd be hard to see with the Sun it says it's stopping in 600 feet can you see that but here comes the stop sign up here let's see how it doesn't come in in the Sun here it sees it let's hit braking hard braking hard oh it kind of took a long time to come to the stop sign it took a little while to actually stop there okay this one should be interesting this is another slow part of the street it says 45 miles per hour but I don't know whether that's the actual the right speed limit or not so I'm just gonna kind of roll slow a little bit you can see that this is a let's see if it stops here it navigated this little turning kind of area all right got it got it okay and then look auto pilot unable to proceed cuz there's no road ahead so very good so I'm gonna disengage that and do manually turn here alright here we come up to railroad crossings and it will try to slow down here and so I'm gonna confirm that it'll go so I've noticed that it does this for every time you come to a railroad crossing all right here we're gonna try out the stop sign from this direction oh it speeds up it goes oh it stopped way too far back look at that oh it's inching up now it's stopping again well it's not really far back someone let this car go now I'm gonna try to make the accelerator go because it says you can use the cruise stock I'm gonna use that and see how that does accelerating wow that's a lot better if you use the actual cruise stock instead of tapping the accelerator first because it seems like if you tap the accelerator first like it does a little jump and then stops and then kind of takes off nope it's your yellow light and it breaks really hard alright cool so I'm gonna try that again I'm gonna try to accelerate with the stalk and see if that continuously does better so it's taking off that is so much better if you use the actual cruise stock is better than using the accelerator pedal hands down work twice it gets off the line a little better and it doesn't like stutter while you're trying to get going hit the brakes it seems to take a lip longer than I almost feel comfortable with to hit the brakes but it does do it ok here we come up into a downtown setting so we're gonna have several stop signs here and a flashing light hit the brakes feels like it could rub okay feels like it could roll out a little sooner you kind of saw there where it I don't know it's all a light or try to get a line way back there I guess it's waiting for me to go oh it cancelled okay all right well that one messed up so I'm not sure what happened there so max 30 and stopped on this one fine now we're taking off again we'll come back the other way and see how it goes okay let's test it going back the other way we're gonna be in a little bit of Sun all right it does see the stop sign coming up here we go okay that was pretty solid seeing it okay like there's people here so it's it's waiting for the people let's see if it goes oh there it goes that car is like really sitting out there okay here's the one I get a little confused with earlier but it seen this one seems to be working fine now okay okay all right Moo all right all right I think we're good that was a little hairy with the people walking around and the car backing up like the car the car definitely kind of pulled forward and waited a little bit although it waited kind of in the middle of that intersection and then it and then it took off when that car finally took off so that was kind of nutty so smart some of it it looks like the circle for smart summon is a little bit bigger than it used to be and it's telling you whether it's in Park reverse neutral or drive which it did not do before so let's give it a shot I think we might go out a range you can kind of see up here where this one way it's gonna go around this way out and around and come back and it looks like from here it might get at a range right over here so we might have to kind of go get the car so let's give it a shot we goes curb the wheel didn't curb it turning it looks like it's completely in the circle it's moving with a lot more confidence than it used to like this thing it used to hesitate a lot it's coming around it's coming around I think it's gonna make it all the way Oh yep okay so it got a little bit out of range so it's it's recalibrating itself because now it's closer to me they're gonna start back up again there it is nice I'm gonna try something haven't tried in a while because it didn't work out for me really great last time I'm gonna try the auto park into the garage so I have my key fob in my hand to stop this if it gets crazy I am ready to go here we go we're gonna go backwards alright let's give this a shot yeah it shouldn't do it alright here it goes here goes I have my hand on the button just in case anything crazy goes on just trying to go in hands on the button you understand I'm paranoid about this it's looking good it's looking good you're looking good boy oh it bailed out trying to get up the trying to get up there huh alright alright it really aired on caution there alright let's see if we can try this again okay let me like maybe my garage door that little lip to my garage doors kind of tall um so let's give it a shot try this again maybe that lip is too tall here goes here it goes here it goes back it in it's backing in push push I think that lip is too tall oh dang it okay here's what I'm gonna try this is experiment okay okay let's try this let's try this I'm gonna get it up over the lip to start with that's interesting okay okay now I have it over the lip all right we're gonna try this again here we go here we go getting out I will see if it does it see if it does it we're good now let's see if you can pull the front wheels over front wheels it's pulling to the lip in my garage is too tall legs let's look at this looks like how tall it is I mean it's about an inch inch and a half and it does not want to pull that car over that lip that is crazy Wow so it's it's feeling the resistance there we're gonna try to finish this off all right let's leave it'll just finish up here and there it goes oh and it closed the garage [Applause] [Music] so that's pretty interesting that that lip is too much for its too much resistance for that car to push against I don't know if there's a setting to change that or not hmm all right well there you have it all right final thoughts I'm very pleased like I said the video where they've come with this I think that the safety features that they've done where you have all of the confirmations are spot-on it has a few times where it's breaking kind of hard at some stop signs it does seem to get a little confused sometimes as you kind of saw in the video especially downtown as we work through that one but still not bad I mean for a first version of stopping up stop signs of stoplights I think it's it's a really really good step in the right direction I'm encouraged by where they're going with this you saw how to summon is just that thing is getting so confident in fact that's moving quick enough now where it made me make more sense that I tried that out in some more scenarios before it was just too slow and just by the time you've got your phone out and some in the car to you you could have just walked to the car so that's getting that's getting a lot better acceleration off the line again much better with the stock than with the accelerator pedal it does seem to wait too long before it's kind of getting up to a stop side before it really hits the the brake and start slowing the car down I think it could back off a little bit earlier and then just kind of let use more of the region to let the car cut Coast it just it really does seem like it's waiting you know it's it's just a half second or just a few seconds too long man like you really feel like okay okay stop something and then it will definitely stop but it just really feels I don't know I mean let me get let me know what you guys think if you if you have the update you've driven it but I think it could let out just a little bit sooner when it especially it's already started known I knew that it is gonna stop and it could start rolling out of that a little sooner or maybe that could be a setting to where maybe that's more aggressive setting or non aggressive setting but you know all in all the poem to the garage thing I'm gonna have to figure that out that's pretty nuts that that thing is too tall for me to get in and out of the garage into so it was having a lot of trouble before but this time the car really did want to pull in straight it looked like it would have done it perfectly if my garage that little my garage wasn't so tall so I don't know I'm just I'm gonna keep working on auto park but then that's all gonna be a really cool feature if I can figure out the garage look I don't know if I need to shave that down maybe you don't know if I should do that I don't know we'll see the guys don't forget to subscribe to the channel and I'll catch you on the next one
