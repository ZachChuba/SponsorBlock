hey guys backyard scientist here first of my name master of house disaster destroyer of watermelons and breakers of sorry I got carried away anyway I'm still pretty amped up from watching the series final ending of Game of Thrones I particularly enjoyed the giant ballista on the ship I liked it so much in fact that I decided to make one for myself check it out let's get started we started off by building the base and the bracket to hold a giant six inch by 6 inch body of the bow the bracket will let me aims about up and down and side-to-side and then to secure the aim that I want I made this giant pin so I can just kind of crank it down and hold the bow in place and that was the easy part now it's time to put the giant head on the bow this weighs about 55 pounds and it's completely made out of quarter-inch steel plate and this is what's gonna hold the arms to the bow these are the arms to the bow and they attach like this with these mounting plates to hold everything nice and steady and maybe arms out of leaf springs from a truck I went to a junkyard and I pulled out these weak springs in it was a real pain in the butt to cut them up let me tell you all right now I'm going to be making the bow out of this special rope it's made out of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and it's supposed to be super strong I mean this says it can hold three thousand nine hundred pounds a problem about it is it's kind of slippery so what I'm going to try to do is just hammer this little ferrule shut and hopefully we'll have enough force to clamp down on the rope and hold it onto the arms of the bone the first thing I want to do is test out exactly how hard it is to pull this thing back so I have a scale right here and I have a bill Crowe and the GoPro is going to be transmitting the information live to my phone so I'll be able to see the numbers on it we're gonna pull it all the way back and see how much this thing weighs I'm gonna be hiding behind a tree over there in case one of these arms snaps I don't want to be anywhere in here alright [Music] yeah that looks like a thousand pounds to me I started to hearing some stuff creaking so I don't think I want to go any farther back than that now I like to think that I'm pretty strong but just think has a 1000 pound draw and I'm not going to be able to pull this back so we're going to be using this winch so all I have to do is press a button all right so it's time for the first test and I think you know what it's already going to be that's right it's a watermelon and I also cooked up a special tip for this arrow it's like a giant steel broad head made out of quarter-inch steel plate it's just like the ones that they used in games of thrones so we'll see if we can take down a watermelon with this you might want to move Sandra this time we're using the medium-sized arrow and just see what happens maybe I'll hit it this time three boom right through just like that well I thought I nailed it at first but once I look at the high-speed you can notice that it hits the table too and I think that takes a lot of energy out of the arrow because this thing should go right through the watermelon my second shot don't worry about where the tables got a bunch of holes in it but I hit it nice I guess now we can move on to something a little bit harder what do you say yeah I never really explained how I'm triggering this thing but it's pretty simple this is the trigger that I'm using it's a very simple mechanism I'll show you a clip of how it works right here you can see that when I pull this cam back it kind of forces this lever to go down and it releases the spinny thing which releases the arrow and this is how I set the whole thing up so I have the trigger here it goes into this long slide it's a little bit deeper than the arrow and then you basically push the string up on here so it's like that use the winch to pull it back then all you have to do is pull this lever and alright the next one is going to be a tough target for sure let's see if we can break it because we're shooting a cinderblock wall let's see what happens so these are the arrows that were using we have the big one so we'll see which one performs the best now if you look at them this right here is a stainless steel flexing on the back of the arrow and a heavy mild steel penetrator tip they're a little bit heavier than wood but I still think that they will be the perfect match for our giant scorpion three two whoa that seriously did some damage oh man I hope it didn't damage the GoPro too high GoPro come look at this it there's just a trail of dust back there I can't believe it by like a hair Wow I mean it seriously just destroyed that cinder block that's really impressive and this is a heavy arrow this thing must weigh two pounds easy we've been shooting this scorpion it seems like it's really really powerful but how fast is it shooting exactly well we can find out by doing this I have two black marks here and this is exactly one foot apart so we're gonna fire this thing in slow motion to see how fast it goes so firing without an arrow this thing crosses the two black lines in ten frames which means that it's traveling at a hundred and fifty feet per second now with an arrow on it that speed is reduced to around a hundred and seven feet per second which is about 75 miles per hour alright we've reset these cinderblock wall and my brother is going to give it his own shot to try to take down the castle I think you can do it okay okay so here we go just take the arrow like this put it right in there it's good to go I'm gonna go hide and we'll set up slow-motion camera let's do this do it ready alright oh right three two one that was a great shot he hit that thing or right in the center and the thing just exploded it totally crumbled so I would say that he beat me with that shot but I'm gonna try one more I am the older brother after all all right so that hit right in the center was pretty good but you know what I think that if I hit it right on one of the weak spot to go through both sides of the cinderblock so I'm gonna try that I'm now using a big so yeah that that was pretty sweet yeah the bigger arrow is definitely better definitely what does it look like on the high-speed let's check it out I knew it was possible boom boom through and through both sides of the cinderblock and it turned it into dust that big arrow is definitely an improvement another thing I kind of want to mention is you notice how the arms of this bow have a slight taper to them they're thicker at the base and skinnier on the top and this is because if I left them all one constant width the whole way down when you bend it back you'd really only be bending this part of the spring and all of this would just be extra dead energy at the end of the bow so if you taper it it allows the spring to store all of the energy throughout the whole curve of the spring that's why it and bows normal archery you always have the taper from bottom to top or from with getting like the top change I just wanted to mention that because how I did it was kind of sketchy I used a plasma cutter to cut it and if you heat up spring steel too much you're going to destroy the temper and make it brittle and it won't work anymore so I used a hose and I sprayed water on the underside of the metal arm while I cut it with a plasma cutter so it wouldn't destroy the temper of the spring considering the ends of the bow I could have just added more leaf springs it would kind of simulate the same effect so I could have had another leaf spring that goes out here and another one that goes to here and that would kind of simulate the tapering of this how it is in the moment car but that would just be such a high draw weight I think it would really literally tear this thing apart for this next one we're bringing back out the giant broadhead arrow because these motorcycles know we're going to be shooting these fire extinguishers so hopefully I can get it to hit right like that blast up both of them I've got them tied up with this high-strength cord right here so hopefully if they do explode they won't go rocketing across the neighborhood they will just get wrapped up around here without doing anything crazy well right now I'm nervous this thing is kind of hard to aim I missed the fire extinguisher well actually I hit it but it was right on the hose maybe I'll have better luck next time this time I really hit the fire extinguisher but it was up top and nothing broke maybe third time will be the charm what do you say Riley sons a charm nothing Italy [Applause] [Music] was awesome we nailed it perfectly that was exactly what I wanted to happen check that out boom nothing went through the other side there right no it didn't go through it just hit it stuck in for a second bounced off it might have actually gone all the way through if we didn't have the broadheads on it might have and I'm glad that thing held on there because that thing was taking off like a rocket in slow motion oh yeah I really nailed it that time right in the center of the fire extinguisher and I loved watching the arms after you shoot the bow they still just wiggle back and forth forever and there it is the impact and you can see that thing taking off like a rocket that is really cool anyway that thing's sent out a lot of dust so why don't we take a break for a second while we wait for the dust to settle so we've been Florida that I need to go take care of it doesn't look like much of a problem to me it's just standing there well I hit that dragon that it's badly injured so I gotta go finish it off there it is so you know that's what's supposed to happen when you shoot a dragon they explode well I'd say our dragon problem is solved but our forest fire problem is starting well that's the end of this video guys that ballista is awesome I love it me my brother spent all week making it so thank you a lot for helping me any time that thing was to shoot at least it really is it'll probably be in some more videos so if you guys have any ideas put them down in the comments below and that's it see you guys next time bye stuff
