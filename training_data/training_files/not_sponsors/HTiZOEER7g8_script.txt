telling someone to eat poop is obviously an insult but in these species if they could talk they'd probably say oh do you have any [Music] these animals are nature's best poop eaters father is certainly enjoying his so is carol he emptied that bottle as fast as he could gobble down a couple of big spoonfuls one right after the other hi i'm danielle dufoux and you're watching animal logic second nature when you think of poop you're probably not thinking mmm that might be tasty bad taste good taste yet surprisingly hoop contains a lot of nutritional value and many species rely on it as a core component of their diet coprophagia or consuming feces is a great way for animals to reabsorb nutrients get nutrients seldom found in their environments and in some cases a way of acquiring the right gut bacteria to help them break down hard to digest food feces are also a great source of vitamin b and k which are secreted by good bacteria i'm through with fresh fructoses i'd give up carrots too i don't need doctor who'ses i need vitamin poop all of these species are incredibly important to the health of the environment they do the jobs that nobody else wants to do well except fungi of course there are some negative consequences to eating feces with the transmission of parasites being the most common one the most famous poop eaters are the ones that adorably roll it around in balls the dung beetles there are over 6 000 species of dung beetle found all over the world these beetles are amazing at finding poop using advanced chemo reception within 15 minutes of an elephant making droppings thousands of dung beetles will arrive on the scene once on site they are incredibly efficient a group of a few thousand beetles can clear a three pound load of elephant poop in just two hours they use their little legs to grab a chunk of poop shape it into a ball and then they roll it off even cuter is that they roll the balls backwards their hind legs push the ball while they walk standing on their front legs [Music] in most species dung makes up the majority of their diet but they use it for more than just feeding themselves they also rely on poop for reproduction dad yes where do babies come from anyhow [Music] several species of dung beetle lay their eggs in the dung balls and bury them this gives their larvae a first meal when they are born this is called mass provisioning a female dung beetle may only lay about five eggs in her entire life so she needs to work extra hard to give her babies the best chance of survival so she will lay only one egg per dung ball competition for dung is fierce albeit cute rolling balls away from dump sites is dangerous work often rival beetles will try to steal a dung ball by use of force and lay their own eggs in it then it becomes a race against time for the larvae to hatch the first to hatch gets to live and eat poop dung beetles are very important to the environment they bury their collected poop which helps replenish nutrients in the soil they also remove parasites like intestinal worms and cows by eating their larvae that are living in the dung dung flies are another key copperphagia species they don't exclusively rely on dung to survive but they do use it as a hookup spot males will usually hang around near fresh piles of poop waiting for females to show up so they can mate with them after which like dung beetles they will lay their eggs in the freshest available poop but insects aren't the only poop specialists in the world in the ocean coprophagi is rather common mollusks shrimps fish and many other species all eat feces this is particularly common among bottom dwellers where organic matter is scarce and feces pellets accumulate in the form of marine snow feces have never been so beautiful in the mammalian world rabbits and other members of the laporide family are the kings of culprifagi then he saw something that would finish his meal just right fresh green delicious they're zika tropes and fermented poop is an important part of their diet they rely on feces as part of their diet because they have a design flaw like us their meals pass through their small intestine first this is where all the nutrients are absorbed but the large intestine contains a pouch called a cecum which holds the gut bacteria they need to ferment the plant matter in order to make it nutritious to get the most nutrition out of their food they need to eat it have it go to the large intestine to ferment poop it and then eat it again to absorb the nutrients these soft feces are rich in vitamins and microbial proteins they will continue this process until the droppings have lost all nutrition and are hard rather than soft it's a rather unpleasant process to witness as the rabbits will often eat the droppings straight from the source but without eating their soft serve rabbits become malnourished so if you own a rabbit like marie antoinette supposedly said let them eat poop [Music] this behavior is also seen in many other small mammals including sport of lemurs common ringtail possums mountain beavers and the koipu many larger mammals like rhinos elephants pandas and koalas are also coprophageous the practice is especially common in babies we need to eat their mom's droppings in order to acquire the gut bacteria necessary to break down plant matter the other reason they eat poop is that it gives them a second chance to digest plant matter all of these species eat very fibrous foods that take longer to digest than it takes for them to pass through their system and so eating their own feces is a great way to get another shot at digesting the plant matter this practice is also seen in many birds cassowary chicks in particular are known to rummage through their parents poop in order to find seeds that they can then ingest poop one animal's trash is another's favorite meal so what should i talk about next please let me know in the comments and be sure
