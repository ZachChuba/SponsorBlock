alright ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as interested in play with your friends or do vanilla stuff or do it's very dark out and apparently there could be a group somewhere nearby or do survival Maps whatever floats your boat check it out thanks to them so learned after the last episode that B streets apparently they do not tame yeah it's out it's all about those rabbit feet yeah so I I'm just gonna toss out those B streets yeah I mean I feel like they might still be useful to something yeah I mean there's just occupying inventory space but I guess what my inventory fills up there'll be the weakest link goodbye they are the weakest link goodbye alright I don't know where we've gotten to where we hadn't ah what's a seat over there though there's a spider wow dude a spider that's crazy bro yeah I can't actually remember which of the pathways we'd go no idea but also having not been on this in a little while I think we have been down here actually this is where we came from having not been on this in a little while what I feel like is gonna happen is I'm gonna get overly aggressive forgetting and then I'm gonna be like oh wait you can't do that here that's bad news don't don't do yeah don't don't do it don't do the big sad do the big bed I should level up some of my ELLs though don't you think take an L or two I mean yeah that's definitely be a thing Oh draws the bowstring back faster yeah dude I'm down with that and then arrow speed arrow travels faster ten percent speed sure done using my levels dude using my levels that's how we do it you've already got heck oh hey hey Super Cobra dude there we go no I've already got heckled wasn't it you've already got hecka levels in your else oh yeah yeah I've I've been I've been putting some levels down that's what you do okay so I don't believe that we have been in here there are apples yes gold gold wait butter oh oh the old skydoesminecraft butter did I get you I get you back the og butter dude okay we got some smart oh it's a groom boy screw boy eat some boys back here dad some boys you you got that um I don't know the spawners they started spawning and I was like whoa whoa okay we got him we got it we got it we got it and then how about you down here dude oh my god II what do we know what we get from here so we've got some lapiz lazuli there's some guys it looks like they dropped down behind this excuse me what's that's Mike kobold you're cool just like retrieve stuff it yeah no kobolds totally whoever said steal stuff oh really yeah that's one of the reasons you want to kill them oh man I've got the your your friends after they do hey I'll be right back I just trying to do the I got the bestiary bug where my summons weren't working properly well uh good good thing cuz something just went kaboom over here and I'm not sure what it was kind of scary I thought that you would come for a second yeah Wow no I have no idea it was super super weird oh that's a special zombie though yeah it is but that oh cool cool I'll take that I'll take that uh hammer all right Harry seems to be going okay enhanced or knocked the negative negatives everywhere it's this negative and I went on that hammer bro it's not hammer time bro never is okay so that dead ended down there but what about here have we been oh there's a torch there so nice we not been into I don't think we went into this area but it looks like it kind of conflicted with world Jen a little bit of iron right there for you though easy iron yeah dude yeah easy iron have you learned anything since last time yourself no oh I don't know you seem to be a fountain of knowledge most of the time between episodes like whoa hey boys it's a trouble boy you get read what oh it's the coke what did you drop there dude a quill and some leather and no big deal you know what let's what is this this looks like a new Monster over here hold on is that an elephant they don't kill you oh no it's not an L whoa dude it's like a train yet I didn't know one of those before it looks like it's healing it oh it probably heals in the fire ah yeah wreck dude get him get to us bro what it dropped a stick good forest troll weather might be I mean it's a special type of leather I mean actually wait I could just do this and then therefore push I push the things into other areas oh wait so you did this why don't worry about it hang on a second I need uh I need a drink of that thank you yeah yep you're welcome okay so maybe this is the area where we kind of forked off in different oh that's a big boy a troll boy over there oh he's a is he a fast boy he looks like kind of okay my arrow bounced off of him whoa he is an animation where he gets angry yeah maybe that's a good idea okay I'll let them take care of it dude I mean oh okay okay I'm a little concerned no he's odd I'm Johnny got him got him what it's Oh what did he write drop the wood he's a wood troll would you believe it oh I would dude I would get shrekt the zombie boliya the fire sounds are so unsettling dude the troll sound was unsettling this is torches all over it okay that we probably have been that way before there's leather seats this one has a torch on top of it but it has glowstone dust which is really valuable and art dust which is very valuable oh is glowstone really valuable I mean that's how we make the big torches right Oh Oh gotcha you have said that before and I have and no no no comprehension was found on this day no I mean why would it be let's be honest ooh there's a thing down here dude this is unexplored territory you go down the blue one I went down if you tried that you I see it will blind right now but otherwise everything's fine there we go there we go dude Oh getting all those sick medical heal supplies right there there's a lot of what medical right there yeah I've got three of the enhanced bandages is that a troll boy yeah I think it's okay wait wait oh my god dude the freakin animations or a while oh that's it that's like an even bigger boy yo those coke Oh God uh what mom did you do that I don't know what blew up honestly dude those colds are actually like they were wrecking him the his health was going super down III kobolds don't put up with any crap did you level them up or something no I don't know okay I thought maybe that was actually a thing you could do all right I'm gonna I'm gonna reira tree v' me torches oh you put those down okay I bet that I did so I'm like oh oh okay so that's a plan Oh got some other boys here donor X and the troll just demonetized itself have we been in this direction I don't think we have either uh no but that kind of look like towards the exit but it could maybe not be so why does this zombie have a mega health he just took so many shots oh wow there's a lot out here it's a few few boys you boy oh so wait where's this light coming from though careful careful did I pass elf check rekt holy crap whoa oh you got a lot of water did we got butter boy nice and then a lot of apples might as well snag the apples battle-ax some I Ron dude oh this is misty it's very misty in here will you throw damn the water yes woogie stroy Frick dude so uh you wanna you wanna fill your water yeah yeah I'd love to I'd love to get some water yeah go for a dude a balloon Oh increases jump height negates fall damage uh that's pretty cool actually there's a reason that's damaging me to do oh that's sick see ya oh my god that's amazing dude we need to find another one of these somewhere in here I hope are there more places to go that's the question I think we might have finished off the general general things hmm I don't like that though I want a balloon dude were there any other Forks in this direction no that is very dead ended I think we just about do we conquered it I I wanted there to be a boss though bro you know I wanted there to be a boss and I was gonna just wreck its face off okay I recall we didn't come in through there friend like we just banged in through a side it mighta just gone and mind our way and that's a very distinct possibility but this is definitely an exit all right dude I couldn't hear you over the sound of my balloon yeah whatever that that you know rubbery rubbing sounds yeah yeah that latex said good impersonation I can remember which direction we came from so oh I have no idea where we are but we just keep going and news is keep running in a direction the good news is I have that's one of those we are a remaining bits easier lies CaptainSparklez apparently you died at some point right there where we are to the east of our base all right cool do you want to head back to base no I'll do it I want to find more ways stones we got to link this all up we got an adventure that's what we need is way stones the only reason like it's just inventory just the obnoxious thing right yeah we need to find like better backpack setups oh oh don't go here don't go there I feel like you could have warned me faster I didn't have much warning oh okay incinerated oh yeah well no it doesn't burn so it doesn't this the question is can you get it back well do you have so we were to the east do you know how East I am still on fine okay I'm not on fire anymore do we have a feather we have a feather we have some ink do we have a book somewhere and then can you make a compass if you have a book we can make a compass definitely okay you make a compass and I've got some paper now I just need to find the leather like I really I I don't know how to convey to you how little time I had I've done that before right like that's that that was my life when you were giggling at me and I was like you don't understand just how fast that would all went down like that homeboy kind of turned okay and then it was like just it's all over I'm taking our misses and this could be a suicide mission oh so you think don't don't take armor I did much for you but in the fight anyway right but it has done a lot for me another situation okay whyever all right here we go let's do this couldn't possibly go wrong what the heck is lobster man boy that's the biggest tree man ever that's kind of disturbing actually oh my oh that's bad you're getting assaulted by a thing what the hell whatever there's the Dragons nest right there okay good good so wait there was another one on the way nice nice nice I don't know if that's another one or if that's the one with toasted us oh no no we're not we're not that close that's for sure we we weren't that far they're definitely not that close yeah okay well I'm circling around to the south a little bit more I mean we might be that might be the dragon that toasted you did the first inaugural toasting okay so oh wait wait we can okay there's a thing to teleport you back to your grave scroll ender pearl and rotten flesh we've no I don't think we do we do we have lots yeah yeah yeah we had him to pay for rotten flesh okay so we run back home okay here I got one for you one for me ready we ready to go right actually I guess we should just not take anything right yeah all right I'm going okay oh my god wow that was amazing I got some stuff I don't know what I've gotten away this I got a little bit I don't see the dragon I don't see the dragon but there's a lot of stuff on the ground here it's scattered in many many directions okay all right all right it could could it be Norse could've been worse that could have gone a lot worse good call dude didn't even despawn all right I think we've got almost everything yep oh I don't know okay but that's good news in that I make another away from I got pretty far away from where he was okay all right spawn area right are you still alive and I'm still alive I'm just trying to piece through what I got which is definitely not everything not by a long shot I just don't have like a weapon right now is the issue I managed to and all the scattered stuff not pick up a weapon well I have your diamond sword oh okay cool cool I'm trying to find the place where you got wrecked again oh you great scroll back okay cool I don't know I have my balloon nice nice oh here's a little bit of stuff well canteen action oh yeah yeah I wonder if you hang out in the water can he kind of actually water supposed to really help you quite a bit okay it's gonna hang out the water for a minute while I sort through weigh your diamond pants okay cool diamond that rapier that is that thing over there okay um I think we've banished together most of the important things we might want to just fork right off direction do we have the did you get the atlas I did not dang it does it despawn I mean I assume stuff D spawns I don't know where you know what what yeah he's right there you want to meet a drop stuff than try and go on a run in if you would like I don't really have any space in my inventory as the issue so I need to make a chest probably Hey well we don't have access or anything like that do we unless you pick nope oh so do we lose all our tools cool cool cool cool I mean I think we lost the majority of stuff I have my shoes and none of my armor but I don't know what you still got on what you don't and I'm here I've some of this stuff for you but I don't have any weapons and it looks like we lost all of our torches one less you got um I got I got torches yeah here you go and let's see those were the dragon might go to sleep at night oh because the dragons do sleep now I hear him clapping okay great I mean at least you can hear it right yeah yeah you got an ember coming up behind you I don't know again I don't have any weapons alright I don't know let's see this Oh we are I have a compass I don't have the atlas how is you Frick you just for kidding Wow you just deflected an arrow into me somehow I don't even know how that works yeah our stuff is probably despawned at this point so it's like yeah do we want to risk going in and recovering the other stuff I'd say let's just keep going we have food right we could keep going until we find another way stone this is the general direction of our base right okay that's where we exited let's do we have got our sleeping bags are done too I have one but you don't have one then no no no I have it I have it we can sleep let's do it I feel like we should just have graves scrolls in a chest ready to go it's someone's been reminding us of it for a while forgetting and okay well maybe let's go to direction over here maybe get out of here boy [Music] yeah I guess the only downside is that we erious whether the dragons like when it goes to sleep because I do know they sleep at some point and then when they sleep it's like you can just kind of waltz in yeah in fact you can some people cook like will even kill them while they're sleeping oh they won't wake up oh wow that's a tree isn't that the same type of tree we've already been up that like was disappointing though oh yeah it is owner this is the same one is this incinerated or is it just lighting glitch I can't really tell oh it's just like really really blown out by the Sun on the other side I mean aren't there there's supposed to be lots and lots of structures that you can find I just found an interesting thing have you ever seen a piece of sand that has a pickaxe in it but I don't know if this is a mod thing or if it's a resource pack thing but you see that huh I thought maybe there'd be like treasure embedded but yeah but no instead of it being a pickaxe it was literally just okay well I got excited there for a moment I thought it was gonna be cool do not recommend cresting that yeah and then there's also something called russet tremor next to it oh that's just a that's just a you know a golden-brown tremor here's a big old structures and so that's a scary boy yeah I did I did notice that looks cool dude that looks pretty cool oh oh yeah I'm into this I'm into this let's go freakin exploring duh oh wow it's like multi-sided and also a little too close to the dragon for comfort on that side oh dude this is gnarly what do we got here though I hear zombies and I have no pickaxe to break spawners yep that's a that's an issue slightly it'd be cool if there was you know like a waist shown somewhere oh my god dude this thing has like statues and stuff walking is huge this is one big old structure what an absolute unit Wow wonder what it leads to like is it just an aesthetic structure Marcus I mean I'm sure that there's stuff inside if only we could break things yeah and access it where you go you work um I am the sort of main statue oh well okay what's going on help damn I'm stuck in a block okay we're okay we're great yeah I figured nope that's not it what is there an entrance it's gotta be an entrance to something here hmm I just let me just break this with my hand this this definitely has some there's gotta be something more to this I need to disconnect and do your thing so I got into the glitch block as well yep okay there's there must be several of them around the that like the way that's yeah it doesn't it odo no I'm sitting on a stair okay don't do that don't do that that's what got me into this mess in the first place I think you good okay yep but I'm moving forward slowly okay Oh believe me Lee you can do it all right let's go to sleep so yeah the dead ends but I there's got to be more to it though so I don't know the best thing is to do do we want to take a quick trip actually you know what I guess you just make a workbench real quick and I have I have a bunch of iron so easy enough to get some tools going hi I'm volunteering to do purposeful demonization mm-hmm I mean it doesn't really matter what I get take it off in your voice okay I'm totally full it can't take anything more dude and take anything more I'm just gonna I'll be cycling through items making sure nothing these spawns I'll be sitting on this protecting it like a mother hen like everybody rags all right I'll see in a minute good see me in a minute what are you gonna do just going water the water does it you can't breathe so come come here often I know first time actually it's a beautiful place though longtime caller first time visitor it's a very nice place you don't wonder what ancient civilization constructed it they did a nice job there we go all right don't forget to cycle that gear mama hen okay good good to see you back here so I guess that's that's a hazard of uh you know the whole under water the water drowned yeah yeah a little bit I know what we could have done what's that is how do you stab me it's also it's also a thing that we could have done yeah but that would be violence and I'm not a violent person you might want to pick up your stuff real quick where okay well I didn't you would just literally dumped it on the ground but I cycled it as I cycled it okay all I need is that axe carrying lis that axe okay apparently you're holding the accident I thought you were making two exes no I just made one okay makes sense so here take some iron if you would like to have an ex and you should have the sticks and all that stuff all right so anything to this huh anything to this whole deal like is it just is it just an aboveground thing like is that all there is to it you're just you're just the facing it I am because we're the face of defacement I am the face of it dude what is that yeah we know what that block is light blue terracotta okay yeah it doesn't seem like there's anything to this how could such a monstrous structure lead to zilch nada nothing you know that after we leave we're gonna get comments on this video like you idiots you just needed to go to this particular location here and you would have needed to do is just know exactly what you're doing and then you could have done it well I can you off in this direction away from the dragon so this yeah we we've stumbled upon sand before but never like the regular flat desert we went through that one area that just we'd absolutely toasted in which is probably what's gonna happen here would nighttime maybe nighttime is a better way to travel through here even if it is things look like things maybe you do look like things you would be right I wonder if they're difficult things to handle there's one right in front of you oh that's that's a thing right there I don't know but it looks like a thing oh okay that's terrifying they're insects in there oh that's Oh Jess are very they're very easy to okay I'm on fire I'm on fire why are you on fire Oh heat don't tell me that's a dragon oh sample Griffin okay I think goodness yeah heat fire yeah yeah it's nighttime and it's so hot why how you doing I'm okay okay I don't know where you've gone oh I see you I see you okay you would think the nighttime would I don't know yeah a little bit this is very hot over here I don't know if we want to get too far in because it's very Bernie there's a lot of scorpions over the left yeah yep Scorpio boys Scorpio boys where do you want to I mean you want to back out you feel like we're not we're not equipped for this I mean you know on fire okay all right all right [Applause] dang these ants bro is that desert Miramax resin okay fiery fiery very fiery wouldn't dive in with you bow diamond with you yeah yeah alright that's much better hey it's me this is okay don't swim up that just makes it awkward okay I just need to drink oh all right these guys are no bueno I almost want to try to go into the underground place but I'm also a little bit worried about all these spidey boys it's any ant boys and it's like super slow - oh it's so creepy it's so creepy I like hear noises coming from it hot potato my ex worker yeah there's a lot of guys oh don't hit me so yeah don't jump in front of me I ain't jumping in front of you oh they withered that's nice oh no that was a special boy that was a special boy was it yeah yeah do you have any bandages I do yes here here let me give you half the chupacabra me dude and then yeah you should be good with that okay it's a little cool underground though so it's like yeah at least it's cooler down here wow where did that guy spawn from the he just zoomed out age assumed up Oh interesting like hesitant to go down here and and there's gonna be some gigantic Queen or something oh these blocks are hard to break what did I break with is it a shovel desert nearing resin chunk no I don't know what it breaks with it doesn't seem to break with or anything yeah they have way more health there's it behind you oh yeah oh fricking I can't I can't hit that with you right there oh you oh you fool okay okay we're good everything's fine you don't like it you don't like it okay we seem to be working in a direction that's not an ideal of direction okay it just it's it's not super toasty which is why I was like hey this isn't a bad I like that but they're spawning as fast whoa oh they just spawn on you know he ran up oh did he alright yeah that's Jill that's Jill it's just it's just a lot you know like that dude they definitely just doubled oh my god they just doubled for sure oh there's more coming all right all right lots of freaking out here ants everywhere oh boy that is that as many things converging on our location holy mother of trucker dud I'm ooh I'm threading the needle going back to the water oh but this thing when a water shoots at you these things shoot at you oh I thought that was a tumbleweed it's not a tumbleweed I guess don't shoot at me okay going in the water one more time hanging out for a second no we're trying we're fine I'm not even I'm not even to fire yet so okay well that's desert desert is terrifying during the night so is is there a higher chance of villagers spawning in the desert or is it just that they're easier to see I think it's just easier to see probably okay deserts shot yeah so towards the lava is home okay got it so this this way then maybe like over over yonder in this direction straight on you're right that's what cut it's kind of where we came from I just drop a nametag from I just got a nametag from breaking a tumbleweed yeah get it get it get it get ready for this boy here comes here comes batter up batter up batter Oh woah woah what the heck you look terrifying what oh that's a that's a fiery boy nice defense though nice defense why am i sinking and unable to swim up what the heck I cannot swim up you should have worn your floaties dude dude I'm not kidding wait are you actually still stuck in there right yes oh god hold up come on you I literally can't swim up that's cool thanks for that game I have no idea oh I had wait two on me something gave me weight - and I just sunk this is cool wanna sleep we can sleep in onscroll okay all right yeah just roll on down the page over here flying thing please do not attack me flying thing please do not attack me okay we're fine big big fan of that hey man you know what at least your scroll should only take you to drowning again so oh good oh god there's a guy just watching me from up in the sky and it's kind of concerning me is it one of the air juice guys it's a the air elemental or whatever no no no it's like a big dragonfly I'm trying to get a name or anything about that trying to get a name on this boy right here quick what I can't seem to do so it's a CH and I'm in ground I'm mire mix oh it's a rather you know yeah yeah I'm gonna try it okay uh as fun as it is I need your help it's dark and you might be a mi grooves cool oh there you are so it's a it's a royal version of the boys who are in a fly okay yeah they're not actually attacking so just get rekt I guess yeah you're good you got see it's tough to collect I didn't pick any of it up I tried to be a kind friend you know yeah yeah I always said about you I know dude I know God deserts are terrible why are they freaking hot at night that's actually not accurate that's not true to life deserts get really cold at night generally most deserts yeah not necessarily guarantee idli nobody but quite often that would be good news I would appreciate that seems like water is a good place to do the fighting come on come on one one more hit one more hit all morning dawn there we go what do you give oh he levels he is a little dog oh he gave mega levels I better do some level ups right this second okay dude we're shade level up oh my god I can do so many levels right now I don't even know what didn't have you ever felt so many levels before now I've never felt this many levels in my life I don't know if I should do L or if I should do attack or if it should do oh I should level up agility so that I can do this yeah I'm gonna do a G leti boys here we go this is your compass that you wanted oh thank you bro I just got oh you know get out of here cinder oh there's another one it's because it's so hot out there's gotta be I think we're near some lava because we are near some lava oh yeah oh oh it spawns them it doesn't cause it yeah make us hotter them you know what though I do I can add a six kill point which is if I go into attack I can add the Frick I keep getting sidetracked by those dudes what I can do is I can get battle spirit which D monetising a monster will give you a short strength buff that's pretty dope unlocked and mining damage reduction highly increases the speed of obsidian mining while using a diamond pickaxe I see yeah I mean I guess I might as well unlock your right because I have six skill points I've done the other one and so unless it unlocks other things that you can do nice nice gathering for skill points attack two agility six he'll Walker after many a long journey and steep climb you reach a state of perpetual stepping up ha dude Oh Julie 32 never mind no can do that's a lot of agility or L can do yeah and you nowhere near that dude okay well we're sort of reaching the end of our time here so now that oh thanks to our wins also in that same description you can find a link to the playlist I was had to think through where I was going but I'll link to the playlist so you can catch up on any episodes where we also got bird if you happen to have missed any has anything you'd like to throw on to that sir no I think you covered it I'm hoping we'll be able to find a way stone at some point in the future because we came up dry this time man oh it's another desert different kind of desert over there many deserts alright the different desert it's just more to the same dude I don't know it looks like more of a different kind of sand desert well bed oh yeah the fancy fancy cactus well the fancy desert we'll check out the fancy desert next time around maybe see you guys [Music] you
