My mom told me everyday To always be careful of guys Because love is like playing with fire That can get you hurt, eh My mom might be right Because when I see you, my heart fires up My attraction towards you 
is greater than the fear, eh I can’t stop this rush On and on and on I want to put my all Into your world Look at me, look at me now Look at how you’re making me nervous I can’t put it out Our love is like playing with fire My love is on fire Now burn, baby burn Playing with fire My love is on fire So don’t play with me, boy Playing with fire Oh no, I’ve already come too far None of this is a game anymore Love is like a spark of fire Let the wind blow, the fire will grow Even my mom doesn’t know 
if this is medicine or poison He stole my heart, but where are the cops You’re like the oil poured on my burning heart Kiss him will I, diss him, I Don’t know but I miss him Beyond addiction, this love is like crack The color of my heart is black I can’t stop this rush On and on and on I want to put my all Into your fire Look at me, look at me now Look at how you’re making me nervous I can’t put it out Our love is like playing with fire My love is on fire Now burn, baby burn Playing with fire My love is on fire So don’t play with me, boy Playing with fire It’s raging out of control The fire is spreading too fast Don’t stop me So this love can burn the night away, whooo
