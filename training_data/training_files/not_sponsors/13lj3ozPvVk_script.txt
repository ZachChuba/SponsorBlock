there'll be more info on that at the end of the video now I want to talk with you about a storytelling tool often used in anime called the trope or it's the cliche as we all know common tropes exist in just about every anime but there are a few that I get really tired of singing which I've compiled in a fun little list of course there's nothing wrong with enjoying these tropes and just because an anime uses these tropes doesn't mean it's automatically bad I just personally am NOT a fan of them let me know what tropes you think are super annoying or even tropes that you appreciate harems I've never really been a fan of harem animes mainly because the main protagonist is always as boring looking an interesting guy who doesn't have any particularly interesting qualities it still catches the attention of like six different girls all with differing personalities you've got like the child's head friend the tokens and then a the lolly sometimes a little sister which is kind of weird the older mature type the rowdy energetic classmate and the almost human one and somehow they're all equally terrible at communicating their feelings to the main character also for some reason he's dense as a rock and can't figure out which girl he likes so he kind of just leads each of them on through 26 episodes I know harem protagonists are made to be basic and sort of like a blank slate so that the viewer can project themselves onto the character but it always ends up being kind of boring to watch soon that is soon that is a term for a character that is initially cold and hostile to their love interests in order to hide their true feelings but occasionally show a sweet warm lovey side in anime soon that a girl's are usually really violent and frequently beat up or berate their love interest so I know my most popular video on this channel is an animatic for a song dedicated entirely to this particular trope but I'm gonna be honest the violence in dinner is not really my thing there have been a few times where I really enjoyed the Sun did a trope like in the anime nichijou where they make fun of a trope by having the sooner I go to the extreme with heavy weaponry and guns which makes the interactions even more hilarious but however for the most part soon des and they're annoyingly oblivious love interests are more or less the same every time this trope is also the type that seems like it'd be really annoying to deal with in real life I've seen girls in real life try and emulate this personality but I found that it's not nearly as cute as it comes off in anime hey I baked some cookies last night and I had some extras so here uh-huh thank you these look great but but don't get the wrong idea I only packed you some because I had leftovers uh alright it's not because I like you or anything got it I didn't even say anything about that look if you're gonna change your mind you can have them back huh no way you've already dirtied the bag with your hands there's no way he'll take it back now okay that was excessively rude but I'll be sure to enjoy them don't expect me to do this all the time okay you're such an idiot what the hell I don't even want this anymore the way anime girls eat [Music] magical girl transformations I personally really enjoy magical girl anime but ever since I was a kid it would always confuse me whenever the main character did her super glamorous and lengthy transformation sequence and all that changed was the outfit and like some additional accessories not every magical girl anime is guilty of this of course but somehow everyone is completely oblivious to the heroes identity I like to imagine there's like one unimportant background character who's completely aware of who the main character is but nobody acknowledges them thank goodness Sailor Moon is here I wonder who's underneath that radiant persona okay you guys know that's Usagi right what no way huzzah he's clumsy and I'm motivated that's impossible are you serious they're literally the same person Oh silly background character you should really get your head checked so we're just gonna ignore the fact that they have like the exact same hair face and voice yep problems caused by miscommunication this trope seems to be a staple of the show - Jean WA and I cannot stand it there's nothing more frustrating than seeing the perspective of the two characters and being completely aware of their thoughts and how they can solve their misunderstanding but all you can do is sit there and painfully wait for them to have the conversation that should have happened eight episodes ago I heard momoka John's feelings and what the teller was all misunderstanding but she won't even look at me [Music] can I face him now I wish he'd understand how I feel momoko-chan listen to me sorry oh my god just talk to each other I can't sit through this for another five episodes it takes like two minutes to fix this misunderstanding so why can't you just communicate [Music] momoko-chan there's something I've been wanting to tell you what is it well I've always really loved what you guys talking about I'm really annoying and I'm gonna keep doing this until you finally get him alone in a more dramatic setting in the season finale which the fans are totally gonna wait for it cuz they're already way too emotionally invested in this relationship okay so now it's time for you to check out some anime to spot the tropes on your own and I suggest you to binge try out the 30-day free trial today and see how you like it
