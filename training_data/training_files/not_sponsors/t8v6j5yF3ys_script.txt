all right we're on 2020.24.6.1 we are entering a reduction in speed you can see up here up 35 it drops from 45 to 35 let's see how it responds in my in my experience it's been way better it's not perfect but it's leaps and bounds ahead of the old uh autopilot computer wait let's see is it gonna slow me down yeah slow me down see right there it waited till the light or not to the light tell the actual sign but it did it it did it and it and it did it at the at the right spot you'd think maybe would do it slightly in advance but it usually doesn't do that but the experience is way way better way smoother less jerky it doesn't forget most of the time like it did in the uh in the past or not recognized most of the time i mean the feature worked in the past but it didn't work well now it really works well i can say that for sure with the with the autopilot three hardware the full self-driving computer and the mcu2 all those upgrades i have and i gotta confirm here to go through the green light what's been your experience let me know in the comments below but i can say for sure it's not perfect remember but light years ahead of the old hardware which i had which was mcu-1 and the original self-driving computer which is nowhere near as fast and responsive as all this and that's that's the key i think it's fast and responsive hey we're going to go back at the 45 will bring us back up i don't think it brings us back up i manually oh yeah it does look well recognized it doesn't bring me back because i artificially lowered the speed myself i wanted to go down just a little bit slower anyway thumbs up on the bell for notifications and we'll see you in the next video you
