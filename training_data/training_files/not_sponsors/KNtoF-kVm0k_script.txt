[Music] [Music] at the time of making this video stranger things series 3 has just come out and it's maybe think about how nostalgia is often used to add a motive impact to contemporary arts and media it's been well documented that stranger things contains many blatant references to film such as et Stand By Me The Goonies aliens star wars poltergeist amongst others films that were popular when a certain Netflix demographic were young the topic of nostalgia is an interesting one and there is a key time in our lives when we're most affected by it our brains memory systems are at their most efficient during late adolescence this is a key developmental period where we often experience many things for the first time this is a period in our lives when we are forming an identity for ourselves finding our tribes working out who we are will form an attachment to music fashions ideas philosophies in an attempt to define ourselves and these attachments will stay with us our whole lives because when as adults were exposed to these things again our brains actually experience a dopamine release and it makes us feel good this is why every generation will swear that music was better when they were young and everything the next generation listens to is rubbish exposure as adults to musical styles that were popular during our adolescence or create a neurochemical reaction in our brains but what particular musical style disease is entirely subjective this propensity human beings have the nostalgia permeates our culture and often finds its way into the commercial world Fuji field cameras have attracted the attention of many photographers with their retro rangefinder designs Instagram filters became wildly popular with people adding a vintage look to their mobile phone shots simulating a film looking photo editing software is a very popular technique for photographers but this is often done placing less of an emphasis on matching a realistic look for specific film stocks and making the image as clean as possible in favor of recreating the imperfections of faded black heavy grain lightly his color casts evocative reminders of our family photo albums from the days of film and cheap consumer cameras nostalgia is powerful and it can trigger memories and feelings maybe also add a feeling of legitimacy to our work if we can make our photos gay than aesthetic reminiscent of those iconic photos of the past maybe this will help our photos appear as good nostalgia is such a powerful force but it's even hijacked for political as well as commercial game this is why we're not told to make America great but that we need to make America great again a statement designed to play on the idea of a fondly remembered past but the trouble with nostalgia is that its selective in what it remembers and the response is subjective to the person experiencing it in short it's not real it's merely a feeling and one that well then you resonate with a group of people for which those particular nostalgic triggers irrelevant stranger things may remind those of us who are young in the 1980s or a fun and carefree time in our childhood but the pre political correctness sexist homophobic and racist attitudes at the time don't really seem to be very present stranger things is the 1980s how we would like to remember it maybe how some of us experienced it from the naive and sheltered viewpoint of children the stranger things is good not because it relies on lost alger but because underneath is narrative building blocks are solid the characters have depth the plot is engaging in the direction is captivating and while it uses nostalgic elements it combines them and it builds on them to create something of substance to create something new fujifilm cameras are great but not because they have a nostalgic look they're great because while they've cherry picked a few of the good things with the old rangefinder cameras such as the manual control dials they are underneath good cameras they produce high quality images they have a ton of useful contemporary features such as autofocus with face tracking touchscreens 14 frames per second burst rates 4k video of course you don't need to wind back the film and reload another one every 36 shots or wait while you send your photos off to the lab to be developed my point here is that value is created in things by embracing the you while it's important to study the groundbreaking an iconic photographic work of the past we won't move forward by simply attempting to emulate someone else's style we've already got cartier-bresson we've already got Vivian Mayer Dorothea Lange Ansel Adams we don't need them again groundbreaking work from the past was groundbreaking because it broke ground because it was doing something new photography that excites me these days is when I see something new when I see approaches that I haven't seen before and I think this resonates with me so much because firstly it expands my understanding of what photography can be and secondly it feels authentic drawing on stars from the past can be a great creative tool and it may even be necessary for you as those are the things that formed who you are today and how you see the world but there's a big difference between drawing on your own experiences of the past and simply trying to recreate it there's a vast difference between inspiration and imitation don't limit yourself by thinking only in the world of photographic styles and genres that already exist maybe find something you're passionate about that doesn't have a photographic style associated with it and work out how photography could be used to communicate a message about it try being led by the subjects and what you want to say not by a style that already exists nostalgic style can be used to great effect to communicate a message but style without substance creates work that fades from memory pretty quickly oh it's really hot in London at the moment oh
