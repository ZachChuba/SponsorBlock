magnetic induction or key Chargers let you just plunk down your phone on a little pad to get juiced up which is really cool way better than wires but they only work over very short distances and they need to be correctly aligned for optimal efficiency well what if I told you that there's a better way what if I told you that this speaker right here and these trains going around me are all being powered by that space eg looking light fixture up there that there is the prototype of why charges long-range wireless power delivery system and holy is this thing ever cool [Music] Kable mods configurator service makes it documentation check it out at the link below so this right here is the transmitter and although I guess technically it could work if we just plugged it in while I'm holding it I definitely get tired of hauling it around and also this is the only prototype in existence that can deliver the amount of power that we are going to need today so if I dropped it that would be pretty tragic I wouldn't do that deploying the transmitter is surprisingly simple if you have a drop ceiling so this prototype is actually held in place by these magnets oh and zip ties this is for quick and easy testing but production models should have more permanent fixtures once it secured all we need to do is plug it into a regular DC power source okay so this light right here is just a regular light and then this one around the rim is more of a status indicator so while it's booting up it blinks blue and then once it's green it means that it's actually good to go the really cool tech though is actually this black bit in the middle which is an infrared window behind which is an IR transmitter and then this right here is also an infrared window and behind that is a receiver so if I just put this let's say for example right here and it does need line-of-sight yeah there's a second look so if I just take this phone and place it let's say right here on my ladder and boom it's charging and if you look up here the status indicator changes to solid blue but how is it doing that from up top the transmitter is actually projecting some very high energy infrared light and the receiver is basically like a solar panel so there's a special photovoltaic cell in here that is tuned to the infrared beam that the transmitter is outputting and now I know what you guys are thinking I was thinking the same thing it's this entire room being blasted with infrared radiation right about now am I gonna turn into like a mutant more importantly will night TV remote stop working the answer is no not at all so the receiver has a very specific signature that the transmitter looks for and when it sees it it shoots out a very thin IR beam basically like a laser directly at the receiver which is pretty cool but what makes it loads better is the transmitters ability to track a moving receiver so I thought that this demo was smoke and mirrors when I first saw it back at Computex last year but these trains right here can be fully powered by the transmitter up in the ceiling giving you some idea of how quickly your phone or your other device could be moving around the room and still be powered and/or charging and to prove that the trains have no batteries the instant the beam is broken the train stopped once line of sight has been restored it just takes a second or two and then power transmission will resume this means that there's no way for a person or like your eyes or something to be exposed to the high-energy beam and the FDA and other international safety regulators have already given it the seal of approval plus you get to feel like a magician okay so what you're probably wondering now though is how much power can it actually deliver well why charge brought two different models here there's this smaller one that seemed more like Internet of Things applications this can deliver about one watt while having a smaller footprint making a little more subtle then there's the larger one that we put on the ceiling that can do up to three watts so this is one of their receivers hooked up to a speaker not bad but if we try to go to high Punk's out a little bit now let's hook up a larger receiver that they've got here this one does one-and-a-half watts and see how much louder we can go [Music] not bad that's too shy of max volume but I mean if we're being entirely honest here that's still not a whole ton of power and like if I wanted to charge my phone or heaven forbid a tablet a watt and a half isn't a ton and putting a case like this on it is probably not that practical fortunately this guy is more of a proof of concept and why charges first commercial product makes a lot more sense so this guy right here is a Qi charger with regular USB on the underside that can be placed anywhere in the room and still receive power so for something like a coffee shop they could offer charging at their tables without running cords every single one of them and that way if someone wants to relocate the table to sit with their friends it's totally not a big deal they would just kind of go like that and bippity Boppity when it is wirelessly charging what makes it really well integrated is the fact that it's it's actually in the table like this like obviously we're not gonna drill a big hole in our table in order to do that right now and the fact that it has a battery inside it so that acts as a buffer so that battery can trickle charge all day and all night and then when someone plugs in or puts their phone down on the pad it'll be able to charge at more than just you know three quarters of a watt and it won't matter if somebody you know is in the middle of a really really you know fascinating conversation and blocks the beam for a little while and this is just the beginning I'm really excited to see where this tech is going I mean just how much power will they be able to get out of these systems in the future good receivers just be built right into your phone or tablet and a little with a little you know window right there I mean that would allow your device to trickle charge all day long if you're in range of a transmitter maybe this will finally be the solution to what has been the biggest problem with smartphones those pesky headphone jacks no not those battery life thermal RGB variant check it out today
