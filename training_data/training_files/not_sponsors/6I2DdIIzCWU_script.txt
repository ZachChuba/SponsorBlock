why hello there my name is 25 buttholes and today we begin the journey on our new challenge which will be killing low-level black chin hunters until we obtain 10,000 black chins this time we have a magic level of 71 and a combat level of 42 with the combination of the tome of fire and the occult necklace we will be able to hit - max hit of 33 with fire wave but given the fact that we are only one prayer we will be risking nearly 1 million four hundred thousand coins each time that we die but before some love boys now back to the gun show now boys let's be honest there is nothing better than a ketchup sandwich and a bottle of toothpaste but one banging these dumbass gold farmers is nearly equally as satisfying ever since I unlocked fire wave I've been taking over the chin Hill by storm I almost feel like I have shifted into a legendary status among the gold farming community as soon as they step into the wilderness it's like they can feel my savage breath savage breath even down the back of their skinny necks you clowns shall die 1000 deaths for trying to steal my precious chins take a look at this chin collector who thinks he has outsmarted me because he has protect from magic but luckily I know like you know these gold farmers have the attention span of a shot this biker boy thought he was safe and dropped his protection prayers and that's when I slapped him with a massive fire wave around the trees to the back of the neck let the chin harvest begin boys let the chin harvest begin in between hunting down these chin collectors I came across a lot of low-level jackers who were trying to copy my savage methods and make a profit off of my gold farmers this clown by the name of mega doodoo probably watched my last video and thought he would copy my techniques sorry doodoo boy but killing these gold farmers isn't going to be as easy as the professional YouTube gamers like myself make it look ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hoo wow I have a lot of people who have been questioning my savage abilities I even have some dumbasses who try to threaten me and tell me that my clips are fake but I just take that as a compliment you know that you have reached legendary status once clowns start calling your Clips fake let's be clear right here boys faking clips is for losers and I and the winner from this point on I'm declaring myself the best peak heir of all time but you boys already knew that house house house house house house house house house house haha Wow stacking up them chins boys we are stacking up them chins this clip right here is living proof that these gold farmers have little turn no idea what in the hell is even going on around them I started slapping up this annoying noob with some massive fire waves to the neck yet this clueless weasel put on his protect from missiles I'm sorry weasel boy but the correct prayer would be protect from magic good fight you stupid man you deserve this death you deserve this death ha ha ha ha ha Wow oh crap boys look we have another jacker who's trying to jack some of my savage profits this guy by the name of tosser II thought that just because he had done a bunch of quests on his low-level account that he was going to have some kind of up her hand on accounts his level in these savage streets take this you quest point shot I'm sorry to break it to you tosser II but your methods are outdated and garbage bye-bye little Billy maybe you should consider doing monkey madness and then talk to the guy who [ __ ] up your account forever and I know you boys know exactly which guy I am talking about cut out out out out out out ha ha ha Wow oh my god boys I just won banged my wife tell tell tell tell tell ha ha oh my god boys looks like we have a runner I'm gonna slap his neck boys I'm gonna slap his neck just when this nine-to-five sweatshop shattered thought he was going to make his break I twisted his ankles with my massive snare it's time you turned back to dust little man I delivered a slap that was so massive that it completely decimated his hit points I swear there is no better feeling than slapping someone down for all of their hit points in one slap except for maybe having someone blow cigarette smoke into your eyeballs either way we stopped another criminal for a buttload of black chins and those chins to the bank boys add them to the bank oh and I guess and another 82 chins to the bank as well because it's time we turn up on these Jim Carrey Psychopaths I need everybody at home to follow these precise instructions go to the bathroom and grab your father's one blade big crazy take the big razor and shave the line directly down the middle of your head now take a bottle of hydroperoxide and pour it directly into your eyeballs this is how to place the grand tree in real life now boys many of you are probably familiar with the term what goes around comes around because what is about to come around to this gold farmers bodyguard is something that not even decima could have predicted while I was in the middle of busting down another criminal I was ambushed by this level 72 thought that he was so cool because he killed someone who was level 40 [Music] I was so furious that I made some collect calls and came back five minutes later on one of my mains you want to pick on low levels but it's time you say hello to my giant more but being the New Age noob this clown was he started doing that classic run around the tree and hide [ __ ] I then let one of the hybrid bodyguard know that his tree hiding days are coming to an end just look at this cocky little cowboys response oh it's cool all right just about as cool as their small going straight into the back of your skull even though I was lagging I was still able to completely demolish this Bill Clinton wanker down and oh boys would you look at that I smited him down at the very last second hahahahahahaha Wow remember boys what goes around comes around thanks Goblin boy for the free dragon crossbow maybe next time you should consider cutting willow trees instead of trying to be a gold farmers bodyguard cut out out out out out out out out out out ha ha ha it's going to take quite some time to collect 10,000 black chintz from these gold farmers but I will not let that get in the way of what needs to be done once I reach 10,000 black chins I will then be throwing a massive drop party for the free-to-play players in Lumbridge ha ha ha just kidding I will be using all of the profits to reimburse myself for how many times I lost an occult necklace and a tome of fire while making these dumbass videos at the end of the series we will calculate the total amount gained and the total amount lost but let me assure you boys no low-level dark Bo clown like this is going to get his sweaty fingers on my massive stack say good night Ranger boy I gave you the opportunity to get off you should have listened hahahahahahahahaha Wow speaking of Bill Clinton take a look at this clown by the name of Baby Templar who was trying to copy my savage methods even though I was ten levels lower than this clown I was still able to slap him out with the quickness without any problem and let me tell you boys I got a lot of problems but a dumbass gold farmer ain't one take a look at the massive combos I lay down on this biker boy it's almost hard to believe that a level 42 can slap somebody this hard thanks Tim Allen boy for the free 450 K I'll add that to my chest of black chins we're really stacking up those chins boys we're gonna be rich in no time Riano Keith's nice name biter boy but even your protect from magic is no match for my slaps to your redneck hahahaha hahahaha Wow for those of you who are considering making an account such as this one just know that these clips in this video took no more than a total of around four hours of filming I found that in the early morning times on weekdays is when the wilderness is filled with the most gold farmers where at night times it becomes a bit more vacant unfortunately since I was turnt up off that loud I forgot to press record when I received my biggest chin peak I of the video but just know that I won banged him with a 31 straight to the dome for a total of 291 black chins hahahaha hahahaha wow thanks for the free 720 K cocky boy this will be a nice addition to my black chain collection luckily for us all of the chin collectors in the morning Pacific Standard Time all appeared to have much larger stacks of chins and the whole community laughs together as we snatch them back from these pirates all in all I would say that for episode 1 we made a serious impact into the black King gold farming community for the name of Putin maniacs 7 is now ringing bells all along China Venezuela and the United States take a look at that turtle loot boys 1308 black chins and a total loot of 6.8 million coins given the fact that I died four times I managed to still profit out of this episode with around 1 million two hundred thousand coins but this series isn't about the profit that I personally make it's about the black money that I confiscate from these black market criminals who multiply within our savage community like cancer cells I hope you boys truly enjoyed this episode and stick around to see us achieve our end goal of 10,000 black chins also boys please make sure you click the link and
