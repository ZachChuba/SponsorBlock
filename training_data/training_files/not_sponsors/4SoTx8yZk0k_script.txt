hello and welcome to tweets from the class number 25. that's right 25 beautiful episodes of tweets from the class answering all your questions and figuring out things that we just normally couldn't do in a regular old etiquette lesson speaking of which uh i've done well over a hundred etiquette lessons so to have 25 of these kind of shows you how much i care about your questions moving along i put together a little montage of all my favorite moments from episodes past so please enjoy and play hey i'm having a really great time i wish you were here i really wish you were here my website got hacked uh it just says [ __ ] all over the website i think it was koreans oh [ __ ] [Music] oh sniff that it's at the prank oh my god this is the prank bro wow i've got goosebumps of nostalgia and i'm hard as a rock now i've noticed you guys asking a lot of questions about what goes on behind the scenes of being an etiquette teacher and normally i don't like pulling that curtain back too far because you lose some of the magic if you know how the sausage is made well now that i'm out of analogies for this let me just say that i'm going to let you guys ask whatever question you want about my process let's see some tweets from rch to killer what's your blood alcohol level while you give your lessons let's find out [Music] zero oh sorry that's not the most interesting answer for you our ch2 killer which is why i'm gonna get [ __ ] hammered during this episode and then we'll see what the results are later all right let's see if we can speedrun this [ __ ] onto the tweets from extreme eight trd27 what's your morning routine uh that's a great question extraman 828 tr27 uh here's my response my morning routine is when the sun comes up i'm still awake from the night before surrounded by empty bottles and still bong smoke while playing video games and ignoring my responsibilities and then i go to bed and sleep until 5 pm and you got answered for maya tries how do you determine what is worthy of being part of the curriculum that's a great question maya tries well what i do is i feed each topic into a very advanced ai computer mechanism and then that extrapolates information from it and tells me exactly how my audience will respond for instance that dr dewormer video from earlier this month well my ai predicted that people would tune in for about 30 seconds before running straight to the comment section to question my journalistic integrity that's exactly what happened he's chilling for fouchy now looking kind of red in the face side effects alternate title overweight boomer thinks he is better smarter and knows more than anyone keep at it i guess this channel is as far as i have time or interest to go on the [ __ ] side of the internet you never knew you were a shill well as they say knowing is half the battle unsubscribing if bias was a person and then gave a youtube channel water is deadly if you drink too much doesn't mean water isn't meant for humans plenty of doctors prescribe ivor mexico unsubscribe sucks that you're more stupid than funny who started watching this guy before he became awoke marxist bigot where all my og's at yup that's me woke marxist bigot salvia anyway here's my favorite comment what the [ __ ] eric if you're gonna mock people for falling for fake news the least you could do is not spread it yourself the story about a hospital being flooded with ivermectin poisoning was fake you can look this up right and the story that you're talking about is actually from oklahoma where they said that the gunshot victims were lined up outside the hospital that was fake news that was never in my video in my video the story is coming from florida and it's about 27 people who did end up in the hospital you can look that up you also didn't properly look into merck's statement on ivermec the patent foreign mectin has long expired this is less profitable for them because anyone else can manufacture and sell at a competitive low prices versus merck having exclusive rates and selling it whatever prices they wish well yeah of course i remember i showed merck's statement saying not to take ivermectin i thought that was a valid thing to show in a video about ivermectin what's his point this statement also very conveniently neglects to disclose how merkel signed a 356 million dollar deal to provide the u.s with a brand new drug for coving which they will have the patent for oh that's so so careless of me how could i be so careless to not mention this merc the oh wait i did merc to supply us government with oral antiviral drug used to treat kovitt i guess he just didn't see that part of the video even though it's a whole six seconds later so you basically took their marketing maneuver at face value do your research am i right do my research i mean i did do my research i think i did the same research as you because every issue you had here is in my video so i don't know i don't know what the [ __ ] people are so mad about i did my due diligence i defended iver mekton i also talked about why it's stupid um i don't see the uh you know the other side complaining like a bunch of [ __ ] but man you people [ __ ] christ shameful is why nobody likes you well super ready to hate the [ __ ] out of this video when i clicked on it raffle wound up dropping a like instead great job on not taking the brain dead approach i was fully expecting and that's what happens when you watch the [ __ ] video from average julian how do you deal with troublesome students i'll show you one sec hang on 0.5 still good to drive all right i'll show you okay now i'll show you let's go back to the doctor dewormer video is no one going to say anything about the fact that ivermectin comes in a chemical composition for horses but the one that was actually being referenced was the drug for humans i said it at 14 seconds 2 minutes 50 seconds and in 3 minutes 15 seconds i play about a minute and a half of a doctor describing how it works against viruses and humans but i can see why it's easy to miss when all you want to hear are things you have hip pocket arguments against or you're just a bot in which case please thank your creator for the engagement and ad revenue and reply so yeah to answer your question i just get hammered and then shame them publicly in a video that's going to be seen by like hundreds of thousands of people next tweet from haunted world they teach how do you know when a lesson is too much for the class to handle or was that one lesson i was going to do that was just called pigs and it was all about pigs and then i fed it into my ai machine and it was like people are not going to like this you're going to get in a lot of trouble eric i was like what what do you mean i guess people are sensitive about pigs i don't i don't know i don't get it well they're just pigs you don't gotta feel bad for them feel bad for their wives all right next tweet from oof post how often should i have a sponsor break in my classroom like you i have some amazing sponsors but i have received calls that is unprofessional and that we pay you to teach not to sponsor your class it's all about timing my dear oof post the segue is an art to be mastered you must pick the absolute perfect moment like extending a melody by changing the key reveal your sponsor too soon and they'll skip through too late and they'll abandon the class now go get yourself paid and tweet all right well now you all know what time it is that's right it's time for the next tweet from bill leheka hey teach how hard do you prepare like do you take hours days months years also could this question segue into an ad nope sorry still not the right time okay what's the next tweet from barnell wren what are some of the best scrapped video ideas you've had in the past oh great question barn already you know i've always wanted to do a video on the mandela effect it's such a fascinating phenomenon maybe one of these days i'll get the right angle for it but until then it's just a dream all right next tweet from tealpage413 who's paying you now that you've been booted off the society angry ivermectin fans who let all my pre-roll ads play while they type asinine comments about things they're just assuming or not in my video about ivermectin and reply from fat crab hey teach genuine question what is your criteria for picking out questions is it whatever makes you laugh or think or is it just a whim as you read them well let me give you a genuine answer for a genuine question there is a strict protocol that goes into tying all of these unpredictable tweets together to form a cohesive story and hopefully a lesson i make sure every tweet i answer is important to that central theme of a greater story and reply all right awesome question and the next tweet is i'm fat and gay oh [ __ ] hey this lesson is brought to you by nordvpn.com big money [Music] well johnson it was a good run while it lasted

careless i simply had no idea people would be upset that everything they do online is being tracked well unless they use nordvpn.com big money and you know what those people did yeah they went to nordvpn.com big money for huge savings on a two-year subscription and they got four months for free because they signed up today don't forget about that 30-day money-back guarantee makes me sick twit

on reddit reddit is the least funny website on the internet if i ever have to go to reddit for this show i'm filtering out 99 of the things i see it's just the same lord of the rings jokes over and over again i i don't even want to try to remember the other running jokes that they're on reddit because it i think honestly made me stupider to see them anytime they pop up i don't know what the [ __
