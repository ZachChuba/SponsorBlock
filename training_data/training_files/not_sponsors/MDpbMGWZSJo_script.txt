things are looking a little dark for our Napa's they thought margin go home was bad wait till you see how intelligent a subarashii can get [Music] hey guys massacre axe here with the days getting darker and the Knights drawing in we are back with some old classics of the what-if universe two of the biggest good boys around almost literally in fact have taken center stage to provide some very nice vibes in a time when things are getting quite chilly a little nippy the autumn months on this channel things are all about grand journeys for characters that sees their fortunes change for the better and some for the good when they become better people or you could say turn good now yes one of the most meta subjects on this very channel comes from one character becoming a good guy and they were originally not so good a guy and today's subject is of course nappa what if he instead of being bald and bad was good but still bald and there's nothing wrong with being bald Krillin can attest to that I'm very fully aware that this trope is a little tired right now but we feel that this whole idea is something very fascinating to explore because it's part of Dragon Balls history when you look at it half at the cast and that's almost not an exaggeration started off as villains to Goku in the team and antagonists to the main cast and crew again mostly Goku but they do transfer their allegiance to the other site here through clarity driven moments and motivations or simply for the act of self-preservation it's usually the latter but it's still something that has been used time and time again within the series to make it feel organic a plot point and I believe it will continue to do so in the years to come people will become good faced with a whopping from Goku that's for sure I think anyone would all you got to do really is just say sorry to the guy in your home free in the last pod cafe Napa's current girlfriend had to come to terms with the fact that her boyfriend was going to be a bit of a handful to handfuls in fact both present and future Napa have once again found themselves in the same place and the same time and things got pretty heated thanks to the trials of the future at the hands of Gohan black not Goku black this time around and despite future nappa being a very old man at this point he had managed to avert the signs of aging for Saiyans by basically becoming even more of a cyborg than he was when we first saw him back in this cell saga he had even gained the powers of the elder Kai with his potential Unleashed and became ultimate nappa Gohan Black has found our heroes and is about to face the two large men before then having to have to come face to face with the idea that is Gohan from the present keen to show his future self that he is no pushover he will fight for his friends now before we get started theme design in the future thank you for listening as we left our scene we saw both present and future nappa ready to defend Earth from the menace of the future but there was something that got in the way of that at least for the moment or few moments our Gohan was keen to show that he wasn't going to let some interloper who would dare to look like him do something so cruel something he wouldn't do this had personally upset Gohan and he was keen to make amends in the only way he knew best in place in time that is unfortunately for him though it has nothing to do with conferences he has charged forward and begun the struggle our heroes are witnessing a strange view before their very eyes we have two girl hands in the middle of the sky fighting each other in a very dire showdown one wearing a very casual type of attire and the other in a very dark and regal sort of martial arts costume it's a little surreal but nobody is taking this lightly not at all future nappa is beyond worried Gohan it's too dangerous let us handle it no me wait let the kid do its thing he's got a point to prove president nappa stops talking and watches his affected nephew do the rest as of this point in the battle neither of them have gone super saiyan it's a little tense because of it it seems like they're both sizing each other up in their base forms to gauge what to do next this means that the power gap is in a la masia right well perhaps perhaps not but then the situation quickly changes when our Gohan realizes that he can't just tie this guy down like this anymore he can't just keep doing the same thing he has no choice he would have to overpower his enemy and either force them to flee or well you know now remember this version of present adult Gohan has never fully realized the ultimate form unlike the Gohan from the original timeline in this version of events the circumstances were much more dire on the sacred world of the Kai's so things didn't really happen the way they did so he needs to rely on good old-fashioned power-ups it is however more than enough to give blacks some sort of a beatdown it's not all you know bad Gohan black is very intrigued by all of this tussling not bad it's quite refreshing to be fighting someone who was actually thinking they always said that if you want things done right you should do it yourself exactly says I'll go home back that's why I plan to end this myself Gohan black simply laughs at this show up bravado and the battle continues with our Gohan surprising black with a up close must Senko during the bite Burris then notices something is a little peculiar with the brand new iteration of Gohan he remarks about how this other Gohan ski feels very different shouldn't this energy signature be the same as our Gohan or incredibly similar oh yes it is rather strange that this other Gohan can handle himself so well against the Super Saiyan Gohan of all things with justice base form this is clearly more interesting than I thought it would be asus is getting longer and longer the two Nappers have now formed a consensus Gohan has had his chance to make a point and they now both want to help and fight off the intruder but Goku asked them not to intervene goku still thinks that our Gohan has got something going that he would rather not have the other Nappers get in the way of the father have gone believes r go on is in deep trying to strategize and learn more about them some mysterious opponent and then do something he's indeed correct goku fully understands what his son's plan is all about now as in the original arc with goku black the matchup is cut short thanks to a little thing called time distortion getting in the way with very little warning Gohan black feels a massive pain in his chest and he also gets sucked back into the time portal in the end leaving the fight undecided much to the disappointment and annoyance of future nappa and Gohan black also stills destroys the time machine on his way out I'm afraid but this future Natha is left devastated the nappa from another world knows exactly what this means total annihilation for the remaining survivors in his timeline with nobody to defend them now he can't get back things will fall apart and Gohan black will have exactly what they want just left for them to take whenever they want this can't end like this it just can't everyone else is trying to feel out the situation as they notice that Gohan blacks ki kept growing during the fight yeah it's a good thing that time had decided to correct itself there and then because if it hadn't then things might have meant that more of them would have had to get involved into the mix to ensure what happened in the future doesn't happen here Gohan notices that he didn't really use his techniques and while strong he seemed not used to one-on-one fights this doesn't make any sense how could someone who looks like me not know a single thing about how I fight this is getting weirder by the second like in the original the group also had the whole conversation about the time rings and how they work and how they're of different ones and this must mean that more of them have been created without proper guidance and beerus for once is glad that the time machine has been destroyed effectively stopping the mortals from making more time rings time traveling and other types of shenanigans or any shenanigans sorry Bomber Ben reveals that she still has the time machine used by cell but it still needs some repairs feature nappa is then left feeling a little less crestfallen by this news but he is still concerned that with every passing second all this time stuck in the past it could lead to trouble later on at the end of the day the present dragon team become very clear in their thoughts they're going to need to help their future compatriot if this is the kind of thing that will affect the past they need to help fight for the future and as a result everyone is training to prepare for the confrontation with black however there are two people that are going to have to provide some kind of mind training for the likes of Caffe she's gonna have to understand all this so during the break both Nappers explained to cafe or at least try to explain to her everything that has transpired regarding go hump black and the like in more detail now as she has finally been able to have some time to fully grasp the gravity of the situation even more it's not something that she takes with little reaction it is obviously shaken her to the core alternate alternate times time travel it's a bit much for even her open mind and despite nappa and wanting her to relax she simply cannot handle this she quickly departs being overwhelmed present nappa understandably tries to follow her but his future counterpart tells him to give her time this is a lot for her probably she's had to take in decades of knowledge of a few minutes she'll be all right so we should probably focus at the task in hand there is a pause future Napa then decides to try and ease the tension and sadness at this point that his present self is probably feeling right now so I see things have been good for you huh he says when they were alone yeah I'd like to believe that even but Gina got slightly better yeah you keep telling me that but I see that your rage is starting to catch up with you if it weren't from my mechanical parser I probably be in no shape to fight not many singers get to this point in their lives they yeah we're really old Hey we fight as long as we can old man look who's talking the two Cheryl off they realized that while they have indeed trained a lot they should probably get some rest future Napa then gets introduced to Vidal Pan and even with some money he's granted to the androids he can however feel that 17 and 18 are living better lives and that these two iterations of the future ne'er-do-wells are nothing like them 17 here is my bestest buddy now future me we drive huge cars together future Napa rolls his eyes but deep inside he tries to imagine how it is to drive a really big car at the end of the day though he enjoys all this time in the past with his old and now new friends he admits to his present self later on that he kinda needed this just some ease and relaxation he needed to remember that there was some kind of peace somewhere to fight for and that it wasn't all doom and gloom despite it looking like it was from his times point of view they end the day with present Napa showing off his garden Oh after all this is over maybe I should get one too I can pack you some saplings if you want I'm sure the ground could do with some fresh foliage after all the trouble blacks caused dead meanwhile Goku Gohan beerus and whis go to universe 10 as the key track has led them there they go straight for the sacred world of the Kai's instead universe and soon enough discover the likes of Zama Sioux and go ah sue Zama sue is not very happy seeing all these wattles here when they're not supposed to be but go us who stops him from any action we see gets go are soo up to speed with what has happened and that they are here conducting a simple investigation nothing major and they simply just want to check the time rings and see if they're there none of them are missing sure enough like before Goku really wants to check out samus his power having sensed it was pretty big but Gohan interjects that he wants to be the first one to check it out having actually had some first-hand experience with it the fight seems to be pretty even that is until Gohan go super saiyan he informs him that it's a first for him to finally be going toe-to-toe with a god since his father fought beerus after all samus who seems very concerned about all of this this seems weird this mortal seems too confident and not at all scared to be facing by the likes of him and in the end Gohan wins the duel leaving Goku just to observe the whole thing which leaves him very unsatisfied well I could've beat him too they return to the present suspecting Samus ooh that is everyone except Goku and of course Goku gets summoned by Zeno and is given the Zeno button that it's still in meanwhile the two Nappers used the time they have together in order to boost the Cheetahs power he's still a little behind the rest of the gang to be fully reliable and useful and what doesn't help that all of this is the fact that he is not at all a fan of having a double of being his trainer but he does recognize that both of them are clearly stronger than him at this point so he has to be quiet on this occasion besides he really wants to close the gap between himself and the others and be able to train with we stack is his goal he's got his eyes on the prize meanwhile Brar observes the whole thing it makes future nappa realize even more that his friends in the future are in danger and that he must give his all to save it finally the group is ready to travel Gohan both nappa San Goku are the ones that will travel into the future and yes bomber did ensure that it had more space the time machine when the machine is fixed given the number of people who are going to be travelling to numbers up b-big after all they are surprised of how bleak and grim the future is yeah this is home and in the rubble of the building they find future bra and bomber they are alive but barely luckily Goku has brought some sensor beans they used them to bring them back from the brink of passing they all head on for the HQ of the Earth's resistance slowly trying to prepare against their enemy and that's where we're going to be leaving things for right now so what do you guys think will this team of sales be able to face off Gohan black before he goes rose' if he indeed can and how old Goku react when he finds out he was wrong about everything leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
