so it it's a truck a cyber truck [Music] I came straight here to the studio from the Salt Lake City Airport after my one-day trip to Hawthorne Los Angeles where I visited the SpaceX headquarters know why SpaceX well at the back of a narrow little alley is the Tesla design studio where a number of retro futuristic cars and a Tesla coil adorned the campus prior to the unveiling of Tesla's long-awaited electric pickup truck there were cars like the actual DeLorean borrowed from Universal Studios that was used in the Back to the Future films as well as wet Nellie the submarine convertible Lotus Esprit from the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved me that interestingly enough Elon Musk purchased for his own personal collection back in 2013 as well as a number of other movie props from Blade Runner and various other sci-fi films this all prepared me for a bit of a futuristic car but but it didn't prepare me for four well this this video is link below and stay tuned for more info later in the video in a bit of an odd intro really only fit for the unorthodox musk Milan took the stage he began talking about the importance of trucks in American culture and that styling has changed very little over the last several decades in his words quote Tesla has to make a truck and quote and mention that the three best selling vehicles in North America are and have been for many years all pickups quoting that over 1.5 million trucks have been sold a year to date after harping on Tesla's platform of sustainability he got to the unveiling of the very much anticipated set what the hell is this thing were my first thoughts as this monstrosity rolled on the stage I was absolutely convinced that this was not real life or that it was a prop that they had made for some movie but nope that was indeed the real cyber truck we'll talk about the looks and the design and my test drive in a minute but I feel like we really need to capture something important here first the construction namely the cold rolled stainless steel door panels which they demoed the strength of by well hitting a standard truck door with a sledgehammer which unsurprisingly did not fare too well and then the same followed on the cyber truck door which actually seemed to take the beating without a hitch they also demoed what they called Tesla armored glass by dropping a steel ball now some 10 feet or so on to the panel's without a fracture which was pretty cool at least until they decided to do what seemed at least to me to be a bit of an impromptu demo by watching the steel ball at one of the windows and oh whoops to make matters worse they did it again on the next window and that one broke too awkward demo fail aside it really does look like strong glass but it just seemed to put a bit of a damper on the rest of the unveiling and the truck sat there on stage for 20 minutes with broken windows but the overwhelming theme of the presentation in my opinion what Tesla was trying to convey was that unlike most other trucks which have kind of foregone utility in favor of luxury and flamboyance this car is allegedly built tough that you can throw tools in a clearer lessly that you can run it through trails with sharp branches that you can take it through water etc and actually kind of dig the whole cyberpunk vibe when considering those factors but I think that there's something way more import that musk didn't really talk about on stage and that is simplifying manufacturing and lowering build cost it wasn't really until after the event that Tesla talked about how the flat glass is cheaper the stainless steel body panels and exoskeleton are structural rather than using a traditional body-on-frame which according to musk has a number of advantages structurally but the one that stood out to me the most was that it greatly reduced production costs and it also means that the car comes in presumably one color silver because save for the bumpers which appear to be a powder-coated black steel there's no paint on the vehicle it's just stainless steel so I guess that fixes Tesla's notorious paint problems hey my Twitter poll concluded that many people love the new truck but that most either hate it or are split on it and I fall into that latter camp on the other hand the materials that they're using to cut down on production costs are now they're unusual and I think it might look super ugly if they tried to take these materials and make a normal looking truck so why not embrace the weirdness of the materials you have and go for some raw utilitarian unfinished cyberpunk vibe I don't know the design is not for everyone I'm not really sure it's for me but I certainly respect that it's different and I absolutely respect that it's been done to cut down massively on production costs because it helps Tesla offer the vehicle to customers at its sub $40,000 starting price point with the fully loaded model going for just under $70,000 that's not just inexpensive for a six-seater electric vehicle that's inexpensive for a modern pickup truck period it's less than what I paid for my tiny model 3 performance just a year ago and it's especially impressive with the specs that it offers zero to 60 and as well as 2.9 seconds which is ludicrously fast 14,000 pounds max towing capacity which beats every single gasoline pickup there is rivaling even the best of the heavy duty diesel power plants has a 3,500 payload capacity variable air suspension and a six and a half foot bed which is longer than all three of the best-selling trucks on the market the f-150 base the Silverado and the Ram 1500 it also promises 500 plus miles of range on the tri-motor trim which presumably requires a massive 150 kilowatt hour battery and likely pushes the vehicle weight north of 6000 pounds you know I saw a lot of people say that this truck was just too small and I think that a lot of the photos are misleading because this thing is massive let me demonstrate with this terribly blurry photo that someone took for me I have a six foot six inch wingspan and I can't even reach from the back of the cab to the tailgate it is a huge huge freaking truck so I got to go for a short test ride in this vehicle and I have some thoughts the seating position is very tall especially for a Tesla but even for a truck and part of that is thanks to the chunky 35 inch wheels now while I didn't drive it I did get to feel the suspension and feel the ride and it was kind of mind-blowing most trucks have pretty firm suspension and cyber truck was very much the opposite it was pretty softly sprung and because of the massive 35 inch wheels it felt crazy smooth I mean our driver intentionally drove over a curb to do a u-turn and it would barely felt a thing I mean this is like the ultimate neighborhood speed bump killer road noise was also surprisingly quiet despite rapidly pushing past 70 miles per hour on the los angeles city streets that we test drove on this was only the jewel motor model which does zero to 60 in just four point five seconds super slow right I know but it actually felt faster than my zero to 60 in the model three performance which is about 3.2 seconds because under acceleration unlike the rest of Tesla's cars the truck kind of squats back and the nose of the car faces upward it's almost like a boat that hasn't planed yet you might think that that would make it feel a little bit sloppy but it really didn't it kind of had a bit of a rally truck v to it it could lean and shift and dip and it just felt great though I'm gonna be honest I suspect that this is probably going to change once we start mirroring production because they're going to need the truck to actually start towing stuff the tires were quiet and the cabin actually seemed really well sealed and the seats holy crap the seats were fantastic I think the Volvo West front seats in my Model 3 are just about some of the best car seats I've ever sat in but the cyberpunk truck Seibert truck puts them to shame they were well bolstered but crazy plush even in the backseat where I was I still had several inches of headroom above me to the glass slab roof which is great because I'm not very short at six foot four and my knees didn't even get close to the back of the driver's seat which is more than I can say for this Delta comfort Plus seat I'm typing this script on just kidding I'm not reading off a teleprompter oh don't read don't worry the cab feels absolutely massive because well it is with four full-size doors and a six foot bench width this allows the vehicle to basically comfortably seat six by default there are two roasts that sit three people each the middle center console and the cup holder tre flips up and becomes a seat back for the middle passenger in the front row which I actually bet doesn't feel cramped because there's just the 17 inch touchscreen no center console gear selector transmission nor driveshaft tunnel so that gives everyone basically the same amount of leg space which is unprecedented in a vehicle I got a lot of questions from you guys on Twitter and I picked out some of my favorites that I think I can answer reasonably well the Tesla didn't really talk about how many outlets are there and their location so Tesla announced that cyber truck will have an onboard air compressor 120 volt and even 240 volt AC power and look I don't know the amperage limits yet but in theory it could even power something like a welder or pressure washer which would be great for certain truck type jobs or you could just charge the all-electric ATV that test will be selling as well you can drive directly into the bed with the built in ramps stored inside the tailgate pretty neat look I don't know how many of these plugs there are but I would guess that they're located in the doors in the back side of the bed however the interior materials well they're basically the same as the model 3 save for the Alcantara roof lining and a bit more angular of a design if you don't like the look inside the 3 you're not gonna like this either the one weird thing that I didn't really like was the marble looking dashboard I didn't get a chance to feel it but to me it almost looked like a dbrand skin it was matte it might have been a thin veneer I don't know but I didn't really love that part I'm assume that comes standard on the white model the white leather I don't know about black yet but I love that white leather I didn't get it on my three and I regret it every day next question where are the autopilot cameras they're not present as far as I could tell let's enhance section a six the front ones will presumably be stored in front of the rearview mirror oh and by the way the rearview mirror is not actually a mirror given that there is a little bit of limited visibility because of the sloping of the roof and then the high rear passenger seating position so there's actually an LCD display that shows a wide-angle camera feed outside of the car of what the mirror would show if it were real kind of neat next question are there windscreen wipers no but they will obviously be added for regulatory reasons there's also no sideview mirrors and while parts of Europe can utilize side view cameras like the Audi e-tron that's not yet approved for use by the NHTSA in the US and there will almost certainly be some kind of restriction on that so expect side view mirrors in the United States by the time this vehicle hits production may make it look a little bit more normal - there's also the same oval steering wheel that we see in the Roadster and that thing looks sick but that is absolutely never going to get approved for production so expect a circular wheel by 2021 number five how do you tie stuff down okay this one's weird because I didn't see any traditional anchor points inside the truck like you would see in a normal vehicle but I took a video and a couple of photos and there was a Reddit user that actually broke down how the bed borrows many ideas from the aerospace industry there is an ill track rail on the upper insides of the bed which allows you to easily insert tie-downs wherever you want this is like a ubiquitous standard in airplanes and on the floor of the bed there are a bunch of these little lines there T slots so that allows you to insert anchor points anywhere you want in the bed floor which i think is pretty darn cool because you just make your own mounting points wherever you want pretty neat engineering this trip to the laps to save 10% a check out there's still a lot of unknowns and I'm sure that this car will slowly and moderately morph into something a little bit more palatable but Tesla has a pretty good record of shipping close to what they unveil years before so it's a cyber truck and this is it if you can get over the design the specs and the price tag are incredible and I have pre-ordered one but I might need a little bit of convincing on the aesthetic side before I take delivery what do you think about the cyber truck leave your comments down below and let's talk about it but thank you so much for watching and as always stay snazzy see you later folks
