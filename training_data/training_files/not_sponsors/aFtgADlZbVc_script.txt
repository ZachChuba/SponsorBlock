maybe it's because the Beat's brand has been slapped on so many overpriced headphones that were just too heavy on the base but we were genuinely surprised when the power beats pro turned out to be good and not just a little good like these might be the most recommendable product from beats since they were acquired by Apple in 2014 now they are still on the expensive side at two hundred and forty nine US dollars but given how well these perform that might not be unreasonable now I'm not ready to say these are the best wireless earbuds on the market but I'm also not going to say that they aren't especially if you're a particular kind of person [Music] honey is a free web browser extension eBay and more get it today at join honeycomb slash LTTE so let's talk design right off the bat you'll notice that the case for these earbuds is huge like I mean if other wireless earbuds cases are meant to be small enough to fit in your pocket this thing is meant to be used as a as a self-defense weapon to make your speedy escape like I mean we get it the case has to be big enough to accommodate the powerbeats ear hooks but the end result is still something that will fit more comfortably in a gym bag than in a pocket that is to say unless you're keeping the cargo pants dream alive the case has a Lightning port for charging in the back no USB C or wireless charging here despite its heft and a single battery indicator LED on the front then inside there's a pairing button and the power beats themselves nestled in the cradle like a pair of adorable little babies waiting to get their trust funds so they can afford power beats pros now if you're familiar with the original power beats you'll notice that these look much more streamlined and Apple II but unlike a lot of Apple products the power beats Pro do not sacrifice function for form the beats logo itself even is actually a clickable multifunction button there's a sensor accelerometer combo to determine when you're wearing them and there's even a volume rocker on both earbuds which personally I think is pretty freakin awesome as for the fit the ear hooks are adjustable and they work completely as advertised Riley who wrote this episode could not get them off no matter how hard he tried and believe me she tried I'm trying to oh my head hurts and the power beats include four sizes of interchangeable rubber ear tips that's one more than the Samsung Galaxy buds and four more than the air pods and they also have an IP X for sweat and splash resistance rating which should come in handy for the sweaty boys out there like Riley apparently and get sweaty you will because the powerbeats pros have enough battery to feel an impressive 9 hours of music listening time that's nearly double the air pods battery life with an extra 15 hours in the charging case if you need a quick top-up five minutes of charging will get to one and a half hours of listening time while 15 minutes will get to four and a half hours and if you happen to put down the power beats pros outside of the charging case they will actually very slowly drain over the course of about 30 hours and that amazing battery efficiency is made possible partially thanks to the same Apple h1 chip found in the new air pods also partially due to the fact that they're just bigger I guess size does matter but what are they like to use well the pairing process is the same as the air pods so you crack them open within a few inches of nioh s device and on-screen prompts to connect will automatically appear along with the battery percentage for both the case and the earbuds themselves also like the air pods the process pairs the power beats to every device assigned to your Apple account pretty sweet as for non Apple devices well the process is the same as it would be for connecting any other Bluetooth accessory but sadly and this is again like the air pods there doesn't appear to be any way to check battery life on android without downloading a third-party app even though the percentage of literally every other modern pair of bluetooth earphones displays directly in the Bluetooth settings I guess that's just apple's little way of saying should've bought an iphone after pairing putting the power beats pros in your ears is a touch more complicated than other wireless earbuds because of the ear hooks but I think you guys are clever enough that you shouldn't have too much trouble after the first couple of times and these hooks also save you from having to push the ear tips super deep into your ear canals to prevent them from falling out something that you can feel the need to do with non hooked wireless earbuds if you don't have an absolutely perfect fit once they're in the multifunction button can pause and play music with a single skip forward and backwards with double and triple clicks respectively and summon your voice assistant of choice with a long press bt-dubs like the new air pods the power beats pros also have a theory support so far so good then but what about audio quality actually they're really good true two beats tradition the power beats pros pack a lot of bass and arguably too much bass and it does end up taking some character out of the sound with the mids and highs sounding a bit tinny especially when compared directly to the sennheiser momentum true Wireless but for speaking honestly that really says more about the quality of the Momentum's than it does about these not to mention that the Momentum's are $50 more we'll have a harder time staying in your ears during strenuous exercise and suffer from a weird battery drain issue at idle now let's move on to sound isolation the power beats pros are better than the air pods in this regard but not as good as other wireless earbuds that we've tested and this seems to be at least partially due to the very air pods like bulbous head that they have that sits in the Concha of your ear so it's a bit of a double-edged sword because on the one hand this should make them more comfortable for people who don't like that deep ear penetration but it means that a lot of outside noises do manage to get in particularly in noisy situations like riding the bus so they still sound pretty darn good but don't be surprised if you have to turn the volume up a little bit to drown out the grunts of the loudest cave people in the gym which I guess segues us perfectly into some other trade-offs as we said the on device controls are awesome and like the air pods the music will pause when you take one ear bud out but the power beats pros lack an ambient sound mode like the one on the Galaxy buds and Sennheiser Momentum's now you could argue that they don't need it thanks to their poor sound isolation [Music] sure but I'm not sure that I entirely agree with that also there's no dedicated app with options like EQ customization or a find my earbuds feature and they don't show up in the Find My iPhone app like the air pods do in fact the only customization options available are in the Bluetooth settings on iOS where you can toggle automatic ear detection and whether the onboard mic defaults to the left or right earbud or switches automatically honestly this lack of customization really makes me wish that the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless a great sounding platform-agnostic option didn't have their fatal battery drain flaw though with that said they're actually sending us a new pair to see if that improves so let me know in the comments if you want to see a full review of those in the meantime the power beats pros even at 249 are an excellent option particularly for use while exercising they are truly wireless so no tether they won't fall out of your ears there's sweat resistant the sound quality is solid and the on device controls and great battery life for truly wireless earbuds are sweet bonuses so if you're on that daily gym grind you'll be happy with the power beats pros but that said if you're more of a daily walking to the bus end eating in the food court grind kind of person you'll probably be happier with a different pair of wireless earbuds and a bit more money in your wallet Skillshare is an online 500 people will get their first two months for free so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that
