this video is supported by curiosity stream this was Dyson CV patent filed last year if everything went well it were to be running on the streets of Singapore and all over the world in 2021 but it wasn't meant to be one aspects of the ebee industry gets very little attention the fact that no Evy company in the world has made money so far Dyson shocked the world abandoning its two billion dollar Evie project quoting the hard truth the Dyson team no longer believes it's Evie project is commercially viable as someone who has been in the startup industry and lives in Singapore I feel compelled to say a few things about the Dyson situation is even the street doomed to failure or is Dyson too late to the game first of all number speaks for themselves in one set of numbers comparison in particular explained the true reason behind Dyson's decision to abandon its Evie project here is the revenue and income analysis at Dyson General Motors and Tesla Dyson is the aspired newcomer and the letters are incumbents a quarter of Dyson's revenue is net income while the number for GM is 6% and for Tesla is minus four percent if six percent profit is underwhelming lilo for Dyson minus four percent will be disastrous this is not the kind of risk Dyson is used to Dyson announced his Eevee ambition in September 2017 a period of ceaseless excitement for disruption and endless interests in eating building pasla was at the height of its valuation reaching 60 billion in market caps seven years into its IPO and the Chinese evey companies were budding and thriving all evidences are pointing towards an opportunity of a century improbable though it may seem it would be foolish for any rational person in 2017 to let the Eevee opportunities slip away this include Dyson already a market leader in electric motors production it is only natural for Dyson to enter the market so why did Dyson reverse on its decision a series of events in the past two years have been pivotal the Dyson's decision to end its EB ambition first of all time has changed the sense of unstoppable disruption is no longer with AV companies though I still believe EB is the the hype has nevertheless died down with leading Eevee makers in both the United States and China mired in that to say the least history is still with Eevee companies it's just going to arrive a lot later than we expected there's no doubt to me that Eevee and gas cars are already at performance parity meaning Eevee can match if not exceed s car's performances but overwhelmingly customers are still buying gas cars because of the abundance of showrooms and endless commercials on TV there's no escaping the fact that the lifecycle of a car last ten to twenty years and therefore even if we stopped selling all gas cars today it will take 20 years to rid our streets of gasoline cars it is the slow-moving yet highly competitive market the hindered Dyson's Eevee plan another reason that must be brought up is that Dyson is too late to the game industry leaders such as Tesla have already occupied the best resources and suppliers in the market the Chinese are even more aggressive in battery production and have pushed industry capacity to the limit therefore inevitably Dyson have to source its own suppliers and material producers at a higher cost losing pressures competitive advantage to Tesla and many Chinese evie companies the situation is similar to what's going on with the new Google Pig so for though I agree it is a fantastic smartphone it is doomed to fail as a business because Google was too late to gather critical smartphone production resources this will not be a problem if Dyson's promised solid state battery is ready but unfortunately Dyson has not made progress in its battery technology this means Dyson will not have a crucial technological edge and will fall into the fierce competition trap for competitors push down prices which make the competition very capital-intensive we also need to put the situation into a bigger global context after the wework saga anchors have lost interest in landing money to a capital intensive technology operation because of the associated risks additionally this also has something to do with the fast-changing Chinese Eevee industry first of all it's become more competitive the reason why Dyson dares to join the eBay industry is because of its engine know-how and the simpler manufacturing process as a result of much less moving parts in an Eevee than in a gasoline car this means lower entry barrier for any Eevee company and resulted in the emergence the many Chinese Eevee companies secondly the Chinese government has also greatly reduced Eevee incentives in China where Dyson had expected to be its largest market sales of battery cars fell for the first time in July of this year because of a slowing market and a cut in government subsidies for between two to seven thousand dollars per car all of this played a role in the final decision of ending license evey and ever one question I get asked a lot is how will this decision affect Singapore the answer is negative Singapore wouldn't be affected that much Dyson has not invested into Singapore's factory nor has Dyson hired a lot of people in Singapore another disappointment that I've got in the past few month is that from the sources I've talked to what I realized was that Dyson is not hiring a lot of design engineers in Singapore to build that AV rather Dyson is focused on hiring people who can built the manufacturing line for manufacturing Dyson CV in Singapore and also Dyson has only hired I think a dozen of people which means I think 1215 people in Singapore focused not um designed the car those are done back in UK they're focused here in Singapore on the manufacturing acquiring suppliers acquiring the manufacturing equipment tooling for the Singapore factory here but I think the most important reflection all of us the tack lovers the auto enthusiasts need to think about is our assessment of the industry from all the sources I think we can get available to us Dyson's decision is the most reliable one because if you think about it the Wall Street analysts and perhaps even alter founders like Elon Musk and some auto founders in China they're kind of biased there are many people on wall street who has vested interest in to seeing Tesla fail they want Tesla to fail so that they can make billions of dollars and those people's views albeit perhaps professional they're extremely biased we shouldn't be listen to them but also we have to be honest to ourselves and to know that Elon as the founder of an electric car company he's view is also biased because of his passion for the project and his vast of interest in the project so I think Dyson's decision to back out of the AV industry is an extremely so current event that we have to take into consideration to understand the industry dynamics the competition the downward trend of the Chinese evey industry the the hard reality of acquiring suppliers in Southeast Asia as well as in China all of those factors played a role and I think when we doing analysis of the industry we have to take those factors into consideration so here's what I think the industry is entering into a period of foo gala T all companies need to take extreme caution into understanding the dynamics of the industry because with one bad decision with just one bad decision you're gone one thing I would love to see though is Dyson continuing its work on developing batteries and motors technology it would be a pity to abandon years of R&D because of the shifts in market conditions we need all the bright minds we have to advance electric cars and renewable technology if you're sign
