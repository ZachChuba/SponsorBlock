hey everybody that creature well I tried to kill myself within the last episode but somehow I managed to subscribe I'm my own worst enemy I gotta tell you ah then you see something like that and you realize you know mother nature's giving you a run for your money all right so we're not what we can do is since we're gonna pass time here we still have we can go ahead and read our book finally we have calories on board so let's do that yeah let's uh let's read that book that book got there it is it's about two hours of research here while we wait for this storm to live there we go and did we complete the book I think we did good we have a completed this one yet though this one should be moved up to fire starting material now yeah okay let's take a look at our fire starting and see where we're at all right we're getting close to being level two yeah don't cut yourself yeah thanks might do is I might go run around hunt rabbits and just fill my stomach with rabbit meat as soon as I can kill the rabbits down here on this island kill the rabbits back at Jack Rabbit Island and cook them up cook the meat this time and then just to recover myself as much as I can before I move to desolation where I think that's the safe way I know I said last episode I was gonna go for desolation point but with my condition works at I get hooked up with one wolf and that's pretty much it that would be just a waste so let's not do that I know you guys probably put in the comments to go for the love of God don't do that don't go across the full connector crumbling highway or whatever the hell is called like that so I won't I won't what I will do is I will eat something here what do I want to eat mmm beef jerky I really don't think study of this word that I think it's better to keep the calories or when uh when I'm ready to uh when I'm ready to sleep okay there we go I think I think we recovered from that we're gonna need to start a fire anyway and get to get some wood cut up get a fire going for some take this with me take that with me we're gonna take it to the next house Jackrabbit on I know I don't like to be a stinky one about here but it's pretty wide open okay let's get going I'm gonna get these rabbits here on this little island if they're out hopefully they are might need Oh six times that much they may stones pushed me out to the water he's pushing me out to the deep into the deep stuff here okay let's crouch down let's try to get this rabbit oh damn it he's gonna run forever oh he's not glitched like the other one yeah this is a dumb rabbit they taste they're the tastiest I know if you do that rapid dumb rabbits are the tastiest right that's like a through a little bit of a curveball on that one I just sort of went a little bit more gotcha gotcha I wish I didn't do that animation I wish I just threw a live rabbit in your pack that I could be running from a wolf and I just I just throw how you reach it like a third hello live rabbit watch it run off alright anyway all right so I think what I'll do for cooking is I'll come they call uh we're gonna cook at probably cooking with these little fishing huts yeah dead rabbits and such dropped yeah house will grab these sticks this weekend as we come across some I can't run anymore they stopped for a minute here there we go yeah we'll be able to run here shortly but we've used up on my stamina so I'll drop these dis rabbit and the guts inside the cabin before I go hunting outside of here because they're sometimes wolves dumped at the base of the hill here unless I get this rabbit here coming right at me sometimes she's got it no no it's not me don't buy me let's see what he does okay either I'll keep along everything's fine don't mind that hungry looking female right there okay now we definitely need to dump all this cuz we're pulling we're pulling wolves from all over the island now just kidding up that not really that far but okay I'll never get all the coastal dis right goodness gracious alright let's throw these rabbits down here throw their guts down drop drop Oh what the heck I'll drop that here we can stop by here easily we probably will anyway we're going from this selection point over to ravine probably stop here just to rest yeah six pounds of rabbit rabbit rabbit ammo right there rabbit pellets but not that type of rabbit pellet this was our guts that's where yeah guts there you are get rid of those two here put them up here I don't one display yeah that's awesome green here work with me here people okay are you gonna be my gut table oh man stocker I used to just have guts everywhere I couldn't walk without stepping on guts you know what I think I think we just made me wait for these guts to cure heal up cured oh I probably want to crack now some nice a nice rabbit hat or mittens or something before we even rush off the desolation poor there's a huge rush now at this point okay let me put it up here really I think I could get it up there now I'm being tedious I know there we go there we go that the place looks a little more presentable now plane we using like guts is like Darwin or something okay let's head back out here these are raw right raw raw cooked that's what cook looks like see the see more sear marks jeez accurized come on son what is the matter with you you're another little hippity-hoppity down here that I can murder somewhere and nothing to drink nothing I'm seeing at the moment there's one hey that's gonna be a little tougher oh he's coming right at me again and I got count from my elevation Oh getting good at this alright I'm gonna leave that one behind let's get back up here again you don't want to kill them with stones and onstop that's why you want to like because you'll over hunt the area or something like that and basically they'll start to dwindle plus I think an interloper they're gonna do Windell anyway in population but so I want to start using traps as soon as I can possibly crap them so alright let's go ahead and think what we'll do here is let's see here I don't want to do this I want to start a fire out here and cook it like a little bit of at a time or I might run these down to the fishing Hut and then we can have a nice protected fire that won't get blown out so if I use a match to start I should say a torch to start it I have a torch mmm do I not sure I can craft one do I really want to use my lamp oil well I guess I could have yeah yeah okay I could do that okay craft a torch use that or maybe I have a torch already my check I don't think I do I think I used it up and going here check I don't think I have one in here no for as an angler take that book now oh I will take that herbal tea in your sut now probably need to cook us some more rushy ten more sticks sure and our pot I don't think we have a pot do not have a pot to urinate in no hook they can take that pot carry much more okay we got now yeah stop your belly aching I want to take these and run straight down did you yeah hey I need to move quick though so that's a deer in front of us that's a good sign I think I can out I think I run past the deer or I will forget us but we're pretty stinky right now I did re-check checkrep no I haven't have I not checked him yet yeah I can use it for rags all right let's just get there it's got a door on it - that's really nice no part of me thinks I might go for this one over here yeah I might over here cuz there's good wood to be had over here too yeah let's go for this one our favorite little fishing hut over here brother cuz if weather goes bad we can go inside and sleep on a nice warm bed I have to worry about any any crap while we recover and not to worry about getting up the hill there with wolves and whatnot yeah we're just gonna go for this second fishing Hut in front of us here that be sure we're not pulling any wolves the incredibly rapid pace my gosh had I not food poison myself I'd be so much better off alright yeah we'll get a little cup of call of one first then we'll cook and by the time you know might as well run need to fatigue myself out so I get really good restful sleep I got a big big big block of sleep the larger the block asleep them more you recover I do have some herbal tea probably drink some of that as well this go around just because I'm like below half health so we'll do that before we go to bed and there's some wood up here that'll help Tuckers out too so let me drop these rabbits here I'm gonna collect this wood here and we'll come back and do a big cooking session I'm pretty sure that torches turned out to our burned out yeah it's burn out all right here actually we're gonna get rid of that need some water do you burn that torch for yet get rid of that thing so we don't get confused about it go away what a sticks around all because you can harvest a right yeah okay fine I got you I got you I was like I guess it does still have a use that's probably their thinking anyway all right let's drop that give these rules to stop coming towards us and I want to go and drink that soda I think for now just so we're not taking a three-percent condition hit as we're carving up these pieces of woods especially since it's 37 degrees outside not a bad time to go out here and do these activities to take like an hour and a half each real quick so let's go do that and again it'll help Tucker us out thinking we're gonna cook in water for so long I think what I'll do is I'll sleep tonight normally yeah I don't know we'll see I think it's probably pretty good for our purposes yeah might do one more yeah let's do it oh [ __ ] it got really cold real fast I would have really hurt us bad now can I get can I get a fire going out here without using a match that might be the I think we can I think we can actually I just need to get to a protected area on this side of the side of the hut here there we go can I get it goin I think I can yeah yeah yeah yeah all good good and since we have we're not costing any matches let's go ahead and use sticks oh this is nice guys it's nice this is it it got cold I lost out on that last piece of wood but it's nice that I don't have to make a torch or have to have to use I have to use a batch in order to get this fire going then I'll what I'll do is I'll take this torch out of this start to fire inside okay listen to get a couple sticks on here just enough to get a torch should be enough to get a torch they're gonna taking it torch out of there use that to start this fire sorry we got care flight flying overhead right now and let's try this while we boil water we can skin rabbits and whatnot life will be good first thing we're gonna do at those boil that water well first thing we're gonna do is add fuel then add a pop then boil the water it'll be extinguished oh did we not get it oh we did get it okay I thought it looked like we didn't there we go good enough let's extinguish this holster that but pot up here and let's cook up some water whoo we need that more than anything right now let's just do a small amount and our hypothermia risk is healed and we're gonna drink that there we go next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna cook up a big bunch of water as soon as I add some more fuel obviously I get a cedar fire I think that was carried out around to begin with a little checking the conditional knows those are curious all right let's do big thing now we're gonna pick this up oh I should've just harvested it from there forgot you could harvest it right from there and we're gonna harvest it will get the meat I just gonna take a little over the cook time for the water what about if we do guts okay let's do that let's not do hacks although that should be good check something here yeah that's fine we can do that harvest get the meat get the guts by hand so we don't wear it on a hat of the hacksaw harvest now we're multitasking there we go let's uh water Sun safe so we need enough 40 49 minutes to boil it I shouldn't just let it go cuz I'm I forgot that what automatically start boiling that no big deal it's not a big deal [Music] there we go starting to boil there we go nice 400 calories eat it raw let's not do that again okay well past time for that and we'll drink that keep what's left make our fire now our 15 we're gonna definitely add some more fuel there roars up there we go let's get this water going again again we should just do the whole rabbit all at once cuz it's gonna take like almost two hours for this thing - yeah let's do that and this thing will start melting then boiling and then it'll be ready right when weak really close to one we're down there okay Arista can we get this 15 minutes by hand mm-hmm not really but hide oh that takes a lot longer oh that takes really Chuck okay I think we just wait this one out okay 55 minutes let's add a little bit more wood here we'll see some sticks we got tons of sticks trying to cook up some water after this let's uh do this first cook it grab the rabbit harvest it he's a big boy he might be a little bit longer yeah I took a little bit longer because he was a little bit heavier though this all darris the bear just passed by here oh crap he's right there Hey go away bear though will say will pastime feliss is already I'll take that and then will isn't putting out 90 degrees to eat throw your worst at me we gotta be careful when we run for the house because if we get tangle with a bear we're screwed we're done all right um so let's cook up one of these well let's go two of these actually all of them I should say there you go oh you just went right through our cabin actually it's hanging out areas okay I wonder peace I won't if he smells the meat don't tried dropping all this junk here drop drop and where's that drop drop I don't know this smelling I don't think this smell but I'm just gonna do it anyway I need to drop that sapling to inside the cabin don't let me forget yes don't let me forget well that was quick that must have just been a partial like a very small piece of 20 23 minutes this another yeah small small piece sir our thirty-six minutes I think we do one more thing of water and then we get out of Dodge you get a drink he's still an area damn no you don't add a couple more sticks he's just hanging around this area my stinky at all it says no he's just hanging out this area he's stalking me so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna eat what I need here cooked yes we're gonna go sleep ready go freakin comatose over here and let's go eat all that can't run hit areas I think he's walking on what a Scott okay it's kind of following me but I left the water there didn't I okay I got to go back and get that water damn alright I gotta wait the spare up I gotta wait them out cured rabbits will come and deal with these in the morning I'm just gonna get low hopefully leaves me alone I need to add some twigs just to get awesome I can't run that's the big thing sort of trapped here he's like right here I see his head poked there he's so close holy crap Oh what I want to get for a rifle right now oh I would have just got fifty plus pounds of meat can't go out there right now he's gonna reset him that's nuts go away bear hope I hit him with a pebble well it cut through a rock at him watch ah take that bear we had some more of these just to make sure that I'm okay okay he's walking he's walking back so we just gotta wait for him to go through town no big deal again we're gonna be using the herbal tea to help boost our recovery but now we have like almost two gallons of water which is nice so and at this point we don't have to worry about oh I think we do have to worry about maybe we have to start worrying about cabin fever settin in oh yeah bed rolls gonna be a priority a door we're gonna have to make snow shelter where did he go [Music] wait he disappeared on me no it's creeping me out god I really just I just want to make it to that cabin heap up on the road did he just disappear like despawn guys I don't know I'm gonna just I'm playing it careful because I can't afford oh shoot there is Wow dang it don't come after me they'll track me go away do I need to circle around this whole village and just go inside one of these other houses I think that's what I'm gonna have to do they see coming back for me yes isn't he alright I'm going back in here he was where I thought he was he was like playing playing a trick on me alright let's just break line of sight with him for a minute here hopefully goes away oh my gosh this is so frustrating so frustrating I think I'm just gonna go around the whole village God dang dude go away bear alright if he gets all the way over to that corner I'm just gonna go for it and I don't think they'll catch me thank God that there's that you know impervious imaginary door right there oh geez I'm being trolled by a bear I'm being trolled by the most probably then now though I think he's more deadly than the male the Moose is pretty wicked they're both pretty bad you don't want to deal with him maybe he'll just freeze to death maybe that's a good strategy man if I had better rock I just sleep here recover enough to run didn't just make a run for it I don't have enough energy to run though got the screwed he's right there go away I'm not here you don't know that I'm here I'm not even I don't think I'm even carrying oh I am carrying some pressure a bit here I might sleep that and oops oh yeah probably not a good idea to put a decoy right there I don't think it matters for him though I don't think he cares I think I will leave the rabbit right here though all right back to square one with a stupid bear I've never run into this before all because I food poisoned myself we'll keep an eye on them see which way he goes to stop I got distracted with my menus didn't really watch where he went and then that's when I came out and kind of screwed me a little bit could use a stem I guess I don't think we're crying that level of I don't have a stem with me I had a stem yeah probably at version 1.0 see does he want to make his Turner see I know that wolves are attracted to the smell of the meat know that our bears I would imagine selling me because in real life they are so maybe it's because I was holding that meat sitting in here because I know whenever we're gutting stuff sitting in here and we're like three stink bars or three stink lines you can come out here like on stocker when I get a huge bear and I spend like a long time I'm supposed to be watching them aren't I I'd turned around back here and every three rules standing there Sunday you can pull them while you're inside if you're carrying something stinky so I think maybe that was the case looks like he's decided to leave us alone finally I think maybe we are I just reconfirmed something I should probably already know oh just keep going yeah I think he's going back home now finally so I'm just gonna start creeping out this way cold wow it's really cold really real cold be horrible if I got wolves behind me and him coming at me from this side I'd be like sandwiched with my current condition that would just suck suck suck suck so bad okay I think I think he's left the area I'm still gonna steer wide I'm gonna go real wide I didn't see him go up the hill so I think maybe he went down the road again I'm gonna just go wide regardless yeah I think you went down I think you might have doubled back down the road but we're just gonna be careful net we're not when I get it out ahead of him here tell you what if there's a bear coming at you I bet you'd dig down deep and find the ability to move fast where's he at God he's it's like freakin cat and mouse yeah I hear you Astrid trying to get you there trying to get you there buddy I'm not sure where you want alright now we're taking some quick conditioned hits we gotta get inside fast I'm stuck oh I could eat anything right now it god I hope it I'll come nose to nose with there he goes he's going up the hill good don't you do it all right I think we're safe oh my gosh guys what the heck oh never had that happen before look at her condition so low so much for recovering condition all right we're gonna get some good sleep though after all that private nightmares probably wake up with like night terrors PTSD and such Wow okay let's get inside that's turd or Astrid all right we're in nineteen coughs really that's all I got left after all that I was a waste yeah we're eating some beef jerky huh okay let's uh maybe have that nope that's a stay okay let's sleep that one 814 that's pretty good okay and we have plenty to drink and let's stop there and I'll use my herbal tea I should have used that for the extra hundred calories right there but that's okay we use that to top off our thirst there or hydration okay so we should be good let's go and sleep for ten hours got improved rest you guys in ten wow that's a bit too far right there okay so we're right back where we started basically yeah okay okay all right we'll start cattails if we have to all right so we should have cured guts by now thank God okay we're going to make some fishing line we're gonna do some fishing we're gonna eat well that's all right we're gonna we're gonna go do some good dang it bear I need to get to that all right where's going wait a second here pass some time here keep going I think he's gone that Bears are everywhere on this yeah he said halfway up the hill I'll close to the top of the hill actually good god man okay I just want to make some I see just doing circles looks like you I don't know I'll think he is okay where's the workbench make some line okay I got two lines out of that let's make another line and then we should be able to make some fishing tackle sir I have that okay I can do this inside right yeah I can make the fishing tackle inside let's go get back inside warm up let's go out here I don't have the sledge hammer though damn okay we'll go we'll go get this sledge hammer let me warm up we'll go get this into hammer and then we'll go do some fishing and we'll be in good shape so we just warm up here for a minute pastime again yeah this is pastime there we go ah ah shoot nighttime it's okay night fishing down with it I hear I swear here all right well if he comes at me I got how I could run I need to get going cuz I need something to break up ice that's what I need Artie wants to eat it are methinks I take it with me I think I take it with me we need to cure these up kiddies back oh maybe I was just I think maybe I was my mind is playing tricks on me alright let's drop this here maybe I'll just sleep here until morning I don't know anyway regardless drop something is here keep the cured drop that one there up that one that drop that drop that will drop this one here there we go should drop that sapling before but that's ok see we can make it to the sick we can make it to the garage the time we make there make it there which should be nice and tired too well there's my pot I let someone take that with me I have a couple with me I have a pot back at the garage as well I think I'm gonna leave that one here Darius I knew I heard him I knew it stupid bear my god man hey guys I think I think what we do with all this water we're gonna go up here and I do it food got two cattails okay so we're just gonna go up here and recover again for tonight I'm not gonna go through town where the wolves are and get bitten by one down there it doesn't seem like a good idea at all I think we'll just go up here to Jackrabbit and recover here tell me what right ooh burn as much energy as I can here before I start freezing turn up Oh stinky lines looks like night to me could've fooled me looks like it looks like it's definitely nighttime alright let's get up here get fully rested again I just don't want to get tangled with a wolf in this condition does it seem like a good idea at all hey what I'll do is I'll just I'll just play it safe and go around this way let my stamina recharge here a little bit yeah we'll eat that tonight definitely debt tonight okay so 453 teapots gonna be good so me good we're gonna get some good recovery again tonight do I have more tea in here I wonder if I do that'd be wonderful I do oh okay this is a smart play I think this was a smartest one I'm still learning how to play this interloper guys he please bear with me we need to wear ourselves down a little bit more still I'm not gonna just run around the house doing push-ups or anything like that I'm just gonna pastime I'll do it from the luxury of the bed here though we'll just see her pass a little bit of time but ourselves to get warm I'm not worn down I know I see my conditions going down a little bit which is okay because I think we'll gain it back faster over well until I start dehydrating but we'll gain it back faster when we get really good wrestle sleep I think we're gonna get about 8 hours of sleep here all right so there we go let's um yeah let's eat and drink and get some sleep here how much do I think I'm gonna probably get eight hours but I'm gonna eat us though I'm gonna go for ten fine a little bit extra and I'm gonna drink this first then I'll drink the water the way I should be doing it I haven't been doing it that way but that's the way I should do it serve a little bit of water okay now we already do get ourselves some sleep let's go for ten we won't get it but do our best improve sleep yes and we're good all right then we'll go to the garage grab the hammer go out do some fishing we have four more things a fishing line and all that stuff so it should be good there our fishing tackle which will make four lines our for fishing tackles I should say okay so we're in much better shape now than we were the goal is to keep our condition high anything right now for the day yeah one on one or in 83 kind of one carry that with me to the fishing cabin let's just go let's get going here while we have a good visibility all right so basically I tried to get over to desolation point this episode in the previous episode and I'm gonna end up right back where I started but I do have a hacksaw now and we do have fishing line now so that's a couple big a couple big pluses in the book of life for us so we're on I go with it time value 16 okay well we'll deal with it I'm just gonna run for it you need to make it there before I freeze cuz then I'll start taking that condition hit again for freezing and and it won't you know it'll really bleed off our condition real fast so while I do burn calories faster this way it's kind of necessary just to get out of cold as fast as possible especially if this that's starting to warm up a little bit but it kind of looks like it's gonna be like a warm Blizzard I don't want my my clothes getting betel either kind of glad I didn't stay because I have a feeling there's gonna be a blizzard coming I'd rather be fishing at a fishing hut during a blizzard with some matches in a bunch of wood if we can get into town without getting nibbled on I'd be very happy I see I haven't seen any wolves yet so that means they are all concentrated directly in front of us like 15 degrees in front of us that's where all the wolves are gonna be let's have this oh I had this bad gut feeling yeah this is a great series if you want to learn from mistakes like don't think the same mistakes I'm making can't believe I ate that raw meat still it's still killing me whenever I do that it's just like God man were you what were you thinking you weren't that's the problem go running quite yet it's all three wolves out there in a lake I don't know if that correlates somehow to the wolves in the town or not I don't know if that matters if they care or not that let's get some high ground here if we see anybody lurking time to make a run for it all right we'll sit in here warm up for an hour and let it out all right where's my hammer at it's down Aris I need you now I need you now herbal teas yeah you did come in handy a cooking pot I have one hour to leave them on I think I left that behind I'll use that for to cook up some fish while I'm out there oh I do have a torch no I grabbed that from that fire to start the to start the one in the stove in the fishing net that's right okay carry much more and I'm dangerous dog food right there how we doing on wait that we're fun oh yeah yeah yeah once I want to I want to do a warm-up let's do that forgot about that all right let's rest here one hour here we go we don't get hypothermia before we make it to the fishing hunt all right I want to do some fishing before I need to actually start up a fire the idea anyway Oh freaking bear what is with it me and the okay well probably means the wolves aren't well they're either going bonkers or they're not around I think I'm gonna go out the same way I came work it in bears man everywhere I've never seen so many bears honestly I need to get out to one of these cabins there's one right there I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna go for it the worst don't matter on these they don't change the temperature though let's just go for it okay not just not too worried about the the temperature right now let's go meet this it probably gonna be a really good day for fishing actually and then if I get them fishing here and I need to warm bed to sleep and I got missing drops Island and I can probably go there with a full belly I'm waiting for this spirit I'll make it appearance over here it's there everywhere sorry guys do some fishing Oh oh thank god okay let's drink I'm gonna get some food on board so I'm not dropping any more condition one trustee I don't know maybe we'll see you know I like sushi I don't know why I can't just like sushi in the game okay let's use this Oh hold on wait wait wait stop that deficit we got things to do gotta make our fishing tackle first and myzel crafts outside I think I think I just turned the corner here now that I'm able to fish yeah I think it's gonna know there's a heavy hammer we're out I don't know if that's the condition or not or does it wear it at all I don't know if it wears okay let's do a two hours of fishing damn it already broke two hours that's only 239 calories very good meat coho I broke another one so much for turning a corner there's my coho okay okay well let's start that fire let's cook these up I will be using a I wish I could use a man I will be using them would match actually I'll be using a torch dragon there we go there we go all right let's give it a go I got that coho just at the very end man I was braking lads I crazy that's my third line I went through wow I hope I got something least some fishing skill out of that that's rough you still all those line breaks like that yeah you sound like you're really feeling lucky all right let's uh add a couple these sticks add that let's cook up this coho shall we nice and let's cook up this gamey rainbow trout there we go might add a couple more and yeah yeah I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and don't want to eat or not I don't think I want to eat yet yeah be a bad idea but I will do a little bit more water cooking just a little bit first time we got there 22 you think we can do it maybe not well maybe we'll need to add a little bit oh yeah and a little bit more fuel you're not much a little there we go Howard 7g eight minutes honor if I can drop any of this gear yes think I should go for it again kind of want to kind of want to go for it is this not frozen again let me check my hammer that's 87% I wonder if it'll go down take a look here 87 maybe it stays here forever maybe it's like yeah permanent I don't know well I got show me an hour only a few minutes let's just let it go out if we catch one we'll leave it here we can eat it later hours to fish let's start to be warm most the time until the gift oh [ __ ] very much route 572 come on baby no line break no line break 294 one more cool okay let's get out of here holy crap at least I know where the cabin is Wow this is brutal [Music] good god man that came out of nowhere kind of stinky without carrying that around but that's okay I don't think many animals are out in this right now I don't think I go this way I think I gotta go open around past the bear cave of course which should probably sleep it in right now as I smell like
