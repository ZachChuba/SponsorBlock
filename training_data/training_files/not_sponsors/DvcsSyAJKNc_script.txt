hey guys so today I want to quickly walk you through my notion set up for 2020 this setup is not complete yet as we're still in December but it's complete enough for me to show you around and so you can gather some inspiration and some ideas for your own setup if you're a little bit unsure about how I plan and what my new organization system is I have a video all about that which I will link down below as well as in the upper right corner of the screen because i do not use notion as my main organization app a notion is actually part of a segmented system composed by three different apps one is the calendar app the other is a to-do list app that allows me to create different lists according to different topics and finally I have notion so notion is mainly focused on long-term projects and long-term goals and this is what I'm going to show you now so my first page in notion is notes and drafts and as you can see it's basically empty because I want to start filling it up in 2020 I basically have a main brainstorming page and then a quick to-do list and these are the things that I use the most in notion when I want to quickly jot down notes without any type of specific topic or any structure where I need to insert that particular note secondly I have a main page called project and in this main page I have other sub pages each one corresponding to a different project I will not be able to show some of these to you because they are still quite confidential like my e-book project which you will find about soon enough but for instance in my UK and Ireland trip projects which is still not filled up so there's there isn't any personal details or dates or any of that stuff but you can see the main structure I basically have a full schedule where I will be stating what is the date of each specific part of the trip as well as any links the location and the status of organizing that particular part of the trip of course at each one of these will correspond to their specific page so any details about my departing flights and this also means contacts addresses as well as prices and any kind of files that correspond to reservations it will all go to that specific page I will also have a map which I can access directly from Google Maps and I can also see the schedule by day so I want to do an eight-day trip which means that I will be able to schedule the trip like hour by hour if needed if I want you my language learning page is quite simple and it basically divides the page by three and these are my goals for 2020 that I just remember and I jotted it down I have goes for Latin for Japanese and for German and of course that as soon as I finish these goals I will add more goals until the end of the year but these are the basic things I want to do related to language learning at least in the beginning of the year then I have a main goals page and this main goals page has a bucket-list sustainable purchases and resolutions I like to divide my bucket list by quarters because I think that this way it's much more achievable and you're also able to stop that hectic time of the year when you start to finish off your bucket list by the end of the year so my 2020 bucket list is divided by quarters and of course that this is not finished at all I will add more items as I remember them and into a specific time where I think I will be able to do them so for instance I don't have any ambitious goals in my bucket list for the first quarter because I'll be basically be focusing on organizing my wedding and that will take a lot of time so I will start doing the more ambitious projects like starting sueing classes writing my ebook traveling of that after the wedding I also have a list of sustainable purchases as I've showed you before this is the same list that I think I showed you in my last video about organization and then I also have my resolutions list which is still empty I like to fill in my resolutions right in the beginning of the year and so I decided to keep this page empty for now so I make a bigger reflection on what I really want to achieve by the end of the year basically and more specifically in terms of habits and basically in terms of health and things like that I also have my wedding planner and I will not be showing you this with detail today because I'm preparing a full video and try to explain how I'm organizing my wedding by myself but I can show you that I have my main to dues page and I have everything categorized by pages and each one of these pages has tables contacts galleries everything related to each specific category so all the information is gathered in one place and I will never lose any piece of information if I need it in a meeting with a vendor or when talking to family members or loved ones then I have my books and reading page and this is basically divided into my yearly reading list which you also know by now and then a page for reviews and my reviews page is basically inspired by one of notions main templates so I will start filling it in with the name of the book the status of the reading progress and this is also neatly set up with the score which I can attribute stars to the author as well as the summary I removed a lot of the info that I could input because it was not important to me and the notion you can really easily switch tables around and edit tables as you go so I thought it would be best for me to remove that information altogether and then what I think is very useful for you to have in any notion set up is an archive I think that an archive is important because notion is supposed to be simple and yet complex which means that in your main view you should be able to see things that are really useful to you in your life right now and anything that is not useful or it's not applicable you can just keep in your archive without having to delete it because you may think that information will be useful further on so I have an archive for 2019 and one for 2020 of course at 2021 will have only the 2020 preparation that I've planned previously and then a 20-19 archive will have in this case my 2019 Christmas planning with all the parties and the presents and everything by the way this is very important this is a new workspace I had another workspace before and I'm now using this workspace with a personal plan because I had a lot of issues with different pages in my last workspace because it was shared and I decided to start a new one for 2020 because I really like that feeling of starting from scratch and since notion really doesn't limit if the number of workspaces you can have with a single email address I decided why not and I think this is all for my very simple notion set up for 2020 of course that I will be adding on pages and as I do so you'll see them in future videos but I think it's very important to keep it simple and to not try to overwhelm your notion set up with an irrelevant planning especially if you're already using a calendar like I am or if you're using another app with your to-do lists and your reminders Mariana - 500 500 I really hope you enjoyed today's video and I'll see you next week bye guys
