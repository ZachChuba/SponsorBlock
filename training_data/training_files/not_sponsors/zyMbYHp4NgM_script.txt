Hey so I'm sick I'm the sick as a dog I'm living off lemon and honey concoctions drowning in all of us my temperature is higher than it should be and all the goo is coming out of my nose so stop me if this is you know T my but it was green and then it was yellow and as soon as I saw the color change I wanted to know why like why is it yellow because everyone knows why stop screaming right it's dead right blood cells I'm here right wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong so long so well so I've been fighting my sickness with decongestants and hot tea but my immune system has been fighting with neutrophils the body's most common type of immune system cell from the first line of defense against infection so white blood cells have congregated in my nasal mucus look but that's the white screen so what I've been going on is that the new chip built release enzymes and the most common enzyme that neutrophils release when you have the flu our cold is myeloperoxidase and mana proxies is also a group known as reactive oxygen species which are chemically reactive chemical species which contain oxygen so reactive oxygen species are generally induced as an antimicrobial defense in humans so this release of Marla practice is also known as a respiratory burst or an oxidative burst but why is it great well my practice has a lot of iron in it I miss the compounds of this iron which are present in various oxidation states that give them make as a screen color a mucous production when you're not sick it's also super important mucus is produced by mucus secreting cells called goblet cells these cells that line the respiratory and excess little tracks accomplish this by secreting mutants which are a large block of proteins for mostly by carbohydrates so the mucus that is produced has a really important gross job that is to keep us as healthy as possible by trapping invaders during inhalation so it's a very old air filter but unfortunately mucus can also be the enemy in conditions like cystic fibrosis where build up a really thick sticky mucus in the lungs digestive system and other organs because a wide range of not very nice symptoms that can affect the entire body so all of that in mind if off the annual subscription to view all problems in the archives and that's it if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you want to see more subscribe I'm a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye
