hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with baked apple cider donuts that's right all the world's great donuts are fried except there are a few rare examples when they're not and this incredibly delicious and easy to make apple cider donut is one notable exception and because we're not gonna fry these not only are these easier but they're gonna be way way less messy and of course less time cleaning up means more time to eat donuts so with that let's go ahead and get started with the most important ingredient and the most important step and that would be our apple cider reduction and for that i'm going to transfer two cups of apple cider into a saucepan that will place over medium heat and by the way this is not the alcoholic apple cider okay this always confuses my european friends but over here apple cider and apple juice are basically the same things and generally if it's been filtered clear it's called juice and if it's kind of cloudy and fresh it's called cider but the point is there's no booze in this and then what we're going to attempt to do here is bring this up to a simmer and then very carefully reduce it down to a half a cup and back carefully i mean don't walk away and let it burn which reminds me if you want to go slower and safer you can always use lower heat or if you're in a hurry and like a little bit of danger you could do this on high so that's going to be up to you i mean you are after all the spider-man of your cider man but if you search the web i think you'll find that most of these reduction instructions call for doing it on medium which is what i recommend and i'm also recommending that you play a little bit of a game with yourself to see how accurately you can reduce this down just by looking at what's in the pan and as you're about to see i got pretty close okay i had about another tablespoon to go so i could if i want to reduce that down a little more oh and if you happen to go too far and it reduces too much just simply add a little bit of cold fresh water to make exactly a half cup and that's it we will just set that aside and then we'll move on to prep our dry ingredients which will include some all-purpose flour some baking powder along with some of its good friend baking soda we will also do a pinch of salt and of course since apples are involved some cinnamon and then we'll finish up with a little touch of cardamom as well as a little bit of freshly grated nutmeg which in case you're new around here is like a hundred times better than the ground stuff and that's it we'll go ahead and take a whisk and give this a quick stir until it's combined at which point we can move on to the last component the wet ingredients which we'll begin with some white and brown sugar we will also add some whole milk preferably from a cow we will also need to add some melted butter as well as a little bit of pure real vanilla extract and then what we'll do is go ahead and take a whisk and mix this enthusiastically until everything's been combined and we're pretty sure that sugar has dissolved and then we're also going to add one large egg which i like to add at this point because i forgot to add it at an earlier point and this would be a great time to remind you that tip i like to share once in a while that whenever we're stirring or mixing something we always want to try to remember what we forgot but anyway i tossed that in and mixed it up and that's it once that's been accomplished we can go ahead and pour in our apple cider reduction along with our dry ingredients then we'll take our whisk and give this a mix until they are dry no more and we've created a relatively thick beautifully colored batter and as usual when we're talking about mixing a batter we really only want to do this until that flour disappears so as not to over mix which might cause if we did it too long some slightly tougher more rubbery donuts which nobody wants okay so once that flour disappears we can give it a few more stirs and then we should probably stop and that's now ready to spoon into some well butter donut pans if we want to use a spoon okay what i think works better is to transfer this into a zip top bag and then we'll be able to pipe it into the pans which i find to be a little faster and neater and easier and of course if you want to use a real piping bag go ahead and once that's been transferred in all we have to do is snip off the tip and then we can go ahead and transfer in the batter like this and when using pans like this they say we should only fill them halfway up but they say a lot of things many of which i do ignore so because i want the largest donuts possible i'm actually going to go like 75 and does that mean there's a chance these are going to bake up over the edges and that the hole in the center might fill in yes yes there is but that's okay don't worry chef john's got tricks but in any event we'll go ahead and fill those as evenly as we can and then we can go ahead and clean up those pans a little bit with the tip of our finger which we will then clean off with their mouth at which point these are now ready to transfer into the center of a 375 degree oven for about maybe 10 11 or 12 minutes or till they're beautifully browned and look like this oh yeah those are pretty pretty big and how you know these are baked just long enough is it if we press lightly on them with our fingertip that donut will spring back and not leave a mark which is why by the way that one in the back looks like it does that was caused by a little premature poking and then what we'll do at this point is let these cool down in the pans for about 10 minutes before we try to remove them otherwise they might fall apart and by letting them cool down a little bit we'll be able to simply flip this pan over and they should all come out easily and beautifully or if you want just to throw out another alternative method we could also just pull them out with our hands like this all right either way and for filming purposes here i'm just going to go ahead and do six and now that these are out of the pan you can see the problem we're going to have if you overfill these like i did we have closed holes and if there's no hole it's not a donut it's just a mutant muffin but don't worry like i said earlier chef john's got tricks so what i'm going to do is take a small round pastry cutter or the cap to my bottle of olive oil and i'm simply going to punch out those centers and of course as i do i'm going to eat them and there we go now i have nice large donuts with holes so take that people that only fill those pans halfway up and then what we'll do to finish these off is go ahead and brush them very generously with melted butter and then once properly greased we'll go ahead and toss those in some cinnamon sugar to give them that classic apple cider donut appearance which by the way gets better as these sits and that sugar on the surface absorbs a little bit of moisture and sort of darkens up and had these lasted long enough i would have definitely showed you what that looks like and that's it i went ahead and plated those up and then took a whole bunch of contractually obligated pictures before grabbing one and biden in and that my friends really was amazing okay thanks to us reducing that cider these have a gorgeous relatively intense apple flavor with just the right amount of sweetness and hints of spice so i really do think these taste incredible which is not at all surprising but what is is how incredibly light and texture these actually are i mean to be honest i'm not a huge donut person because whether they're baked or fried i find them very heavy but not these these are feather light and i've heard from a very reliable source that you can easily eat three or four of these without getting all weighed down and by the way if you're not into the butter cinnamon sugar finish these would also be great brush with a light icing or just some powdered sugar with a little bit of apple cider in it or because that color so gorgeous you could just serve them as is but regardless whether you serve these plain or you ice them or toss them in sugar i really do hope you give these a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a printable written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy you
