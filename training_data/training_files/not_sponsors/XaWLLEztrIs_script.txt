Oh hold it run that back sector g6 there zoom in okay freeze that what is it enhance and heads look at his wrist nobody walks with their arms pronated like that Turgenev x101 jim my god we can get an ergonomic logitech vertical mouse to him might just have a fighting chance before before what well before he develops a repetitive strain injury and gets fired thermal takes level 20 cases beautiful tempered glass panels check them out now at the link below [Music] logitech's MX series of flagship mice including the full-featured MX master 2's travel-friendly MX anywhere 2 s and NX or go for trackball enthusiasts now has a new addition to the mischief that the mischief really a group of mice is called a mischief well you learn something every day ok anyway it's the MX vertical logitech's first vertical Mouse now the idea behind vertical mice which have been around for anion 20 years now is to maximize comfort and avoid carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries that can be caused by lying your hand flat for long periods of time this is known as pronation and actually causes your two forearm bones the radius and the ulna to scissor which can pinch the tissue inside the forearm increasing pressure in the carpal tunnel it can also inflamed tendons so yes that's right folks going prone sometimes hurts more than it helps now the index verticals design mitigates this by putting your hand in more of a natural handshake position of 57 degrees which is higher than the MX argoes optional tilt but still less than the 90 degrees which in theory would give you enhanced unseeing but then would also introduce new problems because instead of driving mouse clicks down towards the desk they'd be going sideways where there's nothing to push against so you just push your mouse way I mean you'd probably end up with an injury from squeezing the mouse constantly to try to hold it still instead of being able to relax which is what the verticals angle and wide thumb pad do allow for okay so your arm bones are aligned and all that but what is this thing like to use honestly quite a bit weirder than I thought and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve before you can point with the degree of accuracy that you're probably used to because you have to learn to move your arm on a totally different axis now on a normal mouse most of us execute big movements by pivoting from the elbow or from the shoulder and then fine movements by moving the wrist sideways a little bit like this but while this does offer a lot of precision it's actually an unhealthy movement with another fancy name all in there deviation but with the vertical you actually do your fine movements like this which becomes second nature after a week or two except for an unexpected problem that James who I immediately unloaded this thing to when it arrived ran into which was a frustrating increase in what we're calling fake clicks where you go to click on something and nothing happens causing you to have to click again so it took me a couple of goes to figure out why it wasn't registering sometimes and it turns out that whether it's some combination of the vertical position or maybe the difference in fine motor control between moving your hand like this versus like this but basically what's going on is that it's really easy to invert 'only click before you've actually stopped moving the mouse and if you look closely you can actually see that the mouse is basically registering a tiny micro drag instead of a discrete click now it's possible that the main factor in all this is just that we have so much practice using horizontal like regular mice and that this could be a complete non-issue over time or it's possible that you don't experience this issue at all and it's just a James thing but all we can do is tell you our experiences and this is what I experienced so there is one thing we expect to be agreeable to everyone though is the MX verticals looks despite Logitech's obvious focus on ergonomics the mouse itself still manages to look frankly like a work of art it looks like a seashell or ax or a sailboat or like a a sick jump but even seemingly design focused decisions here often have practical elements to them so the soft touch rubber top for example is accented with these vertical ribs that play with the light more than the graphite color otherwise wood but also give it a please grippy texture in the hand so you can't accidentally slip unfortunately this mouse doesn't exist in a vacuum and comparison is the thief of joy so when we bring other mice into the picture the MX vertical loses some of its luster even though the MX vertical is lightweight and advertised as having the elevated performance of the MX series and even though it has forward and back buttons a dpi selector that goes up to 4000 dpi and left and right buttons that are rated to 10 million clicks it still feels like it got a little shafted in terms of features compared to its siblings so despite demanding the same 99 US dollar price the vertical has the fewest programmable buttons it lacks a horizontal scroll wheel and gesture control and dark field tracking for use on highly reflective surfaces and while I understand that the angle of the mouse might have restricted Logitech from putting one of their awesome hyper scrolling wheels on here I feel like at least a tilt wheel probably wasn't too much to ask honestly other than ergonomics the only thing about this Mouse that makes it stand out against the others in the lineup is the fact that it uses USB type-c so you get the reversibility and the improvements to durability not to mention that it will be handy to be able to use the same cable to charge your laptop your Android phone and your mouse but James and I actually had a pretty good debate about this and we were going through this you could make the argument that some of those missing features that we mentioned before would be more important to many users than the type of USB port in spite of all of that criticism though I can't think of any reason to hate this Mouse even if it was clearly built for folks with medium to large hands the forward button is a bit of a top shelf in the kitchen kind of experience for a smaller person like me it is expensive but it's a high-quality right-handed Mouse with modern Logitech benefits like dual connectivity via radio and bluetooth flow across multiple machines and this neat graphical dpi selector which unfortunately didn't work until I installed Logitech's options software so so if you're looking for a vertical Mouse to help you prevent or recover from a repetitive strain injury and you don't mind spending three to five times as much as the competitive offerings in exchange for the logitech pedigree then we can easily recommend it just don't try to game with it because it gets pretty warm actually all that surface you want to appear as though you are using the internet from so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the
