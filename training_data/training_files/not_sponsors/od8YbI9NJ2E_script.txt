    knew it already fine, misery inside at myself, I would laugh, fallen down behind but I don't know a thing, love or losing see? so I threw to the side any human in me if I live a lie of shallow words and empty replies then what am I? hitting walls of a stage that I couldn't break then it stuck in my head gotta run away playing out like a scene, posing every lead near the end of the show, waiting in the wing, see? Run to front stage, you’re all actors anyway no one to watch, you’re all part of the play There’s no one inside me There’s no one that’s hiding Always been me, empty, a body but nobody here to see So hurry up and bite down whoever you found Game over, give it up now Mayday, a double agent Struggling over love and discontent And here I wait for something to twist the plot dramatically again Oh you too yes yes so take a deep breath You know how this’ll all end Head shot, we took it too far But if you aim, go for the heart We’re pulling at the boundary, unseen A curtain dyed in black soon came to be And knowing that those eyes are watching... Broke it all with a touch if I do recall Hiding all of the shame, all I did was fall We were young, never bound by a single sin Til before we could see, we were monsters in skin But even if I had tried to move on, why can’t I leave my past? “Considering it’s you, better give up soon” “Cuz no matter what you do, you will always lose” And then I was alone way before I knew Blocking every little thought that I couldn’t sit through All they want now is safety from what’s around Waiting for help but never learning how I don’t wanna think now I’ll play dumb anyhow Always been me, empty, a body but nobody here to see So standing at the front line and maybe this time I’ll be there with a flag high Outmatched but easygoing Never gonna need a script with me And here I keep them burning to twist the plot dramatically again Oh you too yes yes so take a deep breath Swear that you’ll see me again One chance is all I have now And so I better make it count Climatic ending, come see The final act, I’m shaken to my knees Yet crying and lonely The world that I locked out is nowhere to find The people who mocked me are gone from my sight Emotions and feelings are useless to keep The tears that had fallen were not mine to weep The kindness and warmth, I can’t feel them at all The hands that are offered, I’m scared that I’ll fall The hole dug inside me can’t hold any love Instead, you can see me break down from above Hey, remember when you saw that they were nearing their end? And you looked like you were laughing at the pain they were in But what did you see? Oh really what could it be? Well, take a breath ‘cuz you’ll need it, so c’mon saying Always been me, empty, a body but nobody here to see So hurry up and bite down whoever you found Game over, give it up now Mayday, a double agent Struggling over love and discontent And here I wait for something to twist the plot dramatically again Oh you too yes yes so take a deep breath You know how this’ll all end Head shot, we took it too far But if you aim, go for the heart We’re pulling at the boundary, unseen A curtain dyed in black soon came to be And knowing that those eyes are watching...
