the other day I read a tweet that said sir Ella's and my stylish minimalist I have ever seen there's maybe Google but then I thought about it further is minimalism especially in fashion usually focused for men only is there an idea that minimalism is boring lame and ugly especially in fashion I decided to put my own wardrobe to the test as a female that likes to look good and photograph some of my pieces of clothing at a professional studio and see if I can maybe make them look like high fashion pieces so these are the pieces that I decided to photograph these are my favorites from my wardrobe that I think I'm most likely to be able to look high-fashion or fashion ish I have a few styles that I have in mind I'm a bit nervous I never know how these photos are gonna turn out like I never know if any of this is ever gonna work so let's try so I've decided to jump onto Pinterest because I wanted to see if I could get some kind of cool ideas for photo shoots from here so my clothes some of them are quite flared I have two flared Kant pieces I'm like seventies photoshoot trying to find some different examples I haven't started yet I've been putting on different range over outfits to try to see what works and what looks good I am really nervous I cannot choose like there's so many different backgrounds I'm trying to work with right now and I don't know which color and pink like it pink freaks me out plus I never work in an environment indoor so everything's just like [Music] that looks good vagina first batteries down I figured this is a good chance for me to reflect and see if I'm on track or if this looks just crap all I'm trying to do is I'm trying to poet like an idiot because that's I can I guess that's what high fashion people sometimes do they like do the most outrageous poses that you don't even know what they're doing and then have an element that does the big I'm about bushka would anyone if I have a photo shoot like this if I was to say that any of your photos today work easy no and it's 3 p.m. of being que mas a date going into more natural territory something that suits me a little bit better now instead of the craziness that has been color so excited for a lot less color [Music] I took my favorite photo gave five shots so when you know what you love it just all comes together if you're fighting against it and learning how to work with other stuff it just doesn't work I'm almost so I know it out myself that is so simple now and the morning was so difficult I just captured this photo and it took me like a couple of seconds and I know it's simple and not groundbreaking but I feel like this is the style of photography these days anyway like denim on denim like simple background also i'm Phidias ode now so I'm like a woman and I was trying to go for childish photographs they don't work for me they don't work for me I think I have a face that doesn't do childish very well I think I'm like badass Diaz woman woman woman it's so easy now I hope my boobs haven't come out but what it's very much love that in this photograph I look like I'm hitless so I just went along with this is not exactly what you would probably see in a magazine I don't think everybody liked it so I'm gonna chop my head off even more so it really looks like I don't have a head in this photograph [Music] can we please have a moment of silence save 10% off your first purchase of a domain or website thank you I don't know frame conclusion one very difficult reduce to do life I'm sorry that if anyone is a professional studio photographer this must have been very painful to watch to work with what you have fall in love with a style and follow that style branch out every now and again to see if you can learn anything from it but you have a style because your eyes drawn to it there's certain colors you're drawn to probably because they either work for your complexion all your clients complexions what is my blue red pinky colors they work for me are that colors a little bit too intense I want to thank my awesomesauce legendary friend from sherbert Bertie Sasha who studio this is it's a freaking beautiful studio with so many amazing props and fun things if you want to photo shoot where she guides you exactly like to your body shape she knows so much more than me I am a novice compared to this woman she knows exactly how to do it make sure you get yourself to Sydney Australia because it is going to change your life and self-esteem every single person that comes into this studio here they self-esteem goes out of the water I don't know if that actually it means anything here is my Instagram and my Twitter if you would like to see more and damn guys
