welcome commander exigence again today we're gonna look at one of the simpler aspects of elite where to call home while technically you don't need a home station if you have more than one ship and if you don't you soon well it's nice to keep them all and all your modules stored in one location picking that location can be rather important as it will impact not only your credit balance but your ease of access to various endeavors first we'll start with the elephant in the room Jameson memorial and chin rotted Ezra Jameson memorial offers every ship and module in the galaxy making it a very convenient place to call home Gerardo desura does however required the founders world permit that can only be obtained by becoming elite in some discipline so as it won't be available to all but veteran players let's move on next let's look at Isola prospect on bruh Stila 8:1 a little-known secret that's exactly like Jameson Memorial and then it sells every ship and module in the galaxy with two caches first it's a planetary base so it takes a bit longer to arrive in land and second and more importantly all items that are 20% premium this is to ensure that even if Leon retakes control prices will always be in more expensive than Jameson keeping it special however if you've got plenty of credits this might be the home base for you now we get to my favorite station for most players ray Gateway India Guan dree one of the best things about dia Guan dree is it's currently under control of the powerplay faction Leon rein in Leon reefs base all ships and modules are sold at a 15% discount which can not only save you quite a lot of big ships and modules but it also affects your rebuy cost another great thing about ray gateway is the very popular so you'll almost always see commanders when coming and going if you're a bounty hunter choosing a system of the station near rings will be key it's great when you're close enough to quickly run back to cash in your bounties and rearm your ship and if you knew Bennett you don't have a long flight back to the fight LHS 20 another Leon reef system is a great choice as the coriolis station ohm city is within two light-seconds of high and low resource extraction sites and within forty two light-seconds of a couple hazardous sites next up we have another somewhat obvious system the cradle of humanity sold while there aren't any stations that sell everything there are some rather beautiful ones like Mars High orbiting Mars flying by earth on a regular basis is also pretty sweet again soul does require a permit from the Federation which you earn at the rank of ensign if you don't yet have that rank have a look at our previous video on earning ranks as efficiently as possible another choice you could make would be one of the asteroid bases or mega ships while these won't necessarily have the best outfitting or ship selection they are rather unique and in the case of asteroid bases can be rather stunning locations to return to after a session of jumping around if you're a power player another obvious choice would be your powers capital system not only is this a great choice for immersion these systems are usually populated with commanders making them feel more alive than some parts of the bubble this is also a great choice if you're going to be running background simulation tasks like undermining and fortification another possible home system that's definitely off the beaten path is Colonia about 23,000 light-years from Seoul colonia is the region of space around the once lost jock station while the population is a fraction of the bubble there are a number of stations with some ships and good outfitting available if you're going to head out to Colonia I suggest searching out some of the player groups that call this area of space own let's look at one last station Hutton orbital in Alpha Centauri the somewhat popular station is near Seoul and centrally located in the bubble what's best is if you arrive in a large class ship you can store it and swap it for a free anaconda while this isn't widely known those that have made the short trip have been rewarded with the valuable ship which also includes a rated rather than the standard I rated modules while there are many stations and elite you can call home and there is no one right station for everyone using the little care and choosing your home station can go a long way to making the game more convenient and enjoyable as always this has been commander XE Jia's reminding you to fly dangerously and thanks for watching
