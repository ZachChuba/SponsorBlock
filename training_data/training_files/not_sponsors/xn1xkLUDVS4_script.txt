people are always asking me why sandals and to them I say why not I mean they're not the most stylish things ever but they're convenient reasonably priced and they even have pretty decent grip from when I have to walk my trash cans down my slippery driveway and so it is with the px 65 physios new flagship P series quantum X TV for 2019 with a buttload of premium features for just $2,200 this might just be the premium 65 inch sandal of TVs and I absolutely love it speaking loads of other features as well check it out at the link in the video description [Music] don't be deceived by the PX 65s all plastic chassis tacky industrial design or bargain feeling buttons because this puppy has all the features you'd expect in a flagship display from a Samsung or Sony and then some out of purported 3000 nits it doesn't just have the highest peak brightness of any display to reach our studio it's actually one of the brightest if not the brightest set on the market now it's hard for us to actually measure this because companies often exaggerate these numbers and our testing equipment isn't sensitive beyond 1300 nits but what I can tell you guys is that when it's cranked it is really bright like to the point where most people are probably gonna leave it at the default 50% now the purpose of all of those lumens of course is HDR and thankfully the PX 65 is certified for both HDR 10 and Philby vision so you get nice bright Peaks when you're looking into a light or a fire but also dark and detailed blacks thanks to the PX 65 s full array local dimming across three hundred and eighty four zones or actually four hundred and eighty zones on the 75 inch model in either case the zones are just over five inches square or about this big now that still looks pretty big but thing is in a side-by-side comparison with Samsung's top-of-the-line q9f that first launched at $3,800 and an LG OLED the PX 65 obviously couldn't reach OLED levels of black but it did achieve noticeably lower lows than the more expensive Samsung and that's really saying a lot out of the box we did find the active full arrays default medium setting to be a little intense leading to unpleasant halos around white objects on black backgrounds but turning it down to low took the edge off quite nicely albeit at the expense of some dynamic range I'm glad we're at least given the option though but HDR is about more than just light and dark you also need a wide color gamut and like last year vizio is again offering some of the most of portable quantum dot displays around for the uninitiated today's quantum dot displays use a thin film of particles to greatly increase color accuracy and reproduction one thing to note about quantum dot or any wide color gamut TV though is that unlike a monitor which can be used for both content consumption and for professional work or content creation TVs are designed only for content consumption and in particular have been designed to display content that meets broadcast standards so while a color accurate monitor can display a wide color gamut all the time regardless of whether you're using Photoshop or Firefox a TV like this one will only kick in too wide color gamut mode when it receives an HDR signal otherwise it'll use the narrower rec.709 color space because there is no wide color gamut SDR content technical reasons for it aside we really enjoyed our time with the px 65 and that wasn't just limited to passive entertainment it happens to be a great TV for gaming as well because it retains all the capabilities that earned its predecessor a spot on display leg coms best gaming TVs of 2018 list now in the standard modes the input leg is actually pretty bad but you can cut it in half by switching on game low latency then if you specifically use HDMI port number five your signal will bypass all the unnecessary processing having your input leg yet again now that sounds wicked at first but there are some drawbacks while this port does handle 4k resolution or even 1080p at a native 120 Hertz refresh rate it is not HDR compatible so console gamers are gonna have to choose between minimizing their input lag and playing games in HDR poop also if you have more than one console well you're kind of screwed again because only hdmi number 5 is low latency though if you're that into it a separate hdmi switch is an option so then should you switch to this TV well it actually makes a pretty compelling argument with a calibrated mode out of the box built in chromecast ultra and airplay to support for 4k streaming from your phone and a motion blur reducing clear action mode that doesn't impact the screen brightness as much as other TVs I mean the px 65 is a bonafide flagship LCD without an outrageous price tag with not said it is only a couple hundred dollars less than an entry-level OLED of the same size so then if straight-up dark feeder room movie enjoyment is your bag I gotta give the nod to the OLED but I also have to acknowledge that do two O LEDs issues with image retention and overall longevity if you're more into sports watching or gaming this one is worth a serious look speaking of being over to ifixit.com
