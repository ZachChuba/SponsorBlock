[Music] Boal Star Wars trilogy created by AI [Music] this is the one wheel pretty much the best electric vehicle that's not a car I've put well over 3,000 miles on this thing now obviously I didn't do all those miles on one single charge this is actually the first generation one wheel which only has a range of about six miles and that's great for just riding around town but once you put a few miles on you guys start looking for a place to charge unless you do what I do and use a mobile charging solution to charge while you're out in the field like this a solar controller using a solar controller you can feed energy from any battery into the one-wheel so my buddy Ian actually took this to the next level and packaged that into a self-contained charging solution on the go called car of power it's pretty sweet and works really well this is the exact system I use when I'm actually out on a mountain or in the field wherever I am away from a power outlet and I still need to charge the one wheel I've seen comments on that mountain video asking whether or not I can charge while riding I've always responded no you cannot charge and ride at the same time it's not possible except that it's possible it's very possible and I'm gonna try it now the charger that holds into the one wheel uses what's called an XLR ports the Chargers XLR port actually has three pins on the inside of it but here's the thing you only actually need two of those pins to charge the one wheel the third pen is literally just there to inform the one wheel whether or not it is plugged in and to not turn on if it is now obviously you don't want a situation where it's plugged in and the one wheel turns on and thinks that it's operational even though it's there tethered to a wall so that's where this mod comes in if you disconnect that third pin the one will doesn't actually know that it's no longer plugged into the wall even though it will still be able to receive power that's critical to this mod so it's actually happening here is that we're fooling the one wheel into believing that it's getting regenerative energy by going downhill even that's not the case at all now I want to clarify that this video is not a tutorial and then if you decide to try this too you run the risk of ruining your board and even worse perhaps having it turn off min ride which can cause considerable injury so I don't recommend you actually try this you have been warned there's a huge deadline looming behind us it's like that for scope names behind the main characters this piece the blue zone shrinking in width at deliver a trailer the end of this week we have to have gold cut lock tab in this week and then next week is our week's finished all the effects all the sound all the music and then it comes out seems like there's a faster schedule than most but what if I told you that this is out all CD videos are done on a reckless neck-breaking schedule like this one times kind of line yeah it's faster the most but you know what this is totally not through Matic way to end this segment but I believe in our team and we do a good job here at corridor we try to have a drama-free environment where we actually get our work done on time and provide the artists the support they need to do the work because Nico's not talking about this correct way at all if we don't have this edit locked by Friday then basically the client hates us and they'll never bring us another really cool grand integration like pub G [Music] don't mess it up this guy sent us an email who doesn't want to work on a Star Wars movie when your kid Tony who watches our YouTube channel Peter guard us was messing around and created a neural network that creates star wars movie scripts that's right an AI making a Star Wars movie script he sent us one look how long this is really great kind of like they send us that and I was like you made an AI neural network that sends this movie scripts sent us two more right now and he sent two more a full Star Wars trilogy created by AI it's like as if r2d2 decided to become a writer there's dialogue oh yeah interior [ __ ] valet day you wanna walk down to into room around the cheer - artoo you must - one with one hand said time obi-wan how losts diddle annie is a pods they need any down you they begin to confident Padme its report the Force Commander West's the elevate the nest for you we have taken of the love nute Gunray is ship around Palpatine no in this approach fear the force and Queen is the rocking then the bridge for a colouring Li it's absolute gibberish anyways I made extra spicy chili ghost pepper lava chili homemade you know most video game companies have something called the crunch time you know where like all the employees come into my 80 hours a week working in video games and just used to the accepted practice in the industry well at Infinity Ward back in the days of making cult like call of duty 4 modern warfare 1 modern warfare 2 etc I actually have a chance to speak to the devs and they're like yeah we don't do crunch time we just properly manage our projects that's we do here we just properly manage our projects [Applause] it's coming together you're doing did a pretty solid job at picking out some really good character beats and you beginning and even the fight scenes coming together anyway yep and I'm excited for this mod I want to ride forever or as long as my batteries will allow so the most common form a battery to charge on the go is this thing it's a 10 cell battery Thank You China this is actually the same exact battery you'll find on the inside of those classic like two-wheel hoverboard scooter things that don't have any name so everyone was causing the hoverboard even though they don't hover boom and now it's charging unplug it done you don't need any special balancing that's all done internally that's the nice thing about these batteries comparing that with say a light boat battery this has a lot more energy but as you can see is unprotected boughs the Pierces with something it may explode like in this video [Applause] for this mod there are two main things we're going to adjust and that's basically we're gonna disconnect that third pin inside of this plug and also extend the length of this cable I'm gonna use just like a classic little laptop cable to I can I can jump rope to this Jeff scissors know this is gonna feel very weird I'm gonna cut the tip of this off there's something about cutting electrical cords like this with scissors that just feels so wrong oh that was that was dirty now to cut the other end off so the reason why I did that is because I only need the two wires in this cable the one's a negative one's a positive terminal and I'm gonna start her some xt60 connectors to the ends of these so for the put really the second part is a very specific 90 degree angle XLR Court in the event that you do crash or spill it won't roll over and break the port you can actually choose what angle this goes in at I'm gonna rip out one of these pins I'm gonna solder the two wires to the other two pens in theory this should work time for some soldering that was very scary I'm decent at soldering now I'm not worried about that I am worried about potentially ruining the one-wheel if this is up and running only a little bit worried it's about purchase it's that simple you're welcome so it has been a weekend I have taken this home and I just tested to see if it works I realized I needed some way to mount this thing to my backpack so what I did was I literally just took some gaff tape and basically made a rope out of it so this is literally just hanging on the back of my backpack uses some gaff tape and some string that was left over from our couch pillows hello pillows you know what this is this is all a little on the janky side I needed a way to mount this green meanie to the back of my backpack my 3d model in fusion 360 a holder or this and ppt all the holes line up how about I just go ahead and just put these screws in mount this thing up and done it works there are few things more satisfying in life than when you model something and print it and now it's real and it's useful it's working so here is the finished plug and you see my I got my little quick-release support here so when I fall off it just unplugs it doesn't do any damage doesn't get tangled up at all so here's another problem that I've run into if I crash and it rolls onto its side all the impact force goes straight into the plug and the plug itself is not designed to take that sort of impact there's the space between the actual plug itself in the rest of the one-wheel so if I press here all the force from that pressing goes into the plug instead of the board what people have done online is that they actually buy these bushings and you literally just put it on like that and this is supposed to protect the plug from your crashes the problem is that this bushing is far too large and that it doesn't actually get a good seat into the plug it falls out really easily so that's problem the plug could break off inside and the entire one wheel is just dead so what I did was actually 3d model another part and 3d printed that today and this was the original V 1 this is the V 2 you want to see something super satisfying so put this on here and then plug this in this should be able to take an impact and not damage anything I haven't done an actual proper test with this thing yet and actually want to compare it up against something that's actually really good and can go the distance such as jams one-wheel XR I'm really intrigued to see if we can both ride from my home to the studio tomorrow and see which one of us will make it Jan is very skeptical of my experience with batteries [Music] if I picked it up like if I drop this is that now literate since I grabbed it Jen I unfortunately think that would be littering taking on the responsibility that to a trash can that's life sometimes you help people get a bag don't let her folks even if it means carrying a bag with you for two and a half miles it's renas testing his new one wheel mod problem is his test involves writing all the way to the studio riding all the way to the studio with Jan Jen has never come into the studio without attack what did we just wrote all the way here from Pasadena yeah and they're on they're coming right now one of the traps yeah dude the mugwort I went 15.1 miles and I still have 74% battery left but it worked man we made all the way here it took us a couple hours but we made it dude everyone's here today we add up the whole flanking maneuver setup so the moment that door open they came in we went around let's roll in no I heard you roll in the Steve warned us Stephen I saw Stephen I couldn't see who it was I just knew guys were coming down the street and if I had my camera I would have done it in slow-mo because it looked like Reservoir Dogs whether you have your own 3d printer you have a service that you want to go through I will make these publicly available for free for you to download if you want
