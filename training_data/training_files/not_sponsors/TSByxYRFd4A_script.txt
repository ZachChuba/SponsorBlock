what's happenin bees and g's and welcome back to another upgrade and unlock take you to episode 1 where I explain all the rules but a quick lowdown is we have to complete actions and these actions then unlock our squares on the map and as you can see we have certain squares unlocked certain squares that have potential to get unlocked and then all of these dead squares which we are not even close to unlocking yet so for example completing a quest will let us open up one of these potential squares or getting 25 total levels there's loads more rules and we can lose chunks as well so if you'd like to see all of those rules go back to episode one and it will explain all of them but before you would usually have to buy but in the last episode you guys told me that we can go and do Romeo and Juliet we have everything for Romeo and Juliet all of the the squares unlocked that is what we're gonna go ahead and do I think I'm just gonna home telly out here because with with the chunks we currently have we're actually blocked in here we can't leave falador what so uh the only way to get into followers to telly in and the only way to get out is to telly back out so yeah we're gonna use the the home telly here to get ourselves out here talk to our boy Romeo and we can start this quest yes I will help her mate there we go Romeo and Juliet completed awesome means we can open up a new chunk let's have a look at where we are off to hopefully it's gonna be something useful here we go how are we off to just water and as we're saying if it is a square that literally has no land on it or is totally inaccessible then it won't count and we'll just re-roll here we go Oh bottom of falador but on the falador opened up means we can now walk in to falador but we can't actually get to here so we can walk out of falador opens up a a yew tree and opens up those wizards there which drop rooms but nothing too useful to be honest nothing too useful at all and but I guess it gets us closer and it starts to really make you know ports are m and Remington really viable soon which would be really nice if we get Rimington we can start to get our house together and obviously put some it would be quite a big one as well so it does start opening up that side of map and hopefully we can just get rid of these few chunks and and get ourselves a little bit further across but there we go that's what we get for doing Romeo and Juliet so in the last episode I was talking about how we can go to mother lode mine what I'm gonna do is I'm quickly gonna get 31 mining then we're gonna head on over to falador and we'll we'll buy an adamant pickaxe and that way we'll have the best pickaxe would possibly can for our level and then when we're over there we'll start just doing some mother lode mine because I really would like to get the mining up and it's so afk it's so nice we'll get some Nuggets in early and yeah it's just it's just quite a good way to get a few levels to start with and we'll have a boatload of coal as well which means we can we can Smith a load of steel and stuff when we come back at to mining some iron that is 31 mining coming in I'm just going to finish off this inventory go by the addy pickaxe and we'll go to mother lode mine for the first time so it turns out I don't actually have enough money for an addy pickaxe at the moment so either I'm gonna make some iron bars and sell that off or and I can't see this fetching 3k all of this but I will just do some pickpocketing just so we have enough we literally this is all the coins we have I've been spending pretty crazily recently and yeah that's all gonna have to do so uh gonna sell this off sell these see what that takes us to and depending on what I want to do realistically I think I'll just pick pocket but we will see it yeah just shy of 2 K so I think I'm gonna do a little bit of pickpocketing we could do with the levels anyway so yeah I'll just go to 3.2 K and then we'll buy our a deep pickaxe so actually gave up on the thieving dream it was honesty I can't believe how slow it was I was pickpocketing to farmers I was getting caught so often I was just like that [ __ ] that so we just gonna make well as short bows and sell them we'll also be able to sell the steel pickaxe when we buy the addy pickaxe that's a little bit money there as well but yeah just gonna do a little bit of fletching a little but we're cutting and and then we'll fire all over to fat door so I think I have enough without short bows now to be able to buy the addy pickaxe but I was actually waiting on JP he's gonna do the shield of Erev with me and he's just messaged me saying that he's cool to do it now so we're gonna do that quickly get shield of our about the way and then we will finally go and buy this this addy pickaxe and we'll be at the mother lode mine but we will have a chunk to open as well so uh so we'll see what happens after we finish this quest okay so we've been told where the Phoenix gang is and we're about to sign up and then we've just got to kill Johnny's beard and then we're pretty much done trade Jackie and we are we'll be done with this quest which means another chunk to open and then obviously we'll go to the mother like mine there he is I'm sorry about this mate it's for the greater good unfortunately so I'm gonna have to kill you I've got the belly this man has on him is that a [ __ ] wilderness sign on his shirt if [ __ ] is isn't it Intel report there we go alright if we give this key to Jackie he can go ahead and use that there you go he now is the key and he can go do it I think I think I need to go down here as well use that on him yeah and then I think he uses one back on me half certificate we use these together bang there we go and we get 600 GP which will help towards the the addy pickaxe fun so that's very nice one quest and of course the big big reward is another chunk here we go what are we gonna get Rimington we've unlocked Remington we can now start on our house which is nice and port Serena's gonna start opening up surely soon surely that starts opening up we're getting very close to being able to do the knight sword as well once we unlock this we will be able to the knight sword I believe also forgot to mention I've unlocked the air altar which is here I think so we can start doing errands as well I'm not a bad one at all I'm locking the house which is you know obviously huge massive massive start there other than that nothing too crazy we've got a crafting stool there but yeah nothing too crazy other than that but we can start getting some construction XP which is gonna be some fast levels once I have the materials which will definitely put our total level up and as I say these three are getting close just looking at that cos obviously I need to make planks I've realised I've unlocked the lumberyard which means we can also do Gertrude's cat which I am gonna go ahead and do just because we're in we're in varrock anyway it's it's gonna take no time at all so we are gonna go ahead and do Gertrude's cat as well and then we will buy this a D pickaxe I promise I promise but I do want to get these quests out the way and just unlock as much as possible because you know unlocking a certain square could make a grind a lot easier you know so it's worth doing them as we can do them Wow we can't do it because we can't buy a fishing rod which means there's no way of us getting a sardine which means we can't do the quest so we are gonna go ahead and and get our Eddy pickax now that's what I love about this series just something as little as that just not being able to purchase a fishing rod right now means we can't do Gertrude's cat so that that's pretty awesome as annoying it as it is that is what this is all about so we are gonna go get some mining levels and we need 450 until another chunk whether I do that through mining ie doubt but we'll see let's go ahead and sell all this off none more big man right sell that one to you for K and we have the ad pick eggs 800 GP left and we can get to work here we can't equipped it [ __ ] so we are gonna be wasting an inventory slot with it but uh it is gonna speed us up which is very very nice I was also looking into this I'm just walking past that this agility thing I was like is there any agility things that give maybe like one or two XP that I can do turns out there isn't which is a bit [ __ ] so yeah you need level 5 agility before I can start doing anything agility wise it's gonna give XP and we've yet we haven't had one random that gives XP and I'm not a dunce we haven't had a what's the other one you know the other one that gives XP the genie that's the one um and of course it would be going into a deity if I did but uh yeah haven't had one which is very annoying mother lode mine on the air on the chunk Iron Man the chunk Hulk Iron Man which to be honest I didn't think I'd be doing but it seems like a pretty good and viable way of getting some some XP here I think it's about 15k xp an hour at my current level which to be honest isn't that bad I was doing bit of mother lode mine on the main I think it's got close to 80 mining now and I think I was only getting like 37k XP an hour so at level 31 that's really not bad at all almost our total XP we've got that is 40 mining coming in we can have mine gold and I think the mother lode mine gives us gold either now or at level 41 one other two which means obviously gold is a pretty good way of getting some smithing XP later on down in the in the account I do sort want to get the gold smithing gauntlets I think that's what they're called from from the quest I think it's family crest you get them from obviously we haven't a lot that yet so I'll probably just stop pile the gold till we have that but yeah there we go 40 coming in one more level and we can use a rune pickaxe which we probably don't have the money for at the moment so I'll probably go ahead and mine a load of iron after we have 41 and that will allow us to make a load of steel hopefully make some steel plate bodies later on and we should be able to sell them off and make a decent amount of money which means we could go ahead and buy a rune pickaxe yep there we go that is the first imagery and we have some gold ore coming in so we're getting some gold now which is very nice two Nuggets there as well let's have a quick look at how many Nuggets for up to nine it's now very very nice indeed but the gold is gonna be very useful later on there we go great stuff we're also almost at 400 coal as well which is gonna be really nice when we go ahead to make some smithing gains because we literally only level 24 so uh it's a lot of experience there I'm probably gonna go to 41 and might stay here for a little bit longer there we go 41 mining coming in we can now use room pickaxes beautiful now obviously we're not level 30 smithing yet so we are gonna have to make just some iron bars before we can make the steel bars and use all of this coal but it is gonna come in loads of use later on right this is going to take us to the end of our mother lode mine grind just because I've just finished an inventory here and I don't want to go ahead and do another inventory because we'll get the next level while we're doing some iron because we have so much coal in the bank now let's just go ahead and grab all of this out so yeah we've ended up with just under a thousand coal we've got 72 gold ore and we have thirty golden nuggets there as well so a good little starting pile there towards the golden nuggets whether I go and buy any of the outfit I don't know I'll get back to that later on but as I said we have to now mined some iron because we cannot make steel bars until thirty smithing so we're gonna go and do some iron we need almost 500 iron anyway to make all the steel bars so I'm gonna have to go on a mining grind with the iron now and as soon as we get this next level we are gonna have 450 total which means we do get a chunk as well so I probably gonna fire on over to Varrick and we'll go from that and that is the level taking us to 48 mining nothing new in the mining category but the 450 total which means we do get to open a new chunk up let's see what we're going and we'll go from there guys enjoy the rest of the episode here we go where are we off to let's have look and it is gonna open up the top of draenor village yes that's exactly what we wanted that means we can now do Vampire Slayer that's awesome that I'm really happy with that one really happy with that one it also makes these it really means that 22 is gonna be probably unlocked very very soon which will mean we can start farming because that will be our first allotment patch and we've almost got the Draenor agility unlocked now but you know we're not very close to being able to use that yet which is a little bit annoying but we can go ahead and do vampire slaying out which we will definitely do for that attack XP and obviously another chunk as well so we're really really happy with that there we go that is 50 mining and coming in can now use get access to the volcano mine with 150 kodos on fossil island I didn't even know about that I've never used that before but out 50 coming in there I'm gonna carry on and do probably another couple of inventories which will take us to about 600 maybe 700 iron in the bank and then hopefully the excess of 200 iron will get us to 30 smithing and then we can go ahead and use all that iron and all of that coal to make some steel bars and get a load of smithing levels hopefully somewhere very close to maybe 40 smithing by the end of that I'd hope but oh there might be going a little bit over the top we will see and that is going to be the last imagery for now we're going to start smelting this all together and and seeing how much smithing XP even get up to six hundred and seventy seven iron ore which isn't too bad till just shy of that thousand coal but obviously we need to use design or first to get ourselves up to that thirty smithing before we can use any of the coal and make the steel bars so gonna head on over to Edgeville thank god we've unlocked that the the furnace is super close to the bank and we'll see how we do gotta go for 115 bars here I don't think it's gonna be enough to get us to 30 but we'll give it a go and if not I'll have to start mining a little bit more iron ore but actually gets pretty close just finishing off a maze here we might get something really good 72% not bad at all let's have a look you can always get some pretty good stuff from the mazes always worth doing and let's have a look coins and feathers hey I guess the feathers might come in useful but uh not as good as I thought was gonna be although 2.1 k isn't bad for the money we currently have that's actually not bad at all and this is going to be 30 smithing at coming in there we go 30 smithing we can now make steel and steel daggers let's just make the last they into a sword and we will start making all this : iron into steel bars we currently have 474 iron and 979 Colts and not a bad amount there so there we go that is all of the iron ore used out 474 steel bars and we're actually at 30 for nearly 35 smithing so we might get to 40 which would mean we could start using the gold ores obviously we don't have many but that'd be pretty cool I'm gonna go ahead and make all of these into various things I'd love to be able to make them into dart tips but obviously we haven't done the tourist trap because we haven't unlocked those chunks yet would have been really nice to make the the darts and then we would have just been able to fledge them for some extra fletching XP but I'm fortunate it's not gonna happen probably just gonna make some steel swords for now and we'll go from there and this is going to be 40 smithing cubby and I think we've still got like 60 bars or something gold ore can now be smelted and we can make steel battle axes very very nice indeed I'm gonna sell all of these you know steal items off to shops are gonna go to file or sell the square shields and we're gonna sell all the the weapons here as well in our Creed and in varrock but we still have about sixty steel bars so uh I don't know if that's gonna get us to forty one but I'm really happy with that with the other 50 mining and the forty smithing really really happy with that we I'm not gonna get 41 smithing that is the last of the bars but we do go ahead and get just over half of the level which is really nice I think we're gonna go ahead and do Vampire Slayer now after a load of grinding that was quite a lot of hours to get all of the ore and then get all of the smithing up so yeah I think I'm gonna do Vampire Slayer get ourselves another chunk unlocked and see what we're going up from there probably gonna go ahead and sell all of this stuff off after that as well because we do need to get this money back up because it is very low and maybe have enough money to buy a Vereen pick but I don't know if I want to go back to my knee and smithing just yet I am obviously getting ready for raagh to get here because rod gets here in in a couple of days now so I definitely want to be doing some afk stuff so if we if we can just carry on doing the mining and smithing while rugs here then that might be quite nice but yeah I am gonna go ahead and do this vampire slayer' now right to start vampires that we've talked of Morgan and we can also go upstairs and grab ourselves a clove or a bulb is it a clove is a bulb of garlic isn't it the whole thing the clove is like the separate one there you go let me know in the comments section but I'm pretty sure yeah it's a bulb of garlic I think that's what it's called search cupboard there we go garlic does it does it say a clove of garlic now I'm confused because that looks like a bulb of garlic to me is that examined wrong that's the question I'm gonna say yes that's not close that's not a single clove as a whole as a whole garlic anyway off on with the quest right here we go B's and G's the final fight or the fight in this quest not much further to go in the quest we have nearly 5000 attack XP for this which is pretty huge to be honest it's as much as XP as I've got total on the account so hopefully uh hopefully this takes us to a decent never I don't know how much further it will take us but I'm very happy with that yeah they go [ __ ] hell that was a that was close 4800 attack XP cover game which takes us to 26 attack not bad at all let's turn that off very nice actually 26 attack coming in which takes us to a 474 which is actually one level away from a new chunk as well is there anything I can quickly go again we can do two chunks at a time because obviously we get one for doing the quest if I can quickly get a level maybe I'll just go get an attack level I'm gonna quickly grab an attack level and we'll open two chunks at once there we go guys 27 attack coming in which takes us to 475 total level which does mean two chunks to open one for the quest and one for that 475 total level no drop there let's go ahead and see where we're going right guys the first of the two chunks as have a look at where we are going oh yes yes we got ports Aaron yes that's huge we can out buy a fishing rod which means I can start actually fly-fishing means I can also do Gertrude's cat because we can get sardine now oh that's amazing that's absolutely amazing um does it unlock anything else obviously we get the rune shot we get the yeah what's it called the grunge gold store so I could steal from the ham stores if I if I get that quest done and sell to there for a little bit of money another allotment blast it's not a lot money it's another farming patch though other than that nothing too crazy but definitely a really important one to get cuz obvious it's the port that goes looking everywhere so when we do start on locking you know into kuranda and stuff like that we can we can get there now which is amazing so that's the first one of the two and we will now go for the second one as well where are we going not a not a great great one but that is is that Doric square scan we do Dora quest I think we might need to go into the dwarma mines which we might be able to access from there I'll have to look into that but um there we go okay yeah we can definitely do Doris course we literally just need to give him two iron ores four copper ores and six clay but that's literally it so that's the quest we can do we can also do Gertrude's cat we'll go ahead and get those done and that's gonna be another two chunks Oh [ __ ] brilliant right so this is gonna be Derek's completed all we've got to do is literally fire and over talk to him and then give him these ores that we got and while we're here I'll probably do a couple of things with getting a house getting the fishing rod getting a sardine and then going into garlic Jude's cat um I want to use your anvil I'm pretty sure that's what we have to say there we go completed what an easy quest [ __ ] brilliant 1300 mining XP and 180 coins we will take that thank you very much mate that is another chunk to unlock so let's have a look where we're going here we go where are we off we're its total water okay so that is all good pick another one here we go the exam center I mean it'll be useful later on but for now it's just nothing that we need but it will be useful later on when we want to do the the the exam quest so uh nothing new there but starting to just you know push your way out push your way out I'm enjoying this so far no I'm actually very happy with what we've been given so far so first of all we've got 119 squares to sell how much is she buying for 360 each oh and once we drop in I'm going to sell probably five a world and hop how much we gain for them yeah five one and hop this is gonna take some time but I'd really want the money here we go guys it's gonna like sell the last seven here forty one and K and we still have loads of steel swords and steel scimitars to sell as well we can easily afford a room pickaxe which I'm really really happy about that obviously we've had like the most money we found in the account it's probably like 12 K so that's a huge amount of money there and we are going to talk to the estate agent and we're also gonna get ourselves our first house right so good trade here we can finally get I'm gonna buy both a fishing rod and a fly-fishing rod we're gonna use feathers as bait which we have loads of gonna buy a raw sardine as well cuz we're gonna need that for Gertrude's cat and we are now ready to get our fishing level up because it was just so slow doing it I don't even know where fishing is there it is I'm five fishing at the moment which is gonna be a load of levels that we can get together once we start fly-fishing which would be awesome but as of right now we're gonna go dude Gertrude's cat and get another chunk gertie how are you right let's go find your kitten old fluffs we're getting back to anyway don't you worry we'll get offers pet on the account so just behind here there should be some Dougal leaves which we can just go ahead and grab yeah there they are and if we use this on there you rub the Dougal leaves over the sardine we have a seasoned sardine now nice let's go get this cap right we found the kitten if we use that on there there we go we should be good now I think Gertrude's cap runs back yeah they run back to Gertrude we go over to Gertrude and we are done right Gertrude that should be quest complete and we get our own kitten now what color are we gonna get ants have a look oh [ __ ] white one I will take that all day long and that is Gertrude's cat completed there we go we get another chunk to open up a totally white cat yes that's sick 30 cookin coming in as well that means we can cook tuna apple pie is very nice cuckoo cuckoo pick up the kitten because I do not want you to run away they would go right let's go open another chunk up here we go let's see where we are off to bang that is just some water so we will roll again are we gonna go oh that is not useful at all part of the wieldy I don't think that opens anything up I think I could take from it is it starts pushing us towards birth or maybe but yeah not a helpful one at all a couple of bad ones those last one the exam of that but guys that he's gonna take us to the end of the episode I've just realized we've had link cam on for the whole were for the whole episode so that was useful guys thank you so much for watching these are the stats if you would like to see them at the finish looking really really good happy with what we've unlocked and we've got like 40 plus K in the bank as well so the accounts already coming on thank you think about doing it I'm casually [Music]
