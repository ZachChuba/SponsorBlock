online store make it with Squarespace okay this is a fun one this is something I've been meaning to do for a little while recreate one of my favorite optical illusions it normally features the faces of celebrities but I thought I'd do it with a mixture of popular youtubers and some of my personal favorite youtubers I mean there's some overlap between those two groups but anyway stare at the cross in the middle of this image either side you'll notice that there are images of youtubers and in a moment I'm going to change those images I'm going to cycle through some different youtubers all the while you need to stare at the cross in the middle here we go you should start to notice that the face has become distorted like their features become exaggerated they become almost like caricatures of themselves I promise you that the pictures are undoctored if you don't believe me you can skip back in the video and watch again but this time look directly at the faces pause the video if you need to to convince yourselves that these pictures are unedited it's bizarre isn't it it's called the flashed face distortion effect sometimes just called the alien faces illusion some of youtubers are conspicuous by their absence that's because the criteria for the images is quite tight they need to be facing forwards ideally looking down the lens and it needs to be an image that I have the right to use so Creative Commons or something like that so I can find an image of PewDiePie for example of Phil those criteria you may have seen some faces there that you don't recognize that might be because they're smaller channels that I really like links to all the channels are in the description in the order that they appear on the left hand side of the illusion so check out that list there's an interesting meta point to be made about effects like this which is that they're often discovered by mistake like this one was discovered by Sean Murphy he stumbled across it in 2011 and that means if you look through the literature we often see a description of the effect before we have an explanation of the effect so with this one we have some hypotheses about what's happening in your brain when you experience the illusions but no solid theory yet so I thought I'd run down the current thinking on the subject so it's somewhat related to another optical illusion that I really like to do with faces with this one you present an upside-down face in this case me and it looks normal until you turn the face the right way around and suddenly it becomes very clear that there's something wrong the eyes and the mouth are upside down the bizarre thing is you just can't tell when the face is the wrong way around James grime sent me this one he's got a channel about mathematics it's really good link in the description so his face looks normal when it's upside down it's only when you turn it around that you realize his eyes and mouth are upside down it's called the Thatcher illusion because it was first discovered again by accident when someone was manipulating an image of X British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher so in keeping with that theme I've made this one this is current British Prime Minister Theresa May looks normal when it's upside down turn it round only then do you notice that the eyes and mouth are upside down scary stuff we have a pretty good understanding of how the Thatcher illusion works so basically there's a region of our brain a module if you like whose job it is to recognize faces to process facial information and actually that part of the brain is kind of trigger-happy which is why we see faces where there aren't any like look how happy this house is or look how swallow the Pope is in this slab of marble it turns out that this module in the brain is quite holistic in its approach to facial recognition like when you recognize someone's face a lot of what's happening is you're recognizing the relative positions of the facial features like how far away the eyes offer and the marathan and that sort of thing and this neural network has been trained over millions of years of evolution using stimulus of people facing you like upright faces which means that when a face is presented upside down this neural network it can't handle it it breaks down and so your brain falls back on analyzing the individual features and when it does that it's like okay the eyes look normal the nose looks normal the mouth looks normal like some of them are upside down and some of the right way around but who cares you know so that seems to be the explanation of the Thatcher illusion so what's that got to do with the flash to face distortion effect well the Thatcher illusion kind of hampers the facial recognition part of your brain by presenting the face to you upside down and it seems that that part of the brain may be hampered as well by you not looking directly at the face like you do in the flash face distortion effect so the rest of the explanation well actually there's two possible explanations one is that faces suddenly changing is not something that happens in the real world it's not something we've evolved to cope with it's only something that happens on television screens right like someone doesn't suddenly change into someone else we can cope with it when we're looking directly at the face but when we're looking off-center instead what our brain does is assume that the facial expression of the person has changed but the person hasn't changed what that means is because when you switch from one face to the next the proportions of the face changed quite a lot if that was a change in facial expression then it would be a huge change in facial accession it would be a grotesque change in facial expression that's one possibility the other possibility is something called neural adaptation and that's an amazing thing and one of my favorite examples is motion after effect so to experience motion after effect stare at the center of this image don't look around it just at the center if it's small in your field of view then get your head closer to it bring your phone closer to your face for example and I'm gonna keep this on the screen while I talk and in a minute I'll give you some more instructions so keep staying at the center and what you're doing is stimulating neurons in your brain whose job it is to detect and interpret motion from your field of view and so by keeping your eyes fixed you're stimulating the same neurons again and again and this is something that happens with neurons all the time if you continuously stimulate neurons they eventually stopped firing so your sense of motion will actually become dampened but then what happens is when you look at something that isn't moving your experience the opposite of the motion you were experiencing before because the neurons responsible for the opposite motion are still up and running if you like so if you now look at the palm of your hand it will seem as if your hand is moving in the opposite way growing and shrinking opposite to the image you were just staring at so that's motion after effect it's the result of neural adaptation this idea that if you're constantly stimulating a neuron and you're on stops flowing so in the case of the flashed based distortion effects if you're staring off to the side and you see a face with a large chin for example then those neurons that say large chin are being stimulated they're being stimulated continuously because you're staring at it and so they eventually stop firing and then when you see a normal-sized chin that it seems a lot smaller as a result that's the idea anyway the process of scientific discovery often goes like this I've got a hypothesis for how the world works and I think it's right because it describes what I see around me but it also predicts things that I haven't seen before so I'm gonna go and look for those things like gravitational waves that were predicted by Einstein's description of gravity and when you find those things you don't have to explain them because you already have an explanation that's why you were looking for them in the first place and sometimes you've got a theory but it's incomplete so you're looking to fill the gaps like you're looking for a particle that could be the explanation for dark matter but sometimes the journey of scientific discovery goes the other way it starts with someone noticing something strange and so then the first thing you do is describe it and then once you described it you come up with some hypotheses for the explanation of it and then crucially you build experiments to test your hypothesis and that's what people are doing now with the flashed face distortion effect and that's great because maybe we'll discover something new about the workings of the human mind this video is sponsored by Squarespace for 10% off your first purchase hope you've enjoyed this video if
