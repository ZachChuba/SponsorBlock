everyone you were Tesla Tom and thanks so much for joining us on my youtube channel or discuss all things Tesla electric vehicles and renewable energy this is your first time to the channel hello and welcome please take a moment and it also helps my channel to grow today we're going to look at software update twenty twenty point twenty four point six point nine the latest update for our Tesla Model 3 performance in Sydney Australia we're going to do that okay so we're entering the wearing a freeway here on the north side of Sydney I've got the navigation set on the rocks in Sydney and we've got it on navigate on autopilot as well and just going to check our settings for my pilot but all the features set up here for traffic light and stop sign control and for self driving visualization we've got that on Stan I believe for lane change and I've got my lane change which is fine not too aggressive and we're going to engage what a pilot right now course on a pilot is always being a guy's so hands on the wheel eyes on the road now twenty twenty point twenty four point six point nine is just bug fixes this time around so nothing too dramatic if you want to look at the release notes from the previous update I'll leave a link to my other video which you can click on through I look at those features so once we get on the bridge proper show you the side repeater cameras as well let me just concentrate while we get onto the bridge proper itself we're still on the wearing of freeway now see if it changes lanes by itself as it does I didn't touch the indicator that's happened a few times now like a last few updates which I'm still very impressed with and see the speed limit change as well by itself there's the toll for the Harbour Bridge I've always got my hands kind of at the bottom of the steering wheel here but it does ask you to wiggle the wheel every now and then just to make sure we're still there basically bit of braking there this rent went under that bridge happens every now and then that sort of phantom braking all right speed limit is 17 let's see if the autopilot speed changes as well keep your eye on that okay it hasn't changed so I will set it back to 70 they're touching the speed limit all righty so we're very close to the northern pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge going southbound from the North wants me to change lanes why do it just yet pretty happy here yep so you're in Australia we've still got to clear the traffic lights I kind of keep my foot on the accelerator for this bit that way it doesn't keep breaking yeah so I'm kind of in the right lane at the bridge just going to be very careful here obviously because there are oncoming paths on the other side like I said I'll keep my foot on the accelerator because otherwise I want to keep clearing the lights because the Alain indicators the car is seeing in those traffic lights so that going green I believe is not coming to Australia from some nodes I saw on Twitter I love double check that for the next update which would be a shame unfortunately hopefully the next update these indicator lights ahead of me will be fixed so I'd have to keep clearing it with autopilot we are just finishing up on the bridge here it's outside now one speech a bear right let's see what it does here whether it exits properly just like Iowa yes one speak of lamb shanks I will do that Lane shake a long time yeah it's not bad that's probably the smoothest the car is done in the last couple of updates its autopilot is ending very soon go back to basic let's see what it does does a slowdown around this curve yes kind of does okay so that cleared it myself okay so yeah so that's done another few times now in the last couple of updates it didn't slow down very well on the curve coming out of the freeway of the bridge and then it wants to just break all iPilot when we get to the traffic light here so yeah hopefully the next update that'll improve but let's go towards the rocks now put it once we turn left here I'll put it back up on autopilot so you can see what happens with our visualizations lane markings aren't great in some parts of the city style very careful of course you can see I've got to clear the light here otherwise it won't go coming police car okay order pilot mines flashing there it's just to come off there that's fine okay guys so we're in the rocks now what we'll do now is we'll head back up north let's cancel that we'll head back up north and see whether navigate on autopilot works northbound as well see very shortly all right guys so I've set it for our Talman which is on the north side of the city and it does say that navigator on autopilot is available which is great [Music] back on the bridge activate autopilot it's catchy in parts of the city autopilot the I'm steering with us come on and off occasionally but let's activate it now let's see what we get [Music] because I'm on basic just going to do you activate it I do want to go on to the Harbour Bridge okay and then to the north side let's put the repeater cameras on for you as well using new Moshi screen less glare okay so I'll activate autopilot once I clear this bit this bit can get a little bit tricky a lot of lanes coming in and out like now that we're on a proper lane let's activate autopilot we are still going to clear all the lights again oh my foot on this on the accelerator we don't have to keep clearing with the dakotas talk so just basic autopilot for now on the bridge there was one update where it was navigating an autopilot on the bridge I believe we'll go back to navigate once we clear the bridge nice winter's day again in Sydney it's bit less glare on the on the screen there with the Moshi screen protector which is nice I would say the colors probably aren't as sharp or the screen protector on but a nice trade off for having less glare from the Sun which makes it better viewing I think for me as the driver and I hopefully the you as the viewer as well okay so we're just coming off the bridge now let's see what happens let's see whether we go back to navigate just that seawall still pacing Chanel I normally would stay in this lane possibly change lanes to the right you see what the car wants me to do what's being changed let's go back let's change lanes okay okay we'll cancel that main change and get back on basic autopilot now it's navigating on a pallet here for this bit a little bit confusing there I think that bits really difficult because it's kind of the transition between the bridge and the freeway a little bit confused the car when at that transition point between basic and navigate just looking back I look at the footage but I think it wanted me to you want to meet you to go to the right but then sort of cancelled back to the left so yeah that's probably something that might need to be fixed with the next update its car wants to change again that's where it's a bit confusing for cars because I mean ideally if I was a human I was I didn't have autopilot on I would have to slow down for that carpet what a pilot didn't slow down for that car which is fine ideally if if the car saw another car coming in to explain it would slow down a little power in didn't do that that's gonna change Lane I will actually stay in this Lane because again there's a car behind me again that's where I think a bit of discretion as a human driver I would normally make I would not change lanes if there were cars very close to me behind me where he's what a pilot no just wants you to change lanes usually very quickly just why I don't have a god water line change I still got it on confirm that way I can sort of still make a decision at this stage I think that discretion is just enough there with autopilot I guess we're just on the on the m2 not there and I plug into this is the gore Hill freeway coming off the other crossings let's see whether it takes the correct exit to the Ottoman exit which is coming up pretty soon against the car does well on a nice straight road not to many especially to changes and trees and exits off the motorway like this is fine but I think it's it gets confused in that transition points you saw between basic and navigate on autopilot and that okay Center confuses me it does change his mind very quickly like that so hopefully for the next update the bridge will be navigating autopilot now when I get that mixed up with the transition I was just exiting the goal hill now see what it does I'll just take it off this so I can see you can see it's what we are our game is ending so one's gonna go this way all right cool back on basic all righty guys that is our video for today for take the preserver and exit you and cancel what a pilot okay so that is our autopilot video for today for software update twenty twenty point twenty four point six point nine as I said it's just for bug fixes nothing major today but thanks for watching guys until the next software update stay safe and as always happy chat
