there are 13 tablets scattered across the four corners of the world in the white eleven of the tablets also compared with an orb of true knowledge the first time you collect one of these orbs you receive a spell on subsequent runs you are granted additional max HP instead here are the locations of all of them I'm gonna do this in the order that makes the most sense to me and not in order of volumes 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc anyway here we go up first we've got the secret Oram her Medus obviously right here in the tree I'm sure that most of us have drowned ourselves trying to get this thing I know that this was my first death in the game you could get to it very easily just by drinking the water or bombing the bottom of the tree this tablet is most likely a reference to the secret tomb secret Orem which is a real-life hermetic text up next we've got the tabulous Marikina which you could find in the bottom right corner of the mines right next to the lava lake which I already drained so just imagine that there's lava everywhere over here to the right tabulous Marikina is actually another name for the Emerald Tablet the real Emerald Tablet to get the next one we actually have to go down to the bottom of the lava lake now you could just use lava to blood if you have that which is what was used here or there's actually an easier way that I'll show you in a minute once you're down at the bottom you'll see this little cave with Emerald Tablet volume 3 and the orbit true knowledge containing the nuke spell which I've already taken and on the other side of this wall is the shortcut chasm down to the snowy depths so you could just use a black hole or a matter eater to get through it from here we're just gonna work our way across the chasm which can be done in the beginning of the game you don't need teleport for this at all and we'll find Emerald Tablet vol 7 and the orb of true knowledge containing the Thunder cloud spell which I've also already taken and this tablet is a reference to fillol Appice metamorphosis of metals which is attributed to George Starkie we have to go back to spawn for the next one and I'm sure most people already know about this one it's the one above the mountain inside of the floating snowy island we get Emerald Tablet vol 1 and the orb of true knowledge containing the sea of lava spell which I've already taken and this passage is actually the first part of the real-life Emerald Tablet so it actually is Emerald Tablet vol 1 to get the next one we head deep into the desert and climb the pyramid and at the top we get the Emerald Tablet of Thoth together with the orb containing the earthquake spell which I've also already taken and this one is a reference to the turba philosophorum now inside the pyramid at the lowest part of the pyramid you'll find the entrance to the sand cave make it all the way down to the bottom center of this area to enter another orb room with the orb containing the necromancy spell and Emerald Tablet vol 4 which is another reference to the turba filosophy room and now for the fun part we have to burrow or dig or somehow get through the desert from around the skull area until we reach an area of beautiful yet alien design called the desert chasm and then all the way down at the bottom of this place and trust me it is very very deep you'll find another orb room with the orb containing the cement spell as well as Emerald Tablet vol 10 which is again a reference to the turba philosopher's room it also might be a clue or a hint at another alchemic preparation using gold and cement combined with fire or lava so yes several of these tablets are actually hints from the developers or them just poking fun at us and then all the way on the other side of the world in the snowy wasteland we fall down this chasm that originally had a bridge across it and find ourselves in another vault make our way through here down to the bottom to find another orb room with the orb containing the tentacle spell as well as Emerald Tablet vol 2 which is a reference to the museum Hermeticum okay now I'm back up on the surface and over to the right a little bit from the vault and it's time to go dig in again all the way down through the snow chasm which actually took longer to get to the bottom of than the desert chasm so have fun once we do make it all the way down to the bottom we'll find yet again another orb room with the orb containing the decoy deer spell as well as Emerald Tablet vol 9 which is a reference to the museum hermetica all right now have fun getting all the way back up to the surface once again now on the left hand side of the snowy depths biome we'll find the entrance to the magical temple which the first time you're here is extremely dark so you have to navigate this really dark labyrinth full of ghosts enemies and toxic sludge missed a persevere and all the way over to the left you'll find another orb room with the orb containing the holy grenade spell which I've already taken as well as Emerald Tablet vol 5 which is a pretty funny reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail the only one of these that's actually a pop-culture reference and not a reference to an actual hermetic text to get the next Orban tablet we have to make it through the second fungal caverns biome the one connected to the left sides of both the underground jungle and the vault make it through there and we'll find an orb room with the orb containing the spiral shots fell and Emerald Tablet vol 6 which is another reference to the museum Hermeticum it's also a cheeky way for the developers to tell us that we're gonna have to work really hard to find all of this true knowledge which is fine I'm happy to be one of the mouthpieces to help bring this arcane knowledge to the masses and now we come to the end literally we're here close to the end of the game or one of them intent and we have to head down through the lava and the easiest most sane way that I know of to get through lava is by using the lava to blood spell once we make it through the lava there's a thin layer of dense and extremely dense rock that we also have to get through and then literal hell do not underestimate this area it is full of monsters and demons I suppose that do a lot of damage very quickly and even with all of my HP and all of my resistances this place will eat through your HP very quickly unless you play very carefully which I am NOT doing so please do not do what I'm doing because this place is huge and the orbit can be easily missed it's in the middle but hell extends downwards a lot past the orb room so you could be wandering around in here like I was for a good 10 15 minutes before you find the orb room if you see this void you've gone too far down get yourself back up immediately anyway eventually you will find the orb room with the orb containing the fireworks spell and our final tablet of this tour Emerald Tablet vol 8 which is a reference to the turbo philosophorum and there you have it all 13 tablets and 11 orbs keep in mind though that the more orbs you obtain in a single life the stronger the final boss will be there's a way to obtain more orbs and it's actually possible to buff the boss the hundreds of thousands of HP anyway I hope you enjoyed the video have a great day and I will see you in the next one
