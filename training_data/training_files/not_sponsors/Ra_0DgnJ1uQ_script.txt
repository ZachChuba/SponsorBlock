I've lived in Amsterdam for over a year and a half now and it occurred to me the other day that I haven't seen a car crashed into a building yet it's not that cars never crash into buildings in the Netherlands but it is exceedingly rare and I hadn't seen it or heard of it happening until I went looking for articles about it when we were living in Toronto my son's preschool was here one day we noticed a car had smashed into the drugstore here a place that we walked every day because the streetcar stop was here a few weeks later a car smashed into a pizza shop here on the other side of his preschool incidentally around the same time a speeding SUV ran a red light and knocked over a school bus a few blocks away but that doesn't count here because a school bus is not a building cars crashing into buildings is pretty common in the US and Canada good evening it's a dramatic scene and the third call for a car smashing into a home in a single day in Toronto cars crashed into buildings so often that in many cases it doesn't even make the news I tried to search for a news article about the drugstore buy my son's preschool I couldn't find it but I did find an article about a car crashing into this Shoppers Drug Mart and this one and this one and this one and this one at this one and this one in this one in this one and this one and this one in fact the only place I found any information at all was in this reddit post by someone who saw it the news did report on the pizza store crash though so there's that Canada and in the u.s. brush this stuff off by saying it was some old person that mixed up the brake pedal in the gas pedal or a drunk driver or maybe a little say it was due to bad weather now ignoring city design that forces everyone even very old people to have to drive everywhere the truth is a lot of these crashes are in the middle of the day in clear weather by regular drivers and the common factor is speed North American roads are designed to be wide and straight they weren't always built like that but over time roads were widened and straightened in the name of safety for drivers unfortunately we now know that wide straight roads make people drive faster and when you remove complexity from the street like removing trees and putting buildings farther away it's harder to judge your speed by your surroundings so in this kind of environment almost every driver drives really fast without even thinking about it when living in Toronto I remember seeing this tweet from the police ignoring why any Street by a school would have a 50 kilometer per hour speed limit why is it even physically possible to drive over a hundred kilometres an hour down this street but seeing drivers going double the speed limit was literally a daily occurrence for us in Toronto it has become completely normalized incidentally after the 1960s roads became wide and straight in the Netherlands too but a few decades later Dutch cities realize their mistake and purposely narrowed streets to increase safety bicycle Dutch has a fantastic video about this that I'll link to in the description everybody should watch it wide straight roads increased vehicle speeds and an increase in speeds turns what would normally be a small crash or maybe no crash at all into this now the other difference is that in the Netherlands if there's a serious crash the road is closed and there's an investigation as to why the crash happened and what might be done to prevent it in Canada they clean up the mess and that's it there will be a police investigation for insurance purposes but nothing will be done about the road there's a cultural element to this in english-speaking countries there's a big emphasis on personal responsibility when a crash happens the discussion immediately jumps to which person is at fault and especially when people are hit by cars victim-blaming is very common that person clearly must have done something wrong to get hit by a car so when a building gets hit by a car it's always fun to make the same arguments that house must have been looking at their phone or that drugstore shouldn't have been wearing dark clothing or if the building had a reflective vest and some lights this never would have happened the approach taken by the Netherlands and some other countries like Sweden is very different they say that road crashes are preventable humans are imperfect and they make mistakes so Road infrastructure should be designed so that those mistakes don't result in serious injury that results in things like separating different types of traffic narrowing roads and adding complexity to get people to drive slower restricting car traffic to residents only and many other different kinds of traffic calming there can be wide straight roads here too but when you get into the city the infrastructure changes and when a crash does happen the investigation includes the actions of the driver of course but also what could change about the infrastructure to prevent a similar crash in the future the roads the Netherlands were designed this way on purpose and they haven't always been this way a lot of this change only started in the 90s these roads came about by putting victim-blaming and figure pointing aside and focusing on the street itself and how to make it safer the end result is a city that's a lot more comfortable to be in especially when you're outside of a vehicle and for us that results in a better quality of life and I don't know about you but I'm pretty happy living somewhere where cars generally aren't crashing into buildings you
