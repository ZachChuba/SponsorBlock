this video is brought to you by Squarespace because this - please so hot fudge sundaes either [Music] the science of a hole is incredible this circular void is the reason behind so many great things in life you put a hole in your pants so you can wear them you put a hole in your walls so you can screw them you put a hole in your enemies so you can cap them and you put a hole in cheese to make it taste better without holes life would be surface level no way to dig deeper that's why when I discovered the 2003 sci-fi documentary holes I was overjoyed with a movie about digging holes holes is a Disney movie based on the book of holes of the same name on the last day you remember video I covered Surf's Up an animated movie that starred the Lord and Savior totally sane man Shia LaBeouf it and his legacy of voicing a surfing penguin but before he left us a legacy there was a time where he was born amongst the stars he needed to seek Redemption as a child actor in holls holls is just an incredible movie through and through the amount of iconic asked lines and scenes in this movie is a feat to behold you got some of the cheesiest writing the weirdest editing and the most over-the-top acting I have ever seen just look at Jon Voight look at how he [ __ ] reacts to things look I love it so much no one in this movie is written to be like an actual human being but God I do not care it makes for one of the most entertaining experiences ever it's a movie that just feels untouched by the elements of time like an artifact discovered in the desert it feels so disconnected and so strange to actually be a functioning movie but it's so fun excuse me can you throw in another pile of something because he keeps getting the movie is about Shila bona fide badass and his struggle of being sent to camp for bad kids and everyone there has to dig hundreds and hundreds of holes so the movie begins with a bunch of kids digging holes within a desert you got one kid who notices a sneaky boy so he goes to take off his shoes and goes over to play footsies and screams and his pleasure of his happiness cut to a pair of shoes flying in the air and we see Shila [ __ ] walking down the street until the shoes fall straight on his head we then meet his parents you got Fonzie that mom from the Fred movie the Fonzie dad has a really obsessive foot fetish so when the cops come to investigate he tries to hit on them cuz I just man you shoot how about if you take your shoe off the cops are offended so they send his son to camp jail Shire plays a character of Stanley Yelnats Yelnats is Stanley backwards so his name is Stanley Stanley what a nerd so when he gets to camp he meets mister sir good thinking you know that's doesn't nobody run away from here you know why we also meet that guy who looks like it's a letter Y was a person as well as a lot of kids at the camp these are the kind of kids to act real tough but you know they got that deep sensitive side deep down within them you also meet zero he's called zero because he's super quiet and the amount of [ __ ] he gives are zero we then get a flashback of his family telling the flashback of an old story of kissing Kate Barlow we learned that she has great grandfather was robbed by kissing Kate and she stole his treasure chest we think of the shy of Stanley's first day of digging holes he learns that he's digging to find something but also not but he also is but he's also not it's very confusing we then get yet another flashback even further back in time about Stanley shires great-great-great grandfather and it gets a little weird and complicated some [ __ ] about pig trading and arranged marriages you can keep my Pig as vetting case and the dude has to bring an old lady to the mountain or his bloodline is cursed it gets really weird but it's pretty funny if you forget to come back for Madam's alone you and your family will be cursed for always and deeper later that night in the present Stanley gets held at gunpoint by mr. sir here we get some beautiful CGI lizard carnage but just keep looking at John Boyd's face I mean how can you not enjoy that so SH I dig some more holes he finds a fossil and we get yet another flashback here we see kissing Kate Barlow before she's kissing Kate Barlow we also meet Sam who's selling onions and that is a fat ass onion but Sam is incredible we'll get to him in a bit but he's iconic as [ __ ] so we get more hole digging more hole digging and more hole digging oh baby just watch them dig those beautiful holes but then oh [ __ ] Stanley found something so everyone comes to see what it is but this one kick comes up and takes that shiz so he can get the day off tomorrow since one of the kids found something the head honcho finally comes out and we meet miss Sigourney [ __ ] Weaver she runs the joint and she [ __ ] owns your ass but first fill everyone's canteen I already filled them excuse me I had already filled them when you drove up in the car excuse me did I ask you when you last filled flashback time so we now get Sam and not Kissin Kate Barlow going on a montage of how they got closer and closer together Sam gets his way into her life by fixing all that is broken this man is a real fixer-upper I'll fix that roof in exchange for three jobs he is fast peaches he fixes her roof her door I mean he could probably fix a broken marriage I could fix it this man is like [ __ ] Flex tape he comes at her later on when she's crying and you know what he says to her oh my god this man can fix a stairway to heaven and he'll have to because later on he [ __ ] dies but you know back to the present and all the boys are digging mad holes one kid plays a prank on mr. sir and steals his bag of sunflower seeds and then he turns around and comes back for them so the kid throws a bag at Stanley and gets the boy in some hot [ __ ] how did this get here huh so mr. search takes shy back to the warden and oh boy the warden is like you're really bucking me over this stupid [ __ ] I'm gonna slice you up real quick so she cuts his face and Stanley goes back to dig some holes turns out that zero penetrated shouts hole before he could so in turn he offers to teach Hiro how to read we think in a montage of kissing Kate Barlow taking revenge on a bunch of shitty men across lands and soon the letter Y guy insults ero so hard that zero starts to give more than zero [ __ ] and he slaps him with the shovel and runs away into the desert Shia Stanley is inspired by his rebellion so he steals mr. Schurz truck and drives away until he falls into a hole he gets out and runs into the desert until he comes across an old boat zeros laying under underneath they drink this black sludge that zero calls sploosh and they head out towards the nearest mountain it turns out that Stanley's great-great-great grandfather survived by going to the same Mountain because it's called God's erection they climbed the mountain and once they get to the top they find water but not just water they find [ __ ] onions red fat-ass onions sweet [ __ ] red fat-ass onions that sustains them this movie really made me believe that red onions were actually some kind of desert growing up so we then get another flashback through this movie is only flashbacks and holes what do you want me to say so we learned that zero is the reason Shila dick dude is in the prison camp it turns out the zero was homeless and he stole the shoes and when he heard cops coming he took off the shoes and threw them over the ledge but somehow had enough time to tie them together I guess and so Shia ended up here and zero got caught like a date later stealing other [ __ ] and that's why he's there too so back to the camp Shia Stanley's lorry arrives and wonders yo where the [ __ ] is Stanley this boy is free to go home but they're still at the mountain but they get a real good urge to go dig up some holes and they go and dig a beautiful hole and oddly enough they ended up finding the treasure kissing Kate Barlow stole from his great-grandfather oh and she [ __ ] died when she just gave up on running from the cops after she buried all the loot that she took from crappy men we also learned that the warden is the daughter of one of those crappy men and she was forced to dig holes as a kid to find the treasure in the lake so that's why all these boys got a dig and [ __ ] so while Stanley a0 are in the hole with the treasure they're also covered with a bunch of deadly lizards but Stanley is just like [ __ ] it I'm getting out so he gets out and tells the warden off and turns out that the treasure has highest name on it and the Laurie I guess it can't close down Shia becomes a millionaire because it turns out that the treasure chest had like insane amounts of treasure in it zero gives more than zero [ __ ] and his dad with the foot fetish starts a company called sploosh and the end it's a happy ending huzzah blah everything works out Holt has an incredibly convoluted mad convenient plot that is strangest [ __ ] and makes no sense but God do I adore it the entire movie is just full of constant energy in the weird editing or from the over-the-top performances from all the iconic lines and moments you can see why I love this movie so much I mean just look at all of those beautiful holes so many beautiful [ __ ] holes I can't describe them perfect enough I have to send it to my boy nitpicks to bring the beauty of holes some real justice holes you make my heart all with your many holy holes it's amazing how empty one can feel without your holes inside to make one hole how many things can one stuff inside a hole in so it becomes a lesser hole if you fill a hole with a hole of sand and dig in the same spot will it ever be the same hole again all these people in the film digging hundreds and hundreds of holes and yet there's only one hole that matters and that's you holes I could go on and on about wanting you to fill my hole holes but at best our holes remain separate holes for now holes is an incredible masterpiece its beauty is incomparable but you know those holes are going to waste it would taeksoo Squarespace for sponsoring this video thanks and nitpicks for reading that beautiful poem on wholes and my boy william for eating that fat-ass red onion we also got a first official merch for this channel you can get yourself a sexy-ass shirt of my logo it's the 24th of its kind and this is that High School Musical 2 was a masterpiece on the back like come on it's amazing it comes in a long sleeve or short sleeve or you can get a shirt with my [ __ ] face on it if you want it comes a short sleeve or hoodie links in the description get yourself something nice you deserve it [Music]
