I've got a weird story I want to tell you a true story a true weird weirdly true story so there's this kid named Edwin wrist he's a talented kid and he gets into this extremely niche subculture of tying fly fishing lures and this isn't even the weird part but I do have to explain it a little bit so when you're fly-fishing you don't need much of a lure because salmon can barely see anyway but despite this fish blindness there was this hobby in Victorian times of tying these incredibly complicated detailed beautiful fly fishing lures it wasn't really about attracting the fish it was about the craft of it all and seeing how detailed and how beautiful you could make your lure allow me an analogy it's kind of like putting RGB lighting on your ram it doesn't make the computer go faster but boy does it make the other boys jealous anyway Edwin gets into this hobby and he's only 14 15 years old but he's tying things at shows and all the older dudes in this hobby are really impressed with him he's this breath of fresh air in what is an extremely old and kind of stuffy culture but Edwin is frustrated with the limits of his fly-tying because back in the day the people who did this tied with the feathers of all these beautiful and exotic birds birds that were so beautiful and so exotic that of course humanity overdid it and now most of them are endangered or extinct so Edwin and the other people on this hobby really want to tie with these endangered bird feathers but they can't because those feathers are illegal to buy it's kind of like if the hot new thing in TC building with coating your motherboard with polar bear skin but mom it'll make a boys on the subreddit so jealous so Edwin feels like he's kind of stuck without these rare and special feathers but he finds out there's a place with a ton of them the British Museum specifically a satellite of the British Museum in Tring where they keep specimens of thousands of kinds of in the museum there are birds of paradise and katanga x' and all of these other highly sought after species of birds and they're just sitting there doing nothing when they could be being turned into expensive and useless fly fishing lures so edwin makes a plan the way we all do by creating a word document that's called plan for museum invasion and then he goes to the british museum entry and he breaks a window and he gets into the hallway with all of these birds and they're dead i didn't say that before the birds are dead it's not a museum where there are like thousands of birds flying around though that would be awesome so he gets to these bird specimens and he may be meant to take just one or two but he sees these drawers and he just kind of gets swept up in the whole experience of all of it and he just starts grabbing all of them all these endangered and extinct species and he stuffed them in the suitcase that he brought and he fills up the whole trunk and he drags his trunk back across the museum and then he escapes out the window and museum security knows they've been broken into but because they have so much stuff they actually don't know what's been stolen until much later and by that time edwin is just gone he's pieced out and not only is he gone but he's actually started selling these feathers on the dark web or the black market or however these transactions take place and i know what you're thinking you're thinking why is edwin selling bow feathers i thought he was just in it for the crafts i thought he just wanted to tie fly fishing lords and this is the part where i tell you that edwin didn't just hi lures he was also a trained flautist at the Royal Conservatory of Music in London and he was selling feathers because he wanted to buy a golden flute what when I think about a museum heist I'm thinking full ocean's 11 style you know you've got the detailed plans of the museum the blueprints the gadgets the daring escapes I I just realized that it's not actually Ocean's eleven that I'm thinking about and what's weird is that some of the most successful art thieves in history have been simultaneously more and less cinematic than those movies gerald blanch our stole the kosher diamond pearl from a castle in vienna by sky diving in and then swapping the pearl with a replica he got from the Gift Shop like straight-up Indiana Jones but [Music] you've also got guys like Stefan bright wiser who stole literal hundreds of pieces of art paintings sculptures everything and he did almost all of them by just walking into a museum waiting into a guard was out of the room and then grabbing it and walking out Stefan is really interesting actually because by most measures he's the most successful art thief in history he stole 239 pieces everything under the Sun and also under protected panes of glass untold millions worth and I actually can't put a dollar value on it because Stefan never sold anything he was broke he lived in his mom's attic with his girlfriend but holy crap what an attic every square inch coated in color in Renaissance paintings and goblets and plates and silverware it's about the closest thing to a real-life dragon's lair as I can possibly imagine him and his girlfriend live in this one beautiful lavish off of the charts a legal room and his mom lives under him allegedly with no idea of what he was hiding up there and this strategy if you can call it that actually makes Stefan pretty much impossible to track most art thieves are picked up when they're selling it the black market isn't exactly airtight but because all of his paintings and sculptures and everything else just stayed in one place enjoyed by exactly two people investigators were pretty much stumped and it all stayed there at least for a while before that another story have you ever heard of the kingdom of Benin I hadn't but it's important for hundreds of years in modern-day Nigeria the kingdom was this advanced and powerful center of trade and culture it had a collection of earthen walls that were literally longer than the Great Wall of China it had one of the first-ever examples of street lights sculpted metal lamps that blazed a trail for traders at night it honestly sounds kind of like Atlantis except you know in Nigeria one of the things they were best at was metalworking the people created these beautiful and complex masks and sculptures some of the kingdoms best known work are the Benin bronze is created from five hundred to a thousand years ago their bananas cool the skill with which these were made is off the freakin charts and even more than that they're a vital look into the practices and culture of the civilization what did they do to develop this level of metalworking how did this extend into the rest of their day-to-day life and culture what's the legacy of this art these are unbelievably important in the history of Nigeria and for hundreds of years they decorated the kingdom of Benin's palace but for the past hundred years the best place to see them was the TripAdvisor number four place to visit in London Museum why did these end up here it's actually worth going into a little bit more detail because the story is pretty nuts so the British Empire is in the process of colonizing everything they can get their hands on but in the 1800s the Kingdom of Benin is still powerful enough to refuse this control it was powerful and well protected and obviously not wild about falling under someone else's jurisdiction unfortunately this only made them a more desirable target Brett sent in basically an assassination squad targeting Benin's came unfortunately for that squad word got out that the white men or bringing more I had a nickel accordingly Benin military went out and absolutely obliterated this assassination squad unfortunately the Brits respond by sending back a thousand Marines and other forces and over the days of bitter fighting they basically burned Benin to the ground and then they've looted the Benin bronzes as well as countless other pieces of art ended up in the British Empire's hands the only ones that they didn't hang on to were the ones that they sold to make up for the cost of the ransacking because apparently destroying cultures doesn't pay the bills the bendin bronzes when brought back with the troops actually faced a disbelief because they were just too complex to advance the British Empire couldn't believe that this could have come from a culture that they had convinced themselves they were superior to and summarily the legacy of the kingdom of Benin has basically faded into obscurity but just give him back right return the stolen art shake hands all in a day's work well not quite because returning what stolen is rarely a clean process Edwyn wrist bird boy thief extraordinaire was eventually caught but a boy in the hand wasn't worth birds in the BOK look he'd already sold the birds and more than that he had disassembled of the birds plucking many of them clean to sell the feathers individually for greater profit he had already removed and thrown out in handwritten tags that were attached to them that held priceless scientific information about where and when they were found ultimately any sense of justice and catching wrist feels unimportant next to the loss of so much knowledge so many irreplaceable specimens because these birds weren't just collected to have they were a century-old recognition by Alfred Wallace that these species faced an existential threat in humanity and one day these specimens might be all we have of birds of paradise and Katyn goes and all the rest and guess what he was right there's not much left of these birds environments it's shrinking every day and thanks to people like Edwin risk than the illicit buyers of the fly-tying community there's not much left of those specimens either Edwin risks story isn't half as bleak as Stephen bright Weiser's though remember him the one with a smog light collection of art in the Attic so he also gets caught eventually for a minor theft a bugle from a museum in Switzerland and the police arrest him and Stephane immediately confesses to everything hundreds of thefts even though the police hadn't even realized they were connected but eventually if the police make their way to Stefan's house throw open the doors to his attic and nothing empty walls not a painting or goblet or engraved fork to be seen because while Stefan's been in jail his girlfriend has been freaking out so she hightails at home and she finally takes Stefan's mother up to the attic and they stare for a minute and maybe the most illegal room in the history of art and then Stefan's mom takes all the sculptures and jewelry everything carved her blown are engraved she takes them all and she throws them in the Rome Rhine canal and then she takes all of his renaissance paintings all of the beautiful colors and brilliant shapes and detailed characters that had wallpaper at his room she takes the Bruegel's and the 10 yeas and the van Kessel's and the chronics she takes them all dozens of works hundreds of years old she throws these Renaissance paintings in a pile in the forest and she sets them on fire [Music] there were some that were able to be recovered thankfully a river might rust up an old plate but it won't destroy it one man found some old bronzes thrown out on the side of the road by Stefan's mother and he nailed them to the roof of his house to fix leaks but once he heard the story he returned them there's no returning those ashes though Stefan for his part was absolutely shattered by the news he was put on suicide watch in jail and unlike Edwin or the British Empire he really did seem to steal things out of some compulsive unstoppable love of the material during his trial he actually interrupts several times because he felt the paintings weren't being adequately described but still where does this leave us Museum theft is a land of contrasts that feels like a cop-out what connects them can we draw a line between Edwin risks and Steven Breit wiser and the countless colonial thefts of the British Museum I guess the thing that grabs me and strikes me so tragic about all these cases is just the sense of what's lost we know who took them we can have a fleeting sense of justice but none of that can really fill the hole of what's gone the bird specimens that Edwin stole provide far more than historical knowledge they could actually bring back lost species like a not ill-conceived version of Jurassic Park they could actually help us reverse some of the damage we've done over the past hundred years Stefan's mother didn't just burn his paintings actually she also stuffed some of them down her garbage disposal and her destruction reveals how fragile a lot of art history actually is I adore the artist Pieter Bruegel who drew these enormous detailed paintings of the Tower of Babel and marketplaces and battlefields and everything else telegraph lists one of the paintings destroyed as cheating benefits his master by Bruegel and I haven't even been able to find a picture of the thing it's weird in the age of the Internet to grapple with the fact that some things are still finite and irreplaceable once it's gone it's gone I was reading a post about the walls of Benin on a Nigerian forum called naira land and someone named rossik posted about the scale and impact that the walls once had and what's left and now imagine if this monument was in England USA Germany Canada or India it would be the most visited place on earth and a tourist mecca for millions of the world's people but instead this monument the world's largest man-made monument lies bruised battered neglected and forgotten in the Nigerian bush this is a story of the horrors of colonialism far bigger than the theft of any individual bronzes but for me they're impossible to separate because unlike Edwin's feathers or Stefan's burnt paintings these bronzes still exist even if the walls of Benin had naturally crumbled to dust these sculptures should have been a permanent fixture in the country's cultural memory a reminder of how powerful and accomplished their ancestors had been instead they sat for a hundred years in a box in London completely removed from their context that detached from the historical legacy they're a part of unlike the feathers or the ashes these bronzes can be returned and they're actually going to be on loan but that's a band-aid over a much larger scar one that all colonialism built museums need to reckon with it's easy for us to understand the tragedy of individual events like edwin zur stefan's but thefts like the Benin bronzes fall across so many lines of institutional power that it can be hard to even wrap your head around but you should try because what all of these stories tell us birds and thieves and lost civilizations is how hard it is to truly replace what's been taken [Music] my favorite thing that I read while writing this essay was the feather thief by Kirk Johnson it's on as you can probably guess the Edwyn wrist and his feather theft but it's also on so much more on Alfred Wallace and how he collected all those specimens and how his ship burned and sunk to the bottom of the sea and the bizarre black market of selling bird feathers and how much the museum was actually able to recover there's a major turning point in the book that centers around I kid you not Simon baron-cohen Sacha Baron Cohen's brother and look you've heard every other youtuber give you the generalities of how many thousands of books audible has and how easy it is to listen yada yada yada but I know that choice is paralyzing so I'm going to give you specifics go to
