free today at the link in the video description so last CES razor showed off a concept notebook shell that allowed you to take their gaming phone and put it in as like a touchpad and then like a larger Android experience and I was kind of going hey this has kind of been done before so this is a little lackluster compared to your previous concept products and be why the hell would anybody want a full-size Android experience it's terrible so MSI apparently saw an opportunity here and they are showing off a much better solution because why would you want to run a desktop experience or laptop experience on underpowered mobile hardware when you can run a mobile software experience on totally old P gaming laptop hardware so I don't normally cover like some software crap that comes bundled with a gaming notebook but the N MSI app player is actually pretty freaking cool so it's not a new concept running an Android emulator on a computer in fact they even got a sticker right here it is based on the BlueStacks Android emulator but what effectively they've done here is packaged this into something that is very usable and very practical for gamers so what you're looking at right here is the full fat Google Play Store where we can get any normal Android apps any normal Android games and yes my friends you should see where we're going with that so using this software you can use a mouse and WASD or a game controller to control Android games giving you a distinct advantage compared to people who are playing on mobile with their like touchscreen joysticks and all that stuff so the better the system the better the experience it'll take advantage of your CPU your GPU and even things like high refresh rate displays and there are other intrinsic advantages as well you don't have to worry about battery life constraints you get to use your full-size notebook great audio solution and if you plug into a wired network connection you don't have to worry about any mobile network leg bullcrap or anything like that now they're mostly focused on gaming but you can run any app from the Play Store there's a bunch of great functionality built in here as well so you can see there's hotkeys for pretty much anything and MSI's SteelSeries keyboards built into their laptops allow you to remap any of that let's just go ahead and make this fullscreen and you guys might have noticed that I'm running this on an MSI desktop now so they are not limiting it to just their notebooks in fact it's not even limited to just their gaming products so their motherboards their video cards even their new prestige series non gaming notebooks are going to have support for this app and this is a huge boon for streamers for example some people do stream android games so now all you got to do is hook up a secondary monitor run your regular OBS and xsplit and then you just run this in a window and you can do all of your gaming and streaming from one machine this is a seriously unfair advantage that's not my problem one last point is that if you suck at games like me so this is some like weird pub G clone or something you can actually run multiple games at the same time so if you're like waiting around for a respawn you can just flip over into another tab here playing on play Angry Birds or whatever while you're waiting and then just flip back over and you're ready to continue one last point clip from MSI said if I don't talk about his prestige series he's not going to send me a gigantic life-size MSI dragon so this is their new thin and light prestige series it's got like a metal chassis 8th gen core i7 so up to quad-core HDMI a couple type C's a couple Taipei's you got your SD card 1080p IP it looks like IPS yep not too bad and so the point here is basically that MSI is finally doing something other than gaming notebooks so good for them and good for try out LastPass for free today at the link below so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our collective tax 20:18 coverage by making sure you're subscribed we will see you at the next booth no you ran away from me again
