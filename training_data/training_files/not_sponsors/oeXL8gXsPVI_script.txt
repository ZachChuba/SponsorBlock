While we seem like we're  taking things really slow... When you look at the actual clock, the filming is over before you even realize it That means it's fun! I guess Yeri's enjoying her radio station! It's to the point that I'm surprised at how fast we get through this! Next! Apparently the latest trend is running through super fast like this~ LOOOOL But by the time this session is over, shouldn't the audience have a good idea of who I am? I think I know you super well! - Don't you realize that?
- You've been talking by yourself the whole time LOOOL - All of you are a party to a plot! LOOOL
- PLOT? LOOOOL Next, next What's the makeup that you care about the most before heading out or the point for fashion? It's funny how we're exchanging a conversation like this because we LOOOL We actually always meet up in casual attires Like put on a hat in gym clothes Hat x2!! I've been focusing the most on hats and masks - Right
- Because I can't leave without those... Honestly, I rarely ever wear a makeup I don't even wear lip products these days I guess she likes me a lot~ Why why why~ Of course I do~ - I guess she's sort of blinded by love or something
- NOOO~ Come on, no way Like because when I was there, she said I'm pretty She took a photo of me saying I'm pretty, and when I looked at it - Come on, WHICH PHOTO?! LOL
- I can say Yeri is a pretty good photographer You'll know what I mean if you visit her Instagram She's got a great sense of photography so she knows all that stuff - (Looking at my photo) but I was FUGLY in that photo!! LOL
- WHAT?! NO!! Which photo?? Like that film camera? - (Sorting out) You ARE pretty! Come on~
- I got very hurt just now! LOL - No no, you didn't get hurt... I actually did just now

- Hehehe That's the end of Yerihan Bang - Part 1 And we'll see you again in Part 2~ So, should we say Ddoo-hi~ Or, Ddoo-bye? Or... - We aren't done though, right?
- I guess...? Then what should we do? Ddoo-againüñê Should we just say "See you guys in part 2"...? LOOOOL I'm only a baby DJ so I'm kinda spineless... - DdooDdoo... I don't think you should use that word often
- WHYYYYYY!!! I'm already promoting this name...ü§£ I'm sure they already edited everything~üòÇ It's not aired just yet - Then, you should just call yourself 'DdooDdoo'
- Come on, how can I do that? - You should! Play it a bit vague like this!
- I planned on getting a nickname like Pengsoo... - You'll get sued then! LOL
- Will I?! Peng-hi! Peng-bye!  He owns the copyright! - I couldn't include that in my calculation!
- I'm close with Pengsoo! I want to be close too....üôÑ I've never seen him before I saw him on your YouTube channel (Jealous) - (Farewell all of a sudden) See you guys in part 2~~~
- See you~~~ - Can you hint me what we'll be eating?
