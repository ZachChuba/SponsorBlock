maybe someday maybe we'll get to take a bunch of these out to a ranch one day we'll get a jeep in one of these in a Bronco you live around Dallas or Fort Worth and you got a ranch ranch let us know give us an email Joe is doing this whole episode in song [Music] special episode today 2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser last year they made this right yep those the 2014 model year was the last year they ever made the FJ and that's what makes it special that's what makes it kind of special yeah I've never been inside an FJ cruiser neither by actually this is my first time ever being inside one too I've seen something like weirdly tricked-out fj's where they have huge sound systems in the back this is not like that it's just a regular normal FJ there's very little aftermarket parts on here I think there's some lights on the front but other than that it's pretty yeah I was pretty stock this interior is so plush it's so much more comfortable than I would have expected before how much this cost when it was brand new yeah this was about $30,000 so 27 to 30 thousand dollars brand new and the funny thing about it is what could you buy this for today still for 2014 model year with 50,000 or less miles maybe about $30,000 that's great it's retained its value so they've really scars especially the 2014 model years retain their value unbelievably well it's insane we're getting up to our normal spot we're not gonna bother doing a zero to 60 just does this it makes a whole lot of noise it does 0u canto about five thousand pounds with this which is actually I think pretty decent CD of size boat so yeah it's a midsize boat I guess but considering how slow this thing is already have you hitch a boat to this thing yeah crawlin and that leads us into the engine you have a four liter v6 for liter v6 turbo non turbo just think it's all just normal it's probably naturally aspirated 260 horsepower 60 horsepower and 271 pound-feet of torque so some more probably could use some more this thing is pretty sluggish they should have just slapped a little turbo on there just give it a little bit more it's a utilitarian truck and I can forgive it for that it's not supposed to be something fast I mean this thing weighs like it's thick oh it's over 4,000 pounds yeah it's a big boy yeah but when you add a turbo to a car it's not just for speeds and you could it really extends the life of the engine because it's not having to work so hard well I mean Toyota does know what they're doing with the longevity non-japanese of this I'm not gonna say Toyota you did this wrong I will never question to you is reliability and what they're doing was a little bit less sluggish I like the color I like that you've got the big solid metal steps on the side to get into the car up yeah on top yeah it looks cooler than a Hummer which I think the Hummer is the most like it's pretty ugly it's a pretty hideous car this is like much better yeah less obnoxious more understated but it still you're still like oh that seems like a capable off-road car still gets the poor gas mileage though you just get 16 mpg city and 20 highway which is like it's not a horrible but like that's not good yeah it's not really that great to be honest I they're not great not terrible not great not terrible I know the interior is a lot cooler I do do a lot cooler we've got start with these gauges up here yeah okay I love the gauges go ahead you've got a compass here this is like a pod cluster we've got a compass you've got outside temperature and then you've got a what do they call that thing incline yeah they've got like a ball thing that with the tells you tell it shows you the degree of what angle you're s so it looks like it like an aviation dial I think it's cool it's right for a rock yeah I do like it and they date obviously it's very analog yelling so it moves around as you drive yeah which i think is cool I think it's super like it's a nice touch ya got big chunky dials for your air conditioning your very Toyota and Toyota makes everything very utilitarian and very simple I feel lately which is great for lasting a long time because these things if they're anything like the Land Cruiser these things could last you like 20 years and that's why you buy this thing I mean not because it's the prettiest car in the world it will survive the apocalypse yeah this will last you forever like every Toyota vehicle will I mean at least that's the reputation you have with getting a Toyota vehicle yeah that's the thinking yeah the stereo unit here it looks like it's a rebranded JBL they do have JBL on here with the toyota branding i I will say the power and volume scrolling thingy dial probably thing it doesn't have any clicks so you're just spinning it forever and ever and I hate that the other one the tuning the radio tuning does have positive clicks I prefer that I wish they had done clicks on both of them but that's a little nitpicky yeah that's pretty interesting I didn't even think about that [Music] the seats are comfy this is really nice however I think the back seats are not so comfy yeah like the front seats here are good and that's one of the things I would like to discuss this can be used as a hard core like Rock Crawler off-roader yeah but it's comfy enough that you can actually use this as a daily go for sure like when I got in this and we started driving I was surprised like this is smooth it's quiet the stands are comfortable as long as you're okay with that bad relatively fuel economy of you can definitely daily this no problem it's very comfy like you said very quiet very silky smooth I like it and as climate change ravages the earth and your commute is destroyed by weather this will get you through it this will get you through it what's interesting despite this being an SUV and it being a rather large SUV on the outside there isn't a lot of space yeah this is similar to the Hummer in that regard it is well it's a big vehicle and you get in and it's yeah there's just not a lot of space which is kind of a weird design decision you have about as much room as like a sports car yeah in the backseat it's like a Mustang back seat or the Lotus back seat that we've reviewed it's very similar to that it's pretty bad but I will say I have my seat probably halfway back and I've still got plenty of legroom yeah 585 9 so for most average people if you're not super inconsiderate or giant yeah person behind you it is challenging to get in though and this is something kind of quirky about this is it's technically a two-door SUV I don't know maybe technically a four-door a two and a half doors even have three - half door dizzy - and - half quarter so you can open their normal the front doors the main doors normally you've got a handle on the inside and the outside normal are these half back doors there is no handle on the outside they're like weird suicide doors - they are they open backwards at an angle which is really interesting and there's only a handle on the inside listen that squeal I'm drifting and throwing all this go through a roundabout so this is a secretly a sports car that's ridiculous we're going maybe 15 miles yeah that was weird anyway you got a decent amount of cargo space you know I was a little underwhelmed by the cargo space yeah there's some but it's not it's not super great I'd say there's even a little bit less than the Jeep Wrangler maybe yeah honestly what are they yeah they do have power outlets back there yeah a single power outlet rather you also have like a backup camera in this which for a 2014 model year was not yet yep yeah it was ahead of its time it's kind of similar to how Jeep did it because you do have a spare tire cap in the back and the camera kind of pokes out of that yeah I will say this thing is kind of fun just you just feel like you're sitting up high yeah it's not that tall of a vehicle but your seating position makes it feel like you're driving a bunny or something yeah if we were allowed to take this like rock crawling or off-roading I think this would be pretty fun oh I totally agree I feel like it's more comfy than cheap sorry oh yeah super comfy like this is I don't know that's weird it does feel spacious in here even though it's not there's not a ton of here up here yeah definitely not in the back here in the front scene in the passenger seat it definitely feels spacious yeah you've got a lot of room between yourself in the windshield like I'd have to lean really far forward to reach it yeah got a plenty of legroom yes a the underside of the like the steering column and stuff is a little bit low so it's it almost hits your knees if you've got long legs it'll probably hit your knees unless you scoot your chair really far back so that's something to keep in mind yeah that place is oddly low off-roaders have a cult following which is why they all generally retain their values so well oh yeah like these Jeep Wranglers and Broncos and especially Land Rover defenders like the 97 to 99 year models that were sold here keep their value I mean they've exceeded they've like tripled their value yeah there are companies dedicated to taking the original Land Cruisers and or not the Land Rover Defender rather yeah and stripping them down to the nuts and bolts and like polishing everything and like refinishing it and making sure it's all good to go and just putting it back exactly how it was when it rolled off the showroom floor and then they sell it for so much more yeah I've seen defenders go for over six figures yeah these again like five years after they were made are still for fifty thousand miles or less seem to be retaining about their original value like what an investment yeah if you bought this for like five years ago used it as a daily roughly I mean that's about right I have a 2014 I've got 56,000 miles on it yes so if you'd bought this instead of your focus yeah could have paid like $30,000 for this drove it all that time for five years and then if you wanted to you could have sold it now for about the same amount of money you paid for it's great and all it's not lost any money well done Toyota that's really amazing here's here's the other thing yeah $30,000 that's a similar price to a modern 2019 Jeep Wrangler yeah the base Jeep Wranglers start around 25,000 move up from there to the Rubicon's which are in the 40s yeah but again 430 this is like you know like a sport s edition of a Wrangler it's pretty competitively priced yeah I don't know whether I would take this with a regular honestly it depends it depends on what you're into really I mean if you want a lego car maybe get a Jeep like this thing isn't as customizable as a Jeep is it jeeps maintain their values very well they did well as but like the Wranglers at least Wranglers maintain their value grates but if you want something that's a little bit quieter a little bit more trouble yeah I think exactly yes exactly that if you want something that's more like comfortable daily drivable this I mean I think this is more comfortable even than the Jael Wranglers which I have owned and I have driven extensively and I think that this is more comfortable than that but yes on the road well then there's no road noise alright less significantly less much less and I had the hardtop jl2 with the sound insulation and the still sounds miles better yes miles better than that yeah so yeah if you're looking for something more comfortable you can daily drive more probably go with this then you can still take out and have fun on the weekends if you're wanting something like more exclusively for that off-road kind of experience probably go with the Jeep yeah you can go with a base model Jeep take off the doors you throw more fun jeep wranglers are more fun than this yes I would say it's more of a toy this is more of a notable daily there's more of a jack-of-all-trades than the Jeep is yeah so starting yourself worse performance yes pretty bad pretty bad in terms of like on the road performance yeah on the road performance handling terrible with trash um acceleration trash yeah it's smooth at least it's comfortable to drive it's not it doesn't yes it doesn't pull you places but now I wouldn't take this thing around the turn at more than 30 miles an hour however I guess I would factor in some off-road capability here which is strong yeah it is good I am more of a fast kind of enthusiast yeah then a off-road kind of enthusiast and therefore I would give the performance probably a three and a half and I'm only I would give her worse than that I mean if it wasn't for the offer capabilities this would be like a 1 or 2 yeah I'm giving it a 3 and a half because of the offer of capabilities it is really bad I'm gonna give it a 4 ok because it is bad but again it's not terrible like I've driven things that handle worse on the road yeah so I'm not gonna knock it that hard it's not good then practicality which i think is pretty high I don't know I mean this thing also will last forever probably that's gonna be a tank but I give it I don't know I'm gonna give it a five and a half wow that's way harsh yeah I think that is way harsh but I mean there's no storage in this thing there's no there's no barely fits in manual it's small yeah this actually it's just a bucket you can dump stuff in I guess well yeah just bad yeah okay I'm gonna give it a seven yeah I think it's decently practical fun factor on the road almost non-existent off-road probably great probably crate I assume as tested as two and a half you're giving it a two and a half has tested yet Wow oh you were being way harsh on this all right this isn't my vehicle this isn't for me to be a bad harsh bro anyway I'm gonna give it a five mostly because I assume off-road this would actually be a blast there's just nothing fun about okay well let me knock it up a little bit let me give it a three because the ball thing just because of the ball thing you like looking at it's pretty neat look wow look at it go this is real ten degrees then cool factor I would say this is more than jeeps yeah more than some other cars of this class yeah five and a half five and a half I'm gonna go with the five quality pretty solid pretty solid its but it's it's utilitarian quality like this is not yeah a luxury car No so that's a tough call it is a tough call I think it's pretty good you know I can't give it like too high I probably give it a seven I think I said and I would've guessed I think it's seven just mostly because I'm factoring in reliability yeah long-term reliability I think will be strong if we rely ability to I'll give it a six and a half okay it's the interior it does let it down value next which i think is a stir wrong I'm gonna go right out of the gate and give it a 10 wow that's amazing I think that's the first car I've ever given a 10 on the value but how can you not this thing like it hasn't lost a says oh yes it is effectively if you've dripped if you bought this five years ago and you've driven 50,000 miles which I think it's a decent amount yeah to have driven in five years you would have almost not lost a penny on this vehicle the only money you would have lost is on the extreme amount you would pay in gas I wouldn't say it's a ten for me the value is exceptional because it does hold its monetary value that will and it is super reliable and it would make a good car no matter how many miles are on the clock I will I think I will give this an eight and a half the average score for the 2014 FJ cruiser is a 30 out of 60 right yeah perfectly balanced as are things perfectly average as all things should be but still I mean if you're looking for a budget good off-roader that's good like on the road to I would recommend this yeah I think I would agree with that I gave it some low scores but that's just cuz it's not for me this is still a very good car for that particular type of person who wants a reasonable daily driver but can also take it mudding or off-roading yeah it's great if you're limited by space limited by money this is a pretty good choice for you great car last year it was made rip little buddy will miss you that maybe will see an electric version in the future but if this is your first time watching thanks for tuning in we appreciate
