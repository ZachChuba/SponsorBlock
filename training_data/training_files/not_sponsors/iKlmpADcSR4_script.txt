all right folks welcome to something new that i haven't tried before and it's it might be a complete failure because i have not been able to test it balance it make sure the costs are reasonable and i'm not just gonna get wrecked and or uh helped too much i don't know i kind of tried to estimate to my best guess how this is all gonna work what we have here is something called crowd control it's a twitch extension plus a program on your computer plus a mod in minecraft so i go into mods i have crowd control and the way this works is it ties into your twitch account and so you have an extension uh like i have an extension on my twitch right now there will be an activity feed in the chat in the game when things start to happen people who are on twitch live watching this are able to exchange bits for coins in the extension when they do that they are able to purchase things that impact the game that could be along the lines of anything from completely unaliving me in an explosion giving me a heart taking away a heart dropping an item destroying the item that i'm holding so some help some hurt and that's that's what's gonna be happening and and stuff so i'm gonna be trying to beat the ender dragon that is the end goal connected to crowd control let the games begin glad you're excited for the oh that's okay all right ronin just spawned a cow hey i can i could oh no that's you guys could be nice if you wanted to and what you could do is you could do the helpful things you just took a heart why did you take a heart give a heart thank you oh it's gonna be such a tug of war with the hearts and the food they're gonna oh my god it's nighttime oh took a heart no don't take a heart for me pace yourselves guys we have so much time cave and heart we have so much time until i beat the ender dragon we're going to level five oh no i'm gonna be reading notifications and someone's gonna spawn a creeper that's gonna be a recurring problem oh diamond someone's nice someone was a nice person oh it doesn't just put it straight into my inventory someone tried to spawn another give it give it give it give it give it here i need to make a diamond sword they disable jumping i gotta make stairs that's the only way around no you yeeted away my oh thanks so much thank you so much you're so nice no get wrecked ray umbra fortunately i can adjust pricing on the fly if something becomes like overweight one day in ten thousand years from now i am going to definitely be able to uh beat the under my jump has been i need to make that more expensive oh shoot i can beat him with a pick out oh i'm in trouble i'm in it's raining that was nice i beat a blaze man with a pickaxe i'm increasing the price of no jump disable jump is going up to double the price nope creeper is going to 15 15. okay things are going well i'm at like 30 minutes into it and um so far i've managed to kind of not do very much see the thing is i priced the helpful things as more of a bargain than the hurtful things time lord you have been so helpful so far this is very unfortunate get some stuff going here oh my lord we're chilling though so hey nobody wants to ruin me and we just want to speed through the ender dragon i mean we have a decent amount of ender pearls and blaze rods not quite enough to fill in the portal but we're at a good we're at a good start oh thanks sparky for repairing my pickaxe that's really nice of you i need the blaze rod thank you t-man i appreciate you is that a yeah blaze rod a lot of iron a lot of iron is good back up spotted chicken actually you know what i need to sorry chicken i need your feathers because i think we're gonna have to make arrows the old-fashioned way ah spawning cream no i have to get stuff and i gotta get the important bits i'm so scared of everything i need the feathers from the chickens i need your pearl but i have a feeling that um that the second i go into the end i'm gonna get either hit with a an alive um sent back to spawn a i don't i don't know now okay i'm hungry yep mighty mo recently contributed bits to say i'm sorry jordan and it's really scaring me i just feel like he has his hand over the detonate button

an absolute legend i don't know how it works when i pause that's why i've been worried about pausing don't do any big ones okay so the count it will actually oh it will spawn a cow oh my god it's just gonna oh my god this is about to explode entities and mobs all over the place it's creating a ticking time bomb and i don't know if they're gonna suffocate or if they're going to just yeet all over the place oh lord okay so what we've learned is um pausing is is concerning to say the least oh yes you made it fast fast i'm speed i'm gonna take the existing flint that i have and call it okay can somebody feel my food no i can't change all the prices i can't the forest is on fire man i didn't think that people would just be this willing to part with so much in order to be so evil if i get a boat then i'll be fine if i get a boat i'll be fine i will be fine yes why did you destroy the boat i can't do anything i can't do anything there's not zero progress like i have the materials i need i just can't get into i just i can't craft anything because if i take two seconds i just need flint that's all i need is flint i had the flint but i didn't have a chance to craft it because i just would have been exploded and asthmatic adino just spawns cave spiders every two seconds i can't i can't i can't i can't oh i'm just we're going diamond chest plate oh my god you guys are so nice people are
