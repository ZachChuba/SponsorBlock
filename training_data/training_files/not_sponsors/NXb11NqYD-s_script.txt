in today's video we're gonna tell you how to take a common twenty dollar drone and turn it into a RC blimp in an hour welcome to flitetest guys today we have a little bit different speed of a project we are entering into the thick of winter here in Ohio so having fun indoor projects is a great way to keep flying no matter what the weather is outside these little RC blimps are a blast to fly they're a little bit different than a micro drum because they have buoyancy and they can actually float you can cut the throttle and kind of establish a glide slope it's a much different flying experience than your typical indoor micro-mini drone which is what a lot of people fly throughout the winter so without further ado you can start by getting the drone out and put it on the USB charger you want to make sure if the battery's charged as you get started building now as for the drone that we are using we're using these little cheerson drones we'll put a link down below we've specifically used this one because it does not have a built-in barometer or an altitude hold now this concept will work with many different types of drones but the main thing is you want to make sure it does not have that altitude to hold in other words you want to make sure that when you cut the throttle the props come down to a halt so the first things first you're gonna get out our trusty maker foam and you can also use your common foam core board from the dollar store but we like to use our maker foam it's a little bit easier to work with and it's also waterproof first thing you're gonna do is cut a long strip of foam anything from about 1.5 inches to about 2 inches will work but I just like to use the width of my ruler and just cut that strip of foam straight down the side after that you're gonna cut a four and a half inch strip this strip is gonna be the base plate of your frame once you cut out the four and a half inch strip you're gonna cut out an additional four inch strip cool thing about this is you can keep working off the same strip of foam that you originally cut out once you cut the four inch strip you're going to take that four inch strip and you're cut and cut it right down the middle cutting it in half these are gonna be your motor arms after you have those motor arms you're gonna cut a little half-inch sliver this is gonna be used as a riser to raise up the rear motor arm to give the props enough clearance so when the blimp lands the props don't hit the ground take that half inch riser and glue it on to the back of the four and a half inch base plate piece of foam once the glues dried you can take that four inch motor arm and glue it directly on top centered on top the half inch riser now you're gonna take your other four inch motor arm and you're gonna glue that directly on to the front of the frame with no riser this is gonna be positioned vertically once you're done you should have something that looks a little bit like this the cool thing about this project is it's pretty forgiving and you can actually make different types of frames and different size frames to get different performance it's actually a really fun testbed to do some experimenting and learn how different geometry and different lengths of things can actually affect the flight performance before we get any further first trip and let's get back to Bill moon once you're done with the frame you're gonna take your little drone and you're gonna take the props off these little props are just friction fit so typically you can just pinch them off with your fingernail or get a flathead screwdriver or a razor blade to pry them off you want to be careful because you will need to reuse these props once you have your props off you're gonna unscrew the four screws on the bottom this is gonna disassemble the main frame of the quad once you have your four screws out you can easily unclip each corner of the plastic frame to remove it inside you'll see that the quad is actually just built off of a common PCB board which is pretty cool once you have the plastic pieces removed you want to carefully push the motors up through the frame to remove them it's important not to push them down as the motor leads are not long enough and you couldn't damage them the next step we're gonna detach the motors from the PCB board and we're gonna solder extension wires onto them so we can fit them onto our new frame you can start by using a standard soldering iron with a fresh tip and solder to simply desolder the current solder leads from the PCB board just add some gentle tension to the motor leads and touch it with the iron to melt the solder and disconnect the wire after this you're gonna measure out two 3-inch wires to be used as extensions you're gonna take those three inch wires and strip the ends this can be done by taking a simple razor blade and gently brushing the wire covering and then using your fingernail to kind of rip it off and exposing the wire also if you're new to soldering be sure to check out our soldering basics video on our secondary channel called the tech channel we're uploading more and more content to this channel all the time and it's gonna be content that's gonna help you and have success in the Hobby once you have both the wire strip you're gonna want to tin them with a little bit of solder in other words you just want to cover the ends with a little bit of melted solder before you try soldering them together as you're extending these motor wires you want to be sure to pay attention to the colors of them you want to make sure that the wires are soldered back onto the PCB board in the appropriate order because you pretend these wires and their solder covering the tips all you need to do is touch them together and add a little bit of heat from your soldering iron and they should melt directly together with these now it's time to take that motor with its new extension wires and solder it back onto the PCB board the way it was originally soldered again because the soldering pad on the PCB board and the wire are pre tinned with solder it should be as easy as just sticking the wire on to the soldering pad and adding a little bit of heat to melt them together and then let go and it should be a solid solder connection once you've completed these steps you can repeat them on the three remaining motors again be sure to pay attention to the wire colors red or sometimes white usually means positive and black is always negative if you accidentally solder the wrong color wire to the wrong pad on the PCB board it's not the end of the world it'll just cause the motor to spin in the opposite direction so if you have trouble when you start trying to fly keep an eye on your motor direction and also which way the thrust is going if you find that the air is blowing in the wrong direction on one of your motors you want to first check and make sure that you have the right prop on that motor if it is the right prop and it's still blowing in the wrong direction that means that your motor is reversed to reverse your motor simply unsolder and swap them on the solder pads and resolder them down after you're done with the extensions on the motors it's time to add the electronics to the foam board frame this is when it starts to get fun during this step it's important to remember where the front of the drone is and where the front of the frame is remember that the battery charger port and the switch are on the back of the drone and the motor arms with the riser is the back of the frame you want to start by adding a small glob of glue into the center of the frame flip out the battery from under the PCB board and lay it flat as possible on the base plate of the frame next you want to add the front motors in a vertical position with a small amount of hot glue make sure the top of the motor case is lined up with the foam to make sure that the prop has enough clearance to spin without hitting the foam once you're done with the front motors you're gonna want to repeat that process on the back motors the only difference is these motors are gonna be horizontal with the motor shaft facing towards the front of the drone once you have these motors connected and you're happy with the fit you can take some scotch tape or some clear packing tape to secure the wires and just kind of clean up the wire so they don't get caught up in the props now we're gonna make a reusable hatch so you can get into the battery charger port and the power switch between flights take the remaining piece of foam and tape it to the back motor arm this is gonna act as a hinge now flip it over and cut off the excess to make it flush at the front of the frame once it's flush add a piece of tape to connect the two together after that take a razor blade and cut it back open and then you're going to add a secondary layer tape over top of that folding the end of the piece of tape over to create a tab this little tape tab is make it easy for you to open and close the hatch over and over again now you're gonna take that remaining strip of foam you're gonna cut two more inches off of it and glue it to the top of the frame you want to glue this as close to the balance point as possible once that is dry you'll use your remaining piece of foam and peel off both sides of paper to make the foam bendable Center and glue this piece of foam to the 2-inch piece of foam that you just glued to the top of the frame this is gonna act as a balloon brace that's gonna attach your frame to your balloon once you have the balloon brace glued now it's time to put the propellers back on the motors be sure to make sure that you have the props and the motors in the correct position getting the correct motor rotation and proper rotation is crucial to have success in flying once your props are on you can power on the drone and test to see if the air is blowing in the right way the front motors you will want the air blowing downwards to the ground and the back motors you will want blowing out back behind the drum now we've got a party balloon helium tank from the store for about twenty bucks but if you don't have one you can typically go to a grocery store or a party store and they should fill up helium balloons for you the bigger the balloons the better however you can use smaller balloons but just keep in mind that the more balloons you have the more mass that the motors will have to push around in the air and the less maneuverable it will be now we tried a couple different types of balloons and we actually found out of all the ones that we tested the party balloons actually worked the best we did use these longer Peapod shaped balloons and it actually looked really really cool it looked more like a traditional-style blimp but we found that it was actually a little bit harder to drive it had less Authority when you were turning and it's mainly because you have more mass in the latex balloons because there's more balloons holding the helium for this one we're gonna use standard party balloons this build is pretty forgiving so you can mount the balloons any which way you want to connect the balloons we just use scotch tape or packing tape whichever tape you use just pay attention to how it feels how thick it is because weight is crucial the light of the tape the less amount of balloons that you're gonna need keep adding more balloons until the craft becomes positively buoyant in other words you want it to flow towards the ceiling once you get that level of buoyancy you're going to add ballast for ballast we used a couple screws and some nails but you can use anything such as a Lego character or any common objects that have a little bit of weight to them to kind of balance out the balloon keep adding ballast until the balloon becomes negatively buoyant in other words you want the balloon to slowly fall towards the ground the reason for this is because when you add throttle it's going to force the balloon to go up and when you cut the throttle it's gonna come down giving you control over your altitude the reason why you want to put enough balloons on it to make it positively buoyant is because it's going to allow you to fly the craft for a little bit longer as the balloons will slowly lose their helium and their buoyancy over time as the balloons lose their buoyancy you can just simply remove some of the ballast in our case our nails and our screws to maintain a good level of buoyancy for maximum flight performance as for flying your blimp the controls are actually surprisingly pretty intuitive just like find anything RC you will need very little input to achieve smooth flight you don't need to overdo it on the controls and you'll learn pretty quickly as soon as you start to feel the controls the entire blip can actually be flown off of the left stick control your throttle with the up and down motion and then you can turn the blimp left and right just using a little bit of left and right input on the stick that being said you don't need much if you achieve the right amount of negative buoyancy on your blimp you shouldn't need very very little throttle and input to maneuver the brillant around the room once you get really comfortable with flying off stick you can start adding inputs from the right stick you can start by turning both sticks in the same direction as if they are in parallel with each other and working the throttle at the same time this is gonna give you a more aggressive turning ability beyond that you can also push the right stick forward while working the throttle to achieve higher forward airspeed pull the right stick back while working the throttle to achieve more vertical control without moving forward quite as much now here's the cool thing if you guys want to take the fun to the next level you can build a second one and share it with a friend we're strong believers that the Hobby is meant to be shared with other people and not only will you improve your skills faster sharing it with somebody else but you're gonna have much more fun fun competitions such as racing or even having air balloon battles in the sky are a great way to use these awesome indoor blimps now as you guys know we love to do big huge RC flying projects and we still plan on continuing to do those into the future but we had a lot of comments from you guys out there who wanted to see more projects that were approachable that you can do at home so we hope you enjoyed this RC blip project let us know down in the comments if you plan on building one make sure you subscribe yet if you haven't and we'll see you next time [Music]
