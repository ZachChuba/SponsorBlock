[Music] NASCAR has been ingrained in American culture for so long that it's hard to say where it even came from it almost seems like our founding fathers included it in the Constitution when creating our great country but as wholesome as NASCAR seems it has a very checkered past nowadays we see drivers like Jimmie Johnson Ryan Blaney and Kyle Busch as legendary triumphant role models but their predecessors going back only a few generations were outlaws souping up their cars and stripping down anything that got in the way of more moonshine you heard me right NASCAR was started by moonshine bootleggers the distillation and sale of unauthorized alcohol or moonshining has been going on in America for as long as America has been going on in America shortly after the American Revolution in the late 1700s the New Republic was short on cash and needed to tax liquor amongst other things to make up for the cost of the war here you are an American colonists having just fought a war over taxes and your new government is raising taxes all you wanted to do was celebrate with some libations needless to say it didn't take long before people started making bootleg alcohol so they didn't have to pay egregious taxes they did it at night under the moonlight so the authorities couldn't see them hence the name moonshine farmers that emigrated to the US with countries like Scotland and Ireland started moving west to modern-day states like Pennsylvania Tennessee and Kentucky to scoop up cheap land with them they brought their knowledge of alcohol distillation farmers would make whiskey out of surplus crops of rye barley corn and wheat in 1791 Treasury Secretary and hip-hop legend Alexander Hamilton sought the tax on all liquor being produced in the u.s. in an attempt to get the u.s. out of the financial hole caused or the Revolutionary War whiskey distillers were seeing red and it wasn't just because they were drunk on whiskey this was their livelihood they protested violently again taxes in what was known as the whiskey rebellion farmers dodge taxes protested and even organized armed resistance the rebellion didn't work but the tax was eventually overturned in 1802 by President Thomas Jefferson either way it was whiskey time for the next 100 years distillers enjoyed tremendous relatively uninhibited growth this is the era in which many family distilleries we see nowadays flourished like Jim Beam Jack Daniels and T W Samuels of maker's mark in the early 1900's a social moralist movement centered around the nation's drinking problems was gaining steam dry Crusaders as they were called at the time and rallied to end the trade of alcoholic beverages in the US they saw alcohol as a societal cancer in the root cause of the country's biggest problems including domestic abuse political corruption and of course alcoholism slowly but surely breweries closed individual states started outlawing alcohol and in 1920 the 18th amendment was passed solidifying a nationwide prohibition of alcohol everyone was pumped just kidding moonshiners were stoked for moonshine families who had been making spirits on their own for generations prohibition was the best possible news they could get alcohol was no longer legally available anywhere in the US so you guys that means business was booming everyone wanted White Lightning and were willing to pay big money for it moonshiners would make the hooch then give it to runners to deliver to customers runners had to be quick and have intimate knowledge of back roads to evade anyone trying to bust snitch or steal from them driving down the mountain roads at night is treacherous especially when you're being chased by the IRS sometimes drivers would even kill their headlights and disabled brake lights in order to evade the fuss and still drove at night that takes balls big ones their cars had to look normal for stock to throw off any unwanted attention passenger seats and floorboards were removed make room for more bottles the suspension was beefed up to handle the extra weight and protection plates were welded in front of the radiator to protect it from dirt a good mechanic could tune and improve the stock engine they were making these things freakin rally cars one thing runners didn't skimp on was tires the quality of tires you had on your car meant you were either getting paid or getting busted there for the rum smuggler at all times used the best tires that could be bought many a runner served time in jail simply because his rubber failed him at some critical moments foreign cars were popular with runners at the time it's ironic because Henry Ford was an outspoken prohibitionist the Model T was affordable and could blend in well with the public as three out of four cars on the road at the time were Model Ts the Ford v8 coupe is probably the most iconic bootlegging car of all time the stock black paint was perfect for driving undetected at night and the flathead v8 engine wasn't anything to stop it it wasn't uncommon to swap out another more powerful engine like the v8 from a Cadillac the biggest v8 available at the time the torsion bar was highly praised by bootleggers as it provided extra stability when haulin all that shot and haul it did when stripped down this little Ford coupe could hold up to a hundred 32 gallons of moonshine that's a hangover right there actually you'd probably die when the runners weren't running moonshine down a mountain in the dead of night they were racing other runners on the weekends races started on public roads and highways and progressed to corn fields and pastures reputations grew and soon their races all over moonshine country and thus stock car racing was kind of born prohibition was eventually overturned because it was a dumb idea from the get-go the end of prohibition didn't mean the end of bootlegging though moonshiners continued to produce alcohol I'll be it on a smaller scale now that runners didn't have to make many more runs and more time to race after World War two many racetracks wouldn't allow runners to race fearing that the outlaw bootleggers would tarnish the image of the racing organizations Atlanta's Lakewood Speedway became the first race way to allow known bootleggers promoters caved to potential protests to allow bootleggers that would have caused way more problems than just allowing a couple of hooligans to race in the first place several stock car racing associations existed but they lacked uniformity and consistency bill France senior a skilled mechanic saw an opportunity to unite these associations he recognized the skill of bootleg drivers and didn't see them as a threat to racing bill organized a meeting at the streamline Hotel in downtown Daytona Florida on December 14 1947 and there the National Association for stock car auto racing was formed two months later in February 1948 the first NASCAR race was held at Daytona Beach the winner read Byron in his Ford coupe America's love for NASCAR runs much deeper than just racing NASCAR encapsulates an attitude that describes what America loves the most rebellious fast and illicit fun it's
