there are many staples of to be 2t one of the oldest and most bizarre servers in Minecraft lava casts illegally placed bedrock and dupe stashes to name a few but by far the most well-known and essential staple of to be 2t is the nether highways traveling in the nether is essentially 8 times faster than traveling in the overworld so players have created highways there that make it exceptionally easier to travel throughout the server every day players use these highways to travel to bases and stashes far away but how far what is the absolute limit you can push these nether highways well today we're gonna find out how far these tunnels actually go and the history behind them now before we get started I put a ton of effort into editing my videos to make them straightforward to follow and enjoyable to watch however if you're new yourself and thanks so much to filmora for sponsoring today's video the history of nether highways on to b2t really started well when the nether was released to Minecraft servers that's right during the early part of to be tooties life the nether didn't even exist at all only until beta 1.6 or May of 2011 was the nether finally supported on minecraft servers from there players started creating tunnels to get to places much quicker than they would have in the overworld eventually four main highways would be created the positive and negative x and z highways all starting at zero zero over time these highways were expanded further and further depending on how far certain players wanted to go at the time before June of 2016 the server wasn't really that popular and only had a few players online at a time so there wasn't really much of a need for super long nether highways to get to insane distances however the day June 1st 2016 changed everything the camping rusher created his first to be 2t video and players left and right started joining the server this rush of players created a huge desire to get as far out as possible to hopefully stay safe from the chaos of the rest of to be 2t this resulted in the highways to expand faster than they ever have before even the diagonals really started to take shape but for one player even a few million blocks out in the overworld still wasn't enough in December of 2016 a player by the name of burns II made a post on the to be 2 T subreddit with plans to reach the overworld border of to be 2 T 30 million blocks out his plan was simple reached the world border or die trying so burnsy started walking on the positive x highway he went further and further and when he got out to just around a hundred thousand blocks in the nether that's when the 2x3 horse tunnel ended from here on out the tunnel was only one by two blocks then after walking eight hundred thousand more blocks the tunnel finally ended that was as far out as anyone on the server was willing to dig at the time but this didn't stop burnsy he started to dig but luckily he didn't have to do it alone due to the popularity of his reddit posts players actually started helping him complete his journey by digging the tunnel while he was offline this group of people eventually became known as the diggers which was led by burnsy himself many milestones were built along the way usually every 25,000 blocks in the nether some of the more notable ones were the halfway milestone the 24 million overworld milestone and the actual world border 3.75 million blocks in the nether and 30 million out in the overworld it was finally complete just over three months from burns easily reddit post it took over 30 people to dig one of the longest tunnels in Minecraft history over time the diggers and other groups on to beat Sardi eventually dug out the rest of the 90-degree tunnels to the overworld border each of course being 3.75 million blocks long from zero zero so those highways were the longest roads ever built in Minecraft right well we're actually forgetting something remember those diagonal highways I mentioned while those were never fully extended to the world border that is until now a new group called the motorway extension gurus was created specifically to extend and improve the nether highways of to b2t with focus put towards the diagonal highways the group started out as one digger Citadel to-to-to-to he had a similar plan to burnsy that is to get to the corner world border by any means necessary when he eventually made it to the five million nether milestone he started to build there when suddenly another player showed up Bill Ville 5:02 they eventually became good friends and created a new goal not only to dig to the overworld border but make the tunnel large and to make traveling much easier imagine traveling diagonally in a 1x2 tunnel that would certainly not be fun of course digging a large 3x3 tunnel to the world border with only two players would have been much too tedious that's where automation comes in a proficient programmer named Vera Vaughn joined the group and created a custom version of baritone that completely automated the tunnel digging process later on three more members joined the group to help with the dig Dan techs Rath Kevin Casey 2014 and super bad now with a team of six all running this powerful bot they could all dig at once and can mine up to a hundred and twenty five thousand meters in the nether per day early on in the dig unbreakable pickaxes were pretty common on the server so mining this highway was pretty easy but then right in the middle of the project the admin of to b2t housemaster patched them so it was back to regular on breaking three pickaxes for the remainder of the dig diggers had to constantly restock their pickaxes to reach the world border digging a tunnel that size takes 9375 unbreaking 3 pickaxes that were of course duped to no end it was definitely an annoyance but that certainly didn't stop the diggers so they dug and dug and after seven months just recently the group has successfully completed the negative negative diagonal highway all the way to the world border this group alone has set the world record for the longest road ever built on a survival minecraft server so how long is it well because this is a diagonal highway we're gonna have to do a little bit of middle school math we'll use the Pythagorean theorem to see how far this tunnel really is so we know a is three point seven five million blocks in another and B is also three point seven five million blocks so let's plug those numbers in and BAM five million three hundred and three thousand three hundred blocks from zero zero in the nether or forty two million four hundred twenty six thousand four hundred and seven blocks in the overworld and the crazy part is that the motorway extension gurus aren't even done yet they aren't only building the negative negative diagonal highway but all the other three that are still yet to go to the overworld border this is an incredible task many months of digging and tens of thousands of pickaxes will be used to fully dig out the diagonal nether highways on this crazy ten-year-old minecraft server now I just wonder what'll be next maybe an overworld highway to the world border but maybe that's a bit too far-fetched [Music]
