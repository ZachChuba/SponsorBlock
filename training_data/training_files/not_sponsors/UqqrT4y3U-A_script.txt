BINNIE : I'm so sad. It's not chocolate cookie. It's supposed to be strawberry cookie. SEUNGHEE : Why did you order that? BINNIE : It's supposed to be strawberry cookie but I guess I accidentally ordered chocolate cookie. It's good! I really wanted strawberry cookie though. But I made a mistake, as usual. It's not even surprising. HYOJUNG : Is my face very puffy?
BINNIE : Yes. HYOJUNG : Today, I ate ramen that Seunghee cooked for me together with kimchi.
BINNIE : Seunghee's really good at cooking ramen! HYOJUNG : Seunghee keeps eating expired food.
BINNIE : Yeah. SEUNGHEE : They won't kill you! HYOJUNG : We ate kimchi with ramen today. When was the kimchi's expiry date? It was best before December, 2019. I ate it because I thought Seunghee bought it recently. HYOJUNG : But it was due before December.
SEUNGHEE : But you enjoyed it! HYOJUNG : I was so surprised. I found out about it after I finished it. I threw away what was left of it. HYOJUNG :  "You also feel itchy and dizzy right? You feel just the same as me, right?"
SEUNGHEE : "Your symptoms are the same as mine." BINNIE : That's too much!
HYOJUNG : "You should get going now." SEUNGHEE : That's too exaggerated.
BINNIE : Try that scene. BINNIE : I watched the "I also give shots myself too" scene with her.
SEUNGHEE : She always follows it. BINNIE : We watched it together.
HYOJUNG : Come here. Come here. "I also give shots myself too." BINNIE : It doesn't go like this! It's too exaggerated.
SEUNGHEE : Why do you have to wrinkle the nose? BINNIE : She says it with such a poker face unlike you. SEUNGHEE : It just goes like "I also give shots myself too" but you're like "I ALSO GIVE SHOTS MYSELF TOO!"
BINNIE : My nose feels itchy. SEUNGHEE : She wrinkles her face here. "I also give shots myself too." MIMI : My daily life is just eating. I'm going to be posting another one between today and tomorrow But that one's really just going to be me eating. All I do is eat. My life is just about eating and working. Aren't we all like Dobby? Right? I'm Dobby and I'm responsible for the music in your daily life. I'm Dobby and I'm in charge of rapping. Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Dobby Kim. BINNIE : I tied theirs prettily but the other members tied mine weirdly. What is this! JIHO : Didn't I tie hers prettily? She also tied mine. [HYOJUNG : We ranked 1st for two weeks in a row]
MIMI : I see your eyes shaking.
JIHO : Show them! JIHO : That looks fine.
MIMI : Yeah, it's not bad. JIHO : I tied it well, right?
HYOJUNG : YooA, come here. Look at the camera. MIMI : Jiho, look.
JIHO : Mine's okay too. MIMI : I told you it's okay.
HYOJUNG : YooA, you look cute too. HYOJUNG : YooA looks cute. MIMI : What is this?
JIHO : Wow, YooA's is really nice. MIMI : Show them the back. Look at this.
JIHO : This one's too small. HYOJUNG : MIRACLE gave us such a big present.
YOOA : Yes, this is what MIRACLE has given us. YOOA : It's our first time getting awarded two times in a row at 'The Show.'
HYOJUNG : It's really our first. HYOJUNG : Thank you so much MIRACLE. MIMI : To our MIRACLE Dobbies who are at home. MIMI : Cheer up!
JIHO : Why are you suddenly into Dobby? MIMI : What? JIHO : Are you watching Harry Potter again? MIMI : No, no. That's not it but... yeah. Anyways, thank you so much MIRACLE. I love you all. JIHO : This is all thanks to you guys. MIMI : I love you!
JIHO : Thank you! BINNIE : Thank you so much MIRACLE. Today, I actually felt like We're not gonna make it. SEUNGHEE : Yeah.
BINNIE : I felt unsure... BINNIE : How should I put this? Yeah... SEUNGHEE : Yeah, this has never happened before.
BINNIE : Yeah, we were never ranked first for two weeks in a row. BINNIE : So I wasn't sure that we would make it. But we were able to become "The Show's Choice" For two weeks in a row, Thanks to you, MIRACLE! SEUNGHEE : Thank you! ARIN : Thank you!
BINNIE : Thank you so much you guys. BINNIE : We wouldn't have been able to do it with out you all. SEUNGHEE : Never.
ARIN : We wouldn't have been able to. SEUNGHEE : Thank you so much. ARIN : Let's stay happy with OH MY GIRL. SEUNGHEE : Let's be happy.
BINNIE : I love you. SEUNGHEE : Thank you. JIHO : It's my first time to wear this. HYOJUNG : What was that?
JIHO : I was posing. MIMI : She's camera 3 and I'm camera 1. JIHO : We also begin with "M COUNTDOWN" though. I gave the idea. MIMI : "Inkigayo". JIHO : I also thought of "Inkigayo". Start. I also thought of this pose for "M COUNTDOWN". MIMI : It's Jiho's idea. JIHO : This is the key point here. MIMI : Start. HYOJUNG : Who didn't vote via #2336? Did everyone vote for OH MY GIRL by text message? Please don't think that your 20 cents are going to waste. Everyone, vote now. #2336. #2336. You all did it, right? SEUNGHEE : Some kind of moon has been up these days... BINNIE : The moon?
SEUNGHEE : Because of the moon.... SEUNGHEE : Why am I the only one who knows this? I heard that the moon has an effect on us all, for sure. BINNIE : The moon?
SEUNGHEE : You can't sleep well. SEUNGHEE : The news said that people are affected by the moon.
BINNIE : I slept really well. SEUNGHEE : It was on the news though. BINNIE : I slept for 8 hours last night. What moon? ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ Moon moon what kind of moon~ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ A round moon like a tray~ ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ SEUNGHEE : ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ Where is it right now~ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ BINNIE : ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ Right here~ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ HYOJUNG : The heart hats are so cute. SEUNGHEE : The hearts.
JIHO : The hearts. HYOJUNG : It suits Binnie so well. YOOA : Binnie looks adorable. YOOA : Let's go, guys!
SEUNGHEE : Come here. HYOJUNG : Let's leave some space for Arin. JIHO : We'll put Arin right here. JIHO : I'm hugging her over here. HYOJUNG : One, two, three! One, two, three! Thank you. HYOJUNG : I love this heart so much. HYOJUNG : I'm gonna try it on.
YOOA : Watch your hair. SEUNGHEE : It says 1 right here, 1. 1 on the back! I knew she would want to have this. YOOA : Oh, this thing. HYOJUNG : So cute! Your head is too big. I love you, MIRACLE. YOOA : Love you. HYOJUNG : I have so much love for MIRACLE. YOOA : Heart! heart!
HYOJUNG : Three, four! Ta-dah! YOOA : Move. They have to fix my makeup, so move, please. MIMI : Got it. MIMI : Get your makeup fixed, then.
YOOA : Okay. YOOA : You can interview her while I get my makeup done. MIMI : I'm working right now. YOOA : You intruded my V LIVE... MIMI : I did. Why couldn't you read them though? Why. Why. Why. Why. ARIN : I went home early and I was just lying down when I saw that we won 1st place. Then, I watched their encore performance and apparently they called my name 16 times. I watch all of that. When I was watching it, I was so touched that I almost cried, seriously. They were like "Arin!", "Arin!", "Arin!" and it was really sweet of them. BINNIE : 3 weeks go by so fast. It's both longer and shorter than you expect. But, for the ending, Seunghee and I prepared a really cute performance. I hope that MIRACLE can spot that. We planned it ourselves. When Seunghee throws a little heart towards me, I go "I was a little flustered". SEUNGHEE : Arin's big bun. HYOJUNG : Arin's bun was covering Jiho's face. JIHO : Whatever, it's fine. YOOA : It's so cold. These clothes don't cover much. It hurts. It hurts. SEUNGHEE : Did you know? It becomes warmer if you hug like this.
YOOA : Warm. YOOA : I feel loved. It hurts. YOOA : Can I pick one for you?
SEUNGHEE : Sure. YOOA : You are like a ripe apple. YOOA : You don't like it?
SEUNGHEE : No. YOOA : ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ My face is like an apple~ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ It's so pretty~ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ Why do you seem upset? YOOA : Mangos are uglier. You want to be a mango?
SEUNGHEE : True, I agree. SEUNGHEE : Mangos are like this.
YOOA : Mangos look kind of like this. YOOA : What about aloe? SEUNGHEE : Aloe sounds good.
YOOA : Okay. YOOA : You want it?
SEUNGHEE : Yeah. YOOA : This one doesn't work but this one does. SEUNGHEE : You took the change already. YOOA : Of course I took them first.
SEUNGHEE : Wow. YOOA : Pretty. SEUNGHEE : Arin, you are so cute. ARIN : Whatever. YOOA : Fine, sorry.
SEUNGHEE : Sorry. YOOA : Let's just go. HYOJUNG : Hyojung~ YooAee~ YooAee? YOOA : Arin looks so good with that hair ribbon. YOOA :  I want to wrap her up and take her.
BINNIE : I know. HYOJUNG : Arin is all gift-wrapped.
YOOA : The ribbon is bigger than her head. MIMI : Arin's a cutie. JIHO : The bun makes Arin's cuteness stand out.
HYOJUNG : So beautiful. HYOJUNG : Why is Arin so tall? Don't wear big ribbons from now on. BINNIE : Or else we're screwed.
HYOJUNG : Or else we're screwed. YOOA : She's the tallest one of the group. JIHO : MIRACLE, you guys made this possible. Thank you, MIRACLE. It's our first time being first place on "Music Bank". It's all thanks to MIRACLE. Thank you so much. HYOJUNG : Whoa, first place in Music Bank. SEUNGHEE : I know right? Thank you. SEUNGHEE : Thank you. HYOJUNG : It would have been nicer If MIRACLE could come to the show And enjoy our performance together. I hope to see you guys soon. I hope you stay healthy. I love you all. BINNIE : I miss our MIRACLE. Thank you. YOOA : It took so long, didn't it? HYOJUNG : Yeah, it took quite long. YOOA : She's such an incredible person. SEUNGHEE : She adapts to change pretty well. I put them on her cheeks. YOOA : I took them off. SEUNGHEE : Oh, you got a mark here.
YOOA : Oh my god! HYOJUNG : This trophy shows how hard we've worked.
SEUNGHEE : It's so pretty. SEUNGHEE : The trophy looks amazing. It's heavy. It's very heavy. I feel restless. Because it's heavy. Thank you. HYOJUNG : Shall I try this? Oh, they're cherries. HYOJUNG : It's Yoo Shi A (YooA).
YOOA : Oh, that's me. YOOA : How could you eat that, it's me! I'm not someone who gets eaten so easily like that. But she ate me so easily. I can't forgive her. As she looks like an apple, I'm gonna eat one apple per day starting tomorrow. Oh, it's sour. SEUNGHEE : *Syasya is syeosyeo.
YOOA : Oh my gosh.
(*pun: sya and syeo sound similar to SIAH and sour, respectively) YOOA : She's hopeless. SEUNGHEE : Let's try making emojis, shall we? The first one, "Hopeless". Hopeless. The second one, "Hi". Hi. The third one, "Count on me". Count on me. The last one! YOOA : Don't make me do anything weird. Oh, I hate it. YOOA : What? I've done nothing. SEUNGHEE : You did it like this. MIMI : Her reggae braids are very noticeable. It looks like they're smiling. HYOJUNG : Wow! Kim Mimi.
SEUNGHEE : ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ I don't need it, maybe ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ MIMI : YooA's appearing a lot today in the "nanananana" part.
SEUNGHEE : Right. YOOA : What? Nandananda? SEUNGHEE : What's this? SEUNGHEE : What's this?
MIMI : I said you're appearing a lot in the "nanananana" part. HYOJUNG : Oh, something's on Jiho's hair. She took it off. YOOA : You mean "beauty"? SEUNGHEE : Man, this is really... MIMI : Seunghee styled her hair with hair pins today, right? SEUNGHEE : That's right. HYOJUNG : She has a new hairstyle, too, today. JIHO : Right. Bye~ HYOJUNG : We're done now. SEUNGHEE : For the last three weeks, so many happy and unbelievably amazing things have happened. Winning 1st place in all three broadcasting stations Was my New Year's resolution for 2020. And it did come true. So I'd like to win the "Artist of the Year" award. Or the "Performance Girl Band" award. I hope that our MIRACLE who believes, leans on, Loves and supports us all the time, And our families, As well as WM staffs, Become more proud of us. I'm so glad that we're getting there Step by step. I hope we'll be able to get much closer to achieving the goals. HYOJUNG : It was a very enjoyable promotion,
JIHO : Right. HYOJUNG : And we had so much fun trying out various styles.
JIHO : Right, right. JIHO : Your hair band was so pretty.

YOOA : I'm wearing the same yellow color as Chick Arin's. YOOA : What do you think? We look good together, right? YOOA : By the way, Arin, it's our last show.
ARIN : The last show. Our three-week promotion is finished. YOOA : Don't you think time flew so fast somehow?
