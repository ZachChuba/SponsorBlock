you're wasting time exact just bounce off the blade and go hi I'm Ryan I've been fencing for 12 years and I'm the co-owner of swordplay Lake my name is Tyler I'm a professional fencer I've been teaching at swordplay for about five years today we're gonna be analyzing footage from Star Wars Jedi fallen order I've played this game through like three times and I'm super stoked to look at this one don't forget ology for more videos like this one let's see how life savers compare to real life sword fighting let's do it alright let's go let's go oh man dodging spin boom man I love the pairing system just like whatever yeah it's great that was a straight-up lunge - whoa that's another one yeah and then she she taunts him nice she loved herself open she deserves to get on that one [Music] Wow XS yes I hope yeah blade yeah you'll see a lot you'll see why it does this in a minute see it turns into a thing turns into though yeah in Star Wars it's commonly called a saber lock I call it stupid it's like you're wasting time exactly just bounce off hit lading go yeah yeah it looks cool it's flashy it that's the drama but it doesn't have any practical value yeah it's probably a bit different with like double lightsabers in the crazy concept still the same you know yeah there's gonna be that power struggle it's gonna be over quick nice oh man the dodging is so good in this game this person playing in knows their knows the game so well that's amia what behold great nice parry and follow-up yeah so much trash-talking they gotta be yes we can feel bad about in your direction nice I do like the look of feeling oh crap yeah so have you ever like he used to swords and like a do a little fashion with your students yeah and it's a bad idea when you're using two blades you have more to keep track of so the more you move your weapon around it's already hard to keep track of where the blade is and I'd now imagine doing that with two White's right it's difficult and usually inadvisable you're mostly gonna be using it for defense yeah exactly yeah this was such a hard fight I can't tell you how many times I've died to hurt that's why I finally got it right nice lunge although I don't know how practical that is no way yeah it's by the narrow in some organs he's like yes sure it's interesting the way they had made the parries work you have to time it just before the attack hits you just hold it down you're just blocking rather than actually deflecting the incoming attacker so you have to be a decisive humming yeah to make a post we were rewarded for your timing rather than your like stubbornness yeah well warning from button matching exactly out in fear thinking tactically yeah and playing smart and there are a lot of different ways that you can parry sometimes your opponent will have tell Telegraph what they're about to do they'll gradually gain speed before they attack or that our shoulder will get all bunched up they'll pull the arm back they like crouched down a little bit maybe and that'll tell you that the attack is about to come so Perry is just a blocking motion where you're tapping the blade I just tap the blade and that's enough to send offline right that's like tapping the blade is sending his weapon off course you're going in the lava dude oh man [ __ ] well you know video games they have invisible walls so who cares Chuck so I know she's so funny I love the Guinness game so much my main thing is that all the moves are just so fast some of the things are very acrobatic that you know you wouldn't really want to try with that with an actual sword lightsabers tech don't have a lot of weight to them if I need ya they seem really like yeah they would yeah you'd probably be able to move a lot faster than with one of those and you wouldn't with play with a regular sword the weapon favors like glancing parries yeah so like hard blocks they very rarely hold their blade just up straight up at the top it's always bent at an angle it's really cool because she was actually doing legitimate fencing lunges yeah yeah the alums really are amazing that keeps the integrity of like the footwork and the blade work they're both are really balanced like there's by dodging a bunch of paring and glancing blows and like flipping and stuff but there's also like really a lot of blade contact and sword fighting exchanges that you have to pay attention to how fast pace it is so yeah it's cool to be able to get into someone's face and halfway parry riposte off and then just jump back into dodging yeah it's really a lot of fun yeah this game surprises me at how many like legitimate sword fighting techniques you know they put in there from the lunge the parry riposte system even just the dodging out of the way that you got a lot of really good sword fighting stuff in here along with some great high fantasy it's it's a great game I love it may the force be with you we amassed now I have to do this one is ever wonder because no one knows I love the bouncing like you like you have an idle animation [Music]
