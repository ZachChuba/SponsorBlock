I'm here because I wanted to get to know you too~😊 OMG What's going on!😍 (Today's Yerihan Bang will be with Yubin unnie whose got unexpected charms!💗)
(Yeri and Yubin unnie (Let's Start Ddu Ddu!!👉👉👉👉) (Feeling shy beforehand😅)
(Ddu Ddu feeling awkward before starting) (Anyway, Ddu Ddu's energy level seems a bit odd today!🙄) (Yeri is nervous for today's episode~) (I guess... Anyone can tell?!🤔) (Today's guest)
(A powerful rapper in Wonder Girls - Yubin unnie✨) (Our 21-years-old Yeri is in good terms with unnies out there🌺) (Let's kick start the energetic Yerihan Bang for today! Let's go⭐) Ugh... I think I'll (Click) ON AIR How were the first impressions of friends who are around you? There are people who are very friendly like those who you've met for the first time but feel like he/she is your bestie, like Yeri who has puppy-like charms! I was kind of intimidated because she seemed like a cold person at first But we all have those people who are actually super friendly and warm out there! Today, we'll have a guest, Yubin, who I want to bring when I ask for a refund but actually is the sweetest person out there!😁 (Did anyone call me?!😶) (Yerihan Bang is shaking) I'm a streaming DJ Yeri~😅 Is she coming in?

(💗Got a silver button for reaching the 100k subscriber milestone💗) (CEO Yubin's luxurious present✨)

Let's not say Ddu-hi today...😅 (Giving up her signature intro for some reason?!)
Why? Do it for us~ (Explaining how her nickname Ddu Ddu started)
Why Ddu Ddu though? It means I'm full of puppy-like charms! - We're supposed to say 'Ddu-hi'... Will you do it together...? LOL
- Alrighty! I'll do it :) (Everyone say Ddu-hi OK👌) (Nervous) I can't look at her properly (Her eyes fixed at the camera)
(Ddu-hi - Extremely shy version) Ddu-hi~✋✋✋ Alright! Today! LCBW! (The person who Looks Cold But is Warm inside~💗) She actually looks like a warm person too! (Scriptwriter's official: Maybe because she's wearing a warm knitwear(?)... lol)
Isn't that just your opinion though? People tell me I actually look like a warm person in real life but when they see me on stage (People misunderstand due to her charismatic appearance on stages) (Approved) So you are indeed LCBW! Then, with Yubin unnie who Looks Cold But is Warm inside~ Oh, can I call you unnie?!!😶 - Oh~ Of course!

Exactly this kind of vibe~ (Thinking out loud)
It was absolutely gorgeous...💗 (Our Ddu Ddu was a stan of Wonder Girls)

Uh~ Yeah, so I won't be Ddu Ddu anymore after today lol My Yerihan chance for today?! The audience thinks I'm an intimidating, charismatic person and many younger artists talk to me way too formally (Yeri's reaction is malfunctioning today) Like this!!! Just like that!!! I want to be a warmer person and want to tell everything about me when someone's curious~ So I'm not an intimidating person to younger artists or anyone~ I'm a very warm! and wanted to tell everything I'm a nice unnie who is an attentive listener (Spread her words~😁) On the list of 'Unnies who I want to bring when I ask for a refund" (The leader of expedition to getting a refund: 'Yubin')
Yubin is always on everyone's list~ But based on what I know about you... I don't think you are someone who can say those kind of stuff... (I always get my money back👌)
Nope, I'm actually really good! (Awkward Ddu Ddu)
Oh~~ You do~~ Hehe Yubin unnie's chance words are~ (1. Not intimidating + 2. Nice unnie)
Apparently a keyword to describe her is 'innocent'~ hehe Ooh! Innocent~ I'll hang this Yerihan chance in my company~ OH FOR REAL?😳 (Ddu Ddu starting to feel responsible)
You actually will...? LOL Are you sure you're ok with that?? lol (So good👌)

Then, let's not ask questions! (Now's my chance to shine!)
I'll just give it to you as a present! (Yeri the Genius) (Deleted the 10 Q 10 A feature and inserted a tea time)

How much can you drink? I do love drinking but I rarely do! (Completely average) I think I'm like that too! Can't drink that much but wants to join parties! (Yubin will teach life hacks on how to stay at parties without passing out)
I'll give you life hacks in just a bit~ OH MY! Alrighty!👌 Q. You are actually an innocent person, but are there any pros to your 'intimidating' appearance? (For sure!) Everyone's careful and I love that! I kinda enjoy that! People don't make me feel uncomfortable! (A must-have special feature that innocent Yubin needs)
I can actually have some alone time when I need it Next question hehe Mr. JYP promised that he will offer a big TV as a gift on air! Q. Did Mr. JYP keep his promise on what he claimed to offer? We're in a shared office, so we can't hang TVs on the wall so he actually bought the most expensive air purifier out there! (Kept his promise👌) You eating gamjatang* in the morning became the talk of the town!
*Korean pork bone soup Q. What's Yubin's most favorite food? GAM.JA.TANG It's gamjatang these days! I used to love all food with avocado! (Ddu Ddu is a true avocado lover who even puts avocado in Korean rice rolls💚)

I kinda wanted to get married too! When I'm only 22 years old (in Korean age) LOOOOOOL Don't rush it~ (Unnie's sincerity...💗)
Now's not the time~ Alright, so we'll actually try Yerihan Bang - 10 Q 10 A! You have to answer in 3 seconds! (Yeri, who hates herbal medicine tea, prepared these questions!)
I picked all of these questions! I've only picked the ones you just CAN'T answer... Oh... Right... Herbal medicine tea... It's so that I can avoid drinking them LOL Alright, here we go! rrr entertainment's first artist, aka family member Hyerim, who is shrewd and intelligent, graduated from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies As her CEO! Q. What was Hyerim's major? (It was something like Interpretation and Translation...?)
Uh... Interpretation and Translation... something like that? (YES!! AVOIDED THE HERBAL TEA TODAY!!!)
OMGGGGGGG!!! SO HAPPY!!🤩🤩 FAIL! What's the full name...? 'Interpretation & Translation communication at International Conferences...' (Yeah, she can NEVER get that LOL) (Hehe) Give us the tea~ (Yubin loves herbal tea so it's a gift for her)
So this is technically a 'punishment'? - It's rea~lly bitter
- Oh is that it...? (Yerihan Bang's Herbal Tea Mascot)
(An intern PD from Chicago enters✨) (Today's 'victim': Yubin) It's a traditional tea and it's good for you and... (Our intern PD is malfunctioning before Yubin) LOOOOOOL (Currently loading to remember what she has to say LOL) (Yubin seriously makes people feel intimidated at first sight!)
Wow, as expected from our charismatic unnie!!👍👍 (Rebooting) (Thanks to our intern PD who made us all laugh💗) Thank you~ Thank you very much~ - (Sniff sniff)
- How is it? It's nasty, isn't it? What is this...? This is not the herbal tea I thought...😶 (As long as I don't drink it, it's all good! Ddu Ddu's excited again)
Isn't it super dark? Look at that frightful color! (Poured the Yeri's Herbal Tea due to inertia)
You can only have a sip! Deer antlers + Ginger + Foxglove inside... Never even heard of anything like this...😬 There's nothing sweet inside, eh? (The bitter medicine is good for your body💗)
There are expensive medicinal herbs inside~ Ooh, it's better than I thought...!☺ (Did I mishear that?) (Slurp! Enjoying her teatime)
It's not that bitter!😶 You can stop drinking! (Yeri's Herbal Tea) (Yubin loves its taste, temperature, and fragrance!)
It's good...😋 I've had dad's antlers + carp juices ever since I was young! (Got an idea to avoid this tea in the future✨)
I should only invite people like her! Can I take some of this home? LOOOOOL I think it's expensive! Hehe (A true 'stan' of Wonder Girls - DJ Rim)
I've always loved Wonder Girls! 🎵Must be in front of your house~🎵 (Needs just 3 seconds to get the title✨) (Wonder X Velvet - Collab dance~✨)
