Vieau drop before no I'm gonna open it up and show you something I've never seen before my wife what what what is in here this is not supposed to be inside a computer this is beans inside women Hazara go out for me on Craigslist I use it a lot holy I never had an issue none of this these black things all these this is like food it's not like to help the computer stay cool someone told you something with a bunch of beans in it these are black beans this is what you get a Mexican restaurant and that's not good to defer the computer I know I have never in my life seen anything like this before I am shocked the wall that should be here is the circuit board a couple of little pieces of electronics this is the power supply unit Oh what's under this that's the motherboard and actually these are the motherboards no no all of this stuff that you're seeing this pile of these are the motherboards no this is food this is beans someone put beans inside the computer this should all should be in here I'm gonna show you a picture of a normal computer No so I have to get one without the beans yeah we'll be able to work today no I'll be able to get it to work out this is food this is like someone took their dinner and throw it inside the car but I don't see the motherboards in there like it here it's flat you see the wire going into it but where all the motherboard like there are a lot of motherboards here but I don't see any of the motherboards in here yeah well those are not motherboards that's food oh you need to turn this and shake all of this Brown got here it's not supposed to be in there no no but you see it's all electronics and this is food right okay you bought this on Craigslist yeah a couple years ago I'm surprised that it's been working as long as it has you know what I hate to say it to you you need a new computer I would how much does that will be oh you can get cheap ones I'm at a loss for words because I've never seen anything like this before okay you said you've ordered a couple years ago mm-hmm I can't believe it's still working well it's not working anymore but it was fine for years now yeah I guess on it I'm surprised actually works too much stuff is inside it so much food is inside it is buying a new computer an issue right now I just don't want this happen again I mean how do I find out that the chances of this happening again is probably zero I have never in my life seen anything like this I cannot even fathom why somebody would have done this and sold to a computer like this I'll figure enough thanks for helping me with all right yeah well I love you for nothing I was nearby anyway all right all right when we told him it was a joke he didn't like it anymore and so that's why we'd learned his face little time figured I'd tell you because some people are confused as to why people's faces are blurred sometimes and not and he didn't want to be used in the video so we blurred his face
