I'm back to the topic of military psychology in this video which has been sponsored by audible but more of that later now you may think that if you give a man a better weapon he becomes a more effective soldier I mean it makes common sense doesn't it so which would you say was a more effective weapon for instance is it the 18th century musket or the modern assault rifle now what would the salesman of a modern assault rifle tell you he'll say wise clearly than what you want is the modern assault rifle because if for instance there are some enemies great very close by you can give him a burst verb and you've still got some rounds in the magazine so he gets a burst ooh and he gets a burst yes it's short it's easy the point it's convenient it's code can go full auto and you've got plenty of rounds in the magazine yes it's a close proximity it's definitely the thing whereas if you're stuck with a musket it's a long heavy awkward thing more difficult to point and you've got one shot and okay granted it's a devastating shot at musket ball as a really shocking huge piece of lead tremendous stopping power but boom if you miss him you won't have time to reload before he'll be on you and even if you hit him if he's got two friends with swords they're very likely to take their vengeance upon you and and they will cut you and cut you and cut you and cut yeah he'd make his point about the proximity and it's a longer range you could imagine that well you'd say well this thing is accurate up to 400 yards and you've got a magazine with plenty of rounds in it you can select single fire you can it's got almost negligible recoil unlike the mule like kick that that musket has and it doesn't wear out loads of smoke obscuring the target in front of you oh yes it's it's more accurate faster firing you carry more rounds it's just better in every way it's the assault rifle and I didn't ask which weapon would you choose if you had to go into battle because I think I would choose the assault rifle but it's interesting that if you actually see how effective these things were in battles of the past the musket is more effective it kills more of the enemy per round fired and not just a little bit now in this entirety of this video I'm going to be using some rather speculative conjectural let us say not entirely sound statistics but it is something in the region of 20 times more effective than a modern assault rifle well how could that be well there was this strange rule that the better the weapon you give an infantryman the lower his kill rate is his effectiveness appears to go down and down and down so in in the Korean War and the Vietnam War and in the Falklands they all had considerably lower kill rates than back in the musket days what why is that well you can imagine there's a chap advancing in his unit with his musket and some enemy are seen there about six hundred yards away and so they carry on walking towards the enemy and perhaps the sergeant says yeah that's them keep going lads won't be long now and if you're thinking of running away at this point well you don't because you're shoulder-to-shoulder with lots of other people who are going forwards and going forwards as a military the useful thing to do usually if your orders are good and you don't want to be the one who turned tail and everyone will see if you turn tail and you you're quite close to the your officers will see you and and so what everyone else is going forward and no one else seems to be worried too much about so you carry on going forwards and the distance gets closer and closer and closer and you might not actually engage the enemy but before hits fifty yards away and then of course you can the fire a tremendous huge volley at him and that will be very effective and lots of people will be killed because what is the target it's a big target of a lot of people standing upright wearing bright smart uniforms sometimes we've been crossing belts on them just to make it extra easy to aim straight at the centre of the chest and that's the situation now you wouldn't carry many musket balls maybe as few as and one sometimes you hear off as few as 12 but I think more like thirty to sixty is a bit more what bit more typical whereas the chap with the assault rifle marching along on his own at least in a dispersed group thinking you can see some of his colleagues over there and some over there might be some distance from his officer and he sees someone at 600 yards and thinks oh I the huh now he's got a weapon that okay it's not brilliantly effective at 600 yards but he's got plenty of rounds so why not give it a try bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang where is he do I get him oh no he's gone to ground it was over there okay so you fired off a load of rounds now you probably haven't hit anything you've alerted the enemy to your presence and give him a pretty good idea of your intent and now you've given yourself a problem because you can't see him anymore he's if he is a genuine enemy he's probably now coordinating with some of his friends to to attack you hmm maybe you could call in their helicopter now some artillery to support you but then you're not actually doing your job you're getting someone else to do it for you and if anyone does actually shoot to kill that enemy it'll be by some ordnance other than your rifle so in fact you are less effective as soon as you find yourself trying to shoot a camouflaged man hundreds of yards away hiding behind that rock you think you're very unlikely to hit anyone and you're also quite likely to expend an awful lot of ammunition one doesn't hear very often of Musketeers running out of ammunition but this is something that modern troops with fast firing weapons have to really watch out for so the kill rate goes down now how do you work out a killer 8 well one thing you can do is you can look at the amount of ammunition issued to the troops on campaign and then divide that by the number of troops that they killed on that campaign and there you go you get the kill rate and if you do this for the this for the musketeer rate you get figures or between about five hundred and three thousand that seems quite a lot so that'll be a sticker middling figure say two thousand musket balls fired for every one of the enemy killed but of course that figure can be somewhat misleading because maybe they actually lost an awful lot of their ammunition when though one of their ammunition supply dumps blew up that happened you knew you know or maybe a load of their ammunition got captured and of course some of the people who died died absolutely riddled with musket balls and you know a man with 8 musket balls and he was just one man dead so the statistics gets skewed somewhat but you nonetheless make look at the figures and come up with some reasonable dose likely agreement I agree conjectural estimates now in Vietnam it was more like 3,000 up to perhaps 50,000 rounds and in modern Afghanistan the US Army has been getting through about a quarter of a million bullets for every one of the enemy that they actually shoot but again that's a very misleading figure because over half those bullets are used in training not in battle and they also get rid of a lot of rounds which they think might be faulty and they give rounds as well to their allies so the number of ones that are actually fighting anger towards the enemy is much more difficult to estimate but we can think quite definitely it's a lot it's definitely thousands now the best that is the highest verified kill rate and and verified passes and well you'll see is 20,000 rounds for every man killed and that was in a particular action where the enemy had almost no cover and even then most of the killing was done by artillery and helicopter support 20 thousand rounds per per man shot and that's of course as as I've just explained is a misleading figure even then so most of those rounds don't do anything the modern doctrine of course is a suppressive fire but a man with a weapon capable of keeping the enemy at a distance men psychologically prefer to engage the enemy at a distance if they can up clos is quite nasty well quite happily just fire alone though the rounds to very little effect if someone's gone to ground you can't see him anymore he may have moved sideways and you're just firing at some rocks to no purpose so if you do force the enemy to to go to ground you now if you don't have support weapons to to take them out you have to get in there yourself you have to get up close and how are you gonna do that particularly on your own if you can of course coordinate with the team that's much better but each man would much rather be the guy doing this pressing than the going in so who tends to go in well officers and commanders NCOs and more senior types tend to go in the men who actually do the the up close work they tend to be bigger more intelligent and more charismatic but these are just correlations there are of course plenty of exceptions now with these huge numbers of rounds being fired in modern warfare this can be explained to some degree by our tactics known as for instance these spray-and-pray or there's the hose and pose so what is what is spray-and-pray well you come up the to a corner and you have reason to believe that there's an enemy over there somewhere probably so you go that was the spray and then the prey bit is that you hope that that hits something of military value which you almost certainly didn't but you have fired your weapon in the general direction of the enemy so you have contributed you've done your bit you are fighting unlike that lots of the other guys so we're just dithering about the place so that's the spray-and-pray and of course it uses up lots of ammunition and very very seldom hits anything then there's the hosen post hosen pose is when you pop up and because it's your turn a few other people perhaps earlier in the day I've done this and you feel you better do something similar just to you know show willing your pop up and perhaps with a machine gun with a belt or whatever it depends what weapon you've got let's imagine you got a machine gun with them with a big belt you fire off the hole right and then you lick it and you go back to your pals who all slap you on the back because yeah you show them you did your bit yeah you made absolutely sure hence the pose bit that you were being watched because then you everyone will know that you've done your bit and you'll get that warm glow the satisfaction there's Pat's on the back and then everyone will forgive you if you don't perhaps pop up for a bit because it's somebody else's turn to do that now again the hosen pose is of very little military value you spray an awful lot of bullets about the place and you're very unlikely to hit anything this is these are not tactics that well trained and disciplined soldiers should be using but it seems that soldiers of all kinds will occasionally resort to that sort of thing so muskets were something like 20 times more deadly but they were fighting as I say under different circumstances and while men would be shoulder to shoulder and and why would that be well lots of reasons one being command you need to be able to fire big volleys in the coordinated way and you'd get two bloc's of men to march around the field together and you know this is that you can shout is very short particularly when there's a musketry battle going on so you need guys close in so that it's possible to control them all and then if the cavalry turns up you need a dense formation of men to resist the cavalry and if a load of the enemy charges at you with bayonets then you need a dense mass of men to resist the bayonet charge so yes you need to have dense masses of men and because muskets worth of that effective weren't that accurate perhaps I should say you could they could actually get away with presenting such a vulnerable target at which they would very seldom present for any great length of time because they would either charge in or run away so they got away with it now one of the effects however of firing in this way is that usually normally fired blind I say normally there's no there's no figure no one can tell you exactly how often they fired blind but it was very common to shut your eyes or even shut your eyes and turn you head away a bit when you fired your musket now you've got a big bit of jagged Flint that's those chipping sparks off a bit of steel in front of you and of course the edges of the Flint bullet will sometimes shatter and so you got bits of Flint flying about and then you've got Sparks and a big flash in the pan and that's happening right in front of your eye if you if you're holding the rifle like that the musket I should say and so you might therefore blink and it's also quite instinctive to do that away from a big flash but don't it's not just your musket because there's a guy here and he's got a big flash and a lot of the stuff will be going sideways from that so any of any little protection that you've got protecting your eye from the flash here isn't going to help you with the flash coming off his and his and his and his so you've got this absolutely vision dimming Lee loud volley that's about to go off oh here it comes see quite often fire blind because you've turned your head and or shut your eyes another reason you might fire blind is that muskets throughout so much smoke both your outgoing and the enemies coming the other way they're very often you couldn't really see where the enemy was you just think just fire into the smoke somewhere one unfortunate consequence of this style of firing was that some men during this as I say just you nothing can prepare for how loud a volley of muskets is if you ever see a reenactment you'll be you'll perhaps be surprised by just how loud it is but just do understand this those re-enactors are not anything like as loud they're using using a modern gunpowder which is not as loud as old-fashioned black powder they're using about half the charge and they're not ramming in a big ball of lead so they don't have that southern pop as the ball of lead comes out so they're so those reenactors and not anything like as loud so boom a lot of men would go and you see that i tilted downwards there it was founded in the polio like wars that a lot of men in the front rank that were kneeling got shot in the back of the head by men in the third rank which is pretty grisly thought isn't it anyway I seem to have strayed from my point slightly yes so I'm gonna be talking about something called weapon pull personally I don't think it should be called weapon but I think it's a very good name for it but anyway there are tactical psychologists who decided to call this thing weapon pull and it is descriptive of the the increase in the likelihood that a man has to fight if he's got a particularly good weapon so and you've got say a slightly better rifle and because it got a slightly better rifle you're more likely to use it and the bigger the weapon and the more effective and and the the sexier the weapon if you like I mean maybe it looks futuristic maybe makes a really cool sound maybe comes with a huge amount of ammunition seek and fire it a lot there's something about this weapon which is perhaps better than your previous weapon or better than the weapon of the guys around you or better than the weapon that the enemy is using against you and so all these things that combine in weapon pull to make you more likely to fight so clearly this is a good thing give the men better weapons and they'll fight war it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that now one example that I read about was a machine gun that was called shell T what it wasn't called exactly shouting because that's a translation from the German but it was called shell T in translation this was a German mg42 on a tripod being used by a crew in Italy in the Second World War and they were not any ordinary crew oh no these were the three grenadiers zhh oh yes and they star themselves on the three musketeers oh yes lots of mustache twirling and haha like this they they were slightly out language outlandish kit and they effected outlandish speech and traditions and they became a team with with a LAN thing is though that Sheltie the gun wasn't actually the original shouting after a while because they replaced the barrel and they replace the stock and then there was that time when they lost the tripod remember oh and other bits got to got wrecked when that mortar bomb went off and so after a while it was a completely different machine gun but it was still shell T and similarly the the three grenadiers of whom there were of course five crewing this gun their personnel roster kept changing as well because men got promoted or wounded or killed or went on leave or Centron extra training or whatever and they other men were brought in to make up numbers and yet each man brought in especially probably did it one at a time adopted the the the customs of of Shelties crew and the three grenadiers zand they started wearing the kit and using the words and haha so they this this unit had elan and when it was came to came to a fight they they shot and they shot a lot with shouty now an mg42 is a weapon with which has got a lot of pull it's it loud it fires lots of rounds it's it's an impressive thing so you can imagine that that's one reason that it fired a lot during fights but there are other reasons to crew-served weapons in general fire a lot more than just an isolated rifleman an isolated rifleman is likely to be somewhere where perhaps none of the commanders none of the NCOs or officers can see him so if he just you know sits down in his in his slit trench for a bit and has an urgent cigarette then you know who's going to who's going to stop him and who's going to know so that's one reason that the the the big weapons that attract the attention of officers tend to fire more there's somebody watching quick everyone look busy also in the crew of five all five men are encouraging each other this team has to work as a team for the gun to operate so if the guy whose job is to feed the bullets into the side of it is just sitting there not doing his job but everyone else is doing here's then people gonna notice immediately aye-aye our lives depend on this do your job oh yeah right but of course he knows that he would be noticed so he fears in the ammunition all the men encourage each other now they also have a bigger weapon and that seems to correlate with with using them more readily they also tend to have machine guns of this sort the sustained fire with a tripod they tend to have big reserves of ammunition as well and the more ammunition you're given the more you tend to fire also machine gunners tend to be bigger stronger guys and bigger stronger guys tend to fight more they also tend to be more intelligent than the the grunts who just given a rifle and again bigger more intelligent people tend to fight more again it's a correlation I'm not saying that all big fight people are big intelligent people make good fighters because that's not true another reason is that you can't hide now imagine that there's a platoon that spread out over some area and it's supported by a Sheltie and one of the riflemen is about 40 yards that way stops firing is anyone gonna notice in the middle of a battle but if shouty stops firing everybody is going to notice immediately so just as the guy feeding in that the rounds he can't hide within his crew shouting cannot hide within the unit so quick everyone let's do our job let's fire a lot they didn't have quite a long range as well and as I said before men prefer engaging the enemy at a distance so that again is another way of encouraging people to use a weapon there is another reason that shouty might have fired more than one of the riflemen that it was supporting and that is to do with the natural aversion to killing that humans have if you've if you're an isolated rifleman you see an enemy you take aim at him you take the decision to shoot you shoot and you see that you've killed that enemy you did that no one else whereas if you're the man feeding that the the the rounds into the machine well you didn't kill anyone you were just doing your job feeding the round oh I just fed rounds they feel just the guy fetching the ammunition bringing stuff up if you're the guy looking through binoculars and calling out ranges oh no I didn't kill anyone no I was my job just to call that ranges I never pulled the trigger or anything and even the guy who pulls the trigger well I was one of a team I was just firing at the targets that were will call out to me I was just doing my job we all we all we all were responsible so it's as though with a five-man team the personal guilt the feeling of responsibility for the deaths of those that that the weapon kills gets diluted amongst the team so the men are psychologically more prepared to do their job even though they know that it's contributing ultimately to someone's death somewhere possibly so Sheltie shouted a lot so if you've got a big effective weapon and all the circumstances are just described you're more likely to shoot more likely to yeah to use your weapon fire it fired in the direction of the enemy now if you the this goes across the board um for instance they have a exam observed in firing ranges so this is not in the military context this isn't a firing range people have gone there you know just to have fun because they like shooting at paper targets the people who turn up with more guns and more ammunition and bigger guns they fire more now you could say well that's because they're probably greater gun enthusiasts but it seems to be a bit more than that you give people big guns and lots of guns and they they fire them more they they get caught up in it and if you give a policeman a weapon say he's got a truncheon about it not whatever there's a chance he might use that baton if you give him a baton and pepper spray he's more likely to use the baton than he previously was he's also more likely to use pepper spray of course he didn't have pepper spray before but you see what I mean with each weapon you give him he's more likely to use one of the weapons if you give him a Taser he's more likely to use one of his weapons if you give him a gun a pistol as well he's more likely to use any of these and tasers tasers get used a lot by police when they was first thought shall we give policeman Tasers there was just thought well a lot of people are getting shot because the the policeman has to shoot because he can't be sure but there are circumstances maybe when you would use a gun but if you had a Taser you would taser them instead okay so the number of killings should go down right because all of those occasions when someone had to shoot someone because he didn't have a Taser will be replaced by people getting tasered instead but that hasn't happened the number of people shot with the pistols has not gone down and my goodness so many people are now getting tasered quite often one one gathers unnecessarily so the more weapons you give a policeman the more likely he is to use one of those weapons whichever one it is and and and big guns tend to end up going into battle more who might think for instance the Bren gun the Bren gun was the section support weapon but quite often the Bren gunner or the var Browning autumn air rifle gunner in an American section American sections are usually called squads they would be you're a big strong guy and then quite often very aggressively youth Bren Gunners went in when when there was a house that needed clearing a load of guys went in there with their bayonets and grenades to clear it out caught the Bren gunner would go in there and I've got a Bren gun that they would go in there and it seems that part of the reason they were happy to get stuck in they had a Bren gun which was which was more comfy than the rifles around them or possibly more than the what was coming the other way as well and looking at it from the other side if you've got a weapon that's lesser if you've got some small light cheap feeling thing that's got a reputation may not be deserved but a reputation for being unreliable well you've got an automatic built an excuse haven't you to not use the thing you're not gonna fight because why should I have got this critic everyone else has got a better weapon I'll just leave it to them besides I'll gonna under watch these stairs just just in case something someone comes down those stairs meanwhile I'll let everyone else do the actual fighting you've got a built-in excuse it saps your morale to have a less good weapon than everybody else now in Afghanistan it seems that when 5.56 millimeter caliber the NATO rounds the things that SATs and the like shooting when those are fired at Taliban quite often the Taliban near enough ignore them whereas if 7.62 is fired at them they get a lot more wary and if someone opens up with a 50 Cal firing half-inch thick lumps of leather at them they run away so the the the power the caliber of the weapon makes a significant distance a difference and in places like Afghanistan people issue with a 5.56 quite often sort ish ously and just swap it for a 7.62 because 7.62 s are so much more powerful more accurate longer range they're better stopping power and just sexier weapons and I got I got a 7.62 I'm just using a 5.56 pop gun are you well I've got this beast and again people have looked at what happens to patrols men with 7.62 s are 20% more likely to fight to actually shoot their weapons at the enemy on the patrol but there is a converse to this now you may think that well if they are 20% more likely to to fight they got this boost because they've got this bigger weapon then you could say well the 5.56 are 20% less likely but no it's not quite like that what happens is that the people who were [ __ ] were this likely to - up and do it they and there were this likely - to fight if you give them a 7.62 they then become this likely to fight whereas the ones not given don't stay where they are they become less likely to fight so if in the modern section for example they tend to have very mixed weapons a modern section doesn't just have a brand and short magazine lee-enfield they might have bunker-busting rockets and they might have grenade launchers and it loads and loads of different weapon systems pistols and all sorts and so there's a huge spread of weapons in a modern section today and though if some of them are given a better weapon the others fight less so overall has your as your section as your platoon has your unit has it become more effective or has it made no difference it's really difficult to disentangle or all these different factors that affect each other and feed into each other and it is said that by giving someone a very strong weapon pool you can boost the effectiveness effectiveness of soldiers by 50% whatever that means all the bull for sponsoring this video now I've been talking about weapon pull now I should talk about the opposite which is weapon push although I really don't see that the pull or the push turn in either of these terms I makes intuitive sense to me but I think the idea that is that you you push the enemy's fighting spirit back somehow with weapon push anyway weapon push is the decrease in a man's likelihood to fight given that someone else has a more powerful weapon particularly the enemy shooting at him and of course a weapon push can be colossal bingo callers in the 8th army and world war ii would sometimes rather than saying to fat ladies 88 would say driver reverse 88 why drive a reverse well this is a tankers joke because the 88 millimeter flak gun had a fearsome reputation in the desert which was not the entirely deserved but the thing is that the weapon can do a lot of it's can be effective by having an amazing reputation the tiger tank for instance had a reputation that was wildly greater than the actual capability of the vehicle itself and it worked both ways the Allies were enormously more frightened of tigers than perhaps was rational and the Germans had enormously more confidence in Tigers than perhaps was entirely rational considering especially how often they flippin broke down but that's another story for another day anyway the there are weapons like the mg42 that I was talking about earlier member shell T that has a completely unnecessarily high rate of fire and uses up wood and someone has to carry those bullet to know and lead is heavy but the thing is that this unnecessary amount of lead flying through the air has great weapon push other people being shot at are much less likely to shoot back because of this this just this overkill even when almost all those bullets don't hit anything it has weapon push okay and there was no a training film in World War 2 for training British infantry and it had footage of mg 34s and 42s firing away spandau s-- and a lot of the people who had been in action against the germans who are watching this film would would cheer and laugh and slow hand clap and be somewhat critical because it would show footage of those those machine guns firing but instead of the bur bur bur noise they dubbed on the noise of a Bren gun firing and all the people who'd ever heard of Spandau firing went yeah that is not what it sounds like but they didn't want to scare the people that they were training up their recruits but by playing them the actual sound that this terrifying machine gun made and so they were aware it seems the editors of that film of the the power of weapon push now if you fire something really really big it has a much greater effect as I was saying earlier earlier on Taliban will tend to run away if you fired something really big at them but what about for any big things like a quad a quad 50 Cal which the Americans had during World War 2 that was terrifying to be fired and he made a terrifying noise and he wouldn't he would just crash through D it would cut through phone agent and smash limbs off of trees in a most disconcerting way so if the enemy's firing one of those at you you get out of the way pretty quickly and the Russians had heavy machine guns the Germans had a two centimeter cannon again that had the same sort of the same sort of push effect if they're firing that at us the women of a fire back at all so you end up an awful lot of men carrying behind cover and dithering and repacking their rucksacks over and over again because sometimes in the middle of a fight that turns out to be of strange importance men get fixated on some tasks they'd rather be doing than firing back at that thing because did you hear that sound it made okay so that's that's weapon push and just as those British infantryman will lie - so American tank crews it seems worth in the dark about the inadequacies of the Sherman they'd been told and the American public had been told that the Sherman was the best designed tank in the world and there's an interesting stat now the the start after the Normandy landings when these these raw tank crews were going into action against the Germans for every Sherman knocked out they would be typically for casualties amongst the crew that was in the first week by the 15th week it was down to just one just one casualty per knockout so how can we account for this well the crews are better trained they're more experienced yes they've put more armor on the Sherman's yes they've tinkered with various other things about the Sherman to make it a little bit better yeah but well this isn't known but tactical psychologists looking at it and trying to explain this enormous drop in the casualties per knockout have concluded I think not unreasonably that it may be that when the crew of the Sherman realizes that it's over match they come up against the Panther or a tiger or something or they think they come against the Panther or a tiger and rather than carry on fighting in the tank they abandon the tank and then the tank gets hit when it's empty and that's why the number of men who became casualties per knockout went down so markedly now in in the Far East the Japanese had a bit of a bunker mentality in defense and sometimes they were incredibly difficult to shift but then you bring up the flamethrower tank now I've talked about flamethrower tanks in another video and I just point the wrong way I usually point the wrong way so either that corner or that corner think a link as I hope just appeared to that that video in which I talked about how extremely effective the crocodile flamethrower that the British had was well flamethrower tanks were used in the Far East against bunkers with Japanese very stubborn Japanese these Japanese were just not surrender his wooden surrender they tried everything to get the surrender but they would just sit in these bunkers and because they were it seems just fanatics who would rather die and Eve a horrible death like being being burned in the bunker with a flamethrower rather than come out and surrender one problem Americans had in getting them to surrender was that there was no Japanese word for surrender but they would no less give it a go and they would get the loudspeaker out and someone who spoke a little bit of Japanese would would yell at them now listen your stinking Japs get a bunker or I'm damn well gonna burn you out nothing so they burned them out now later on in fact very near the end of the war they learned that it was actually possible to get these Japanese to surrender but you have to use the right language and I think it's it's worth whereas it there it's worth reading you an excerpt for this book wargames which is the book that I got a lot of the material that I'm talking to you now about tactical psychology book this was sent to me by a viewer which is great Thank You viewer who it later turned out was actually contributed to the book so there was a little bit of self interest there but we've been corresponding back and forth and it's been there it's been a fascinating thing anyway I just thought I'd entertain you with the speech that they came up with which actually worked for getting Japanese to surrender you'll notice that it's somewhat different in tone attention honorable Japanese soldiers I am the authorized American commander for this area and I have been ordered to make it secure attention I have flamethrowers I will use flamethrowers to carry out my lawful orders I regret the unfortunate consequences resultant on the use of flamethrowers Japanese soldiers I order you to come out and assemble properly at designated landmark and that it seems did actually work and so you have to learn the enemy's psychology and make the appeal that the the works with that particular enemy it's a great shame that they learnt that I nearly said trick their technique I should say cause it's not a trick they weren't they weren't trying to fool the enemy to the enemy's disadvantage is quite definitely to the enemy's advantage to surrender given alternative was being burned alive or burned to death in a bunker anyway and how do I get onto that oh yes so there is weapon push now through the ages weapon push has been taken many forms and it's not necessarily the weapon is it any any bit of kit could do the job so for example you might have really shiny breast plates on your armor and the enemy will think oh wow those guys look as though they've got really good arm a really expensive well looked-after armor they they must be man to be reckoned with our arm is looking a bit rubbish really not anything shiny maybe we shouldn't be taking them on and war cries and loud drums and so forth have a similar weapon push pushing effect on dampening the enemies likelihood to fight and of course coming up permit to more recent times they were deliberately loud exhausts for instance on some World War 1 plane specially those used in ground attacks over in across the battlefield and would send men scurrying for cover would farm more than actually the actual threat of the aircraft genuinely represented but when something really that goes over the top of your head you throw yourself into cover don't you and there's the Stuka the Ju 87 nerd where we go I had this prepared the modelling I think I made this when I was 9 or 10 anyway these things by the way did you know that um technically you shouldn't really call these a stay it's a Lukas aged 87 or Junkers Ju 87 calling in a Stuka which people did because it was the dive bomber that the Germans used doesn't actually technically distinguish it because the German authorities who were buying aircraft for the Luftwaffe stipulated that all German war craft should be an aircraft should be allowed should be capable piggy pod of die forming even the Hankel bomber ones the the biggest bombers that the Germans had were technically capable of die forming though i've never heard of the there ever being used that way so calling simply a Stuka doesn't anyway see one of these and they had this permanent undercarriage this thick hair it doesn't fold up you see it's permanent down and so the wall since it's there why not strap a siren to it so that when you switch the sirens on the air intake will as the little propellers in the sirens around and it makes [Music] noise that you've probably heard dubbed on to completely inappropriate aircraft in the movies almost anything going to I've even heard it put on on helicopters so any aircraft that starts going towards the ground or speeding up make something yet stupid noise no didn't the British actually copied it to some degree by adding whistles to their bombs so that in a later war when that when the RAF dropped a bomb it went so again that's another gets added to any dropping bomb thing in the movies but that's actually late war RAF bombs anyway oh yes I said no so that's to do with weapon push and you can imagine if you are carrying in some trench and you sticker is above you with Ju 87 and you hear that absolutely terrifying noise even if the bomb when it finally drops misses you by miles it's very likely to keep you in that trench and for quite a lot longer than you otherwise would have stayed there so weapon push is a very powerful psychological tool that that militaries can make great use of and about 30 percent fewer men will fight if the enemy is perceived to have a more powerful weapon a better weapon sexy weapon noisier weapon whatever it is a better weapon I suppose it's the perception you might be the noise that causes the perception so that's a very rough figure to be taken with a huge pinch of salt but something in the region off now I've been talking about that just [ __ ] war games and I did I really liked it but I do have criticisms of it one being that he keeps talking about this term effectiveness and you say that this adds 30% to a soldier's effectiveness and this 50% of this up to 90% and so forth without ever really defining effectiveness what what is effectiveness and to what baseline is this number applied so if you have two soldiers who are notionally standard average soldiers and you put them in a fight then each is 50% likely to in presumably so the notional soldiers quality is of 50% so if you give him a 50% boost is he now 100% solder you're now guaranteed to win the fight or is it 50% of the 50% that we started with in which case he's now a seventy-five percent effective likely to win time soldier well I don't know quite how these figures stack up and it seems that tactical psychologists don't quite know how all these things stack up as well but you have to make common-sense decisions if there are certain things that only apply in circumstances well then they don't count you take those away now there is a big problem for tactical psychology and that is although to be fair he absolutely admits to this and this is no criticism of the book is that getting good data is really difficult there are some things that people will happily talk about other things they really won't and if ever there is a mess-up people tend to close ranks and and protect those who made the mistake in the military so there is a definite bias towards studying victories rather than defeats and quite often it's heroic extraordinary victories against the odds the guest that studied and very easy victories that turkey shoots and so forth perhaps gets a get ignored not and form enough of the data and fear is a good example of something which people will actually happily talk about so people who have been in war and people who are even in warnout currently serving soldiers will quite happily talk about how terrifying battle is and how scared they get and why is that well it has to be scary for them to appear brave if they say actually it was not scary at all I wasn't scared then what they're doing is not terribly impressive is it whereas being scared and yet overcoming that terror and achieving something regardless that's manly that's impressive so people are usually quite happy to talk about fear and anyone tells you that they're weren't scared they're like they're happy to say that but there are other subjects like aversion to killing and guilt and disobeying orders and so forth of manag very considerably less likely to talk freely and accurately about so it's difficult to get data of the psychology in that sense it's also very difficult to get the right facts and figures because they're not the sort of things that get written down in the history books particularly of older Wars and now another criticism I have in the context of pushing pull apart the fact that don't like the terms push and pull maybe when relative weapon effectiveness or something other subjects some other term might be better is that actually I think it's wrong to think of them as two separate things I think really they are one thing weapon push a weapon pull are a single factor because if you remember I said that if you give some men 7.62 s they shoot more but the other guys shoot less and so the pull and the push effect are actually all part of the same phenomenon if you've got two battalions who've been fighting alongside each other very successfully for a long time going from victory to victory and they're they're very happy working with each other and you get a load of the new rifle that just arrived they they're they wore they're sexy and they're really good and they make a really good noise or whatever I don't know they're somehow better but you've only got enough to supply one battalion what do you do if you give it to this battalion what they may think hey we've got the new rifles oh sweet okay and they may go into action more readily but their neighbors who are supposed to be supporting them on the left flank then you think well why should we take us there they're going ahead and they seem to be doing fine so what and they we've obviously we're not good enough to get the new rifles and they don't they they fight less and truly two units working well together is something worth preserving rather than one doing a bit better but of expense of coordinating with its fellows and all right so maybe you shouldn't do that maybe you should give half the men of each battalion the new weapon oh great so now you've created tremendous logistics problem you've now got to supply not just the whole unit with one type of ammunition and this whole unit with another but now you've got to get the right ammunition to every individual man depending on what he's been issued correct you just created all the problems there and of course now you got to train both battalions the use of the new weapon so you created the training problem as well and within that battalion all the guys who have not been issued lead the new sexy fast firing loud and cool futuristic weapon they they feel wow I'm not anything he's got the new weapon you can go ahead and use it you've given all of them an excuse not to fight not to pull their weight so they were happy in before they were comrades all fighting together and now you've actually perhaps degraded the fighting effectiveness of these units by giving them better weapons so there is there is this push and pull I talked about in that video on the crocodile flamethrowers how incredibly effective they were on the enemy morass they had tremendous weapon push if you like but they also had some weapon pull effects in that the escorting infantry were meant to be going it forwards with those crocodiles were also a bit scared of the flames and thought while the flames seemed to work really well do I really have to be exposing myself here walking across a field Connor just let the tank do all the work so they were actually more reluctant to fight because of the weapon push of the of the weapon that was on their own side so I don't think there's any separating these these two effects you have to you have to meld the two together and as for a new section that the modern sections where we have a tremendous spread of weapons if you're looking at the the effectiveness officers just say one section of ten men or thirty men in the platoon that sort of size because they're carrying so many different weapons if you make one alteration trying to work out the complicated effects of that are just horrendous and it seems at the moment tactical psychology is not up to the task but that doesn't mean that it's not worth trying to find an answer just because a problem might seem insoluble doesn't mean that the that the journey the inquiry isn't worth it people should be looking into this and trying to work out what are the effects of changing or giving people better weapons or less good weapons or more uniform weapons and you know an interesting task but it's an interesting task anyway I hope you found this talk reasonably interesting [Music] the man you
