is amazing! (A fight you can't see?) Shall we go right ahead? When I say 'Solar', you have to
say 'mind' together. Ah~ So tacky~ Kind of like this, Solar~mind!
(Created choreography) (Embarrassed) (Quite likes it) They're asking how they can ever do that (Do it for me~) Solar~mind! Give me the first word! [Yongwangnims, also try to guess it ^'^]
Look at me. Isn't this too easy? 'It's too easy, right?' Quite easy, right? [Artist Yong Bob] I am going to draw easily like this~ Moonbyul! Puppy! [Already???] - Oh my god~

[Answer: Puppy] Hold on. Colleague 1, 1 point. - (Ceremony) Moonbyulyida~
- Shut up. [Next problem] I will draw happily~ Moonbyul! 'Koala' [She got it right again? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ] (Why is that a koala?) I must draw pretty well~ Solar? Mind! (They're really in sync at times like this ㅋㅋㅋㅋ) I like that~ Give me the next word! [Humpback whale (hok-deung whale)] 
[Quite hard] (Unhindered) [Oh~ For now, it's like a whale] It's quite easy, right? If I want to add some more art to it.. Hello? (Calm) Excuse me!!! Okay.
Can you pull my car out? Excuse me! It's quite easy, right? - I twisted it a bit.
- Why? I did it a bit.
(Where and how did she twist it..) (Ocean added) JooJoo! Whale? If it was a whale, she would've
drawn water like this. I'm sorry.. Is it hard? We have to guess the fish's name, right? So, this... Hint! I'm giving you a big one! That's what I said, dolphin! - Moonbyul!!
- JooJoo! (Byulie first) Dolphin! Wrong!!!

(t/n:They kept saying 'heuk' instead of 'hok') This is so... (Storm of complaints) Do you not know what 
a humpback whale is? - Not well Are you friends with a whale? I'm best friends with a whale~ Isn't that a halibut? I told you it's halibut.
[Halibut seems right..?] No, this is the ocean.
It's spewing out water. It's black here and white here. - But, why is the tail like that?
- There wasn't space for it! (Accepting a spot for whales..) Since you didn't get it right earlier,
I'll give 2 points [for the next problem]. Please guess it well~ (Colleague 1) We want to guess it well.. [*Yongwangnims, try guessing it, too] Moonbyul. Hamster. LangLang! Fox!

- JooJoo! Zoo?! (Excited because she got it right) The giraffe there. I thought it was a leg.
(This is a giraffe) It's quite easy, right? [Next problem]

I get more confused with your talking. Shut up! This one is very easy~ JooJoo! Kiyoung?

[Back to the problem..] What was it again?
(Forgot from playing) [Word: Pilates] (Knows the word) The legs are like.. (What position..?) If you draw it like this, it's quite easy, right? Look at its facial expression right now. This facial expression. You see it, right?

Guys, hold on- Hold on! Time! Everyone, you had fun, right?
[Solar's artworks that are in pretty frames....] It was a fun time, right? Like this.. Lots of our judges came a far way. They complimented my drawing skills quite a lot. So I'm really thankful. I plan on continuing to create lots of
works of art with my hands. So please don't be sad. 'Poop hands'! (/unskilled hands) Scream~ (I'm poop hands) Thank you for watching to the end. I will return with a greater challenge next time. Bye~ Solarsido? What is that? What's the -si? Seoul -si (city). I've felt it today, that I'm better at drawing. What are you talking about. I think it would be fun if we battled it out next time. I welcome that any time. - A collab with 'Moonbyulyida'
