sponsored by sir shark there's nothing I'd read more than hacking do I really need to practice I do yeah I stopped it jump hi everyone Tala here with the holiday season I'm right around the corner a lot of us are going to be traveling to visit friends and family now I used to be that person that would always overpack and not even use half of what I brought with me nowadays I've learned to narrow down to just the essentials this is the tech I like to pack when traveling let's get into it when it comes to bags I'm not gonna lie I may be a bit of our herschel fangirl just fit they're well-built and I love these FedEx the bear one here is called the pop quiz the smaller one here is called a beam mininova and last we have the 15 liked hip pack also known as the fanny pack so depending on how much I have to carry it Alexei's between these two bags when it comes to my fanny pack this my friend is always a must I don't usually carry a laptop but if I do it will be my trusty 2015 MacBook Pro usually I'll offer my iPad pro or tab s6 and due to how much lighter they are phone wise I've settled in on the iPhone 11 Pro and the Galaxy Note m+ yes I carry two phones one for business and a personal line that only close friends and family have access to listen being able to disconnect from stress and worse by just leaving my business phone in the hotel room has been huge for my sanity as long as this guy up here is happy that's all that matters if you're wondering I did love the pics before excel but I had to return it because there are some issues with the screen I'm definitely going to pick it up again and I heard this a Black Friday sale coming up so you know I'm all about saving the money with the cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro and the Galaxy Note Sam Pleasant being so amazing you think I wouldn't need a dedicated camera but I still do and the one I'm packing along these days is the Sony rx100 Mark 7 this guy right here [Music] listen recording 4k footage on your smartphone completely eats away at the battery life and I found a dedicated camera to still be more versatile for those reasons I'll do most of my blogging on the Sony fun fact a lot of the b-roll that I use in my videos comes from this little guy right here so it's quite capable for such a compact camera with that being said nothing beats the convenience of snapping pictures or recording video on your smartphone so I carry a smartphone gimbal with needle with me move with me a - recently I switched from the DJI Osmo mobile - to the three and I liked it so much better one there's no balancing or calibrating you just slip your phone you at the centre power the gimbal on and you're good to go - if folds which makes it way more compact I know both phones have a great stabilization but it doesn't beat how stable it looks on a gimbal also the note m+ doesn't have stabilisation when recording 4k 60fps so this guy helps with that when it comes to audio I usually carry two sets of headphones with me I'm fully wireless now since no one wants to show the headphone jack alone anymore so for longer listening sessions or if I'm on a plane I've been using the Sony WH 1000 mx3 I think these have active noise cancellation which is great if you want to zone up to a movie or music super comfortable but they do cost a pretty penny and they work as earmuffs for me and then what's your - I'll also bring along some wireless earbuds I'm still testing out the air path Pro but my current goatees or the galaxy buzz Oh walk these will work out at the hotel gym gotta burn those travel calories if uh if you know what I mean they sound great they actually stay in my ear and I appreciate the low key design oh and if you're wondering this case is from rinca it to pieces and sticks on with some 3m tape I tip to throw these around a lot so this protects it from getting scratches this clip is cool too because I can just snap it on my Sony head focus like this that way I can keep all my audio gear together this this right here is a game changer it's called the Mophie power station hub yeah it's uh it's a little more not because I've used the heck out of it this seriously does it all when it comes to charging you get all these different element adapters so no matter where you are in the world you'll be able to charge your stuff also I love that the punks pulled in and else so it stays out of the way when packed okay check this out you can charge up to four devices at the same time three plugged in and a phone wirelessly yes you heard right it has a wireless charging pad on top the coolest part is be built in 60 100 milliamp hour power bank throw it in your bag and charge a wire out in a boat if you travel a lot definitely check sir shark for supporting the channel [Music] when it comes to entertainment I usually connect my notes and plus to the hotel TV and run decks great for watching Netflix or YouTube on a larger screen the HDMI to USBC cable that I have here and I've been using is from you green I had an ombre to one before but that one got damaged so uh yeah that's that huge fan of braided cables because there's so much more durable highly recommend I'll also carry a while charging pad of some sort mainly because if I have my notes and press connects to the TV four decks I can keep the better topped off wirelessly my go-to has always been this circular movi one but oh my trip last week I used this one from ESR it's called the foldable wireless charger so check it so it works as a charging pad and if you lift this top section up it works as a charging statute which is awesome because I've video chat a lot light compact easy to pack that's a win in my book besides the cable for Dex the one I mainly used to charge up all my devices is this USB c2 USBC cable this one is actually from rinkai and I've had it for a few years now so I can vouch for the quality i'll also pack a couple of other cables a micro USB and a lightning cable for my Apple stuff I cannot wait until every piece of tech I own is USB C so I can just buy one type of cable and not 300 usually thrown a couple power banks - preferably ones that aren't too large and are easy to pocket and that's essentially all the tech attack when traveling hey if there's a piece of tech that you cannot travel the belt you need to let me know I'm always looking for some cooler things to try out until the next one peace bye [Music]
