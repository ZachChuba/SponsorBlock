so I just got a new software update this one is 20 20 20 4.6.1 and release notes so basically this this update includes new features for traffic light and stop sign control basically allow to go through a light if there's a leading vehicle in front of without confirming the autopilot stock with that functionality turned on will see a green light when it sees that the leading car is making it safe to go through basically so there's an additional update for backup camera improvements so now you'll be able to use the side repeater cameras for added visibility around your vehicle when the backup camera is visible simply swipe to display the center the repeater camera video feeds dashcam viewer improvements to make sentry mode videos easier to review we've added a red dot along the viewer scrubber video scrubber to indicate the moment when a century video event has triggered when playing a century mode video the dashcam viewer will skip ahead and begin playback right before the event which is a really nice functionality I'll show that in a few minutes here so there's some tuning improvements with this update we've improved the visibility and discoverability of TuneIn stations and podcasts so that it's easier to browse content we've also added the ability to adjust playback speed of podcasts up to two times as usual to use tune in just tap on the media icon and then select tune in walk away door lock improvement now have the option to disable walk away door lock when your vehicle is at home so tap controls lights I'm sorry controls locks and then select exclude home so I'll just kind of go through these features real quick here show everyone a little bit I'm gonna show the traffic stop traffic light stop sign control beta improvement but the backup camera so click here and then camera and actually have already selected it but by default it's gonna show your normal cam and they just kind of slap up and it will show your side repeater cameras which is really a nice added function especially be nice when you're on the freeway and you're wanting to make lane changes can make sure there's nobody in your blind spot more easily so the next one was the lock way walkaway door lock so if click on this and then go under locks and then scroll down you'll see walk away door lock and then right next to on there's that exclude home so basically can exclude it walk know with door locking when you're at home which is really nice because it's really a pain having to unlock the car when it's in your own garage so that's gonna be an added really nice added function I will just see if there's anything visible and tune in that we can see here media and tune in okay yeah so it does show I don't believe this was there before popular stations in your area and I remember seeing that and your new episodes I don't think that was there for its before tablet I don't believe it was there before so that's kind of nice popular news stations find your team local radio yeah it's really kind of nice I don't remember this being in there comment down below if think this was there prior to this update but I don't ever recall this and then they just wanted to see in regards to the two times speed okay right up here can click on it and can do up to two times it definitely speeds it up so that's yeah it's nice functionality the last new function is the cabin camera so help Tesla continue just to develop safe safer vehicles by sharing camera data from your vehicle this update will allow to enable the built in cabin camera above the rear view mirror if enabled Tesla will automatically capture images and a short video clip just be prior to a collision or safety event to help engineers develop safety features and enhancements in the future as usual can adjust your data sharing preference by tapping on controls safety security data sharing and allow cabin camera analysis no camera images and video clips will not be associated with your VIN to protect your privacy so let's just see if we can find that so it's under safety and security and then under data sharing okay here it is when cabin camera analytics is enabled so yeah basically this goes over the same things so can click yes there or no whichever your preferences and this would be a nice function especially for our century like if somebody breaks into your car I imagine this would kind of record the in camera view for century of events so that have an indoor camera the person hopefully and get their face as well as see what they're stealing so I wanted to show Ron the improvements to the dashcam viewer and which basically what what they added is this little red dot right down here so that's basically where on the scrubber where it recorded so it's usually clean towards the end of the video the Sentry cam video and then it records the ten minutes prior to that event just so if there's something fishy going on can see what was happening before it's basically can just touch just touch right before the event and then it was know basically that way can easily go right to where the event was so just want to see what the PM was this was somebody cutting me off and I hit my horn of course it recorded the video after that so yeah it's definitely a nice function so don't have to watch the whole ten minutes can just scrub right to the where the the event that triggered the century cam alert so this version just came out today actually I think in the early access program we've seen some reports on Twitter of other people that got in early access management eightish got its an a okay unfortunately Anders and I'll be in front of me going this way through the roads are multi baron here see if I can't maybe speed up and get in front of her behind some of those other cars here so can kind of see this new functionality guys at that time I did not do the confirmation that sees the car in front of me and I was it's safe to go through it see the green the line across was green the way yeah let's see if it does it again here sees the car in front of me I would see somebody cutting me off and three in line all the way through so that shows that I didn't have to do any confirmation which is really nice it makes this functionality way more useful it's quite annoying having to swipe like there's a car right in front to have it go through a green light okay interesting inside of that sink the cards too far away from me to say that it's safe for me to go through behind them doesn't seem quite ideal see it's both the light in the car before it goes through the language sure recognize that it's safe to go through let's see what it does here so get good can see the line is already green there across the red because of the car in front of me so I didn't do any confirmation and it's allowing me I go through which is perfect know a really light here let's get a little confused okay now it sees the relay and it sees the green light over the arrow just kind of cool okay it sees the green light and it sees the car in front of me and gives me a green path to go through and no confirmation which is perfect earlier when I was driving I did have one incident where it kind of got lost in the middle before me it was a four-way intersection and I kind of didn't know which lane to follow I was following it on her car through but it lost track of the car in front of me and started very know incoming traffic lanes definitely some work they still got to work out this is try to stay up with these cards here so we can see if it'll let us through the next couple answer I apologize my camera slipped down it's interesting I would have thought that it should have flipped me go through there I'm gonna speed up a little bit to try to catch them okay looks like it's going through this light no problem at all now there's another light coming up here and now it sees it's green okay yeah that guy is really close to me and it seems like it should have gone through there so that's kind of an undesired behavior there I would say okay cat now it's green light now it's giving me the green line across saying it's safe to go through the intersection just doesn't expect we're all not bad and I would say that it seems like it should have a little more leniency and the distance factor and SIA this is if it let's go through this one it's cars pretty still very close okay God would say it has those dan green most of the time it's not asking me for a confirmation and again the scars really close okay good there's another good example but going through a green light that's all did that's kind of strange I sure like freaked out there but okay so again sees the car in front lead car in front and confirmation kind of curious how what distance it needs ask for confirmation once again it sees this car there's still safer announcement confirmation and once again can see the green the middle of the screen there mean that it can see and the cars gonna have a little farther a let's see if it still allows me to go through without information no confirmation yet so this was mixed using this new functionality so much easier there have it stoplight manager light update that allows to go through lights so I'd imagine the next functionality update will be maybe allowing it to go through a green even when there's not only car I still think they're gonna want to confirm when you're at a red light before if there's not only current sane let's think that I think that would be the last functionality and so here can see me jeez seize the truck in front of me there Oh Mayson they actually still saw that that truck went through some kind of surprise that it did actually I didn't ask for my confirmation on that light either this one it's way out there is asking okay so does that is a little too far out for him too so they'd have to confirm because the car just too far out front imagine this next one turning yellow the card when they stop eating she's good there have it that's version 2020 dot twenty 4.6.1 I hope enjoyed if could please my video thanks very much have a great night
