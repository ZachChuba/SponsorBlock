sandi Monroe is going to be here for yet another episode of the teardown of with Sandy Monroe something that we do every month he is one of our monthly contributors if you're interested in cars don't forget to subscribe to this channel today we're going to tackle a question of why in the world is Tesla still dominating the electric car market and I don't mean just in sales I mean in technology so many other brands have tried from the legacy manufacturers all the way to startup companies and everyone in between I even heard the company that makes hand dryers not good hand dryers but hand dryers has tried and failed so before that a quick over $100 all right on to our conversation all right sandy welcome back to your segment only for electric but you have someone with you today please do introduce your your copilot today copilot oh no no this is the expert in batteries actually today I'll probably be just sitting here nodding my head but you wanted to talk a little bit about batteries and Mark Ellis my associate dr. mark Alice if he's in China because he was given a PhD for battery technology and battery manufacturing and battery installation of equipment and whatnot so so marks marks been around the horn he knows everything there is to know about the chemistry the manufacturing the whatever so and I don't want to I don't want to give him any more praise again big head and he'll ask for a raise so we can't I can't have and Sandy you're just gonna be here as an I can do from what I understand right okay excellent okay I now I understand the setup let's let's get into it so all right so we're talking about batteries today and you know the question that I have and I think a lot of people have is this you know Tesla has been around little is just baby it around for a while but but it since Model S let's put them on the map with I'd say mainstream somewhat you know eight years now and in the beginning everybody was kind of like alright cool you know they're startup so they're they're ahead of everybody that's fine but you know people will catch up I mean what's a big deal I mean they're you know they're battery technology it comes from Panasonic and you know everybody can do that well apparently after eight years of trying people cannot do that and I don't meet people I mean brands cannot do legacy brands with billions and billions of dollars so let me just ask you a silly question what what is it that that Tesla is doing all this all this time with the batteries that come from a third party that no one else can do well you know one of the things you have to look at is mr. musk made a financial decision when he chose to use cylindrical cells originally when Tesla came out and said they were going to make a battery pack with 7800 cells in it everyone in the industry thought there is no way that they are going to be able to make that work because you have to go through all of the electronics of balancing and voltage checking and balancing and temperature issues and people thought he was crazy he proved them all wrong so talk a little bit about why this cylindrical ahem right here cylindrical cells are they thought would be a failure at versus what are the other types of batteries that that people thought would work you know even now Tesla might be doing this with RC ATL yes you have three basic kinds of batteries that are used in electric vehicles today cylindrical cells prismatic pouches like LG and then you have prismatic cans that LG Samsung Panasonic a lot of battery companies make the prismatic cans and there's advantages and disadvantages to either form now the cylindrical cells from a commercial standpoint are much less expensive to make then pouch cells or prismatic and cells so that would that was his first smart move they've been making cylindrical cells for decades and they are very good at it and they are very fast at it and the prismatic pouches and prismatic cans require a lot more infrastructure in this in the making of a battery pack because those two types of cells the prismatic can and the pouch cells have to be compressed and so you've got to have all of the structure in your battery pack to hold compression on these cells so they don't delaminate during charged and discharged cylindrical cells act within themselves so you don't need to have as much packaging and you don't need to have so much support structure to hold the cells in place because you know just like with the Duracell battery they even expand and contract when they're charging or when they're did when they're discharging and they can get hot but they contain themselves within the cylindrical form and so did the lithium-ion cells so if it's a much easier cell to manufacture actually when I talk to people about batteries and I try to explain what's going on with a battery I used the I used the analogy it says it's the difference between making a jelly roll right you see kids they just spread some junk on it and you roll it up done right versus a grilled cheese sandwich I got a square things I got to cut the ends off I got to put stuff inside I got to take everything then I got a like squash it and that's kind of what you're looking at one is very simple and fast the jelly roll then the grilled cheese sandwich is a little bit more difficult and and hence costly okay so he went with a jelly roll and that was a good point decision but you know now all of these other companies are you know whether startups like lucid and bitin or them you know legacy like Volkswagen Group and BMW group you know update they've tried the same thing and yet they're still far behind what is it that Tesla doing that they cannot figure out how to do and again they're all using third-party provider cell providers like you know Panasonic and LG camera and no one's stopping them from from from using each other supplier so where's the matter its electronics it's in the electronics is where their advantages because like I said when they said they were gonna make a battery pack with 7,000 cells no one believed that they could balance the cells keep the voltage levels correct in order for a battery pack to work well their electronics are so superior to all those other companies that yes they made it work but they actually made it work really well and so from the electronics standpoint they're decades ahead of everybody else and the reason that they're decades ahead is because Tesla's vertically integrated and all these other companies are looking for somebody else to do their work we've talked about this I think before but vertical integration everybody says oh no look at what happened with Henry Ford okay well I don't think that Elon is going to go on start his own rubber plantation to to make his own tires or something like that but if you go in the opposite direction like most of the OEMs you wind up in a situation where you have no idea of what's going on he he develops his own chips that's why he's miles ahead he's he's trying to manufacture it trying to build a next generation and and and basically looking deep into the future the other guys are just how do I get through the next quarter so yeah yeah and I get that but but nevertheless the batteries are still made by Panasonic right but so so I guess that's where so so that's where electronics come in can you expand a little bit for my audience what do you mean by electronics do you need the the actual modules do you mean the chips do you mean the software what we're now that we identify whether the secret service sauce lies what is it that's in there all of the above everything you mentioned it's the chips it's boards it's the philosophy on how they maintain valence of charge within the batteries how they monitor the voltage how they monitor the temperatures all of that is controlled through electronics and that's where Tesla has a big advantage over everyone else take the first Chevy bolts that came out Chevy bolt had LG batteries LG electronics LG powertrain components LG motor everything was made by LG General Motors didn't make anything they just bought stuff and their supplier supplied them with it right and and so that puts them at a disadvantage from the standpoint of yes maybe they told LG how they wanted the logic constructed for the battery management system but they were stuck with whatever LG's level of technology was and as sandy mentioned Tesla's throughout all the rules and started over he didn't end up with a bunch of legacy from old battery guys like myself who've been doing it for 30 years and we're pretty stubborn when somebody tells us we have to change something and so he basically started with a clean sheet of paper and just did a better job than most other companies that have tried to get into this business yeah I think initially I said that batteries were easy and I think it's because I compared it to the electronics the electronics are hard that's where things really really are difficult because you have to invent new physics sometimes when you're looking at these these controller boards in one night they're vastly different than what we see normally no matter what I mean and that's where Tesla's got the advantage is in the electronics the battery itself is just like a gas tank but how do I get the gas out of the gas tank how do I take that electricity and bring it in and and and release it again and I do it in the most efficient fashion and that's where I mean the balance what was the balance on the on the on this right group of 42 there 46 cells so show me who's got that kind of control nobody I mean when I heard it I thought there was something wrong give me that fluke the fluke is a thing when we test I mean that fluke there's got to be you know this thing's gone funny but it wasn't it was giving us the accurate number it's just that they know how to control power all right now let's talk about so the electronics is you know they just don't appear out of the blue people make electronics right so let's like let's I'm trying to figure out because you know obviously the bigger brands have more money to catch up and yet they're not so is it in people that you hire that will create better electronics or is it the system that should work with them for example having a clean sheet like Tesla did versus a big organization of BMW group or or Volkswagen group where you can't really just do anything without a paper work and and in two years of approval process and stuff where did where's their problem lies of legacy manufacturers well it's not it's not one problem it's a whole bunch of them yeah there's a whole bunch of things that contribute but number one remember when when we had the big meltdown the banks all went broke all right well who got rid of all their people NASA Raytheon larell Lockheed Martin on and on and on where did those guys go I mean they're gonna they're gonna sack the guys that have got the lowest seniority right that's all the young that was this that's the seed corn that's what's gonna make the company grow bigger and these guys are all of a sudden find themselves out it will work what did Ilan do he went and hired them all brought him in I'll tell you what that's what we did too in 2008 9 10 11 we hired all kinds of young guys why oh because they were brilliant I can't find guys like that normally they wouldn't come to me Ilan was the same thing I mean think about it this Saturday what what shot up into into into outer space how come for doesn't have one of those how come Bentley how come how come DW how come nobody's got got their own space exploration group because Elon snapped up the best and not just the best mechanical or product design guys or electronic designers but chip designers and guys who were free thinkers guys that were I mean tremendously smart it's not so much money that makes things happen it's it's the people people make things happen yeah okay a fair answer so but then I also wonder that you know there have been plenty of startups that also started from clean slate whether they were just completely from scratch like loose and bitin fair their future and so forth but there has always also been projects within the legacy manufacturers like Ford had the Edison group were given you know clean sheets you know clean canvas and they couldn't get as far they're nice nice good effort how come they weren't able to achieve even close to what Tesla was able to achieve are they just too late to the game and all of the good talent is taken or they just simply their approach is wrong well the other thing I know about Tesla is that they hire the same way Munroe does I hire workaholics we had to little joke about you know don't say anything because you'll ask for a raise or something like that okay workaholics that's what that's what I'm looking for I want somebody who's totally devoted I don't want somebody who's coming in here well I got to stick it out for eight hours run home I mean Shinji sorry one of my guys his real name is Shinji we call him Jay Jay was you know on the weekend we had to do some some special scanning the damn thing wasn't working he was there Friday for 16 hours Saturday for 14 hours and Sunday I don't even know how many hours 12 this ridiculous but you know what he wanted to get that job done he was his mindset was I gotta get this done and a lot of people that you find in in the in the big three in fact I had a boss that was phenomenal his name was max duro sick fabulous guy and he he said in a great big giant all people's meeting 80% of you are worthless 20% is really making the company work That's not me that's a that's a guy who was a VP of powertrain at Ford and and that's that's kind of he and and that Tesla I'll bet you that there's the reverse I bet you if they have 10% of the people that aren't quite as good as what they should be that would be a stretch I think everybody that's working there is trying to their absolute best to make that company profitable well then you have to remember where Tesla is located Silicon Valley I mean the mindset of California and California companies is a lot different than the mindset of Munich or Detroit or Tokyo companies so so you have a little more creative energy now you talk about these other startups well were they laser focused on being successful or what are they just trying to make a name for themselves were they laser focused and using their funds well and and with the kind of technology that they really needed to be successful or were they living in a little bit of a dream world I mean we talked to a lot of people we talked to a lot of people who are doing startups and some people have good well-thought-out plans and other people have big dreams that can be as impractical as ever and and so what Tesla did is they had a laser focused vision and that's what drove them to be as successful as they are they're serious that's the difference between them and most everybody else they're serious every day to them they get up and or try and earn their wings okay they want to make they have to make sure that whatever they come up with is going to be is going to be a home run they haven't got a second chance whereas other guys well if this doesn't work then we'll depend on trucks or or we've always got the you know the diesel engines that we can they they're in a serious the top management is not as serious as what you've got coming out of Tesla okay all right I feel fair enough now let me ask you about this you know you mentioned vertical integration obviously that that helps with pretty much any technology and as far as just keeping it moving forward and not having to depend on people who don't you know kind of not on the same boat as far as the achieving the goal is concerned but you know Tesla now or their reports that they will be making their own battery because they figured out or very close to figuring out the chemistry and and and and sort of the the the behind-the-scenes stuff but they might actually start producing their own cells can you talk a little bit about you know how much over over a hill is it to climb to start making your own batteries for for someone like Tesla well one of the things that you know that's not totally true because Tesla has a factory full of equipment for making batteries because I don't care who says it but making a battery is not easy there are lots of things that lots of people don't know about making batteries that they only learn by making the mistakes Tesla has already seen all the mistakes they had issues when the gigafactory first started up they had issues with the machine say it issues with this hat in the other they've pretty much got that all focused out so now Tesla wants to make their own batteries but Tesla is not gonna make their own machines Tesla is not going to recreate the basics about making a battery they're just going to change the electrochemistry and if you change you know electrochemistry is when in the early 90s when lithium-ion batteries were first coming out they had lithium-ion cells with lots of cobalt in them having lots of cobalt in yourselves caused them to catch fire caused them to explode do all kinds of nasty stuff so they worked for years to take the cobalt out and still have a very good usable battery now when electric vehicles became popular they put the Cobalt back into the lithium-ion batteries because it provided a more energy dense battery per kilowatt kilowatts per kilogram you could you could have more power by adding the Cobalt they again wellnow Cobalts become very very expensive and they're going backwards now trying to take the cobalt out in and so the research has been done in the last eight years is probably equivalent to what has been done the previous 80 years on lithium-ion batteries so there's a lot more happening today because there's a market for lithium-ion batteries back in the 80s and 90s when I started in the battery business there weren't that many people that knew how to make a battery did it well made equipment for making batteries that's all changed now because there's a huge market for batteries which is why there are so many new battery companies well there's another thing too and they bought Maxwell when they bought Maxwell they inherited a bunch of new chemistry's so not to mention yeah the processes as well so not Island top of that Maxwell was claiming but they were close on on a solid-state battery I mean that that's how you stay ahead as well instead of trying to figure out how to compete with somebody sometimes you just look around and say hey look at that guy over there how much is he gonna cost ten billion dollars how much will it cost us to try and catch up maybe 20 billion go by that guy and now all of a sudden I'm not I'm not trying really hard to catch up I already did I not not only did I catch up but I have exceeded everybody's expectations and I leapfrogged past everybody else the other guys don't do that nobody does that nobody wants to make a big investment so you're seeing that Tesla is closer than most people think to actually be able to manufacture their own own batteries because they've already dealt with really were kind of already you know in the mix with Panasonic and it's just maybe a matter of you know kicking Panasonic out and bringing their own guys in is that is that what I'm getting from you that's a joint venture it was set up between Tesla and Panasonic and if Tesla wants to buy out his joint venture partner they're gonna have the equipment they're gonna have the processes he's working with some electrochemist out of British Columbia that's one of the fathers of lithium-ion batteries so he's got his electrochemistry people he's got his equipment already so now he's just expanding on that to other markets now if he's working with C ATL in China for the China Giga factory he's got all of the years of experience see ATL has had also now and so you know as they work on getting cobalt out of the lithium ion battery to make it much less expensive it's a partnership again it's not just a single entity all right well this this is definitely a conversation I'm sure we and everybody else will continue but I I appreciate the inside and I know the battery days coming up we'll probably know so much more and have a conversation based on that so I appreciate your time and I will see you next time all righty thank you okay we'll see you then so long Alex all right another interesting conversation with Sandy as always don't forget he's one of our monthly contributors so don't forget to subscribe to this channel I I can't help myself but laughs sometimes when I ask him some of the questions and I look at him in my modern day and he goes like you know the look on his face like Alex I can't believe you're asking me this you should really know and and the thing is like I don't I don't know a lot of this stuff and and also some of this is a crowd source but you know my audience and some of the other people in the industry that that I ask you know what should I ask send you next time right so but this is why I have them here right this is why we're so privileged to have them here and and educate us on all of this topic so by the way if you have a suggestion for the next topic that we should explore with him don't forget to add it to the comment section of this video looking forward to all of your comments other than that see you guys next time and remember to stay charged
