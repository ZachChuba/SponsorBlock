yeah you could just turn around day 7 deck 3 of noah's ark but that's yeah you're probably right yeah my kids are real man that's your co-host man it's not fired noah this is the best competition reality show i've ever been on and that's coming from somebody who was on a dance reality competition show seeing you dance on that show made me gag and it won't stink as bad as these stink balls [Applause] i know how much and how well you are able to handle horrible smells it's pungent oh god oh god i'm here for your treasure sir oh jesus it's no good man i just tried to fly sure let's pretend it's true that's not true at all god i just realized i might vomit during this episode why did that not occur to me until just now that's great youtube man we've got three different stink bombs we're gonna test i guess we'll test for what how intense they are how fast they spread and how practical they are uh yeah so who is contestant number one uh contestant number one is the common egg i mean it just looks like an egg but i'm gonna guess it's a rotten egg how do you make an egg go rotten okay i don't know if this is going to work or not it looks like one of those really crappy remember in the 70s you would dye eggs and somehow you told yourself that was fun this is just a regular egg according to the recipe that i found online you just take a sewing needle pop a little hole in there and then let it sit for a while this has been in my garage for about a week and a half so i'm gonna guess that what that does is oxygen gets in because part of the reason an egg stays for so long is because it doesn't gross out with oxygen you're letting oxygen in the science science for science adjacent the grossing out process yeah okay okay did you ever have anyone like clear out junior high by throwing the rotten egg no mean either i was just asking simpler times did you really what i mean statute of limitations is probably up we got to hear that at some point okay okay let's science this you stand on the side throw it right in the middle down there all right which i wonder how long it's going to take to unsmell and i'll stand on the outer ring i want you to i want you to in your mind you go and we'll both kind of start counting and then you tell me when it hits you and just privately note like how intense it is okay and i'll tell you when it hits me that sounds good that's that's science okay ready science commence in three two one science there it is i'm at 12 seconds that barely could smell no i'm getting nothing faint real faint like you're gonna faint no no no it's a really faint faint smell yeah i'm going in 20 yeah i'm in like 30 seconds i'm not really getting anything to be honest you probably could have cut a fart and i think it's the same thing yeah i caught maybe a whiff of something but nothing now and i had my face right down in it i mean it smells like propane and propane accessories yeah that's not that bad ah all right legend tested yeah contestant number two show me how you smell sulfur and burnt dog hair oh i'm so glad that the last word of that sentence was hair so just dog hair dog hair and match heads yeah that's what the recipe called for uh we've got the rubber band wrapped around the little payload here how many match heads are in there i put five in there okay all right man i'll tell you what that first contestant man it was a real uh there was a word for it no he follows me on twitter he's nice you know what let's go on to the next one prepare for oh describes oh man this time we're gonna put it in a confined space oh yeah okay all right there we go let it waft pretend we're in biology like burning paper right now yeah also i don't mind the smell of matches is it matches the thing you light to cover up stinky smells yeah that smell like rotten eggs yeah why would that work i don't know man now it's like we're trying to just cleanse the pit of evil vibes and stuff just some sage by burning dog hair oh oh i guess if you have a dog that's patient and will let you pet and extract hair and you wrap it in paper and you have a little gemina so that you can keep the burning dog hair alive [Music] and you have a dog hair burning sommelier who can capture the nose he can walk you through it i mean why are these so stupid this might literally be just incense somewhere you're in austin yeah oh my god remember that episode when i put my face into a chimney full of burning dog hair and it wasn't even that bad oh are you sure the source wasn't just pranking us it may have failed and i verified these i found them in from various places multiple sources yeah smells like uh i don't know smoke rotten eggs i have no doubt rotten eggs smell bad there's a reason but that prep method was completely ineffective yeah and also uh outdoors it just doesn't cover a big enough area yeah dog hair i don't know if i was cozying up and i thought i was about to get a kiss for my lady and instead to smell that i might say one of us should take a shower but i don't know that i would call her a stink bomb in that moment yeah that's really disappointing but this next one will not fail us because of science brian yes this is your own european urine if you throw that on me you clearly need a dog what am i looking at this is egg whites and drano crystals lie lie exactly the drano crystals have sodium hydroxide in them the sodium hydroxide reacts with the amino acids in the egg whites to produce ammonia first of all you should not inhale ammonia that's bad bad idea okay okay i'm gonna take it on faith you open and i smelled it would i would think it was bad oh dear yeah gave it a good shake when i put the drano in there yeah it immediately started to get hot that's exothermic the problem we're having is that all of these have been like we're outside so everything just blows away so if this is truly the most potent of them we could play the world's worst dumbest version of pin the tail on the donkey my eyes are closed uh okay so the plan is i have to find if i smell right yes okay i'm gonna spin around god we're so dumb okay all right here we go i'm spinning i'm spinning my eyes are closed let me know when you've found spitting keep spinning my eyes are closed i'm spinning as well tell me where i don't know that's a good plan your voice has to be someplace away from the stink bomb okay i'm spinning i'm circling around a little more i found an arrow we need to not step on that okay okay can i can i open my eyes enough to know yes where i'm stepping you can stop turning around okay i'm looking down and i'm only sniffing in fact i'm gonna i'm gonna i don't wanna see anything [Music] come on brian i mean i can tell where you are from your voice i'm glad it's not from smell i don't need you knowing my secrets my secret sense now i can see straight down so i know these are the steps yeah be careful i still can't smell that dinosaur like it just smelled like wet dog uh are you homing in on it i think you're closed am i supposed to be honing in on i don't know think of a a pungent ammonia smell oh god is it working you didn't throw it on the ground or nothing did you no no i didn't i have my clothes you're very very very close you're hot you're burning up burning up brushwood oh christ i'm looking right at it do you know what it is what is it i'm i'm sad to report that i know i i got used to it shockingly fast and it just smells like a rest stop all this smells like a urinal it smells like a rest stop not just any urinal but like you know that caked in the sun oh yeah that's pretty uh hey we should pour it out and uh yeah and bask in it i guess this isn't even is it you didn't you didn't just pee it this wasn't all i didn't have any drano man i mean that's how you're supposed to do it but i just mixed some eggs and my pea in there and then this guy dave that lives over by the kfc he peed into two oh yep that's oh my god he's right that is a rest stop mother of ugh you know what i just found out tell me it's been all these years i didn't know that squarespace had a one button push thing where it's like it'll post your blog but it will also send it out to twitter or facebook and uh tumblr if you're still doing the tumblr thing you're making you made that one up no okay twitter facebook are real but the other one i think you made my point is we have the modern rogue.com we redesigned the entire site i just now found this out so now i have to call our editor-in-chief and say we should do that that's a good thing to do maybe he's already figured it out and he's doing that but pretending he's working way harder than he actually is meanwhile analisa is just like why am i typing all this you should be using squarespace one of the other things i love
