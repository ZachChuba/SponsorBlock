what's happenin bees and g's and welcome back it to another upgrade and unlock episode this is the series where quests levels boss uniques GP and other activities unlocked chunks of the maps so we can progress further into the map losing our hardcore status and deaths after that also take chunks away from what we've unlocked if you've missed the playlist link will also be in the description for those you on mobile one thing I did want to change and it was massively requested in the comment section and up voted by loads of you is that now when we unlock a chunk we can obviously use GP our first unlock was 1k to unlock the chunk it's now gonna double so the second one is gonna cost us 2k 4k 8 K 16 K and it will cap at 500k to unlock chunks these episodes also going to be weekly every single Tuesday so you can expect an upgrade and unlock every week from now on we need four more levels to unlock a new chunk and I did actually go ahead and get myself a few bars we've got 20 more to do so one more inventory worth which is a nice nice nice but uh since I took a long time I was mining them over in Lumbridge banking in Lumbridge walking back and then obviously coming back here took a long time just to get like 30-something bars I think it's probably 40 but really really long grind hopefully we can go ahead and get at least close if we can get one level away there was a dragon in bling there if we can get level 1 level away from the new chunk I'd probably just go ahead and do it in something else pretty simple because the the whole process just takes far too long so we've got ourselves together 160 bronze knives I'm going to probably be hunting a few m/s but just when they sort of come across our path rather than actually going for them because obviously they do drop a few things that would be useful and later on in our career but often that I'll probably just kill a few goblins or something like that and I'm just going to get this range level up a bit and then obviously the magic we've got a few ruins here as well and we're currently three levels off so this shouldn't take too long there we go two to five we've got a prayer level and a range level at the same time I can't remember when you meant to go too rapid I think it's at level three but I can't remember can we go to level four on Kirra and then we change to rapid but we do have a new chunk to pick please give me the one I need here we go come on come on yes we kill it that is what we're talking about now we could do two quests I think we yes we can do we might be able to do Prince Ali's rescue as well now I haven't looked completely into it because I saw a pot of flowers through out of the way and sort of dismissed it but as long as there isn't anything like we got to walk up here or something we could have this guys we can have three quests from just getting this one square Wow so I just looked into it we can do everything for Prince Ali's rescue except we need a pink skirt so annoying we have like this one unlock to the red berries we have this unlocked for the clay we're just missing that so I'm caught sure we're not gonna get three quests done but we're definitely gonna get two done which is awesome and maybe we'll unlock seven and that will then bring us into being able to do one more quests so let's go ahead and give this a go so we can start our second quest and we have the shears right there so let's uh looking for a quest yes okay I can do that beautiful right we're just going to get a twenty balls of wool sheep shearer started easy as that while we're round here we're just gonna get the all the ingredients we need for the cooks assistant as well that's gonna be two more chunks to open up go and get some fresh milk from Gilly Thank You Gilly preciate it there we go that is everything we need for cooks assistant we have our 20 wool we just need to go and spin that in Lumbridge and that is two quests done there we go cooks assistant completed 300 cook exp not a level that unfortunately but we are gonna go ahead and spin these into balls of wool big man Fred here you go oh I got one too many beautiful thank you very much 150 crafting HP's 60 coins and two new chunks to open up start to have to zoom out a bit more to see everything we've got a we've got quite a bit going on Varick would be nice just for the things that it would come out with you know the sword shop the anvil obviously it means we could get the pink skirt to finish off the princess rescue ports the rim rest drain or drain or manner any of those would be good just not desert please two picks here here we go oh we got the wizard sour okay that means we can start em catcher which is okay so that means tutorial island now becomes one which would be horrible to get so please don't give us that but we together well wizards tower which is nice i'm gonna go ahead and see what we get for our second chunk here be something nice seven plate okay opens up a bit more of varrock we've got that we can actually walk in now to barrel can walk down here there's now an altar i guess a home obviously we got the mining bit there but other than that nothing too crazy oh just got a close go easy search the coffin in Edgeville can't do that but we will hold on to it because the chances of being able to do any clues girls is so little that i might as well just have them when i start unlocking areas just went ahead and got myself 20 attack so we can now upgrade to the myth simio so got 20 hit points there which is a very very nice and date can we go on over and get ourselves this mithril scimitar which is actually gonna be a big old upgrade physique my boy how much you turn these for one cave its hefty mate that is hefty its have a look what is this gonna do it's gonna add six strength bonus and six more slash very nice indeed might as well sell this back to our boy how much you're gonna buy us off us for two that's not a bad price actually and there's some prior experience 16 levels away from a new chunk so the next thing i want to do is get 27 thieving that way we will be able to start stealing from seed stalls and obviously if we got some seeds in the bank it's gonna really help us as we continued to keep unlocking these patches and stuff like that as we slowly go through the world we are gonna need more and more of those so well the [ __ ] of the farmers oh he's in there what's he doing in there what's he doing in there as I said yeah we're gonna go for 27 thieving here and then we're gonna head on over to the seed stalls only 14 more levels before we get ourselves another chunk unlocked as well and hopefully we can progress through a quest or something like that maybe we'll unlock a new skill with the next chunk and like all good youtubers I just missed the level but that is level 27 saving coming in let's open this door or pickpocket him again open the door there we go and Pete pocket get open the door there we go level 27 coming in and that does now mean that we can go on over to Draenor and start doing the seed saw which is gonna be better XP and obviously yeah there's not a failed chance as long as we stand in the right location so much better XP and also it means we can start getting these seeds and hops and stuff like that together you get a few potato seeds together and that is the only thing you can plant at level 1 but unfortunately the only allotment that we can get or very close to that's close to being unlocked is the one here so right now we can't actually plant the potatoes that we're getting I am currently getting attacked by a jail guard oh my god um we do not want to die and obviously that means that we can't actually start farming what I could do is start raking and if I break some of the weeds to level 3 farming then we can start planting barley hops which we can get from the store and we can also then go and plant it just over here behind where we were steaming from the farmers we can plant the barley there so that would be a way of getting our farming up if it gets desperate I might go ahead and do that but as of right now I'm not too fast on getting that up Giles mate hello is this a shield it is a shield mate what are you giving me a sapphire not really what I want but I'll take it I'll take it a free sapphire and here we go first a thieve of the stool Olivia could just [ __ ] off that would be brilliant and a barley seed there we go that's what I was saying that is you know our way to farming if we don't unlock the the patch the allotment just over there just over the horizon you know earlier when I said this is Bear XP it's definitely not it's definitely not it's just gonna be a way of us to get our our seeds together so I guess we'll probably move on because I thought you've got way more expedient it 10 per theme and obviously you don't have to wait for it to come back so we aren't gonna carry on here but it does mean we have now unlocked a way of getting some seeds pretty easily and get those early farming levels when we do need it but as of now we have to move on and and get nine more levels and then we get a new chunk and we can see what we unlock I'm gonna be heading on over to lumbridge in a minute anyway so I might as well use these runes up and for those who don't know daggers actually give a one magic attack bonus so if you don't have a magic weapon it's worth putting a dagger on for some reason I have no idea why but oh yeah that's a it's a little trick and yeah just get a couple of magic levels here not really going for anything at the moment other than a new chunk but I might as well use these so we can go and get ourselves claim ourselves some more the runes as if you the video I would appreciate it cheers guys just unlock water strike which is sending the XP through the roof what's this look at just one hit how much is going up we didn't even hit there look at that oh this is beautiful beautiful I wish we could get hold of some more runes easily but it seems we have a rune shop in our area at the moment this is pretty much the best we can do hope some good drops and and claim them from the cheater and the moment magic just isn't that viable but when we do have the runes near the levels go up super quickly which is really really nice that is gonna be the last magic level we can get level 8 coming in nothing new there but we will just finish off these last three my runes run off the Lumbridge and we're not far from another chunk now not far at all and probably push another magic level with the with the 30 we get now you know what I'm just going to send the home teleport I know that seems nuts it's kind of guy I am five levels away we'll definitely get another magic level we did make some bronze knives earlier as well so maybe I'll just start throwing them around as well just get a few passive levels so we can see what chunk we're gonna open next right so we're out of rooms what I'm gonna go ahead and do is just use these bronze knives I'm not going to use them at any other point in the account I'd out at home because they are such [ __ ] ammo and obviously we're gonna get a lot better things later on so might as well use them now get these levels up and go for at 250 unlock a new chunk I probably go ahead and start cooking some chicken as well so we'll probably get a couple of cooking levels on the way it to this five or six range as well that is level 5 range coming in which means we can now use oak boughs and of course the steel throwing weaponry which is really nice we are now also one at level away from the unlocks so I'm just gonna get this level through cooking these chickens and we'll see what luck is gonna give us a I don't know what what guys there is 23 cooking coming in scrambled eggs and tomato very nice 250 total level let's hop on over and see what we're gonna get here we go guys right what are we gonna get on this unlock plays something that's gonna give us a quest or bit of varrock would be nice to be fair that would unlock some shops and stuff we will see let's have a look Oh Draenor I think that means that we can go ahead and do what's it called Ernest the chicken I believe I think we I think I think you can do everything you know the chicken let's have a look oK we've got to be very careful not to walk past this line luckily imagine there were some trees there I wouldn't be able to go in here that would be so [ __ ] but we're good right let's talk to Veronica have a chat and we can do Ernest the chickens so we'll get this one done and that way another chunk to unlock here we go took five ten minutes nothing too crazy talk to him and I think yes he is gonna turn us back into a human bang job done that is gonna be quest completed which means another chunk and to open up oh that was quite nice I mean sort of good because obviously this opens up when we want to do the accumulator we already have this chunk opened but let's be honest all this did was give us a quest so sort of like for now it was just giving us another chunk it was like but I won't get one free because we just did the quest but there's nothing else to do here really anyway let's see what gonna get here something good please let's just get this so we know what's going on and we're really pushing up here aren't we getting close to the wilderness here um and not an anvil its it's not close to a bank so that doesn't really help us we've got Pesce we can buy a helm they'll secure to your stronghold oh that's actually quite huge and we can do some fly fishing here and we can get the edge field dungeon remember I said if we can enter a dungeon oh no we can't actually we don't have the brass key but if we had the brass key we would be able to go down there and use the hole at the edge field dungeon but uh we do get the stronghold we get some mining Pesce a spinning wheel pottery and ville it's okay it's okay and I think the stronghold is gonna be good it will give us 10 kgp which does mean a few chunk unlocks I don't really need any GP at the moment so maybe we go ahead and do that 10k use that all on unlocking some new chunks and and see we hend up going but uh not a bad bad start here that is gonna be where I end the episode as well guys as I said these are gonna be weekly now so you know they're gonna be a bit shorter but they're gonna be every single week every single Tuesday is the upload time at 8 p.m. UK time so uh try and work out for yourself but uh yeah it's gonna be weekly so it goes thank you so much for
