all right my name's phil talking about politics and in this video i'd like to continue the general theme of small businesses facing the sharpest end of a very pointy stick as a result of the extreme tory brexit and discuss individual examples to highlight how the problems far from teething problems are actually permanent but first if you'd like to be click the bell notification icon so quick reminder of what the government wants us to believe the downturn in trade is caused by the pandemic and people needing time to get to grips with the new paperwork but these are temporary issues that will go away given time now it is true the pandemic has absolutely suppressed trade and that as we emerge from it something that will take longer thanks to boris johnson's candid response we would expect trade to increase at some point it is also true that some issues with trade have been because people are struggling with the paperwork see some are taking a long time over it's all new to them obviously that delays shipping orders as they become more accustomed to the paperwork it's natural to assume that process will speed up some businesses can't possibly afford to spend the time doing this and so they really need to subcontract that job out but there are enough customs agents at the moment in the uk to satisfy demand again you would expect supply eventually to rise to match demand in addition some consignments have been delayed because there was a an error on the paperwork and again the government will go you makes sense doesn't it as the errors become less commonplace the process should speed up all of that is true however when you take all of those things away you are still left with a load of issues that the government don't want to talk about and that's because they're not going anywhere some will even get worse so i'd like in this video to take a look at some well specific businesses who are tearing their hair out as reported recently to shed some light on why this is and and one widely circulated report which is the subject of this video concerns ken torres who is an engineer based in sheffield yorkshire he said delivery times for his goods have gone from three days that was fairly normal beforehand to up to four weeks he also said that it'd be buggered if his goods were available elsewhere in the eu now this is something i've mentioned before because companies who produce goods that aren't made in the eu you know niche goods for examples um i can argue a little bit luckier because their customers either have to put up with the long wait times or do without i mean there are certain things i've been getting for example and and i can't get them anywhere else i can't get them from within britain so i just have to wait it out um of course some of these companies won't necessarily last long term they may be looking now because if a gap in the single market is spotted by a company in the eu and and others in the eu start producing some of these goods to the same standard then the british base manufacturers are actually knackered and mr torres explained a few of the problems see the paperwork is different for different countries we talk about the single market a lot of course because we were in the single market and now we've left but we need to get used to the fact that it is now meaningless for us the single march market has no benefit for us because we aren't in it so when we trade with countries in europe now we're not trading with the single market we're trading with individual countries with their own rules and their own import procedures and they're all different so when the government talk about people just needing to get used to the paperwork i mean this is true if they supply customers from a consistent list of countries but imagine a business right so in the first few months or you know even the first year of brexit let's say it's supplying customers in france and belgium and italy and they eventually get used to the paperwork they're all different but they get used to it because they've been sending things to customers in these countries over time and things get better not as well as before because of before they didn't need to do the paperwork at all you know the paperwork still takes time even if you get better at it and it still costs money and the checks still mean transport delays which weren't in place before but it's as good as it's going to get then let's say somebody from greece a year later orders from you great more business ah great we've never shipped to greece before more paperwork that you've never seen in your life to get your head around and then you're back at the beginning all those so-called teething troubles all over again then consider that people start up businesses all the time we can't just say it's fine once exporters get used to the paperwork as if all these businesses are fixed in time what happens when new businesses emerge and they have to start navigating the complex exporting process or worse or if they're a manufacturer and they have to import raw materials or parts manufacture a product and then export the finished product back into the eu then they have import and export procedures to deal with so anytime even in 10 years time 20 years time you will have people struggling to cope with the cumbersome systems and slowing everything down well i mean that's just a small number isn't it you might say i mean at the start of brexit it was everyone everyone had to cope with it later on it'll just be new startups you only get so many of those in any given month won't be a big problem but here's where we come to mr torres's next issue see a small business isn't likely to fill up a lorry with their guts their consignment will be part of the shipment trying to get across that brexit border your consignment may be absolutely fine all your paperwork immaculate but if it's sharing a lorry with a consignment where there is a problem the whole thing gets stopped it's the lorry that stopped until all of its freight is cleared this means that a single issue with a single item on that lorry and everything is delayed until the problem is dealt with this has been widely reported as well this is why it can take weeks to get those goods delivered even if there's no problem with your goods or the paperwork with your goods you know he said that some had been lost for over a month it's why mr torres has said if he had competitors in the eu he'd be finished now with brexit as soon as it was clear that it meant leaving the single market it became equally clear that the cost of transport would go up this hits your competitiveness immediately and is why any such brexit was going to cause a serious economic hit but when you have a situation where your goods can take 10 times as long to be delivered your customers are absolutely going to be putting in effort to find an alternative supplier if if you know if there's no alternative then they're stuck they have to wait it out or do without your goods but if there is an alternative they'll just go with the alternative you know for the things i'm waiting for the blinds for this studio for example if i had an alternative i would absolutely go for that alternative there isn't so i'm waiting bottom line is we don't have the systems to manage our new trading relationship the conservatives have been in power from start to finish of this mess and should have put those systems in place now i know why they didn't and it isn't entirely incompetent that's only part of the story see eu countries have implemented systems at their end it was politically sensible to do so but not for the conservatives setting up those systems would have served to highlight just how damaging brexit was going to be until it was in the bag until there was nothing anyone could do to stop it they wanted to pretend that it was all going to be sunshine and rainbows not that i'm a big fan of sunshine and rainbows especially not when i've got my waiting for my blind still but then i suppose i'm not a fan of brexit either and when you look at the three specific issue that ken torres has they are all inherently a feature of the system not a teething problem so one as a small business his consignments will be sharing lori's space with that of others even if his paperwork is fine his goods can still be delayed by weeks at a time if he has the misfortune for those goods to be traveling with somewhere errors were made and i say misfortune as if as if you're unlucky but he says that every single consignment has been delayed he specifically said that he feels lucky when one gets there after a week and that's double the previously expected time so actually it doesn't sound like you're unlucky for this to happen it sounds like it happens a lot that is not a problem that's going away while this paperwork exists there will be people making errors where there are errors being made the whole the whole lorry load gets stopped because there will always be people who are inexperienced in the process secondly each separate company country sorry has different rules and paperwork that inevitably slows the process down and adds extra costs along with the delays to transport increasing the cost of freight this is also a problem that's not going away you know that these different countries have different import rules is not going to change at least not while we remain outside the customs union and single market thirdly the systems need to manage this and not in place now you might argue well they've been slow on that but now brexit's in the bag they can go ahead with it you know that is temporary because eventually those systems will be implemented perhaps if you're talking in the far future but in the foreseeable future will they because to do so not only requires more competence than the current government have but also a willingness to face up to the realities of brexit they're still trying to convince people that brexit is fine and that any problems that may exist from time to time are either teething problems on the part of british businesses or spiteful revenge on the part of the eu government systems wouldn't help either would they so putting them in place only undermines their own argument by getting serious about trying to solve the issues so i'm not really sure that politically you know that is what they would do so i don't think i'll hold my breath but those are just some of the problems as highlighted by a single engineer in sheffield more will be coming until then i hope you found the video interesting if you did don't forget to click the like button and if you'd like to support the channel further please also click the
