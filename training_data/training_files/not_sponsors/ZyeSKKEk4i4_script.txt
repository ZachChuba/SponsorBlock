Oh first of all I just want to say I just hope that she's okay that she is happy that she wasn't rushed into realizing this because from what I understand the comeback was postponed because of I don't feel like I'm in the position to be saying this like I Who am I to talk about this right so you know what let's just forget about this I just hope that she's okay I just hope that she's a happy yeah that's it I don't know how to move on from that but yeah you know what let me just go ahead I have the caption zone happy I know she's older than I am but I just want to like squish her cheese and I give her like a big hug [Music] I feel like I'm gonna keep on smiling the whole music [Music] [Applause] [Music] she's adorable Oh funny because I would never be able to describe her style she does so much [Music] can you even call this kpop at this point my heart [Music] honestly if you're feeling down just play this song that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] it has a weird English pub like Old English pub life if that's even a thing I love the vintage feel of this [Music] I really want to see yes this look of her [Music] she's literally gotten [Music] [Music] you know how you're just like smiling like oh you have that dumb smile on your face when you're watching a music video I feel like this right now like don't you feel like it's it makes you feel so good to see one of your Idol like smiling and being happy like legit because you sometimes we feel such like a strong connection with an idol I'm not necessarily talking about ten because I haven't followed her for that long so I can't speak on that but you know when you have a connection with an idol or whatever and you just somehow 2-sphere what they feel sometimes like you you feel for them and I this this just makes me feel for her first of all and it makes me feel happy for her not necessarily for myself but this music video just radiates so much like good vibes it does make sense no news if you do is nothing really crazy she's just in that set and I'm moving around and being you know herself and I like seeing it it's really simple it's nothing too complicated or whatever is one of those music video where you just like take it in as it is more than try to analyze what's happening and I'm glad she came up with the concept like this one because I don't even know how to describe her like discography or like her style general whatever because she doesn't stick to one this doesn't sound like any of the of her past songs if that makes sense like she is able to do so much in her voice is so versatile and it fits everything I mean I don't feel like her voice fits everything but she makes it fit everything if that makes sense that makes sense am I looking too far it anyways this is a type of song that when you really need to get that boost you know you will get to this song because it makes you feel good if I need to feel hyped I won't go to this song but if I need something that you know just makes me smile it's some of the reminds you that it's okay to be happy in everything so yeah that does the type of something that you would reach for when you are in this type of me so I'm glad that she is releasing such song at this point right now and that's just truly hope that she's okay and happy so yeah
