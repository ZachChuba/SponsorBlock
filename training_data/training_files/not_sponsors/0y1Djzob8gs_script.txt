[Music] hello humans darlings you must forgive me it is far too hard I have to sit in the shade today but the video topic is this topic today is actually so freaking exciting I started going through the statistics of how much it costs me to be a digital Nomad and travel full time the way that I do and I wanted to pass that on to you guys because it's so interesting just to see and free self to compare is this possible can you live this way what does it take flights accommodation transport transport in a world where I think digital nomads are still so mysterious and the world seems out of reach I want to make it more attainable for you straight up I'm gonna admit your mum and dad are probably not gonna like me because I am trying to get as many people living life on the road I don't want you stuck in an office job unless you want to unless you choose to do that I don't want you there because I know what life is like when you have time to do whatever you want and live life on your own terms but of course there are gonna be failures it's taken me 10 years to get to this road so myself the beginning was horrible and I failed a lot I had to go back to work find new jobs work crappy bar jobs overtime work like crazy try again fail try again fail until I figured out how to make this a sustainable lifestyle without pressure of me having to return off your first domain website or online store so this current Airbnb I'm staying in is six hundred and fifty dollars for nine nights and five people are staying in it making it fourteen point two dollars a night that is pretty affordable the cost of my previous accommodations would barley twenty one dollars a night house of six people cost broken up by six people Germany a hundred and seventy dollars this is so expensive it is so expensive I'm not denying it I had four bedrooms to myself it could sleep eight people it was huge it was luxurious but I was filming a lot so this was actually a business investment but it is so expensive I stated for three weeks ouch but then to balance it out Belgium I stayed there for a while and that was free because my boyfriend had work accommodation Latvia $25.00 for the night or $700 for the month Estonia $100 that's Tonya $100 for the week do keep in mind that the most expensive thing that I pay for when I'm traveling is accommodation I use it hugely as my place to film the current place I'm staying in is pretty ugly so I'm not filming there but usually I pay a little bit extra because it is my workspace as well also as a full time traveler sometimes it gets a little bit annoying moving for a house to house but if you have nice houses to go to it makes things a lot easier for me so that is why I choose to spend quite a lot in comparison on my accommodation it's not a huge amount still it balances itself out and I'll tell you the total cost of what I pay a year at the very end and you'll see for yourself I don't think it's that massive so continue watching barley it's fun this beautiful scooter that I have that I love featuring because it's so brilliant brand-new it's costing me like portals a day too high up scooters in general cost around two to six dollars to hire and then it's about a dollar to fill up the petrol tank which is amazing then moving with your bags in between the airport and accommodation it's about ten to twenty dollars per trip and you're usually sharing that with a few people in the car aka transport and viley is very cheap this year I've only hired two cars everywhere else I've just used public transport and that has been a total of eight hundred and seventy five dollars and the other transportation I think I've used five buses and that's about it to get me between countries like Latvia Estonia Lithuania and those I think costs between ten to twenty dollars per trip so again super cheap the GC one the flight the thing that everyone probably is waiting for usually my flights are between like a hundred to five hundred dollars at time my current flights for example Toronto to Bali was five hundred dollars and then I'm going to Australia next which is two hundred fifty dollars and in Australia I'm staying with family by the way so that's whole set free I just want to throw in these sunglasses whenever I can because it looks so bad as I love it so much style for me so this year I've flown 23 times I know you don't have to fly this much I do it for work as well so I am NOT a responsible traveler I admit that I'd do my best in other ways to save the world but I do freakin struggle this way and that's not okay I would say the total cost of my flights this year would be around roughly six thousand dollars in total but obviously if you think about it even as a digital nomad you really don't have to take any flights at all you could just drive between places or you can catch buses between places or you can just stay in a place for six months at a time you definitely do not need to travel as much as me I thought it would be quite interesting to see what I look like from the other time me sitting and this is how I'm when I'm recording my my favorite food Bali okay so the cost of eating out here is between two to three dollars a meal complete meal including drinks in local restaurants however in Chango for example there are a lot of really fancy cafes at a tailored towards tourists and you can easily spend between 10 to 20 dollars and and it starts to add up but you do not again have to eat out like this you can also cook at home it is very cheap to live here other places whenever I'm cooking at home in different countries I would say it a verge is out to be 500 dollars a month for groceries that I buy I rarely eat out Bali is a place that I eat out a lot because it's especially this house that I'm staying in right now it's said it's not a check I don't want to you know what is sometimes you win and sometimes you don't honestly the bottom line is I don't know whether my lifestyle is lavish or not the only thing I spend money on is accommodation flight and food the rest of the stuff I don't go shopping I don't have a car or now the mortgage I don't have expenses bills the only regular bills I have is online subscriptions that help my business and then I also have travel insurance which is given to me for free by my credit card my boyfriend's credit card actually so I have 100% simplified my life to the max I've done this there repurpose plea because I want freedom so after some super rough calculations I figured out that my transport and accommodation is about thirteen thousand dollars a year and then give or take the food we're probably looking at twenty thousand dollars let's stretch it to twenty five just to be safe this is not for everyone some people will be surprised by that cost like so cheap and some people will be like holy crap I just know personally when I was living in one spot in Australia for example it was costing me almost the same thing going out for dinners partying shopping buying a lot more I'm a minimalist I travel full time I can't shop it just seems like it's kind of evening out on the cost side of things for me I don't know if I live lavish or not I don't know please let me know is this crazy expensive or is this doable the way that I honestly see this it's $25,000 for me to live like this every single year it could be about 15 if I didn't live lavishly like I did with the accommodation that I have if you can figure out how to make twenty five thousand dollars online every single year you're done you're happy you're saved you're good it doesn't even have to be online you can just with the service or the skill that you have say it's massage Reiki gong healing and dancing anything like that there are so many different ways to make this work so don't get stuck in your job can we just get some nice slow-mo on my sweat drips that I happen to you right okay so my friend also Jackson groves he lives off $800 a month full stop that's it that his is his beautiful thing that he does so you can do this a lot cheaper and even if that is not within your budget there are different ways to do this you can literally live out of a tent out of a van the other option is to train yourself in this lifestyle because it is a little bit hard to start off with so when I was 18 and I was figuring it out this whole world I went traveling for like two to three months every single year and I would go and stay with family I would stay on couches I would stay in a hostel and then I'd come back and I would be working overtime in bars like crazy amounts of work so I could save up and do it all over again I think Zach same time I was also learning all the skills I needed to to make money online and figure out this lifestyle but that is where you cannot fault you have to keep learning even if you go for a while and you fail and you have to come back because you ran out of money because your business didn't come off the ground do it again next year when you've saved up some more money if this is what you want you do not give up on it well yeah as I said I think that people really do believe that this lifestyle is too unattainable like impossible to do so I did this with a little financial support from anyone I just figure this out for myself completely and to those haters that sometimes come in it's cuz you're a gal and you sleep around honey that's called jealousy I did this all without I think that thank you very much I don't need to open up my legs to travel the world food legitimately I just wanted this so so bad and there was nothing nothing nothing that was gonna get in my way so I really really hope that you choose to work on this lifestyle and not get stuck in an office job that you don't love because life is too short to not enjoy the frickin video game or simulation or whatever it is that you believe we're here to experience life to the fullest so don't for the love of God gets stuck in an office job because there are different ways to make this work I think I think I wrap it now because I don't know if anyone wants to see the sweat
