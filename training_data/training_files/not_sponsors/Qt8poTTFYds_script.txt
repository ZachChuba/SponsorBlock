shouldn't we shouldn't prank call because no no no i don't think we should prank call people mikko the refrigerator running as in like it's running away from you and then it's like a haha funny joke like you're supposed to go catch it i don't think we should prank call people wait but but okay okay not actual prank calling but just calling up so that's not a prank that's just calling a friend i have an idea okay what's your idea are you single no [ __ ] wait wait depends on what day it is who is that right okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm asking are you single yes okay so how about we call some streamers asking if they want to go on a date with you i think you're going to get a lot of no's but i'm down to try okay okay okay but then what what happens after they say yes is it just like now do i have to go on a date with them no i don't then we can go copper okay you're right that's correct then we just laugh in their face you're right you're right i just want an excuse to call up a bunch of streamers that would literally just kill their egos you want to go on a date with me okay well go [ __ ] yourself buddy we're going to laugh at you well then can we call wubby yes give me call lobby and just spark quad him what what is farquaad what does that mean okay so it's a debate okay farquaad basically means a debate so what we can do is is we could call up lobby set up like a fake date and then be like you desperately go rico me and wubby used to be friends like two years ago we know each other pretty well okay okay then he'll be in on the joke no he won't he knows my boyfriend that's why the fourth quarter would be perfect that won't be perfect okay how about this how about we call wubby and tell him you're pregnant is that better that's that's pretty good that's pretty good can we do that i feel like he wouldn't care but there's an option here okay yeah yeah so we try i'm trying to think of something that he would actually give a [ __ ] about yeah okay think think think i can't think of anything he gives a [ __ ] about true how about how about okay okay how about really there's nothing i can't think miko you're putting me on the spot here don't think that all's
