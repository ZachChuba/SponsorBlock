time i get a pet well kind of i managed to go from zero to 160 mil only at the corrupted gauntlet unfortunately i wasn't able to get an enhanced weapon seed or the pet i am way over the drop rate on those now and i have a clan bingo event on the horizon so i will have to leave the corrupted gauntlet at some point soon my challenge now is to try and get an enhanced weapon seed or the pet before the bingo all right we got a bank value of 179 mil 1 200 corrupted gauntlet chest let's open these master clues we've got the ball sack muscle number two 410k and master clue number three or the pinned comments download call for free [Music] i thought wait did someone just die with their pet and it's like walking around how is this chompy chick just walking around without a daddy hello hello i got an armor seed this is the first drop i've gotten since the last video so we can pog off i guess chess number 1225 oh and elite clue i have a master in my inventory i have an elite clue in my inventory and i have an elite clue stored at watson so it's time to do three master clues can i get another ornament kit like the one i have here i lock in a lot of items now if i get the untradeable

cool let's see what's in the chest after this person opens there's because i'm patient oh it's cake never mind let's see what's in the chest oh got an armored seat let's go right chest one two four five for the another honesty nice all right chest all right chip all right oh my god all right check oh my god oh my god all right check fire chest number one two five one hey an arma seed one two six seven that is my fifth crystal armor seed in a very short period of time speaking of time it was not of the essence my bingo event starts in one day despite not getting the enhanced crystal weapon seed i was spooned a load of armor seeds which means my bank value is now 210 mil it's time for the seasonal scuff unit bingo i have a lot of ground to make up because on the last bingo i let my team down pretty bad and i didn't really get any points here's how the bingo is going to work there are three teams each team has 11 members i will be the captain for one of the three teams this is the bingo board it has 24 tiles if a team completes a tile first they receive a gold medal second will receive silver and for third bronze each medal represents a number of points gold three silver two bronze one whoever gets the most points at the end of the week wins the bingo the bingo also has a prize pool of a thousand dollars without again to core for sponsoring this video i've done a few of these bingos before but i never really bothered to make them into content i want to give a quick shout out to mr mammal he released a bingo video earlier in the year and it's inspired me to do the same thing do all the uh captains wanna wanna grab a table and everyone else stand in the middle there sweet so that's the complex table the wedges table and the eyed fat table should we just get straight into it complex yeah you are the first person yeah i will pick jake campbell isn't he here no he's getting his [ __ ] head tonight i finally have my team sorted that i'm preparing for tomorrow's bingo my team is called the democratic people's republic of kanderin and we are up against the mystillin mad dogs and they drain or drunkards let's get this [ __ ] started ready okay a few other people have the same strat as me i pre-loaded a gauntlet chest in hopes of getting the crystal armor seed as that is a tile quick get that arma seed come on someone please please [Music] we boo an entire day one plan it was to pre-load gauntlet chess i hope to get an arma seed telly to darkmeyer straight away in hopes of getting a bloodshot and stacking up some thieving experience for the skilling tile oops i just oh my god i just spawn a [ __ ] skeleton within 45 minutes of thieving violence my teammate myth secured us gold for the bloodshot title we were massing thieving with nine men but we sent our tenth to go to top and he managed to snag us on the vernick defender hill which is also gold in the top tile okay the mad dogs have got themselves a berserker ring this clan call-out system is so good for events like this i went back to gauntlet as there was a gold tile up for grabs for the crystal armor seed mr the mad dogs managed to get themselves a zenite shard and two rings at dk's so they were making up some ground the mad dogs cannot be starved look at these cringe lords they bark when they get a drop i reckon they just called themselves mad dogs so that i have to say mad dogs in a video [Music] no way no oh my god what is happening we're in the first hour and towels just got a [ __ ] skilling pet okay so the draenor drunkers were a bit quiet at first but they went for a big brain strap to get all the skilling tiles done off the bat they also managed to snag a skilling pet too which is absolutely huge for them because they're so rare the draenor drunkards managed to snag three goals in quick succession which means things were all even hold on let's open the chest first come on something good oh 11 minutes and 12 don't want to talk about it come on let me free yes this is actually huge because now we are one gold ahead of the draenor drunkards let's go there are no more gauntlet tiles left for the bingo so it's finally time for me to leave as it stands my team are just about in the lead and it was time for me to do something else i don't know what to do now i'm so lost without the gauntlet my bank value is just above 245 mil maybe i can buy some decent slayer gear as i was gearing up for slayer my teammate myth managed to bag us the dragon limbs this was a gold medal title and it put us in a pretty clear lead oh jeff got a jar let's go let's go he said he felt like hey a black demon task the zenith shot will be silver and draenor drunkards haven't gone for this yet and it's all about really stopping them from getting silvers and golds at this point have a kitkat okay for that no i'm not having a break yes let's go um alison i'm putting that in the video aviance's task this is big because there's three tiles i could potentially do here any god wars hill any pvm pet and also any armadillo piece we are not allowed to use any dps alts for this competition so this is kind of going to take a while and i'm going to use a lot of black chins hopefully i get something to recover the cost of the chins at least oh my god yes let's go this is a huge win for kander in oh my diddly smork all right this is the task over very successful task getting that hilt gold medal is going to be huge for the team at this point we had a clear lead of two gold medals however my team had received information that the team in second place were working on five different skilling tiles and were close to redeeming gold medals in all of them oh [ __ ] it's past midnight which means it's technically the end of day one team mystery mad dogs were in third place with one gold medal as they were too busy sniffing each other's asses the draenor drunkards had four gold medals they had a skilling pet three skilling tiles and a silver in the bloodshard and my team were in first place we had an array of pvm gold tiles and a couple skilling tiles here is a metal breakdown of the end of day one it was time to put the coffee on and no life some pvm knowing that when the drain or drunkards wake up from their slumber they will be able to redeem a load of skilling tiles i had to hope on getting some late night rng to get a real true distance between us and them so if you get beans right can you it's my favorite meal you're an idiot i hate the way you speak like solid things yeah i was gonna say you're like and tinky winky put together that's what i'm going for oh i hate myself [Laughter] i just got a long bone from spider no i just died at venonatus and i lost my bull walk because i wasn't praying i got smited this can't be asked man it's stupid the lack of sleep was getting to me dead man was over the wilderness was full oh and there we go oh nice game on man it's game on i've learned a trick or two from solo mission i've been a bit of a sly bugger i've just told my uh my friends on discord that i'm going to bed but in actual fact i'm going to go off to dks and try and get a lord of the ring set as that is a tile still up for grabs i think if they knew that i was going they might have sent one of their team members to go and get the rings too so i'm kind of doing this under the radar here's a live clip of me dismantling a crossbow and not even realizing that when you dismantle it you get ether and the ether that you get is nowhere near the amount worth of a crossbow no way have i just lost 16 mil no i think i just degraded my i didn't know it turned into ether oh god okay i'm ready for dks my gear is horrible i still don't have my inferno kick back i'm trying to get a zuck task and then when i finally get that i will be able to wear my cape again but i don't fancy doing it off task it's kind of a waste of time in regards to the bingo let's [ __ ] go no way no way oh my god i don't know this is good or bad because no one's claimed a pvm pair in the bingo so i've just got a gold medal but i also just got a pet which means i could lose i could lose everything securing this tile was absolutely huge for my team however it could be very detrimental for me here are the current tiles that play for the in depth for a pet series obviously i can't switch accounts because of a bingo so i'm going to swap that out for steak bank again i think it's safe to say and to confirm that the dual arena will be removed in the long term usually when i get a pet i would just straight up stake my whole bank jagex intend to remove the dual arena so i'm going to mix things up as well i'll be keeping the forfeits that these tiles hold a secret because some of them may involve risky content where i could get stream sniped well i just got a pet and i figured this would be the best way to see what tile i land on oh my god is that is that a real-life pet did you stake your paypal for it [ __ ] okay i think i am ready i have 11k left in my bank i don't know where it is oh i'm an idiot it's the polar camo legs okay um that's absolutely everything worth a value out of my bank the untradeables i get to keep this time round are the full crystal armor set as i attained all of the crystal armor seats myself and obviously the amulet of torture ornament kit that i managed to snag from a master clue i really do be in that for a pet this time around because i didn't manage to get this avernick defender hilt myself which means it's gone that kind of hurts but i have to resource it myself if i want to keep it no inferno cape this time round i didn't manage to get it i've only been doing gauntlet so i haven't needed it but hopefully i can get a win and then go get my inferno k back all right room pouch and the bin i've done no lms i should have probably secured this a while ago but whatever okay i'm finally ready to go i just exchanged a load of marks of grace for amylase and the bank stake will be 161 mil is my guy really trying to scare me out of 356 gp come on front the cash i want a steak the bingo is saved and i'm rich man i just doubled my bank and i can't even spend any of it because i got to do the agility tile doing rooftops with 400 million your invent yeah just killing which would give you time to give up i'm ready to give up but i'm here already i love this about bingo because it's been one day and everyone's like gg gg yeah all right agility tiles secured we got silver in that one now time to finish off the dk's task i have 112 to go i managed to catch a short sleeve and i'm ready to game for the rest of the day oh no i've got every single ring apart from the one we actually need just need the arches ring and then we've got this tile done okay i've just teleported out because my teammate has just secured us the arches ring we're now done at dk's managed to get silver in this one but it's a pretty important silver because the team in third place got the gold we had half of our team left on the skilling tiles to try and wrap up silvers in those and then it was my job to try and get some of the rng tiles finished there weren't that many left the big rng tiles that i was going to go for were the carol skirt any wilderness ring volcano tool seed any jar cox unique and a nightmare unique yes [ __ ] the democratic people's republic of canada are still first but team drain or drunkards are really catching up now this morning alone they managed to complete the fishing tile the mining tile they got a hilter armadill a crystal armor seed all zoro uniques completed and a silver medal in agility in my team are able to spoon a cox unique and get this crystal tool seed we have a really big chance of winning the bingo the crystal tool seed is a one in 200 drop from volcano it should be easier to get than the small kano the volcano shot and the onyx we split our team up into two half of us went to volcano and the other half did chambers of zarek um chaps could i just have your attention please fruit salad yummy yummy fruit salad in my tummy fruit salad [ __ ] love me i've just been doing this for six hours i've died like five times i didn't realize there was a room like plug-in that tells you where everything's gonna hurt you opie a hundred kc at the volcano you're excited about the family [Applause] this was an absolute huge win for my team as it secured us a silver in the skilling pet and it was very unlikely that anyone else was to get a pet do you know what i think it's that time gamers [Music] it is [ __ ] i really really want to punch myself in the tip oh right who's coming next one [Music] the clock has struck midnight which means it's the end of day three [Music] things are really close there's only one silver medal between my team and the team in second place as for third place mr lim mad dogs [Laughter] we were slowly burning out of zolcano but if any team was able to nab this crystal tool seed they had a pretty good chance of winning why's penn put like the most depressing message he's defeated me good luck lads remember there are bigger sacrifices one might be asked to make than going in he's having an accident all right we've been here 12 hours people are saying good night we're losing team members i'm gonna try and stay up for as long as i can and get this tool seed come on i got second volcano [ __ ] pet oh no way why why how am i getting so many pets i can't believe this why am i getting so many pets good good morning i think it's morning it's 5am i have been at volcano for the last 16 hours and none of us have seen a tour seed but i just got my second pet during this bingo event again i really can't get clean so hopefully i land on the tile that's not so detrimental for my account good morning it is time yet again to roll the dice i'm hoping to not have to stake my bank again this is the pet roll for volcano pet let's see what we land on can you move out the way bro that's it it was three if you can't do that you can't change it brother it was three tile number three is steel bank i'm really happy about this because this means i get more i'm playing my other account on the side and building up some gp for this moment [Music] [Music] okay so on this account in the past few weeks i've been doing a load of blood rune crafting i've been trying to hunt down skilling pets on this account thankfully with runecraft i make a load of money despite not getting the pet okay sold the bank 41 mill which means 41 mil plus to my series account my bank value now sits at 437 million [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
