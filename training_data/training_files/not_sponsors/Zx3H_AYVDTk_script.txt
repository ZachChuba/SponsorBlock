Throught the course of human history, people have fought against and killed one other for some pretty stupid reasons. At least, it may seem that way from our sophisticated way of viewing things from the 21st century. There was the time that El Salvador invaded Honduras after a controversial football game. The time that the Austrian Army fought a battle with itself while drunk and countless times when one guy thought that his religion or way of ruling was better than anybody else's. Most wars in fact could probably be argued were fought for stupid reasons But in all of my personal reading I have never come across one as silly sounding as the War Of The Bucket which, yeah was an entire war where thousands of people died fighting over essentially a wooden bucket. The setting was Northern Italy during the late Middle Ages. Italy at the time was divided into various different city states and Northern Italy, in particular was part of the Holy Roman Empire and so the states here were mostly independent but technically under the legions of the Holy Roman Emperor back in Germany. And since people like arguing about literally anything, a conflict arose in Northern Italian states between who had more authority. the Holy Roman Emperor or the Pope. In 1176, the Holy Roman Emperor invaded Italy and was defeated by a bunch of city states brought together by the Pope. Over the next couple centuries different states shifted around allegiances but by the 14th century Modena was with team Roman Emperor and Bologna was with Team Pope. In 1296 Bologna invaded a couple of territories from Modena which their buddy at the Papacy confirmed to be legitimate.
