-Yes you can! Like this, like this. [Music] -What are you doing?
-Oh my god, it's working! [Music] Anything! Hey, I dare you to pick up those buildings. *ringtone* Oh, hey, grandma. Wait, you're in the city!? Put it back, put it back, put it ba! Get out of the way! Don't mess with him, man. [Music] He's so tiny! [Music] [Music]
*tiny beeping* [Music] *chomp* [Music] -What are you gonna do now? You picked up everything. -There's still one thing I hadn't picked up. [Music] What? Is that the chopstick guy? That's disgusting. Music: [Chicken Choppers] - Push N' Glide
