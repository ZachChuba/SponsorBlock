these are the heart of your system PCI Express generation for nvme SSDs ever launched during Rison 3000 launched during Computex this year and I always asked myself the question is this product really the reason to justify X 570 because we already know from previous testing that generation for PCI Express is not really a reason to have for graphics cards we know that with the Navy GPUs generation 4 is not really utilized the 2080 ti doesn't even use generation 4 and we even know that if we use generation 3 with 8 lanes for a 20 80 TI it's still fine in most of the cases that's why generation 4 for GPUs is not really a reason for me to justify X 570 because you might already have let's say X 470 and you're maybe considering to get a 12 core or 16 horizon CPU and then you will maybe also think should I also upgrade to X 570 and the biggest reason besides having maybe bit better memory compatibility and also a better vrm could be PCI Express Gen 4 now we have those n BM e drives with generation 4 which were announced and also shown during compute X this year I have the eros generation 4 and also the Corsair MP 600 generation 4 nbme drives right here which I tested over the last days and the results are kind of interesting we will compare benchmarks we will do some real-world testing like just copying files Adobe Premiere also some testing when it comes to temperatures and also game loading times first of all it doesn't really matter if you're getting an arrows nvme Drive or if you're getting an MP 600 from Corsair both of them are using the thousand PS 5 0 1 6 e 16 nvm e controller and as far as I know this is still the only nvme controller on the market that is using generation 4 protocol and that's what you need obviously to get the most out of PC Express Gen 4 still those controllers are faster than what we had previously with generation 3 but they're not utilizing generation 4 completely if we take a look at the datasheet of the facin controller it's capable of reading 5,000 megabytes per second and also writing 4,400 megabytes per second while the load or power consumption should be around 6 what considering that PCI Express Gen 4 should give us up to about 7.5 gigabyte per second this is still not utilizing the full bandwidth of Gen 4 but also if we just let you take a look at those raw numbers those are sequential read and write numbers and they don't really reflect real-world performance still I did some crystal disk mark numbers to just show if the numbers the vendors are stating online are correct so the first test was crystal dis Mike sequential read and write the Aros SSD did 5014 megabyte per second read 4285 megabyte per second write the MP 600 did just about 5,000 megabyte per second read and 4200 67th megabyte write the 960 Evo which is still a generation 3 nbme drive did 3184 megabyte per second read and 1539 megabyte per second right then I also added an MX 500 from crucial to the test which is just a typical satirize that was laying around here just to get some comparison numbers that SATA drive was doing 550 megabyte per second read 465 megabyte per second right so just looking at the numbers everything comparing the read and write data of the fighting controller and also what's the vendor's arrows and coarser are stating on line is just in line everything is correct but those numbers sequential read write don't really tell us much they don't really help much because typically you don't reach those numbers right that's why the first test is a typical copy just files test I took one of the videos which I'm just shooting right now put everything into one folder it typically consists about 15 video files and we have some screenshots in there maybe have screenshots and some notes the peak files from Adobe Premiere so total files maybe like 3040 files and then just copying this folder to the same drive the MP 600 takes 26 seconds same as the arrows drive followed by the 960 Evo which was much slower than I expected it was 117 seconds followed by the MX 500 with 287 seconds we can already see that just by the copy test the generation 4 nbme drives are much quicker than generation 3 but you also have to keep in mind that I was using the smaller version from Samsung from 960 Evo with only 250 gigabyte if we would use the one terabyte drive it would have a higher read and write rate so it would be a little bit quicker now the next test is taking this specific folder with all the video files and loading it into Adobe Premiere that's what typically takes most that's really disk related when you're opening or when you're working with video files because if you're just editing the video if you're cutting the files it's not really disk related or not really this dependent that's not much you can test also the rendering it's not really disc dependent loading the files took 49 seconds with the orals SSD and 50 seconds with the MP 600 took 55 seconds with the 960 Evo and 73 seconds with the MX 500 you can see there's a clear benefit going from a SATA Drive to an MDOT to nvme Drive considering that I was using only the 250 gigabyte version of the 964 it was a little bit slower than the 1 terabyte drives generation 4 but I think if we would maybe use the 1 terabyte version from Samsung the results would be really close together I think it would be 50 seconds for a generation 4 and maybe 53 seconds for generation 3 so there's not really a big difference now going over to game loading times first test is pop G which is kind of interesting because no matter which SSD I used to install the game on the result was exactly the same was about 14 seconds there is really no difference here I did every test three times and always used the average of each single test to make sure there is not really like a measurement tolerance or just to lower the measurement tolerance you can see everything is exactly the same so for pop G it really does not matter if you're using an nvme drive generation for just a SATA Drive there will be no benefit next test a shadow of the Tomb Raider both generation for nvm II drives took 8 seconds to load into a game state while the 960 Evo took 10 seconds and the crucial em X 500 to 11 seconds almost no difference I think if we were if we would use the bigger 960 Evo it would probably be the same as the generation 4 drives and the SATA Drive was expected to be a bit slower but I think if you're just sitting there in reality not gonna lose much time now we're getting over to the interesting testing because we already know by just looking at the data sheet that generation 4 nvme drives consume more than generation 3 nvme drives and obviously also more than the typical SATA drives that's why we have those massive heat sinks on those drives and the question is how good are those heat sinks are they necessary and what happens if we really put those and BME drives under load that's why I decided to run the crystal disk mic 30 times in a row and the result was mind-blowing it was was much worse than I expected looking at the MP 600 the peak temperature was 88 degrees Celsius after 30 runs which resulted in the drive throttling down to about 2.3 gigabyte per second while right was about one gigabyte per second so we're losing over half of the performance in reach and over four times the performance in right because the drive is getting so hot this condition was on my x5 70 hours pro from gigabyte in the top slot using an AI oh and no air flow it's just sitting on my table I have no air flow that's really the worst case scenario scenario that's basically what we did when we were comparing those VRM numbers back in like X to 99 vrm disaster video that's really first case that sample it's something you typically don't have or you should avoid but that's what could happen if you're using a case with zero air flow and if you're putting your drive in a bad location the arrows Drive was even more interesting because it hit 78 degree Celsius and the result at 78 degree Celsius is that the drive simply stops working it stops and goes down 2-0 megabyte per second in Reed and also in right it's funny that crystal disk Mike just keeps testing but nothing happens if you check in Harbor info there is there is ZERO speed on read and write the drive basically stops working and we have to reboot the system to get it back to work as I said before that's really worst case scenario then I thought okay that might be related to generation 4 drives and maybe that's because of the higher power consumption then went over to test the 960 Evo and then the result was even worse the drive hit 101 degree Celsius under load which resulted in throttling to 670 megabyte per second read 187 megabyte per second right so we're down to like 10 per second in right 10% in right and down to like 20% in read the throttling was insane then I thought okay the 960 Evo doesn't have any kind of heatsink on there so there's zero heat capacity or zero mass where the heat can go to that's why I decided to use those plates you know in nowadays main words most of the more expensive ones or premium ports they always have those endo 2 shields heat sinks whatever you want to call it and I always thought most of them are only for visuals they only look good they're going to hide your drive and in real world they're probably not doing much but that's wrong because when I put it on my 960 evil you can see after 30 times running crystal disk mark peak temperature was 10 degree lower and the drive was almost working fine it was a 2.9 gigabyte per second read and 1.4 gigabyte per second right which is almost the same as when it was running colder it was about 3.1 gigabyte per second read and 1.5 gb by per second bright which means there is a sec if you can't improvement using one of those shields and that's not because they have a lot of surface area because they don't it's simply because they have mass and they can compensate the sudden load on the drive and that's also what makes this cooler really good on the arrow strife because it's made out of solid copper you can really feel that this thing is extremely heavy and now you can maybe think about going back to the game loading test of Tomb Raider where it took about eight seconds to load the game then you have eight seconds of load onto your drive which means that your heatsink will maybe increase by I don't know three or four degrees Celsius and then you're in game and in game the load is extremely low on the drive and then your heatsink has enough time to dissipate the heat over the surface area of your drive again the crystal disk mark running a 30 times test is really the worst case scenario when you put your drive in a bad location or if there is no air flow inside your case for the x5 70 RS Pro for example it would make sense to use your to use the bottom slot which is sitting underneath the GPU and then you might think eh if I'm gaming my GPU core temperature is hitting maybe like 70 degrees Celsius which means that the cooler has a temperature of I don't know like 60 degree Celsius and then your air has maybe 55 degrees Celsius coming out from the side of your cooler therefore you may be think that the cooler is heating up your drive but even 55 degree Celsius hot air would still be capable of cooling your SATA drive underneath because otherwise you can see it's hitting like I don't know 90 up to 100 degree cells if you're using an nvme drive make sure that you use the correct location sometimes you cannot really choose the location on some boards you only have one generation for nbme slot and therefore if there's not much you can do in that case yeah you can just improve the thermals inside your case maybe yeah adjust your airflow but make sure that you really have some airflow across those drives especially if you're I don't know doing some professional work if you have a lot of read and writes over your drive then those things are becoming really really hot the question in the end is is a generation 4 vme Drive really worth it in my opinion it's not considering the price one of those drives is about 250 euro here in Germany and if we take a look at for example 970 Eva which is generation 3 it's about 170 euro and in the real world scenario for example the copy test it's maybe a bit slower but for gaming I don't really see that there is a big difference so justifying x5 70 for generation 4 to have a generation 4 nvme trice I wouldn't really do it I don't think that the money you spend on the drives is really worth the benefit unless you have a special I don't know occasion special thing program you can use to utilize your drives all the time then it's may be worth it but then you also have to make sure that your drives are really getting cooled otherwise stick to generation 3 drives they're much cheaper and you don't or you're not going to feel any difference and for some or most of the scenarios even a SATA Drive will still be fine nowadays so much about this video was a bit unexpected I didn't think that those drives are getting so warm and yeah I also learned that those shields are really helping let me know what you expected see you soon [Music] [Music]
