and David's teammate Jonathan laughs Jonathan was awarded an OBE in 2005 which just goes to show how hard it is to take back an over here exotic pets including an iguana brightly colored with soft leathery skin and a bulging neck : is one of the most distinctive faces well very funny Jimmy but the iguanas dead a new way is Dave as a joke are a terrible person iguana went with Dave iguana okay Jonathan have got a mascot that one I thought I was grabbing today I thought I grabbed the wrong mascot I was gonna grab my mother-in-law knitted for me know action boil the mighty item the Japanese character who invented by the great Osamu Tezuka she knitted it for me and she had a little voice box inside it's got a Japanese one with the same message to me in Japanese I think it says because it's my mother-in-law keep your hands off my daughter's vagina and I love this which was a much-loved pirate I had as a as a youngster captain scurvy I liked him he did have an eye patches well what's awful if the eyepatch has been pulled off to reveal nothing underneath it expect it to be at least a socket what they would so in an empty socket well on a children's toy yes they've given him a wooden leg I bought a mascot elbow something quite whereas know I'm a collector I collect comic books love of know that and I also collect toys that particular frame of reference Japanese toys from the 1960s and 1970s in particular the toys from the company's bulimic poppy Gaga keen and Takara are also a part-time snooker referee very valuable item um bring it out for and I'm showing it the respect it deserves if I can get my glove okay so this is a toccata meet Gordo man from 1970 Oh is about 50 years out to his hips are as strong as they usually okay and these come from it my core domain which we pronounce my Kwame oh these are the original ones and what I love about them either incredibly great choice they're beautiful looking at the toy but when they book them out they blow out about ten in the first one so the Japanese company gave them all names can guess what this one's name was Jeff because he looks like he's juggling blue bags and he's coming out the airport and his taxis not arrived do have a mascot well at the moment I am home alone my wife has not been with me for over two weeks now my wife and daughter because she's at Toronto my daughter's doing some work experience and she's still out there and work experience around so yes I did it quick fit some great experiences some things are planned some aren't and obviously I've been drinking more than I usually would just to take away the sting of loneliness a week ago I came home and was a box in the hall web had been delivered during the day while I was there I thought I don't know what this is and I started opening it out got out of the box and it's only when I got it out I realized it was the night I was watching Kill Bill at home this is true what should kill but on my own and after it finished and I decided I had to have the samurai sword from Kill Bill what was waiting for either go home and it's so shot I'm not allowed to get it out in the studio really yeah its proper shop all I've used it so far he's cutting up apples in the kitchen cuz that's where we keep the knife in the garden and pretend I'm King Arthur I bought a mascot in this isn't the mascot an active fact this is to demonstrate the mascot I should explain why I have this item with me because hopefully it's gonna bring me not just this evening but in the future is that we're we decorating our house at the moment because all my children have left home on that age now and when their kids leave they take a lot of this stuff but they didn't take any of their pets ok so we've now got something like we've got seven dogs we've got five cats we've got two snakes we've got one pig and a little fish and the cats have got territorial with each other and while I'm he's pissin everywhere he's just pissin it he's spraying all over the place it's clearly a protest he even got on the duvet and pissed on the duvet while I was in the bed the other night and then he went around the corner and he lifted it up and he pissed directly into an unused plug and fused the power on the whole phone it was smoke was coming out behind him I was kind of hoping the electricity would go up the stream of piss and kill the little psychologists in called a man and she said know what the problem is your cat's pissing everywhere that was a bad so my wife went online is she found there's another possible solution to that which I brought with me and this is my good luck car things it's a cat napping see these of course I have I'm wearing one right now the thing is is this a genuine thing can buy yes it is but the
