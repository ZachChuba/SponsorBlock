z-star the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video on my channel again about Rison 3000 boosts clock again some people might be saying I'm beating to that cow but still this seems to be an issue that's still existing I just read a news on a German media website PC games hardware that apparently AMD added a disclaimer to the product website stating that the AMD CPUs or the rising few thousand CPUs might not reach the boost clock under all conditions or they're only reaching it in nominal operation whatever that means obviously it's not clearly defined in which state the CPU is rece reaching the advertised and singer core boost and you know what I'm doing videos when I'm just testing my own stuff there is always a certain risk to those testing things I'm just testing one specific mainboard one specific CPU and then showing you the results but there's always the risk that for example this individual mainboard has a problem with a BIOS version or the CPU itself or there might be something I did wrong with the windows or I don't know so there's always a certain risk when I'm testing something and I'm experiencing something that's not cool and then I'm reporting it to you obviously if I find something I'm always talking to like other youtubers other reviewers I'm talking to vendors like Asus gigabyte MSI I'm just checking what they experienced and for the Rison 3000 boost it really still seems to be unclear what the current situation is some people are saying it's fine some people are saying it's not and in my opinion what we should do is just test it all together that means I will need your help everybody who is owning rice in a 3000 out there and watching my videos I will really need your help because now we all have to test and I will need your data and then we will see which CPUs are actually reaching the advertised boost clocks and if they're not reaching what kind of boost can we really expect in reality before we start with the testing please make sure that you're running the latest Windows version run all available Windows updates also make sure that you're running the latest AMD chipset driver you can find all necessary downloads in the Google Form which is linked down below that's also where you can find the link for Cinebench r15 if you don't have it yet and for hardware info because those are the tools you will need to participate in this video after you downloaded everything after you have set up your windows and trips a driver correctly also make sure that you're running the system default in BIOS make sure you're not running any OC settings manually like no core voltage no PBO precision boost overdrive make sure you don't touch anything in the BIOS ideally you go to the BIOS and run the optimized defaults to make sure everything is running by default and we are not manipulating the boost in any way once you did all that once you're in Windows you downloaded Cinebench r15 and also hardware info if you run hardware info make sure that you check the box of running sensors only because we don't need the additional tools of hardware info running the sensors we go to configure sensor and we adjust the period where the sensors are refreshing to 500 milliseconds so it's refreshing twice per second and also adjust the smart to ten cycles so it's not refreshing that often for layout we can disable unnecessary monitoring or unnecessary sensors for example you can see I only enables the clocks and only enabled the temperature which is CPU t die down here that's the only thing I enabled everything else memory timings you just check the monitoring down here for example mainboard VGA all the SSD stuff like smart dim temperature just make sure you disable everything that's unnecessary because we want to make sure there there's nothing in the background that could influence the sensors or the boost in any way also make sure you're disabling every app that's running in the background for example even if it's steam even if it's chrome CPU Z just close everything make sure only hardware info and Cinebench r15 are running to access the single core test in simulation 15 go to file advanced benchmark enable that and then we will have the option for the single core tests now there's also this option down here that's small you can see on hardware info if you click this clock it will reset the monitoring that's one important thing which we will need so to start the measurement and testing runs in the bench signal once it starts running reset the test again or reset the hardware info monitoring because we want to see the maximum boost during the benchmark everything else doesn't matter I mean if the CPU is boosting to 5 gigahertz in Windows Idol nobody cares because we will need the clock under load and we want to know what kind of boost we can expect from those CPUs now we have to wait a little bit until the test is almost over and then we will be back so far the maximum boost from ICP was 4500 16 megahertz just wait until the test is almost over and then we will write down what the maximum boost was which we had with this specific setup or CPU you can also run it maybe 2 or 3 times to make sure that the measurement is accurate but for me I will write down 4500 16 which should be 4525 most of the CPUs are running a lower bit clock than 100 they are running ninety-nine point eight multiplied with 45 point two five will equal in 1525 megahertz now that the test is over please open cpu-z what we will need is the name of your main board for example in my case it's the x5 70 RS pro from gigabyte and down here in the bios area you can find what kind of ISA you're using in my case I'm using 1 0 0 3 a BB the a BB part is actually missing down there but if you're not sure what kind of agiza you're using just check what kind of BIOS you're using go to the vendor website for example if I go to gigabyte website and check the area of the BIOS downloads I can find that f4 I in my case is 1 0 0 3 a BB now you go back to the Google Form and simply enter what you tested in my case I tested the rise in 930 900 X which is just mark down here could be for example for you to 3,700 X now I enter what kind of mainboard I was using from ESX 570 hours Pro AG is a version in my wish in my case it was one zero zero three ABB now you can select the maximum boost in my case it was 45 25 megahertz you can just select whatever you tested depending on your CPU and if you have any kind of comment a comment if you experienced a strange behavior if you weren't sure about your agiza version or if you just want to leave a nice comment you can enter it down there then you submit and I will have your response please make sure that you share this please make sure that if you have a friend who is owning a Verizon 3000 please also ask him to run this test the more data we can collect the better I think if we managed maybe get over 100 or even a thousand results that would be amazing because then we can for example compare main boards with specific agiza versions with specific CPUs and check what kind of boost is really expected in reality maybe the majority even hits that it has boost clock and maybe my testing is just for some reason wrong so yeah that would be really amazing if you can participate and help me out with this Google form and horizon boost clock survey thank you so much for participating thank you so much for helping out in this case see you soon [Music] [Music] you
