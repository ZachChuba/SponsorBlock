all right jack it's time for some classic battlefield strats here we're gonna do the old c4 drone oh nice is it just the same button again to explode it yeah you just double tap or you press a again you can pick it up sorry there you go okay just tell me when okay he's just killed someone right get ready okay get ready three two one that was amazing what celebrity do you think this looks like the most there is a correct answer oh god i have no idea i don't know angelina jolie no look at the face where else do you think i'm looking it's angelina jolie she has the body to me it looks like emma watson oh it would yeah i don't know what to do with a sword should be a wand she's taking the dark arts quite literally you guys were studying the dark arts i was studying the blade all right let's go for the one further back your primary objective is to kill everybody seems legit i mean yeah like oh i've had to come in and make friends with everybody oh he spotted someone on the roof so you shooting no it's him he's he's just getting mad kills and stuck in rose decks decks please i'll help him all right there we go i like west decks me too he got killed immediately he seems like a nice guy careful they will destroy you i'm actually scared of him you know right yeah the tiny little movement yeah any little wobble at the end of it you're dead what is he doing he's so tactical he's got gold sniper rifle on the gold m4 look at this look at this guy oh god where's dex leave some kills for the rest of us okay he's looking very blinged out there oh a jeep oh they're all dead oh did you do that i fired one rocket at them and they all exploded go behind us oh let's go get him he's not exactly we're the schoolyard bullies after all so we might as well stick his head in the toilet ow oh his friends to the right trying to cover you time's up objective failed he's very low if you want to push him you feel brave that didn't hit him nice we're good we're good look at this truck i mean i kind of want it i where's that in the store so it's a waifu truck yeah we gotta go the zone's coming you want to go to that frankie and benny's over there and go to the shop do they have a greg's around i don't think they have a greg's i'm a sausage roll okay is greg's open yet location mark i don't think so even mcdonald's isn't open i haven't had mcdonald's for like three months maybe yeah i feel sad inside oh there's someone playing in did you see where they went they went that way oh yeah they're there going into the green building nice he's trying to crawl back in see if he can get him he's out of sight now that was close hitting his friend friends in there in the store yep okay let's see if we can do one of these oh you're gonna send the rpg in there oh i didn't realize that it just travels forever yeah it's a bit unpredictable sometimes it goes up down straight you just never know dude yeah my battlefield brain is like okay so you've got to aim quite high up to hit this rpg shot yeah and then it just goes upwards and you're like what happened yeah it went into this top story window hey i got him what do you want uav popped hey i got it as well um goddamn pop it now there's another one on that roof you don't have an air id no okay for someone else just air strike their building then guys back to our north oh yeah maybe in the hospital i hate that hospital okay c4 you got it yeah right nice we got to move in a bit for the zone if we go underneath their building hopefully they don't hear us yeah that might be the play you know they're probably not even there anymore oh sure they are oh they're getting sprayed you're nearly done okay right i don't trust this here we go oh here's him get some c4 on that bad boy have you got two or one uh two yeah put the other one on there go all right get ready get ready wait wait wait for it wait for it wait for it okay no no no no no right that's one down right there's another two up there yeah i say we just we just kill here whoa guys on this hill oh right next to us no shield i've got a hill in the building god damn in the building yeah they shot our guy out through the window down get him watch out watch out this is the small i think team life we're good we're good uh next to the tree next to the tree yeah those are the guys i was shooting all right next is up here for us he's right there behind that tree okay we can do this we can do this there's not many left alive that guy has to move though behind that rock yeah he's shooting up with the guys on the roof no armor okay right so the last team are above us it's us versus them i have more c4 you do oh damn it i don't have a drone all right they're gonna have to drop down oh one down i'm down let's jump down nice i'll rest i think there's one more up there yes foreign oh that was awesome that was a great game man it's my first ever win of war zone hey trying to help this guy out there we go right we are clear and we can buy you back if we need to go be 400 bucks here somewhere find an atm somewhere hopefully you're not overdrawn for the day that reminds me of uh being at university yeah that's exactly where my brain was nice have they got cash i doubt it damn it what i was going to show you earlier was if you aim you can then peek the door and then if you slowly push forward you can be super tactical so you could like throw a flashbang through or make like a really dirty angle that you could shoot through it's a snapshot grenade you throw it into a room and it like if there's anyone nearby tags people through walls like for a split second like a little wall hack that sounds very tactical i want to go with that it's super tactical i'm sure it's not a real thing either no it has to be it's in call of duty enemies in the area we don't put fake things in this one see if my tactical grenade was over there now you'd be able to spot them i mean boopy doopy you know what to do come here oh yes come on it's happening my favorite time of day [Applause] did they shoot it put that rpg down yeah they had a fight down there there's a couple of bodies they have to run towards us two down i'm going over behind you well played your guy's australian i didn't even realize i mean if he wants to go and get that he can it might be in the gas scene mate i wouldn't he's going for it might be nibbling on your toes in a minute i think that's a bit dangerous oh sniper he ruined me man i'm just a bit cautious because the gas is coming in and there's also people up here yeah got him nice job is it just one dude no i need body armor oh voicey come on oh my god am i actually going to make it in yeah you'll be all right you'll be all right oh someone else is shooting at you keep coming to me keep coming to me i'm just gonna have to go for it i think don't worry you'll make it i have a gas mask i'm good keep running keep running you're okay god damn no way okay okay watch out because i think there's someone around here oh that one was tight oh man look where the circle's going dude what is that oh god that's just the edge of the map man we need to get there now i think we could buy um oh three guys in herpe right in front of me okay you could come back or voice yeah you could both buy some armor plates if you come back or do you want to keep moving no i want to buy armor plates i'm gonna get melted all right are they on that roof i don't know could you drop me a cash and i'll buy some some more thank you yeah this is going to be rough yeah so do you want to swing right yeah they're they're in the building on the left oh my god i hate this i hate this yeah this sucks we're gonna get shot any second all right we're good we're good we're good what a bullet i just heard hitting hidden ears oh probably it was downed good job so they're going to be behind us on the left oh another one to the left there's more guys to the left broke armor we're in the zone here don't see those targets oh they just murdered him there's a guy here down another one i'm gonna try and flank here right here right here dead there's seven people left somewhere keep forgetting that they have voice comes oh you keep hearing them yeah i just heard what i'm in got him right here crack him dead nice oh man everyone's gonna know where we are yeah we're okay we're okay i say we kite this circle up through this play it real slow let's move out oh 2v3 v2 he kills you one ten eight dude we got this we got this keep this low ground here because there's a nice bit of cover here anything on her beach no okay are they fighting each other yeah there's yeah i can hear them shooting there's a little ridge here we could play i like this it could be right in front of us there that's outside the combat area one down okay so the other team are probably behind them then yeah let's push so we got yeah yeah i guess oh now go now got one dead who's left 2b2 oh i see one down oh we did it oh hell yeah yeah god damn that was a great game oh my god that ending was nonstop
