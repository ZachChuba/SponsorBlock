project pinky in color starring Nick blackest also starring Richard running and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tonight's episode our blast from the past [Music] coming up in episode 29 we get gifted an automatic coffee maker in order to save some time and hurry up the build [Music] [Music] in the previous episode we'd taken on the task of fixing the panel gaps we fitted the scene trims after a little modification obviously and then stripped the entire shell apart ready to take to the body shop [Music] many of might have thought that stripping the shell down for paint was the last of the disassembly but not for the first time you'd be wrong we've got to do something about this for a while now we've had the feeling that the general consensus in the group is that this rear subframe is Scabbia than a bat SAS and we've got to do something about its sharpish well you're right so let's nix donor salika was a JDM import and that means that there's no anti corrosion protection added from the factory save for the paint that's on all the components once JDM cars make it to the UK unless they have some serious remedial protection added the salted winter roads over here mean the state of the steel deteriorates dramatically to strip repaint and rebuild this complete assembly is a lot of work and expense so it was pointless to do this before we knew the project might work the downside of working under a scabby rusty old piece-of-crap for six years is that only have to breathe on any part of it and get completely showered in shape the big half-inch impact gun has made short work of all the seized up bolts on the subframe and the disassembly is going well it's clear from the sheer heftiness of the parts that make up this rear end that Toyota had rallying at the forefront of their minds when designing this thing everything is SPECT to perform and built to last just the fasteners alone weigh an astonishing five kilos that's a little over 11 American cope X well the unbolting was relatively painless bearing in mind the whole thing's been under a car for 30 years but that's the end of the easy bit before we can trip off to the powder coaters we've got to push out all the bearings all the bushes and we've got to stripped these driveshafts apart this drive shaft has been untouched since the car was built and retains its original boots and grease lots of grease lots and lots of grease when tackling this type of job it's a given that you're gonna get covered in shmoo so may as well just accept it as part of the process embrace it and crack on new cv joints are horrendous ly expensive so we're planning to clean these up inspect them and reuse them if there's no signs of wear new boots and grease will be added when they're reassembled the last job on the shaft is to engrave on the end which one of the four it is so we don't mix them up now can remove bushes and bearings with a vise and some hammers but to do the job properly need a big-ass hydraulic press knowing this job was coming up we splashed out eighty quid on a sleeve kit for removing bushes it's hard to overstate just how bloody awesome the kit turned out to be it's one of those tools that you'd use infrequently so it's hard to justify the expense but having used one now it's a game changer the rear subframe is a bit unwieldy so it takes two of us to push these bushes out a large impact socket is used to push the final part through that bush we just press tight was located inside a split sleeve but nothing except a 90 kilo gorilla with an air hammer would budge the rear upright has a fairly standard bush and two of these special mad spherical bearings we can't get to the back of it on the press so a different approach is needed to remove this one the final job on this strip down of the rear end is to remove the wheel bearings from the uprights starting with smacking the seals out then remove the big circuit that keeps the outer race in position then in two stages press the bearing out of the upright seriously without the press and the sleeve kit this job would have been significantly more difficult and the sign of the bearing hitting the floor marks the finish of the rear-end disassembly the front-end components are less numerous so it didn't take too long to pull this lot apart well that's that then off to the powder coaters we did a lot of research into places that do powder coating in Shropshire and one name kept cropping up the first stage of the powder coating process is to give everything a damn good clean up in the blast cabinet all that scabby rust and rubbish is swept away by special blasting media combined with very high pressure air what you're left with when complete is bare steel with the perfect key ready for the next stage while all that's going on the oven is warming up nicely bits of the components that don't want powder coating are masked off using some very expensive very high temperature tape this stuff is about 15 quid along our friend Andy who owns this place is finishing off the blasting of the crusty old subframe and there's already a massive improvement any threads or small holes that are in the parts are stopped up with a silicon plug now it's time for the first baking [Music] this is not some wellness inspired relaxing waterfall device no it's a machine to suck in the oversprayed powder and it's incredibly efficient with the parts up to temperature and he sprays on the first coat the etch primer the way this process works is that the gun applies an electrostatic charge to the powder which is sprayed towards the item being painted all of the components on the rack are grounded through this earth strap and the electrostatic charge literally pulls the powder onto the workpiece and then its back into the oven to melt into a uniform coating [Music] there are over 8,000 different colors and finishes to choose from ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything in between there's candies flat colors metallics with gloss or satin finishes so with myriad options what does Nick choose for the subframe and suspension parts a striking shade of grey the oven is up to 180 degrees Celsius or 350 six North American classics are light but after baking for a few minutes Andy drags the rack out and sprays on the color after applying the lovely and not at all boring gray to the suspension bits it's back in the oven again for the penultimate time while the parts bake the spray canister is filled with the final powder the lacquer it's white in powder form they'll quickly turn into a high gloss finish once it's applied to the hot parts then it's plaque in the oven for the final time for about 15 minutes or so we've brought a ton of bits so while that one is baking I'm blasting off some other parts while Nik has painstakingly masked off the uprights the baking is finished the layers of powder coating have become one and the parts are done the finish is brilliant and even the heavy pitting from corrosion is looking better but where the parts were in good Nick it's just outstanding and even let Nick loose with the spray gun he redid it all after we left obviously I told there was lots and that's not even half of it we'll be back to see Andy in the very near future because he does a lot more than just powder coating right now what we need to do is sort out a few sub assemblies before we can put the whole lot back together again and I think we'll start with the diff we're talking about the rear diff here obviously and we've blasted and painted it already I know there's nothing majorly wrong with this because I've driven it and even the backlash is more than acceptable for what is now a 30-year old death what we did notice was some oil we pitched past one of the oil seals and while we've got it here we might as well pull the whole thing apart and for a little bit of peace of mind change all three it was easier to blast and paint the diff with the unit complete as it's basically sealed to the elements so no contaminants could get in mix removing the diff cover here which is a cast aluminium piece bolted on to the cast steel casing there are a few types of limited slip differential available and this one is a toes and if when go around a corner the outside wheels need to travel further than the inside wheels as they are at a larger radius so a differential allows the wheels to turn it to few speeds to take this into account on a performance car want the differential to lock up a bit when apply the power in order to send drive to both wheels so this is when need a limited slip differential or an LSD instead of an open diff found on most normal cars after removing the input flange and the two dry flanges the old front seal is unceremoniously leave it from its home using a big pry bar given the longevity of the OG parts it seemed cherish not to plumb for Toyota bits again know the quality is going to be fantastic so to use cheaper pattern parts would be a false economy we've broken out the sleeve kit again and Nick is gently tapping the new seal into the nose of the diff casing lovely we've got more Toyota seals for the two sides and once again these are tapped home with the utmost care so that's the diff in spected and resealed but it seems like such a shame to have a beautifully painted shiny new diff casing Oh need to put these fugly over sprayed old bits back on but don't worry someone had the marvelous idea of buying a small home electroplating kit before we can get to the chemistry the parts need preparing thoroughly so our old blasting cabinet is dusted off and pressed into action on this crusty old dry flange let's be honest no one wants to work with a scabby flange it's nothing like as big or as powerful as Andy's from earlier but our little cabinet is perfectly good enough to clean up small items nicely it just needs the application of patience we don't want any plating on the hardened shaft so we're wrapping it in a protective sheath of insulation tape right up to the flange the first step in the plating process is to immerse the part in some alkaline degreaser it's left in there for a few minutes to get really clean it's then pulled out and rinsed off thoroughly in some clean water the next stage is the dry acid pickle there's nothing dry about it that's 9 liters of deionized water in there but the acid pickle salts remove oxides and surface impurities the process also slightly itches the part leaving it ready for plating we leave that in there for about a bruise worth of time and then it's back in the water to rinse off we bought this kit from classic plating dot code or UK and they do a range of different size kits we bought a biggest one they do ops Ince it's time to plate the flange it goes into the electrolyte which we prepared earlier the crocodile clip is then attached to the wire cage holding the part next we turn on the ammeter to keep an eye on the current lastly turn on the electricity supply the part starts to fizz gently which indicates that the process is working and now we could relax and put the kettle on while it does its thing with this flange we turn it through 90 degrees every so often to make sure we get an even coverage of zinc can see the shininess coming on to the part now it's still touching away merrily so we'll leave it be for a while the Pixies have been flowing the chemistry has done its thing and the part is looking resplendent in its new coat of zinc actually that's not too bad if I do say so myself anyway the final step of the process is to passivate it all that means is to make the surface more passive or less likely to suffer from corrosion and to do that it gets another rinse and then dipped in a tub of nitric acid for a minute with passivating can impart a color onto the finished surface you'll all be familiar with the gold or yellow passivates find on screws and lots of steel parts but can get black along with the clear finish that gives it a subtle blue tinge but here NYX decided to eschew all those choices and he's gone for a terrific shade of olive drab I suppose it's alright if like that kind of thing but to be honest it was as close to British racing green as we could get given the choices once you've fallen down the plating rabbit hole it's hard to get out anyway the diff is now ready to go back together [Music] best to do the drain plug up tight now lest forget about it later on and blow the diff up on the first run ask me how I know I think you'll agree that's quite the difference with that taken care of we can move on to the drive shafts the front CV joints weren't in the best condition and as they get the hardest life we thought it prudent to purchase a fresh pair but the bare-metal finish wasn't up to snuff so NIC painted them Nach there are an awful lot of components that make up the fore drive shafts and reassembly is a time-consuming and greasy affair we reckon the mini will be quite a lot lighter than the salika that donated its running gear so the pounding the drive shafts incur should be somewhat less than they're used to however due to the size constraints at the front the angle of the front shafts isn't ideal so we'll be keeping a very close eye on those especially to start with the molybdenum disulphide grease that goes into CV joints is a terrific lubricant but my god does it get everywhere each of the shaft is being treated to a pair of new boots to keep all that lovely lube safely tucked away inside the joint not all boots are created equally we've had calls to return a few cheaper ones due to the material being well a bit crap the shiny plastic e material is rubbish and splits far too easily and this isn't a job want to be doing very often so we always try and find the more matte finish rubbery ER material that's a word the stainless steel boot clips are the final touch and these get crimped on using the proper tool for once that's a nice job do it three more times and get this lot next was some pre-assembly are the uprights and anime have been prepped and powder-coated but they're not quite ready to be built up yet it wouldn't be an episode of binky without the requisite growing direction now would it and if this time we've got what's effectively a plastic scouring disc to remove only the paint and not any metal there are quite a lot of engineered surfaces on the uprise and we'd very much like to keep those flat and true and free from the powder coat the problem is exposed metal rusts like nobody's business so what we're going to try to do is clean it all up and apply a thin coat of each primer to mitigate the possibility of corrosion they should be left there really but we'd rather them not dissolve at the merest hint of a British Road all escalated quite quickly hmm well the next job is to mask it all up to stop the etch primer getting on the lovely fresh powder coat as can see this isn't the easiest of tasks but like a lot of these jobs it's all in the prep and painting the upright is dead easy and quick so after drying and unmasking it looks like this but we're going to need all this lot to make it into something usable we've got new wheel bearings seals and circlip a freshly plated dry flange and new extended studs a handbrake backing plate and fittings a new polyurethane Bush for the trailing arm and two new MADD Toyota sphericals we'll start the reassembly with this spherical bushes these are tapped into place to start with and then because of their location we can't just press them in using hydraulics so we've got some all-thread some spacers and nuts and are squeezing them in using nothing but brute force and ignorance these split poly bushes are far more straightforward they need nothing more than some a special silicon Lube and they slip straight in the steel sleeve also gets some lubrication before being pushed firmly into the bush next item on the agenda is the wheel bearing and it's at times like this where the sleeve kit and the press really show their worth the bearing is retained within the hub by this big circlip and then it's time to fit the front seal to it the rear seal is fitted in the same manner the handbrake backing plate is fixed to the upright using these four colossal spline studs we really didn't want this thing coming off their m10 for crying out loud and this for were them mental after sliding the backing plate onto the upright the nuts get done up to ft or six or belugas the studs we had in the dry flanges were going to be too short so we raided competition supplies at Silverstone for some longer ones the final part of the upright puzzle is to press the dry flange into the wheel bearing and there have it one complete refurbished rear upright ready to go back on the car we did the front uprights too but they are no good without something to bolt them to so we may as well get on with this reassembly of the front lower arms quickly we haven't talked any of the bolts or nuts retaining the bushes yet we'll do that once the whole car is together and it's sitting on its wheels at normal ride height that's to stop any possible binding up as the car settles we're hoping that the red poly bushes will give us less flex and therefore more control than standard rubber ones also retaining a hint of compliance for a good ride the big rear subframe has lots of holes so to stop water and grime getting in they need blanking off we've cleaned up most of the original grommets and replaced the really manky ones with new all right nothing else and that should keep all grommet watch is nice and happy anyway with that done I think we can finally start bringing some of these sub assemblies together and to finish it off but in a minute so while we get on with that can get the funk out [Music] [Music] [Music] earlier in the episode we had this crusty rusty fugly old subframe and diff but now it looks like something we'd be happy to bolt on to the mini but it's not just the subframe every single part of the running gear has been stripped inspected primed painted and reassembled using new bits only where necessary and if you're wondering where we got the attractive thick fire retardant curtains they actually came from a lunatic asylum because know NIC maniac so I think we can call the running gear done but as we haven't got any paint on the car yet we're gonna have to find something else to tinker with in the next episode see soon [Music] tune in next time for another exciting episode from the files of project pinky [Applause] to make anyone noticed yeah [Applause]
