hey guys backyard scientist here you know I've always wanted to see lava for myself but I've kind of had this irrational fear of volcanoes from when I was a kid but anyway today we're going to be trying to make lava for ourselves by melting down some rocks then we're gonna pour it in the pool we're gonna see what happens if you jump on lava will you sink in or float back up to the top and we're gonna pour it on a couple other things let's get started yeah that LICO volcano could just happen anywhere like just erupt in the middle of the street because I watched a movie and they were just appearing in the middle of the city I thought it could happen anyway what we're going to be doing is melting down these red lava rocks and these are actually like rocks from volcanic activity I don't know if this can get hot enough to melt lava rocks so we're gonna try I know can melt copper and aluminum but these melt a lot higher they're like 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit and that's really hot that's almost melting steel well let's get started first let's fill up this crucible with some lava rocks put it right here in the Forge now all we have to do is turn off the gas fire it up and then it's just a waiting game and if you're wondering why the propane tank is taking a bath it's because it'll get so cold because it's using so much gas it'll start to iced over on the side so we need to keep it in water otherwise it'll lose pressure and it won't work anymore now let's get started this might be a big one I think it's ready now let me stick my stick in here and see how it is oh that's molten you can see jiggling that's dreadful odo come over a little bit more oh wow whoa that's molten all right here we go let's do this all right here we go are you ready oh it's coming out it's like loading whoa do you see like bubbling in the gallows pretty cool all right go get it that was our first try and it didn't work out so good because this furnace didn't get hot enough and that's because the the burner I was using just wasn't hot enough and it was kind of a gas hog so I made a new burner and let's compare it to the old one tell by the lighter color blue of this flame that it's burning a lot hotter and more efficient the math language is working kind of rich burgers and that's it we've got our two burners installed let's try melting some lava for real this time ready for the wolf get started building your website today oh well according to the thermometer over here the rocks are all melted so let's go check them out [Music] [Music] I just can't believe how hot it is oh [Music] gosh [Music] that was a that was pretty cool that was awesome look at the pool I know I was hoping that we'd get like a piece of art out of it but it's more like just turned straight to sand there's a chunk oh gosh just shoot a local pool guy oh my gosh it's is it coming apart yeah coming apart kind of cool it almost looks like wood can you see it yeah but it's so fragile watch it I can just oh well I'm gonna clean this up and then we'll do some more stuff with the lava all right for the next experiment we're gonna see what happens if you were to jump or fall into a volcano or something like that some people think if you fall in you'll sink right to the bottom or maybe you'll hit and just go splat right on top of the lava so we're gonna be testing it out with this piece of chicken here I'm gonna take it out and throw it in there and see what happens come come look at this and see how hot it is I'm sweating can you see it yeah that's what the Sun looks like watch out I have a prediction that this is going to smell really bad cheese let me stir it up a little bit oh my gosh now let's try it for the chicken see what happens to it is it gonna sink or is it gonna float [Music] [Music] you know chickens ready to flip well you know what this actually cooks it pretty good because this one's like a hard shell on top it's so hot it's like burning my leg let's put in the hot stuff it's just fire oh my gosh it's so hot it's so hot I can't even get close to it yep so that's what would happen if you fell into a pit of death or a pit of lava same thing you know you wouldn't go straight through and sink to the bottom you'd probably just sit on top and end up looking like this piece of chicken you wouldn't think no all right let's put this back in and try one more thing I'm getting a sunburn I wonder how hot something has to be I start giving off UV rays and I know hot stuff probably gives off UV but how much if you know the answer to that I leave it below in the comments because I'd like to know and I'm sure somebody knows that right off the top of their head now we're gonna try pouring the lava on glass and aluminum to see what happens and we have a little cowboy vs. Indians setup right here too I'm thinking that it's so hot these guys will begin to smoke and catch on fire before the lava even touches them anyway so we'll see if it can melt through the glass and melt through the aluminum or both I'll probably pour it on everything this organized chaos exactly that's what I'm gonna call this art piece when I'm done haha okay that's pretty Moulton you're glowing yeah came out a lot easier than I went in well we'll let it that bit our eyes all right go on Wow wow that's so cool it's beautiful oh let me get some on the aluminum - well the glasses oh look at twisting like this wow that just exploded oh that's so cool oh let me get some on the aluminum - [Music] that legitimately scared me though I kind of is the horse okay the horse is okay that's all I hear bit about the stagecoach yeah lava flows were a big part of daily life for the settlers they always had to watch out for random volcanoes according to your childhood theories okay volcanoes could happen and you were just like sinkholes just a matter of time all right guys that's the end of this video I hope you enjoyed it and if you're new here go ahead and consider pressing
