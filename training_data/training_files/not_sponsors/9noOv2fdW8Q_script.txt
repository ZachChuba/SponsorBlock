all right right-side honeycomb 3 2 man this wipe was action-packed 2 online raids and loads of action nearly all as a trio in this video you will see us dominate the playing field despite our small numbers everything just fell perfectly into place well most of the time [ __ ] loaded don't take his face there's someone's home that upgrade is doorframe you forgot the upgrade your doorframe yes one is just too like a 2x2 or 3x3 I kinda want to do a 3x3 [ __ ] it this guy's got a gun behind this base [Music] sorry guy take a minute so this run was planned to have a four man group but spicy didn't stick around for too long so soon it ended up just being me Aiko and disfigure so I know that right now it's a quad but just keep in mind that soon it won't be I decided to research the water pipe as it was BP white our first BP a water pipe shotgun someone's taking our mini Oh Tommy guys took our heli I'm almost dead in a once nice there's another one I think it's loaded dude watch I'm going back to base that's another Tommy oh they're coming back coming back nice this meats on the rear 700 700 clump by the way I got a pump e2 furnaces like just a bunch of nice stuff so no more than an hour in we already have a bunch of guns and a good amount of resources from this duo that basically gave us their kits it was a bit weird to say the least but we'll take an opportunity like that any day but you don't find yours oh that kind of air table you guys supply signal dude if he didn't know the reason I'm happy about him finding this air drop since usually air drops are pretty crappy it's because recently on my servers Blue Lagoon we buffed air drops so they have some really good stuff in the mountain so if you're interested in checking it out it's in the description right auto turrets supply signal do you want to call in the supply signal dude I'm down I want to just do it right here [ __ ] it let's get a bit easy class okay I'm gonna call this in did the pilot loot it all maybe no no got right here shot him yes a gun Thompson lr he's loaded what does the airdrop have [Music] we flew over to the snow because heli went down here we wanted to see what we could do vice a big group was holding the mountain and we were gonna get pinched by this other group at the lake so after losing disfigure me and Aiko just got out of there with the SAR kids boy let's go for that he killed the Rebbe guy isn't right me and the boys soon found another airdrop so we called it in the area that's why I'm really hurt aw someone's going for airdrop I don't think I got it yet wait I have one more bullet I only know one thing I hit them all really hard right here I whipped pretty bad though Oh 100 m39 the other guy had an LR okay dude this is this is insane this starts so far dude later boys I'm gonna go [ __ ] kill these kids both dead hello great for right hi guys sorry for sure why it's like I hasn't that rock after base camping those neighbors they Nevitt of lead or camped us but it wasn't a big deal soon after that we went for cargo yeah and no one's hop right now wait there's no red yeah there aren't there on the crates and I drop down and a dead [ __ ] another supply signal and a ladder hatch we need that figure out your pants and an 8k dude someone grab this be like 9c oh not bad the boat that's usually on the back of cargo ship was taken so we had to wait for the right moment to jump off and swim to shore well I do just in time to look at setting these phony now you got it you got it you can never mind oh my god that face is huge my oh my god actually what farmers farmers dude they got like the the H Tunes setup and everything all I'm saying is it's the second day of life I'm pretty sure I saw it now he was like is that a heli going straight for us driver dead rocket launcher bunch of scrap oh it's BP wait they don't have the really hard can anyone loot this kid I'm gonna just ammo should I just gonna do road sign and then you guys should do the ammos and meds you got farther I'm gonna push this a K out here because we called in that airdrop from cargo a bunch of people started coming to our area including a few a K guys wait once on me mp5 I'm full dead I don't know where that guy came from he was hiding in the rocks nice Minnie's trying to go for our [ __ ] and I killed the heli guys so we're good there I think this guy just [ __ ] up with the heli cattle are oh I killed one I killed one I think a head shot hit him yeah [ __ ] I don't have a gun the shooter one got tons of loot what it's kind of stacked this guy BC right here got ek ed man that guy's so good I had once the other going straight for his body and I'm pushing right now I'm close nice nice okay I think we need to go everyone else pulling tours right this rights are unloaded in here man ID all anyone's been here kind of satchel though hey where's that arrow well it's straight ahead let's go let's go for that oh my god what is that [ __ ] aids on the hill dude so late only five times wait what did you get again double armor you sent I want to push this Sark on that is [ __ ] I don't mean Ellis him either double dings that man that was a lot of people all of a sudden do you think I think it is Depot time did my heart rate at my heart I literally felt it almost explode holy [ __ ] I got hit a few times I was a roller coaster of cancer so that just about wrapped up day one since we've already had a lot of PvP the main goal for today was to do some rating but first we needed to find a target so while setting out on Rome's that's exactly what we were looking for [Music] that's how that guy over there [Music] I didn't know ahead he's outside living them headshot headshot pushing I think this guy got his LR feels bad finding a raid target wasn't too hard these guys have a reasonably sized base a reasonably sized group and it seems like they have a decent amount of gear they were also roof camping but we were invading their territory causing problems so roof camping in that situation makes perfect sense now over the course of these past couple of days we've been building up a lot of explosives so we'd be ready to do this raid in no time but first we wanted to take out this neighbor that's been around since the beginning we weren't expecting any profit we mainly did it for the TC and also to use it as a flank base there's a lot of [ __ ] boxes that's whatever we weren't really doing this after finishing that but you snuck over to their base to place some bags before the raid interestingly enough though they were still on their roof and they got a decent amount of people in there we headed back home and waited out the night once when it was day we went back over to make a small raid base nearby I'm gonna should I just put it down right here with the raid base finished we were ready to raid we just needed to get our better gear on and all the Rockets making 100 more explosive ammo I mean explosives you guys all have bags in the rate base right yeah wait a minute why is there a horse on our airlock I'm gonna lead the to c4 in the base in the raid basis in case we need emergencies to c4 double dings that goes hazmat [Music] all right right so honeycomb three [Music] [Music] what is some of you guys in Rockets bro you guys are [ __ ] Pepe guys okay I'm gonna go get a c4 because now we're kind of stuff because this figure missed a rocket that put us at an odd amount of rockets so I headed back to get the c4 to try and even it out no this is stupid man why does this keep happening I'm c4e i co timed out but we had to keep pressing on you see you see we need those source of ammo yeah I do but we need that explosive ammo looted off my body yeah does behind me [ __ ] it [ __ ] it I knew there's a loop back there but it was the only safe place I could place the TC while I was dealing with the inside of the raid this figure was holding the raid from counters hovering ICO until he wakes up I'm keeping you in love you should be able to just moved loot this whole time flanker [Music] hey guys wow you guys are insane you got this slide off [ __ ] online rated dude probably do spawn I shot a rocket at it did you kill him here mmmm I can finish that [ __ ] it is I got bolte gunpowder guns [ __ ] is his face I'll answer it ok we need to break bags why'd you guys raid us room what a [ __ ] year at this guy says we weren't responding we were trying to de-spawn Jesus patio you've only got like a [ __ ] quarter velu dumbass now we were hoping that from a base of this size we would see some sort of decent defense as the reason you online raid is because usually it's more fun than an offline raid but all this guy did during the time ago rocketing was move all of his main loot and despawn it plus he had the audacity to talk [ __ ] over the mic these kids [Music] everybody hates we were out of rockets so we couldn't blow any deeper but I still think what we did was worth it because this seemed like nobody in the neighborhood liked this guy so after another hour or so listening to this guy the place started to cool off so we grabbed all the best loot and ran back to base now this didn't feel like much of an ending to us so we continued on to see where this story would take us I can't even see the heli it's calling that was an m2 encounter yeah they're definitely gonna they're gonna meet us there I'm already here you ready at the [ __ ] MATLAB but he's dead you kill them soon on a roof yeah you can fly on there you could fly on their father damn dude oh [ __ ] true is there no turrets or anything no no they had no turns you open the open nice no he's loaded there's so many in the [ __ ] trees [Music] are you ready I'm like it so we got em - we should just Ted there's a crude after absolutely snagging that m2 we heard a raid in the distance so all three of us got in different mini copters and we flew over to check it out this was the raid right right he's a K kind of [ __ ] right now there's a few counter eaters up on the hill that were pestering us so we decided to just fly into the raid and ignore them [Music] I got es seed of course jokes well they're in here they're in there I bet we all ended up dying there was a few more in there but we still had a lot of kids so we went back yeah let's go oh did we need to go [Music] let's go quick depo and go straight back to it on our way back we noticed they were making a run for it so we chased get ready for this [ __ ] did nice guy on the rock twice yeah he's that oh yeah to rock nice easy all right who wants to come first now as we come closer to the end of this video I want to introduce you guys to the last segment it starts out with me running to this area with loads here dear where I meet a geared active group double tanks [ __ ] later beds holy [ __ ] go back with TVs [Music] [Music] did I just compound [ __ ] off oh we're dead get rocket launcher he's dead I'm dead man these [ __ ] random nakeds with rocks dude so we have some new targets and while they didn't do anything wrong they still seemed pretty geared and since all they had to work with was a 2x2 it's not like they could [ __ ] out and try and D spawn like the other guys did so we figured instead of wasting more time door camping that we should go and online raid them the plan was simple we were gonna rocket their roof all four squares and on the last rocket we would shoot an insane if all went according to plan it would be an easy white [Music] Nadel are watching door but he's opening its opening finish on the back we need star rocketing dude joke what [ __ ] you just start rocketing just start [ __ ] shooting on dizzy nice I'm dead man and just like that the raid was done at first we thought there was only three or four of them but apparently there was a couple more and they were all posted up ready for us to start raiding almost as if they knew it was a massive punch to the gut but as most Rus players would do we weren't gonna just let this slide so we went back over to try and drain some of their kids make sure you guys watch your backs too I ought to like are they all in their base right now there's people behind us careful a lot of it are they outside the [ __ ] he wants to do oh yeah hey I got an angle on door nice you should just run those back to base we got exactly what we came there to do this figure was able to get two of our kits back which means less kits they can use to defend when we go and rate them again and because I knew you guys would be on my ass if we offline rated at two by two and also because I couldn't live with myself if I did we were gonna attempt another online raid so first we headed over and made a raid base and I just upgraded that sold like a [ __ ] papaya with the rain base finished we were ready to raid oh I can so easily see this dude I don't know if there's anyone here at the base I haven't checked was there actually I think I said that the whole area was quiet which I found pretty interesting considering we just failed rated these guys no longer than an hour ago but at the moment it seemed like nobody was on either way we continued with the plan then Oh hit the puppies yeah perfect choice if I'm gonna like overwatch [Music] [Music] yeah careful boys don't let them rocket both of you at the same time they spread out we got all of our Rockets back easy profit guys holy [ __ ] we're in at last the raid went our way and we got all the Rockets that we lost before back they may have not been able to put up much of a fight but with the base as small as that what can you do regardless I think it was a job well done we had our fun and as always it was time to prepare for the next wipe I hope you guys enjoyed our trio adventure [Music] [Music]
