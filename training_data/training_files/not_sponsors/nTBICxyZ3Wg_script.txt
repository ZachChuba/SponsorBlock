ready folks welcome back to another episode of Exodia as always brought to thanks to them like in the description so um oh I did send you a squad invite by the way I don't know if you are for you so that we can then squad up and be all squad buddies yeah that would be pretty cool now I have accepted your invite now you need to hit the start squad oh do i okay yeah starter start yeah exciting yeah it's cool hey good stuff so wow what quest were we working on last time I was working on trying to get things the way that I needed have been to be oh yeah it's always good to do all right I was doing the even more annoying and I'm gonna make some Lumia man signal um I guess sounds great I don't great I forgot how to make a wooden engine it's very complex I recall that it took a lot okay fine fine I literally had all the right pieces just upside down and then [Music] tin dust pulverize so how do I get an energized glow the fluid Transposer how do I get energized glowstone in a fluid trance closer oh Nagma crucible with glows magma crucible okay pretty cool pretty cool with so we actually that is down and ready to go we got some some glowstone now you can actually you know put put to use the storage system that was developed that you thought wasn't very cool but it turns that actually is pretty cool you know it was alright if you're into that sort of thing how do they lose stone again oh man yeah this stuff is all over the place and then if I do this here do we have any of the do we have any of the things any of the brassy greta the the misty gravel maybe probably I think we probably processed most of it yeah okay the glue tight crystal in B crusher okay there we go cool also hey what's up Sonya sorry I didn't catch it earlier that there I don't know if you're still here but hello then I should be able to put this here I actually want this to be a clay well you made a steel hammer dude that's fancy I'm a fancy boy okay so hmm let's hope this works how do you make signal them to do that as well that takes destabilize redstone which you get through a magma crucible redstone sounds good sis glowstone and redstone basically I guess if you consider them similar opposites I guess that Lumia manned and signal them are kind of like two halves of the same coin you know two sides of the same coin whatever that saying is to do two halves of the say if you took a coin and you like cut it in half then you would get loom alum and Syngman um definitely I feel like we all lost a little bit by right hearing you say that like ah that was it was educational that was to the detriment of everybody excuse me excuse me but that's extremely rude Oh God shoot I have not wired these up have I know you know cool need more of the hey you want to make more insulated wiring so don't zap myself over and over I'm busy that's disappointing I'm busy right now but I check back with me later and I might be able to lend a hand okay I can make I can do it wait can you do it is you were kind of just hoping that I'd do it for you wait we don't have any have fiber what the heck we should have plenty of hemp fiber but if I were you I would check in the drawers rather than trying to check in the system mmm that's a point that you've made right there dude mm-hmm all right so if I get some misty gravel I can say route that up and then that'll go over there the the stuff that comes out the dust will go over there everything else will go into the main system and drop and sort as appropriate sounds all right to me dude you know what I'm talking about definitely okay okay that that didn't sound confident but I'm trusting your confidence with my confidence good yeah I'm boy oh boy the amount of steps to get these frickin things there's a lot of steps Jesse I'm I didn't I'm doing you the courtesy of making the insulated wire yeah I did are you what a guy this guy over here best guy this guy right here I try to be I try to be the best like mm-hmm how do you go into oh okay just works just works ow hey drone bad ow I was busy I was busy step okay me over here trying to shift to pick up table god there's an evil rabbit there's an evil rabbit why is there an evil rabbit is there actually though no I just decided to start screaming about it for no reason I didn't I didn't know that those could spawn here this I didn't either and then I climb here and there was a there was a evil rabbit and I was like no I I think everybody heard that part of the whole thing yeah yeah yeah oh wait okay I dude I made I made insulated wire isn't that isn't that cool that's very kind of you how do we get really how do I get rid of the existing wire you break the piece that it's on and you replace it Oh like the wire connector yeah the connector okay oh god I need more of those oh yeah boyee there is so many steps to do to get these things connected yeah story of my life man story of my life that's the story of my life okay I have warped back and I have returned with gravel from the misty world cool so now I should be able to say that if I put gravel here then went going into the system will route as appropriate down the line but gravel going into the system will route up and over to be filtered hey the work it works cool automation is automatically awesome well I got these things powered so that's exciting now all right we're gonna try to make some destabilized redstone wait do I have to pass the thing into the fluid transpose or to be able to collect it once it's in there yes but you can put the fluid transpose and next to it it is it just I was smart and I I did the thing I don't forget enabled thermal expansion should be pretty easy to route like thermal expansion does it right or driving stuff there we go okay I am hoping that we'll be receiving relax said the night man we are programmed to receive what is that from any I'm a little disappointed not gonna lie okay just it's a Hotel California by the Eagles you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave I thought it was um It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia because there's the night man you know yep yep have you never heard of the night man no-no-no I've denied man and I we go way back okay good yeah that's very important big big with the night man good yeah the night man is a very good character um all right let's see I need to offload this water or make a new bucket do you have different buckets do we have different buckets you know blue red yellow one all right well I got myself some glowstone energized glowstone I should say uh-uh yeah dude it's an upside-down bucket that's pretty cool yeah well I mean it and if you guess it floats I'll jump it out then it floats up yeah that's oh right because it's on the ceiling of the nether it makes it makes total sense it's reasonable at every level all right well I've got an apple I'm gonna eat that and then from there I guess it's time to kind of check in on where you're at what you've broken and figure out how I need this man is fix a most demeaning mother trucker who has ever existed Oh any demeaning melodramatic demeaning you are where are you all right like LED stone powered ducks rammer recommends let's don't pack oh hey hey hey hey hey hey you sir what's the meaning of this I thought you had actually important things that you had to share but this is that's something else okay alrighty then yep mm-hmm cool cool so what good big Lumina manam and the stuff aluminum mmm and the stuff Lumia mingotts oh okay so quest now that I've done wired all that up you are working on the even more allowing right yeah okay energy so basic energy so basic that I need an energy cell frame and some LED red stones easy easy easy electrum and lead plates and a machine frame okay I think we've got almost all of that they'll be done electro we've not okay how do i alloway electrum I mean get done that way silver and gold one to one right yeah and it makes me wispy yeah if we're gonna have to mass-produce these signal em and LU Miam it's it's gonna it's gonna be a whole thing I mean you know the the mod packs predicated and we've kind of we've kind of dealt with this what what what oh I said what what said what what you know on setting up automation and getting all this stuff kind of running without us and that's the part that we kind of seem to skip over a little bit so we end up doing everything the really really tedious way when we're supposed to do a tedious setup and then not have to do it at all mmm-hmm well it's gonna be it's gonna be rough - you have to take your ingots then you have to put them in the pulverizer and then you've you've taken to the pulverizer into Auto crafting and from the auto crafting you then have to smelt the output and then you'll finally get your signal amor and Lumia more what-have-you so it's it's a many step process that's yeah yeah let's make sure we have the good Stamper over here yeah yeah all right I have acquired four Lumia blends which is an exciting thing that has taken place no Miam it's like floor beum I don't know where that came from why why why am I not seeing the cuckoo's is this thing out of the 2p to power the chupa chup you say how do you make sure the embers have been to pichu's know this but you could use in there something's not be chewing sorry man all right and I got signal um and now I think I can put you in the redstone furnace no can't do that can't do that gold and silver okay oh you need sand very interesting why is this nope achoo Aang it's on that's on and also Stan okay like this should be but Ewing may have to request a assistance from the Batu Master what is that me thank you are in fact but you master well that goes fast it was fast it is known I'm gonna break you and put you back on do it but you jus Bangladesh what why was there that's huh what about you isn't patchouli Bangladesh I said I said spinkle it'sh but but she was not the chewing you know over here wait I guess like thanks for it YUM yes yeah hey I need you I need your help you actually need my help I do I'm over here trying to decipher the Pitou machine and you built it okay what do you need for me huh I got the gold I got the silver but it's not pursuing okay but if you if you nice check the activator I checked it I checked that there's the two fuel right yeah the shards and the levers are all on so maybe it's supposed to come from this guy I don't know how to do linking perhaps a guy and it goes it goes but you over here to put you yeah come on I don't believe so but okay so I don't know which one was made for what this one doesn't seem to be that's where the doom-doom is make but to wait there we go maybe this and then is it not in sight do we need to move do we need to move it do we need to poke it somewhere else did it go down on the bottom instead of right there I don't so it's got the stuff in the tanks is it we don't have that yet we don't have the amber pichu's what is going on I wonder is that that's on huh it's a good question something might be clogged potentially yeah I mean there's nothing in it was able to get from the mixers or from the the crucibles into the mixing thing so it's nothing in those pipes these pipes are empty so it's nothing in there nothing in that tank so there's nothing in the pipes that's waiting there's nothing in the bin stand base the correct stamper is in place but we're not getting duped Jews let's see if it's all busted no it still works exactly there no I feel like this happened once before and I don't know why or how and we have a fair amount like I mean obviously it's not a Heil Heil hey okay here we go it's not like in the end of the world but it's you know 32 ingots of both okay something turned on yeah I was testing that like the mod itself wasn't busted so I just had a really shards not some other type that it's needing that's not ember shards right yeah amber shards are viable the amber crystal you can do either art you can do either okay amber crystals are the bigger ones okay but yeah it definitely seems like this is intact like the activators not hitting the connector that's where it seems like the the receptor oh oh there you go so yeah this one's just broken weird hey you made it work huh and that's what's important yeah so this this amber activator is busted weird animators not emitting there's ember grit in that pipe amber shard in the back pipe and then nothing in the activator that's weird I don't know I don't know about it to know why that happened but clearly jiggling the lever worked we heard yeah but now we're getting put to purdue's so thank you for your help no problem yeah I guess uh-oh Oh amber grit is not fuel and it's in that pipe I see well oh so it's not another 800 you had in 400 everything broke oh I see okay well now I can now I can reconnect these thank you for your help I appreciated it yeah absolutely there we go now it's all Pachuca chewing dude Thank You Ram are much appreciated yeah get those but to zone all right and then I need to let it lead plates actually anything over here okay seven so I need some of that some of that anyway I Miami getting like what hello there you go tree fluid extractor and latex processing unit and then we can get plastic to make additional machines with an iron casing anatomic Reconstructor solar power which requires that oh the empower oh my god dude there's a lot oh there's a lot going on here yeah it's a lot to unpack um now if only you upgraded to thermal pipes it would make your life much easier huh mm well we haven't oh these are no is this the are these the thermal pipes thermal dynamics lead stone flue adduct idem duct and fluid arc that actually is the next challenge right there so maybe that's what we're supposed to do yeah sounds like that's what we're supposed to do okie dokie all right okay so I need two machine frames which is eight glass a lot of that machine pipe and two blocks of ten now god the hardened glass no not like actually it makes two per right but I still might need to make one you forgotten what these hardened glass again the iron pipe it's pretty easy with glass dududududududududu all right I don't know what to do with these fluid X and stuff once we actually get them but so you're making sure no fluid ducts right or are they fluid X or flux ducks uh yeah they are sorry wait what are they a flux duct yeah there there is item duct and fluid echo that we're supposed to do yet so flux duct is a replacement cabling like for RF transport okay as opposed to the insulated LV wires and stuff like that gotcha so it's an alternative to that we thought five of what I needed but the so that that's I think he's yeah you know your your guide is saying you need to like I switch to those so that you stop zapping yourself and doing with all that gotcha well I guess I should just make a bunch of hardened glass because apparently I'm gonna need it item ducts and then optim duct and fluid duct hopefully these are compatible they should be one would hope yes good Oh item ducts have a filter apparently so that you can filter stuff outlets yes mm-hmm very exciting I think will be excited about it I am excited about that cool oh I need two of the Topaz I believe is the correct thing they're cool cool beans and beans and cool and Wade and stuff I love cool Asian beans that sounds weird and it's a classic that's a secure me you know how you know how in in England they have an English breakfast here we have the kool-aid and beans Wow you're insulting and classic American tradition it would be like insulting the English breakfast I'm perfectly fine with class with insulting kool-aid and beans like no qualms other than the English breakfast no regrets are there really any like dishes that UK is known for food wise spotted dick is this a real thing what spotted dick yeah I've never heard of spotted dick of course it's a real thing oh yeah fish and chips that's true fish and chips is one there's haggis sorry this guy right here guys I'm not with him okay like okay all right okay [Laughter] what is spotted dick it's I think it's a pudding spotted dick because it's the name what do you want from me why that sounds like a disease Josh he the oldest spotted dick Oh Ralph dude gotta have to amputate oh did you say British not English oh okay then he's fine yeah okay I'll say okay all right well I was thinking English but you're but British is fine more specifically I said the UK but yeah with the with the with the Scotsman's wait where's my hardened glass it has to be copper ah out of here with that how did I miss everything so badly I just I counted and put in a way that was poor so let's see I need four more and then some more of those I just worried you were gonna start talking about English kilts and stuff like that as like well let's just talk about this before we get too far down this road like you know what you don't like to free ball it dude mostly I don't like to attribute kilts to the English Oh oh gosh gotcha that's that's what I don't like alright I mean I I don't know that it's like I don't I don't want to miss any attribute I guess or and then 5:1 for the iron which I need to stamp out Oh II ignore the recipe got it got it got it and smart doesn't have to be copper I've been bamboozled you're a bamboozle ah there we go ah DuckTales whoo oh that's funny I didn't realize that was the name of the challenge might salah mystery or rewrite history ducktales woo long-distance Tran if I combine item ducks with ender pearls I can transfer items over longer distances brah we made it away oh dude we made it this is what we're talking about what are we talking about oh just you be ready dude all of everything you've been working on is about to be rendered useless oh boy oh boy I know it's exciting hey weird my iron and gold plates go with the heck that's not smelling smelling smelting no spelling I hear electrical zap ease apps yes parking stuff right now I'm Oh dreams that are you that are sighs after you he's funny everybody he's a funny man I love you bud only the funniest of yolks up in here dude box box me we'll we'll get so many views dude we I mean I don't think we would rate pay-per-view though you'd only need what pay-per-view I don't think we would rate you know like the warrant you know I don't think so so you know they announced that I was on the the Saturday thing today oh yeah cool cool cool announced and so I got to feel the the pride of seeing that go out followed shortly by having everybody go oh I guess they're just adding to randos now cuz apparently no one knows you're the other guy I'm sorry wait why were what were the lower the responses just just like you know oh don't know who these people are but okay no yeah most famous streamer on Twitch mate oh yeah people are more famous absolutely I believe that everybody will tune in not even thinking not into our both our boxing match fight yes and also when you you know appear on the minecraft saturday thing which by the way everybody tune in Saturday this Saturday and I think possibly sequential Saturdays I assume at 1 p.m. Pacific time 4 p.m. Eastern time 9:00 p.m. UK also English time and you'll have to extrapolate from there but you can catch a tournament of epic epic ah city proportions I hope so because it hasn't run it hasn't run yet so it could also no it could also you know everything in crash and burn but you know it could also have large spheres of air placed into the lobby it's possible that could that could be a thing - is that what that's what happened on the final minecraft Monday yeah so is that just over now no I think it's supposed to be returning at some point unless it doesn't in which case that would I hate that clears that up yeah yeah I mean it's supposed to be later this month I don't know the exact date but we'll see I got you yeah I don't want that one so brah bronze yes okay Nuggets give me some Nikes dude dude the bomb dick no wait wait I don't need you oh wait are they the spotted dick cuz you said the bomb dick I was bomb diggity but then I interrupted myself now do you only need one dispatcher and then you get a linker it needs to be attached to an inventory and then it can be linked to other receiving inventories it can be sped with upgrades and configured intervention ah is there anything that you're like wow dude it'd be really cool if I could connect these two places with a thing that sends items of the moment not immediately speaking no media scene immediately unlit torched a lot of rocks and have we gotten much in the way of ender stuff oh that's what I actually have the ability to do right now is I could make the other void minor thing because they think I have the little right needed the other oh the crystal or what have you uh whatever the other type of void miner was I see you know you know how it'd be well I guess I don't know what to do we the dispatcher as of right now so that's a thing I'll put it in the chest and we'll see what it do the copper plates cover plates keep in mind if you need to send items over a long distance we have the dispatcher rather than you wiring up just a bunch of pipes and obstructing the walking path Wow okay no I'm not saying you've done that I'm just saying this offers an opportunity to just saying you know maybe in the future you don't need to block the path I'm just saying oh we didn't leave the server on did we no yeah you know I haven't figured out how to do that okay yeah you're not we've not gotten a great deal over here but that's this shell is cool it's fine chill well we'll get to that win when I remember how to do ow careful those are those are exposed wires I'm gonna insulate those any minute now yeah don't oh you did the jump one yeah just don't jump I I had this lake idea I was just thinking about Oh were you gonna say don't jump is that the idea that you were saying enough instead of jumping why don't you not jump oh is that is that what you were thinking yeah that's what I was thinking you know you caught on resource what is the difference between the current void miner and a resource miner are we not mining resources ones like I I think there are two different things I would think that the one is like metal and the other one is not metals or something like that I think Oh ores versus non ores well why would I want non ores that sounds boring Knorr if you will and Knorr dude I'm gonna ignores that Wow okay wait wasn't I do I put the extra somewhere and did I D extra there sure there's that but I have left I literally just made literate you fool oh it can be anything okay they don't make sure so that's just working okay you fools reconnect diode oh boy inter connect diode oh boy I've got her sounds I'm all boy right there's that right there and now let's see if this all works that's one too far I hated I hated every part I hated every part about it I hate it at all hmm wait what's wrong it's a stricken Oh what's wrong tell me your story in your woes it was redstone wire requires aluminum in the wire Stamper yeah okay it's just a lot of steps that I I didn't really want to do this again but here we are Here I am the one that you love doing all these steps again mm-hmm oh we're running low on redstone yeah I always do have any dust that I could potentially use to go and toss my rack we do a make dust out of that we should be able to make to put dust or put back in the polarizer and get the magma dust oh we can just like smell that directly well it's not smelting but it's pulverizing instead of us having to do the tap tap tap tap tap thing that we used to have to do oh yeah but I need dust just just dust oh yeah we actually have 19 dust in here though that I can throw into the the old thing of a new maker you know and that's not working so you're gonna to smash it sorry nice noise good work I wanted it to work I was believing I was hopeful but it just didn't work out that way and I'm sorry sorry man it's okay I appreciate your apology I'm gonna find myself some steel which I need how much of like I need a hate oh boy and 16 aluminium electrum a lot of electrum boys mm-hmm I don't think people have made see me make these interconnects quite enough I need to do more interconnected bat planetary is that are you singing The Beastie Boys yeah I was kind of like working off of it I could kinda tell enough to tell me you got there got there all right well crap cuz now I need redstone too and you're going you going to do other things but until I finally give in and just make it excuse me I put dust into the thing I did my part I did the 50% okay I did my part oh we have a lot of yeah there's a low stakes good good on you for the dust good on you for the dust I'm out here making big plays okay yeah yep I've always I've always said so thank you it's cool so I need the steel hammer which I think you probably still have on you know I put that back really yeah where did you put it back in I put it back into the chest by the door that contains most of our tools that we usually need I believe that goes to grab although that's poops and it's poops dude I hate that what are you talking about one out at it fine out oh I was here see yours is worse what I was just walking I didn't jump and I bumped into your livewire that's that's a bummer dude it's bummer yeah is I'll be okay no don't concern yourself hmm I hope I did this right this may or may not be the wrong type of hammer where says that he put the steel hammer back yet it's not there I did put the steel hammer back okay there it is it's right there Wow Wow yeah little faith yeah thinking that I would not do my parts yeah ow sounds me don't worry about it don't worry other real no okay yeah all right there we go and then we got the oh yeah we need to make more with it right got it there we go there we go so do we I wonder if what I do with these is just swap them out for our void minor head and then we can turn it into doing other stuff cuz I really want to make the other resources but it's like hey if we want other resources instead we can just substitute the thing out Oh apparently that is how it works cool very exciting I like it I like it I've been swimming in raw sewage use the resource mind well why would I want the resource miner instead of dope ores and stuff or sound really good I neither resource miner for the minor upgrade in general oh oh is that right cranking over there this is doing me what it do here now now just don't jump I'm not that's that's not the thing that I'm referring to currently oh okay well it's hard to know sometimes you know yeah no I know well that was oddly time a resource miner get into action dad action why can't there we go over here boom cool and there's my circuit board will swap arou and then we did it Oh apparently we need a resource called Micah can you help me find Micah I've heard he's lost he's been wanting is is there a Micah in the chat wouldn't be funny if someone here is actually named Micah I'm like Micah we need you it's not that uncommon of a name so could be could be Mike are you there dude I need someone to come in here and be like yeah what's up my name is Micah hello is it Micah you're looking for it is right now correct how would you spell oh you'd be like mi CAH if you were to actually name someone Micah right you could do i or y gotta remember I'm from Utah though there's what do you mean I or Y like my CAH oh I've never seen a Y though I'm nervous you know why that's a that's a crazy that's a gnarly way to spell it I mean like as I was saying I'm from Utah which is the land of the unique spellings that's like how is AB City from Utah I don't know I've never met Absa D but I'm sure they're a nice person okay oh no the tier-2 crafting table whatever my oranges did I eat them all oh no the crafting tables here to help me I don't know if AB City is from the from from Utah but you know who absentee is no idea it was a mother who decided to name her daughter ABCDE I mean it sounds that sounds like a Utah name it's oh oh yeah yeah no no like there's no Utah's kind of known for like the the weird Spelling's cool cool yeah braxton b ra c KS t un as you know the kailia ka ye ly e e IG ager I mean it's just like like the goofiest like just keep adding more letters what there's more more letters more letters I've not felt unique my entire life so I need to name my child of frickin bizarre spelling so that they can be unique I mean everybody's mom was from Texas okay well there you go there's your answer mm-hmm we need a better power source like the dynamos how make what kind of dynamo should we use I mean magnetic dynamo is always nice okay we do have very little to do you say that but then you look into it and you think refine the refine circuit board is never fun but we just need do we have a lot of redstone things cooking we just ran out but I did make extras of those okay I did make extras so that that way I could have some extras and then the energy cell frame should people do one and two cool there's power I doubled up so that we would have all the power need to make down complex passes that biodiesel power source for 12 k RF protect those were those are some words like they're worse worries yeah no there was definitely words involved there out and then orange is an output yeah I don't I don't know do these connect it and can I do hip to hip is that still do do I think I still do do oh yeah definitely draining the power just well I don't know what kind of Dynamo we're supposed to be making so I will avoid that for the time being the advanced crafting table though I wonder if we're supposed to get the tungsten steel now from the yeah that's that's an unlocked the advanced gravity table isn't it fun it's fun I think I like it what's wrong you don't like it we also need to probably get more I don't know if we get tungsten Sealy I mean check the thing and see if we've gotten tungsten steel up there okay check that thing see if we've got it up here you check that thing you check it good hey that's actually I mean if we have a biomass one that we can hand like these hemp seeds is stuff too like if there's an RF that we can work from the oil or seed oil then that might be a thing to think about hmm thing to thing about Oh thing about sprayer play biodiesel if you need I owe diesel quite we do need more ash I don't know any of that stuff works you don't know how any of that works that's immersive engineering we did all that in the stems mm but when I say we I'm using it kind of loosely whoo boy there's a lot of advise going on about that and I don't think I have the ability to really right now yeah ow it's a lot go not careful don't jump you appear to have placed a netherrack on the roof it was listen mistakes were made yeah it's happened they just you didn't want to get rid of it though I was busy doing other things that were important one and two more realize your shame very important things and very important things are being done at that moment okay okay well anyway I guess I could wear out everybody can appreciate how important the things that I was doing where I think it's ash through the diamond gets this tungsten if we want to do more or we can just wait on the void miner to do it I'm not really sure Frick I do I'm gonna do this what are you gonna do tell me what your plans are tell me what oh god no no stop man nope give me back you did it wrong Lyle Frick Oh Frick where the aah where did it go check the vacuum hopper wait or the chest oh I don't know what you're missing where's the overflow go I thought it was supposed to go into this chest wait what how how how does this eluded you so badly like where did it all go wrong tell me tell me your story where did the god dang it dude okay so you know how when you when when stuff comes hey what are you looking for when stuff comes up through here uh-huh isn't there anything that doesn't get filtered into the compacted or is supposed to go into this chest yeah and then that just gets emptied where's the chest empty - what are you looking for the power thing yes it's over here where where does it empty - this is your controller okay so all the all these extra think you have it some piston you have some redstone you have an outer class means we should probably oh we can't route some of these dang yeah yeah I mean you know there's a lot of different things that we could probably do slightly better other than you know we haven't so at the moment we haven't because we didn't but if we did then we would that was a string of who saying things that just went off the rails I was exactly I said everything I intended to say and more alright so Vance crafting table is always gonna be the old tedious one rhodium oh and then the void or oh my god tier two yikes additional machines Oh powers a steam dynamo magmatic coal generator oil generator biofuel oh so that is part of the chat so okay that puts us in a direction so steam dynamo we are supposed to make right now dude I got this I can do it you got this you get get to work on that steinem oh man dynamo all right what do we got requires miniaturizing things right no it doesn't know it does good the restaurant transmission coil requires a circuit yeah or the tediousness where that comes in but it does not require miniaturization yeah okay let's see what we don't hand it let's see how many is that we're doing that's its new can the server a little cuz it's cooking pretty good probably the old dynamos you know we think so but it's just it's anticipating the glory that will be my dynamos it doesn't know what to do with it I'm getting some ash to feed in so that we can get more dust so that we can create more redstone mm-hmm so we can all have a party and if I were smart I would do it less the way that I'm doing it and more a different way but certain things I've never claimed to be apparently I do not have the ass oh wait it cut off slightly early it cut off a little bit early I I do have the ass I don't have the acid that I need but then I did have the acid but then I realized I needed to put the circuit board in there and then do not have the ass but I know I think I've been anybody people have commented that that's that's an attribute that I actually have it's just okay I'm glad that coincided with obviously my front page slot like moving ever so CLO to start seeing this so it's a good first impression hopefully yeah it's good it's people to see it to meet you and find out about you and your well well-endowed that's something completely different yeah once the the product the other is the the Frederick if anyone can word salad a what today was leg day though so it uh-huh you got the seat basically the moral of the story is he is he works on his squat skies III didn't do well I did kind of do squats today he didn't do it no I didn't cleans today which included so my clean regimen is that I will do I'll do a clean and then I'll front squat and then I'll drop it and then I'll repeat you know ladies don't forget you can check his Instagram for pictures you don't have to do that but you should follow me on Instagram because I've been stagnant for quite some time dude oh that was a selling point right there you follow me I've been stagnant please please help I need it oh I thought you meant about posting not but not about no no IIIi don't know there was said there was a time period where Instagram was doing some algorithmic things was getting a bunch of followers and then everybody winded up following me ended up being like wait why am i following him so now I'm going through that cycle of people on unfollowing because they're like I didn't sign up for this who's this guy this is not the content I signed up for yeah that's that's story of my life man so I get you I get you it's the story of your life I'm sorry man yeah yeah you got you got people on instagram who are also confused by why they followed I mean I wasn't speaking specifically of Instagram as much as just you know as a creator just everywhere general yeah yeah I was just trying to make it sad you know trying to bring a little levity through a sadness you know the hide the tears that sort of thing mm-hmm I got you dude I got you yeah I appreciate it you got my back well now that the another front page is actually is kicking in here dude I almost wonder if you started slightly late and missed your first slot I kind of think that might but you were there it's I was that was definitely I was live two minutes prior to 7:00 so or if he missed your highlight I don't know it was interesting I know but people were saying I was I actually I did look on the front page and I just had to scroll over like five things and I was there it just wasn't one of the primary slots so okay maybe it just maybe they had another thing you know sponsored deals happens the Chester Krauts it was Bud Light at the number one slot and I very much doubt the twitch was like really like you Bud Light we drink you a lot in the office and we just want to give you the the graciousness of that old front page root that front page remain I wouldn't put that past DJ weep but baby you know love that Bud Light dude I've never had a Bud Light in my life I'm sorry I'm late I I have had but I had a Bud Light last night and I didn't mind it did you really I'm just not very nice here I'm a pretty basic  when it comes to this like it's just I hate right demonisation demonetized I'm a basic person but it went and I just like I know that the beer snobs turn their noses up and that's fine like you can drink your fan your nicer stuff I'd sign him fancy but just nicer it's just it works for me so I ain't worried about it you know one of these cuz I'm not a huge beer guy but sometimes you just want to kick a drink back in and worry about it just don't worry about it yeah I I don't know I've just I don't like beer I'll take a cider it's gotta have some sweet to it beer is just just not it's just not my thing believe I say it I wasn't its I don't know if it's an interesting story I think I like I like anything you until you were like sixty you didn't like beer it's an acquired taste okay so imagine all the words I learn things I would call you if you weren't on the front page I know I'm still I'm protected right now I don't know but I was selling my first condo and oh his first one dude not as secondary homes or anything my very first condo that I owned I was selling how about that such a Boomer he owned a condo I'm not telling you the story anymore okay guys if you're interested in hearing the rest of this story then come over to twitch.tv slash zine and you can hear the rest of it okay anyway continue along about your condo sale okay no I was a and I had hadn't planned on like having it sell really fast and it turned out that the people wanted like an accelerated sell like they wanted to sell in like twenty days okay and I had listed it and I was working on the basement I told the realtor I was like you know no I'll finish great wake up your condo at a basement yes it because there's different places that have different styles of condos this is more like a duplex kind of thing it was actually it's very townhouse he but was considered a condo but it was three floors it was alright at any rate I was repainting the basement I was redoing it and but we wanted to get it listed and get it started this is when I was back when I was married and so I didn't actually realize that you would share that okay cool I'm not anymore so the I told the realtor I was like let's get it listed but now I'm perfectly fine committing to finishing it and and that's not a big deal and he was like okay cool and then it's sold in two days oh and they didn't care about that they know they wanted it finished but they wanted a quick sell so I suddenly had went from like all this time to now I have like three weeks to get the this entire basement I'm just redoing when the sale was contingent on this yeah and I had a trip that was in the middle of that and it was a trip that had been planned for a long time to Cancun so it was like a special treat and it was literally landed like right at the end of the period so it was like I instead of having through what I expect to be like six weeks I ended up having to and so I just sometimes sometimes you got to just really look is this isn't realistic and they really if you had said like look I can't finish this in the two weeks but I pledge to get it done you while you're living there I like I'll cover the cost they would've been like no the clothes like be out of the place right no but you can you can still if something is impossible to finish you could say like look it can't be done that quickly but I will cover the cost or we can take it out of the purchase price or something like that would they walked I don't I I didn't want to find out okay you know the price is what we were looking for everything was there and so it was let you know yeah sure I'll figure it out so I was working full-time and then I'd come home and then I and that was back when I was working a lot harder at my day job and so I was like working till about 7:00 p.m. I'd come home don't let his boss here this he's not working hard this days anymore and then I'd work from there until about 3:00 and then I'd sleep and then be back at work about 7:30 and that was when my life for like two weeks and so I was just dead I managed to make it did all the deadlines all this to tell you a story about beer which is that I made it to and I was so dead that all I could do is basically just sleep for the first three days and all I had was Trey let Jake uh room service cake & steak and then they had room service it sounds it sounds delicious what's all right basically lived off Corona trailer che cake and and steak and for like three days and I didn't like Corona going into that by the end of that trip I was like wow I'm surprised it wasn't the opposite so it was kind of like you know when they say it's an acquired taste I was forcibly acquired to it through exhaustion and an inability to move what do you know and that it was a very long-winded story about many different things but that's how you end up getting to where you're like but like that's fine yeah just so it just sell a condo that people confuse people as the town house kind of nice all you got to do I'm glad to you that I mean that sounds great two weeks to get your ask even if it was a little stressful it's better than it was you languishing day-to-days Wow this is when they made the offer it was like good what yeah and what did they just come in and ask what do you mean they come in to that no oh yeah yeah yeah yeah in fact we they the bank actually wouldn't we didn't like work out things because the bank wasn't willing to finance as much as they were offering or you know let's set the mortgage because the appraisal and all that so we had to work out anyway was its banks I pray mortgages suck but yeah and then I ended up living with my in-laws for several weeks because we because I was waiting to the house that I was built and it wasn't ready because we had everything it moves so fast so that was fun too gotcha all right well we are definitely nearing the end of the
