I was surprised.. because all the staff were in it together... [Were you annoyed because the notes were similar to 'Solarsido' / Avoid answering]
- You didn't like it, right? Honestly.
- No, it was funny! It was funny. [You got me]
Don't lie, it was the same notes with 'Solarsido' That's why you didn't like it, right? [It's time to open the love of Moomoos]
There are so many amazing things! I am not interested~ [Tattling to Moomoos]
You saw, right? When I said I am doing YouTube, her face was like 'What?!' I am Moon Byul. - SOLAR : Use this note.
- I am sure it was because [I need to change the melody to have Solarsido's permission?]
I stole Solarsido's melody. [The quality of the snacks is amazing!]

SOLAR: It's fun! SOLAR: Since thereâ€™s no audience SOLAR: Since I'm a human being I got a little bit drooped. SOLAR: I always heard my fans routing for me SOLAR: And I thought even though I'd make moves connecting with the audience SOLAR: Our Moomoos would still do the same at home SOLAR: So I just did it one by one SOLAR: And then I came this far. [Q. How about an acrostic poem with the word Mak Bang(Last performance)?]

SOLAR: No. I'm not SOLAR: It just felt like this was all so long.. SOLAR: Since I didn't have my Moomoos by me it just felt like I did it for like a year SOLAR: If I had my Moomoos with me it would have been really fun SOLAR: But it was just working in silence. [Q. What is the most memorable performance in the past two weeks?]
SOLAR: I think all the stages were great because it was just two weeks. SOLAR: But it's my first time working solo SOLAR: I was more nervous than when I was a rookie during 'Mr. Ambiguous'. SOLAR: The four of us always performed together, and to do it alone I felt dumbfounded SOLAR: I was so nervous, and I was like this without my Moomoos SOLAR: And by the time second week I got used to it.
