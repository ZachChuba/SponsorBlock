went inside a man and he groped near the heath and horde his hands wrapped around an ornamental bauble and he who were sleeping had been tricked by thief's cunning and he was enraged for he was not at all in control of the worm horde this passage was written some thousand years before Toki never said quilt a paper to write The Hobbit in the 1930s it's a neck straight from lines 2 to 11 to 2 to 20 of Beowulf in Old English epic poem talking even explicitly references this passage in his own language Bilbo it heard tell and sing of dragon hordes before he grasped a great to handle cup as he be as he could carry and cast one fearful eye upwards smoke stirred a wing opened a claw the rumble of his snoring changed its note tokine echoes the terms used in Beowulf in this passage with Bilbo earning the title of thief and burglar throughout the story and Smaug is depicted as being a worm throughout the story and his hoard of gold being a central feature to the book and now as heretical as I know it may be to say the fantasy genre did exist prior to Tolkien Lord Dunsany 1924 the king of elf hands daughter features a fully realised elvish culture with marriage and politics and magic system 1905 s time and the gods features a detailed creation mythos built from the ground up like we see in token Silmarillion Lewis Carroll's 1865 Alice in Wonderland features a young curious protagonist on a fantastical adventure who strength is in her courage and not her sword arm these tropes did exist in one form or another historically but Tolkien's credit comes in that he codified the ones that worked into a single text with his own spin the Lord of the Rings but I think that the legacy of talking is more complicated than that most people know that he'd defined the fantasy archetypes the pointy hair gray beard wizard these slightly Aryan elves the Dark Lord and the D&D classes of characters basically what D&D party doesn't have an annoying rogue a snooty elf and a fighter that charges right into combat before the rest of the party has time to plan no while much of his legacy is in codifying these tropes that we identify with fantasy I think talking changed the fantasy genre more through the tropes that he left behind let me explain fantasy has long been termed as escapist literature stories wherein the reader can escape their worldly woes and fulfill desires but for a long time the escapist ideal of fantasy was quite literal books like Alice in Wonderland's and George MacDonald's fantasies featured characters who literally escaped the real world and woke up in a fantasy world with the end of this story usually culminating in their return to earth stores like The Wizard of Oz or Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales had created stories for children and about child characters who though they may go to this wondrous world of color and whimsy do in the end need to return to the real world and confront responsibilities these worlds were whimsical and often designed not necessarily to make sense but to communicate a theme relevant to what the characters needed to learn for when they returned these fantasy worlds weren't designed to be real and a trait of this unreality of these fantasy worlds was that time would pass differently usually more slowly compared to the real world a way to signal that consequences would matter less because things didn't really happen time isn't lost it's more akin to a dream you can see this legacy even in Tolkien's contemporary CS Lewis who carries on this escapist model throughout the Chronicles of Narnia telling stories about children who come to a land where time passes quickly but must eventually return and confront their issues back home this was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia Sizzlin that by knowing me here for a little you may know me bitter there the characters come to Narnia to know Christ so that they may know him better in the real world and the result of this is that the feel of these stories is remarkably fable-like with the world itself exists dependently to support theme more than for its own sake and this is the important thing here remember this this was a hallmark of the fantasy genre at the time and this fable istic suspension of belief was seen as a childish thing as CS Lewis wrote in on juvenile tastes the specifically childish taste has been generally held to be that for the adventurous and the marvelous we're educational and moral motives may come in all together this framework of tropes made it so that fantasy stories were catered for children and it's because of this collection of tropes that fantasy could be marketed and sold rendering the genre largely inaccessible to adults and here's where we get to token token chose to leave these Terps behind and instead fight for what he termed a secondary world into which both designer and spectator can enter to the satisfaction of their senses while they are inside but in its purity it is artistic in desire and purpose middle-earth it was a wholly invented world rich in culture history and most importantly language my work is fundamentally linguistic and inspiration the invention of languages is the foundation the stories were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse all of this gave a depth to middle-earth that's stripped it of the childish unreality of fantasy before this deep world building mint that middle-earth existed independently of theme as if it existed before the reader ever encountered it there's a greater sense of consequence and weight to things that happen here then in the whimsical fable fantasy worlds of before simply because middle-earth makes sense it feels real it exists for its own sake if childish stories are defined by their unreality then this gave middle-earth a sense of maturity the thing is that most people who read Tolkien only once tend to forget who was who what they do remember is middle-earth itself it's got all the properties the soul and the presence the depth the personal quirks and the feeling of an existence at sign to the books that Catherine Kerr people and more importantly adults could engage with the text on a different level in cultural analysis linguistic study and the historical contexts in which Aragon says little do I resemble the figures of Al India land Isildur as they stand carving in their majesty in the halls of Denethor I am but the heir of Isildur not Isildur and some people didn't need to suspend belief to believe in middle-earth there's a deep sense that there's so much more going on than what you're reading on the page fundamentally it was the advent of deep world-building that found a new audience for the genre rather than change the genre itself and talking leave behind a number of other tropes to help with this shift the characters were no longer escaping their troubles and effect our heroes are nearly always thrown into the meijer of narrative unwillingly and the clock is always ticking down to apocalypse main characters like Aragorn Frodo and Gollum aren't children the timelessness that defined these fantasy worlds before was left behind there are long lasting consequences to actions in middle-earth insofar as the characters and thus the readers are concerned middle-earth is a real world it doesn't exist to hold up a theme and that brings with it an odd maturity in 1955 critic professor Ronald Barr perfectly summarized the shift and the fantasy genre in saying Lord of the Rings is not for children nor is it for the whimsy lovers and Alice in Wonderland quotas there are no little visits to one's childhood his appeal to the intellectuals is therefore interesting he had created a fantasy story very accessible to adults but here's the thing about genre a little secret that I'm gonna let you in on no matter how much ink literary theorists spill over how to define genre and what the hell it really means because apparently this is a very complicated and very very controversial topic I've gone to a long argument with a friend about it once what really matters in the end is the dollar sign the book fantasies a fairy romance for men and women by George MacDonald tells the story of a not oz a 21 year old man who discovers a fairyland puts together a fellowship to fight evil spirits and Giants a story featuring kobolds and a deeply magical adventure which culminates in destroying an object of dark magic and it was first published in 1858 but it only sold a few thousand copies even though it contained many though not all of the hallmark tropes of fantasy today it didn't spark a new genre the way that toking did in the 1950s toki and even recognised the influence of mcdonald head on his works but the Lord of the Rings sold 50 million copies by 2003 and a hundred 50 million by today in other words talking did fantasy bitter as if these works before hand were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown they were but trifles this was to the extent that people mimicked his writing style and the tropes that he used for decades this idea of deep world building for secondary worlds was so influential that one man's passion for linguistics became a cornerstone of the genre with people going to great lengths to design languages with the same depth and originality as elvish like a stamp of authenticity in the fantasy genre so yes genre is about a collection of tropes that define a type of book but it's more about economic demand only if there is a sizable audience for a specific collection of tropes is a genre recognized around those tropes young adult fiction is a recent example of this as more young people picked up books specifically about the youth experience the genre was born because it could be effectively marketed to an identifiable group of people part of the reason that science fiction/fantasy have taken so long to be recognized as their own distinct genres from one another is then throughout the 1920s pulp magazines like Weird Tales began to publish fantastical stories for a wider American audience these were fantasy authors like HP Lovecraft and Call of Cthulhu and science fiction ones like in its and I Alice in wind the Greenstar waned these stories were advertised too and bought by broadly the same audience because it was still pretty niche and that's why the genre continued to solidify around token s tropes because that collection of tropes could be marketed and so publishers slated of books that echoed it like the Sword of Shannara and the Thomas covenant series it's not really because elvish languages Dark Lord's and westernized fantasy lands are inherently built into what fantasy needs to Brants Anacin actually has a really nice quote about this fantasy didn't mean the genre where the author creates his own unique sitting and meant the genre where the books include elves dwarves wizards and quests in a sense talking popularized but also confined the fantasy genre as he changed it even if he never meant to and only since the 1990s have we seen a lot of real deviations from this confined definition of fantasy toking changed the fantasy genre yeah but I think the Lord of the Rings is a more interesting case study in how a genre is form and what fantasy means as a genre fantasy is still escapist literature but it's not because people are refusing to engage with things that matter the temptation powers of the One Ring explores how those already in power are more susceptible to corruption and succumbing to it while there is power in humility and a humble life innocence I think talking changed the fantasy genre in a way that changed what kind of escapism it was an escapism for adults Escape is evidently as a rule very practical and may even be heroic why should a man be scorned if finding himself in prison he tries to get out and go home the world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it people often ask me how [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
