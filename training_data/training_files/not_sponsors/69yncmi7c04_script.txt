okay so the key takeaway for this video is that I am stunned by the degree to which this tiny little indie startup game has completely trounced Pokemon sword and shield by every single metric when like Game Freak is literally the best funded game studio on the planet at this point I mean there's not really much else I can say at the intro so I guess let's just dive in and talk about what's up with tempted [Music] okay so I recently made a Pokemon video and Pokemon fans really loved that one the title of that video really sums up my feelings which is that you know Pokemon is now the laziest most stagnant franchise in the whole Nintendo stable whatever you want to call it it feels frozen in time its visuals show that this was clearly a 3d sport its online functionality is complete garbage the game lags down to like 15 frames a second when you enter the wild areas while playing online the wild areas are just big empty fields the game is ludicrously easy the combat is one-dimensional and overly reliant on the super effective counter mechanic I could go on and on what's the video but like the longer the short of it is that Pokemon there's rivers of money flowing through this IP they could do absolutely anything they want with it and what they do with pokemon sword and shield was so far short everyone's hopes and dreams like imagine the best possible Pokemon game you can imagine that the game we've been dreaming of since we were children Pokemon southern shield was meant to be that it was the first one on consoles it was a huge moment a huge opportunity and it felt completely squandered by a game that was just like half-assed from start to finish yes I'm sure this video will attract the same liked ratio from Pokemon stands but that's okay let's continue so it was during the reception to the video that everyone was spamming me and then we're like hey dude check out this Tim Tam thing and I'm like okay cool looks interesting I'll take a look it's pretty damn impressive Tim Tim is a kick starter that is unashamedly trying to just be Pokemon but better it actually describes itself on its Kickstarter as a massively multiplayer creature collection adventure inspired by Pokemon catch every Tim Tim battle other Taymor's customize your house join a friend's adventure or explore the dynamic online world so that's pretty clearly like hey guys we're doing Pokemon but different come check it out and at this point I'm certainly quite keen on that I know a lot of other people are as well when I jumped into the closed alpha just a few days ago I expected something really lightweight something with a nice hook that makes you go arm yeah cool I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes but like this alpha I I was so stunned by like how much was in this Alfa and how polished all of it was I had vastly more fun with this Alfa alone than I did my entire time playing a Pokemon sort of shield and I only did a quarter of the available content here in ten hours I finished only the first of four dojos and I captured only about fifteen or sixteen of the total 75 temped hem and every inch of the content I played sparkled with technical polish design insight and pride [Music] so yeah things begin in character creation you obviously can go through that it's small its lightweight there's not a huge amount there but it does get the job done there's also additional customization available throughout the game where you're able to you know collect new outfits as you go and you can press the pause button and you can you know reconfigure your character at any point in time and that's it so customization is a thing but don't expect anything too massive it's quite basic now let's quickly talk technical performance this is one area where I was super impressed okay so obviously I played this on two machines one of them is an RT X xx atti AMD rise in 3900 and the second machine is an i7 5700 k with a gtx 1050 on my Rison machine i got 0 frame drops I'm talking like I'm running this thing at 144 French the entire time I mean maybe a dropped once or twice but this thing is rock-solid man like for an alpha this thing is incredible with how well it runs it's just it's beautiful I could not have expected this level of performance from an alpha on the other machine the Intel machine R with the less powerful graphics cut I did definitely get some framedrops were talking 30 to 40 frames but I was also running like OBS at the same time as I was doing that there so that would have taken a performance hit and the other machine it wasn't doing that this game runs really well man and given how far away we are from release things are only gonna get better so already like well done devs that's that's a good job already so you might be saying well of course it runs well like it's really simple graphically and that's partly true like you know graphically it's simple but I think it's quite striking it has a very breadth of the wild desk kind of look with really vibrant colors nice shadows really strong angular line work giving everything a lot of contrast and pop look this is already a much much better looking game than Pokemon toys obviously a lot of people are gonna say are well obviously that's an unfair comparison because Pokemon is running on the switch versus this is on PC no that's [ __ ] like breath of the wild runs on the switch man and it looks incredible the reason that Pokemon sauna [ __ ] looks like ass got nothing to do with the switch hard way it's because they didn't try here in tempting they've actually tried to make a good-looking game and spoiler alert it's very good your adventure begins as all Pokemon style adventures do which is that you are the Pokemon wait Tim Tim Tim Tim person and you need to go out and do Tim Tim things like collecting them and catching them and training them and battling them and all that sort of stuff so feels very familiar if anyone was to level criticism at this game very fair criticism you'd say this feels a bit too Pokemon like it's not really taking a lot of risks and I would definitely agree with that certainly in the kind of like structure and style the general feel of the game as you're stepping into it it's unmistakeably Pokemon it's not really deviating from that formula in any meaningful or interesting way and you'll feel that the minute you get into that game world as for the game world itself like yeah it looks really nice it's quite large actually like the first area alone that I explored with the first dojo was massive and as I said it took me about sort of 10 hours to make my way through it in terms of breaking up the different areas the different towns the different sort of mini bosses grinding my Pokemon we'll come back to that later yeah there's a fair amount of space to be had there and there's also Metroidvania style unlocks that occur as you beat different trainers you will unlock new things like for example when I finished the first dojo I unlocked a surfboard allowing me to then just go around and explore the water areas which was really nice I could now catch new Tim Tim etc etc so yeah the world stuff as I said it's very familiar it's by the book but it works and it looks nice and it's cool and I enjoyed exploring it sadly there's no voice acting you kind of get these like kind of cute voices like sim style voices it would have been nice to have some voice over it was definitely something that was holding back Pokemon at this point but these guys are a small indie studio I'm very happy to like cut them some slack on this hopefully we'll see some voice acting added as the game furthers its development oh and the writing the writing is actually kind of cool it's got like a cleverness to it you know as you read different things and you're like interact with the characters they've got interesting things in Pokemon no one talks about anything but Pokemon it's all they talk about like being the best Pokemon that's it they've got no other interest in like just Pokemon in Tim Tim the characters actually have other interest they have other things and that actually leads to side quests there's actually Quest's in this game where people lose things and you're gonna go and find it for them and whatever else you have to catch a specific type of Pokemon for them and bring it back they're small the rewards aren't massive but it's a nice little like hey I'll do this while I'm here it feels good so with all that world building stuff out the way it's time to catch some tempting right out of the gate Tim Tim impresses with its catchy soundtrack and its really nice combat animations this was something that I was quite sort of like critical of in Pokemon sort of gelled where I was like calm these animations kind of sucked they look really good here and they put a lot of work into them and they get more interesting as the Pokemon involved the developers have actually foreshadowed some really interesting ones so yeah like great work on animations already that's nice as for combat itself I think this is really what I appreciated about Tim Tim the most and what felt best to me as I was playing through it first of all every battle is 2v2 straight away so that's really nice and you can actually do all of these battles co-op so you can play the entire game through co-op and when you get to a battle screen you are each controlling one Tim team which is really nice now each Tim Tim has a unique trait for example stuff like caffeinated which means that they can't ever be put to sleep or friendly-fire where like they're immune to sort of like offensive spells from your fellow Pokemon or whatever else combat plays out very much how you'd sort of expect if you're familiar with Pokemon games which is to say that it is turn-based and the characters are each taking turns to use their moves based upon the different priority associated with each move so a high priority move will happen before a low priority move you can do speed up buffs to make those things change there's lots of different status elements that can be applied to different Tim Tim for different reasons it all sort of like feels quite familiar and comfortable but there are some really key differences that set it apart one of them are the different affinity abilities or synergy abilities which is to say that certain tempt em have abilities that become more powerful or higher priority or apply different status buffs when they're used alongside a specific type of tempt em so my little crystal bro here when I'm using him alongside a flying Tim Tim then one of his specific moves is going to get a buff and become higher priority and deal more damage it's going to be extremely efficient to use that I'm gonna use it a hell of a lot more so all the time I'm thinking about what kind of status buffs or debuffs do I want to bring what are the general sort of stat distributions that I want to bring because each Tim team have their own stats and then who do I want to be pairing them with on the battlefield at any in time and I was very often like switching tempt him in and out based upon those affinity moves so that worked really well I really liked that it was a nice touch the other thing is a stamina meter which basically throttles you using your big bomb moves all the time so each move costs stamina you're more effective or more powerful moves costs more stamina and so I can't just you know continuously spam out my big nukes I kind of need to be smart about what I'm using with Pokemon sort of shoot when I was playing it I was just constantly pressing the most powerful attack I had over and over again and when I ran out of charges or whatever I go recharge at the station and then I'm back to doing the same thing so boring I can't do that here because within the space of one battle I will run out of stamina within as little as three moves and then when I run out of stamina I actually damage myself if I continue to use those moves and then I need to like wait rest to the next turn etc it really just results in a more intellectually engaging combat model than just like spamming your most powerful attacks all the time so I really liked that I thought that was great one of my other biggest complaints with Pokemon shield was the whole super-effective thing if it's just too powerful man like it's just too much you know you're constantly just trying to find the super effective counter and spam it and you just one-shot your opponent's one after the other you can't do that here in Timm Timm because the health pools of tempt hem are much larger which means that yeah you can still do twice the amount of damage but like battles are just generally longer and slower and you know just because you get a big super effective hit does not mean that that Tim Tam is going to hit the floor so it's a really strong rebalancing of that super effective mechanic just the way I would have wanted it to be when I was complaining about Pokemon sword and shield so again like well done developers this is a good sort of like solution to those problems and the other thing I guess I'll say as well is this game is definitely more challenging than Pokemon at this point your Pokemon I just never had any challenge at any point in time I never had to use my brain once but with this one straight away like you will die unless you're paying attention you will like you actually need to think and you go like the stretches between the different villages and the dungeons and like they're really long and if you aren't managing and resources really precisely you will not make it and there were definitely some times where I was on my last potion and my tim-tim roster was completely wiped out I had like two dudes up and I was like please get this attacked make it work don't die etc and I you know I made it through it that feeling of like just hanging on by the skin of your teeth through these encounters through these dungeons etcetera feels really good it was completely absent in Pokemon it's really present here in Timm Timm immediately and I've really experienced the first like forth of the game's first 10 hours I really genuinely wonder how difficult it's gonna get in the future I guess one to complain I might have is that it's a bit too grindy at this point I definitely encountered a few instances where I would have to go and like grind much lower tempting than I was currently on because I needed to get ready for the dojo battle or for senior trainers or whatever that didn't feel good I don't love that I know it's a sort of standard part of the genre I don't find fun but look maybe people like that maybe people like grinding stuff to get ready for the next battle I just found it a bit too over tuned it would be great if the devs could just whine it back a touch as for the design of the actual temp team this is something that I think is just really subjective I've definitely seen different perspectives on this some people think they look awesome and they're just as good as Pokemon or better some people say they don't hurtle candle the Pokemon it's like what's the point of playing temptin when the creatures aren't cute enough like I've literally seen that for somewhere I sit somewhere in the middle I do think Pokemon does a better job of designing its creatures it's Pokemon than Tim Tam is doing but I still think the terms em look cool you know I like them and there's some of them that really stand out for me and I haven't even seen all their final evolutions and stuff yet so that's gonna be interesting to see but overall I don't think it's a bad job I think it just comes down to personal taste okay so that's the overview of the game it's early access at this point it comes out on the 21st for early access so I was in the closed alpha it's open alpha on the 21st early access you will be stunned by how polished this game already is and how much content is already there there's four dojo 75 temp temp to collect numerous regions but the thing is right it just it just feels like what Pokemon should be at this point you know you as soon as you load in you're immediately surrounded by trainers you know it's so you have to go to the wild area then use system lags down to 15 frames a second and it just all works seamlessly you can play through this game co-op you can immediately start training and battling with people in like casual or competitive play you know like just just from the ground up this sort of says ok what sucks about Pokemon and then how do we make it not suck for our game like that's essentially what this game is you know and as someone that really really dislike pokemon sword and shield I really really enjoyed tempt him you know I definitely as I look back on that reveal may-maybe I just hate monster collection style games or you know whatever like but now having played temptin I'm like no I was not the problem pokemon sonic shield was the problem and tempt him is the solution like it is like it's just I think it's that good to see something this polished at this point of its lifecycle I think is fantastic well done congratulations - looking forward to seeing where this goes in the future go and show them some support to go and grab it on Steam or whatever or it's going to come to other platforms in the future it's gonna come to Xbox ps4 and switch I think it's gonna be big guys like that's my prediction this is a solid game and you should check it out anyway that's it thanks for watching and see you next time thanks for watching the video and thanks I'll see you next time the way [Music]
