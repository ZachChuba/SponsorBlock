I could tell the moment I saw you You're something special I could feel it in your eyes I could feel my heart dropping Fly like the butterflies
Na nan a navillera Let the wind blow Fly way, away So I can reach you
With all my heart Let's start fresh, you and me The love I envy, please don't let me down I'm going to show you how I've been feeling I won't wait any longer Back at the starting point Let's speed things up a little Let me get myself together And I'll come forward Bloom like the flowers
Na na na navillera I'm still just a shy girl I'm nervous too Our voices, so full of excitement
With all our hearts Let's start fresh, you and me The love I envy, please don't let me down I'm going to show you how I've been feeling I won't wait any longer I've been waiting for this moment And I'm with you who've always kept by my side I'll make it come true, like I always do Wake from the dreams
Na na na navillera Someday, you and I I hope we can build a future together
You're more than enough for me Let's start fresh, you and me The love I envy, please don't let me down I'm going to show you how I've been feeling I won't wait any longer
