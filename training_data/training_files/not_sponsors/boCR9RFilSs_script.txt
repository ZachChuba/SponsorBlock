you might be surprised to find out that eBay isn't just for used video games and bootleg sneakers that's a spife 350 you can also find all kinds of mysterious items like this cheeto that looks like a Golden Retriever or this cheeto that looks like Vanilla Ice or this cheeto that looks like bold and brash aka belongs in the trash alright the weird side of eBay isn't quite what it used to be so let's take a trip back to the year 2000 back when the weird side of eBay had a bit more of a mysterious aura and then allegedly haunted painting took the internet by storm this is the story of the hands resist him [Music] to start your 14-day free trial of crunchyroll premium the early days of eBay were primarily characterized by just how ridiculous some of the weird items on the site were especially when you got to the more supernatural things they were all sorts of supposedly magical or haunted knickknacks up for sale alongside depreciating beanie babies at that point it was almost entirely what the site was known for for example I vividly recalled the owner of one web site I think it was ex entertainment.com had dug up a jar of dirt from his backyard and sold it on eBay as a magic kit for $20 but on February 2nd of the year 2000 a listing posted by an eBay ur name mister no reserve was taken a bit more seriously it was of a creepy painting that depicted an angry looking child standing next to an eyeless doll behind them was a door with several hands reaching out from a black void the listing read as follows when we receive this painting we thought it was really good art a picker had found it abandoned behind an old brewery at the time we wondered a little why a seemingly perfectly fine painting would be discarded like that today we don't one morning our four and a half year old daughter claimed that the children in the picture were fighting and coming into the room during the night now I don't believe in UFOs or Elvis being alive but my husband was alarmed to my amusement he set up a motion-triggered camera for the nights after three nights there are pictures the last two pictures shown are from that stakeout after seeing the boy seemingly exiting the painting under threat we decided the painting has to go please judge for yourself and these are the pictures of the characters allegedly fighting in the boy leaving the painting to me it just seems like they made the side of the picture a little bit of red but I have no idea how such effect could be achieved they finished a listing off with a warning warning did not bid on this painting if you are susceptible to stress-related disease faint of heart or unfamiliar with supernatural events by bidding on this painting you agree to release the owners of all liability in relation to the sale or any events happening after the sale that might be contributed to this painting this painting may or may not possess supernatural powers that could impact or change your life however by bidding you agree to exclusively bid on the value of the artwork with disregard to the last two photos featured in this auction and hold the owners harmless in regard to them and their impact expressed or implied now that we got this out of the way one question to you emails we want our house to be blessed after the painting is gone does anybody know who is qualified to do that clearly these people were in a big rush to get this haunted painting out of their home although I guess not that much of a rush considering the $199 starting price but you know a bit of a rush almost immediately after it was supposed to the listing spread all over the Internet mostly due to the fact that so many people found it to be completely ridiculous but there were some people who were taking it seriously there are some people who responded as though they could feel the haunting through the internet there were those who claimed that they could feel at unease just by looking at and some people even said that the picture made them sick the listing began to receive several thousand views and it received a number of questions which were answered in the following update that week the size of the painting is 24 by 36 inches so it is rather large as I have had several questions here the following answers there is no odor left behind in the room there were no voices or the smell of gunpowder no food prints or strange fluids on the wall to deter questions in this direction there are no ghosts in this world no supernatural powers this is just a painting and most these things have an explanation in this case probably a fluke light effect I encourage you to bid on the artwork and consider the last two photographs as pure entertainment and please do not take them into consideration when bidding as we think it is a good idea to bless anyhow we still welcome input into that procedure so at this point it's pretty clear that the seller really didn't expect it to go that foreign and gotten a bit out of hand they were obviously backing away from the haunting narrative and even went so far as to debunk their own stakeout and the line about considering it pure entertainment is the go to cover a statement when selling haunted things on eBay even to this day because the thing is on eBay you could get banned for selling intangible items like you know ghosts or souls or things like that as the auction drew to a close the seller posted one final update the auction is nearing the end I want to thank the more than 13,000 people that took the time to look at this image on eBay I appreciate the more than 30 suggestions that I received regarding blessing the house exercising and cleansing seven emails report strange or irregular events taking place when viewing this image and are literally two suggestions made by the sender's first not to use this image as the background on the screen and second not to display this image around juveniles or children last not least thanks for appreciating the art as well and on February 12th 10 days after the auction began and it accumulated 30 bids and it's sold the price of are you ready for this one thousand twenty five dollars it was purchased by a user named Ionia 7 shortly after the painting Ionia 7 was interviewed by a website called surfing the apocalypse dot-com most of this interview were evolved around why they would buy such a painting and if anything happened after they received it what attracted you to the Haunted painting were you interested in the piece more for its artistic value or for the legend that went with it visually it seemed like a good composition the artist displayed a certain professional handling of the medium and the subject matter was compelling the legend seemed like a good marketing ploy but I was buying it to sell how long have you had the painting since March 7th has anything unusual happened with the beading if so describe I wish I could report a bizarre happening or mind possession type of thing but the unusual thing started happening with the first email and counting prayers and quotes from the Scriptures for a man of faith advice as to how to cleanse my residence of this evil thing from a Native American shaman and Mississippi reports of people being repulsed made physically ill or suffering from a blackout / mind control experiences I've been informed that over thirty four thousand people on ebay alone have viewed this item people want to know how could I live with this sort of thing or want to buy a life-sized reproduction if anything this is the real story I had never received an email before that wasn't from some online porn site and the only apparent reason I get these is because I fit the profile perhaps most importantly though it was through this interview that the internet learned the name of the painting it's some more information about its origins have you been able to find out anything about the history of the painting I was hoping from the detail image on eBay of the boys face that given the crazing of the pigment the painting would date from the 1920s or 30s that generally would make an economic difference it probably was completed in 1965 to 75 it is titled the hands resist him which i think is a very interesting name it is signed but I'm not releasing that information yet a good example of surrealism from that period just call me a lucky bidder on eBay the painter was later revealed to be an artist named Stoneham bill Stoneham hadn't thought much about that painting until the year 2000 when Ionia 7 contacted him to find out more once he learned about his work sudden internet fame he took to the Internet to share more information about the painting according to Bill it was painted in 1972 and inspired by a poem that his wife wrote also entitled the hands resist him he is of the seeing visions his strokes reveal them in a rush of color of madness of mystics and his head is the highest center it must confront its enemy the hens resist him like the secret of his birth his presence is the sanctum heartbeat Felton darkness and passion its sound the sole gift to that silence bill said that the boy in the painting was based off a picture of him as a child the hands reaching out from behind the door were intended to represent the alternate lives lived while dreaming and the eyeless doll was intended to be the boy's guide through the various dream worlds a very different narrative for the one presented by the original eBay listing but that's not to say that the painting wasn't without its own set of mysterious circumstances both the owner of the gallery were hands was displayed and the Los Angeles Times art critic who reviewed my show were dead within a year of the show I'm sure it was coincidence but some of what I paint resonates in other people opening the inner door the first purchaser of the painting was a character actor named John Marley who you might remember as the guy from the Horsehead scene in The Godfather and while he's often mentioned as one of the deaths associated with this painting it should be noted that he didn't die until 1984 over a decade after the painting was purchased and most likely after it had already left his possession and as it turned out the lucky Bay bitter Ionia 7 turned out to be the owner perception Gallery in Grand Rapids Michigan Ken Smith although he originally bought the painting to sell at a higher price he'd received a number of offers over the years and turned them all down even some as high as six figures considering that he had only spent about $1,000 on that wood a massive profit so I guess at the end he just couldn't bring himself to part with it to this day it is still in storage at his gallery only occasionally being displayed for special events such as one that he held on Halloween of 2013 that was covered by juxtaposed magazine and people's interest in the painting still continues according to Bill Stoneham he still received several emails about it every single week he's even been commissioned to create several sequels to the painting a piece in 2004 entitled resistance at the threshold in which the boy has now grown up into an old man and Adele began to transform a piece in 2012 entitled threshold of Revelation which depicts the doll fully transformed into a real girl and a prequel in 2017 entitled the hands invents him which shows us the view from behind the door in the original painting in an interview with The Daily Dot bill Stoneham was asked why he thinks that so many people are still interested in this old allegedly haunted painting to which he responded we live in an age of science of Revelation and hard realities and hard facts but we are still drones the mysterious stone and said and what is more mysterious than paintings more than any other object paintings are one of a kind thing created by someone using their hands and for now that's the story of the hands resist them if you like this video
