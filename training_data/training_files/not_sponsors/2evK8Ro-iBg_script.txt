Challenge is the actual rooftop and if you're to fall off this rooftop you have like a 99% chance of dying so I have to get back to set that steam shooting lifeline like to leave this project of the handshake and rent they had 10 days to this done they have day of prep 2 days of shooting two days of editing and then one week to do all the sound music color grading visual effects basically they have to get done in a very short amount of time so it's really up to Jake and rent to work together Ren has all the visual stuff figured out he knows how he's going to do all the effects whereas takes the early effects guy but he can run and shoot really well the with them and we really want to keep working with them so hopefully Jake and Ren do a good job on this top floor all right we're trying to get this input shot figured out businesses that they place on a rooftop in this show here we are on the rooftop we're going to be shooting here we are challenge is the actual rooftop but we need seems that the actors are sitting on the edge of the roof actually have scenes actually standing on the roof it's these electrics fall off the edge of the roof and so we can interlace VFX magic land which costs way too much money or just enter stunt wire magic land with some really time-consuming week so I got to think of a solution alright and in real space there's obviously nothing there I'm literally just walking through a wall but that's in that equation you like I'm in very good club to tag and you're like oh I'm gonna tag here you can't do it for another place especially for focusing on just the wall we can literally just put up a light about the camera next to light and put the people in front of the light but the people are just offering from your camera so we're literally just looking at their shadows so like this should be a hundred sent and we should throw some different lights just some different distances Brett backpack Yanks from his back that's just practical string tied to the back tied to the bag the demon pulls him again try it practically will be it we'll know in a little bit cut it out I'm sure we'll have enough light I think I got to figure it out so we built this here creature we actually replicated these walls on this platform and raised it all up Oh so we could go up there and filmed Eve on the ledge with the cityscape behind them and it looks like they're on the edge of the roof but they're actually not it was actually a relatively elegant and simple solution that gets us from filming on the real ledge and filming on the fake ledge yeah come here it looks really sitting on the edge of the roof of Nikko that's like 12 or do you want to look up duty calls for itself it's tricky because we're on the say group we can't show the fact there's another roof be on the show guys let's roll camera please great nice work so there was certain amount of time every day from the scenes and the time each step takes about half an hour you know it's a puzzle taking all this dialogue and breaking it down so that cover each character in the faces if you have to camera streets you're basically looking at one angle establishing the space here we get close-ups in you're doing a wide because they'd be able to get the microphone in the shots what do we do the close-ups like if it's two cells who need it stylize it a little bit so that shows interesting to watch we're trying to set up both cameras here a dolly shot and then this shot but probably gonna see this camera from the dolly but thankfully we have enough time to do one into the other we have time to see what happens in our third set of labs on like a dolly moving camera or something else that maybe comes up with just something I come up with get the show looking awesome whether it's he were saying today Ben's in New York filming with Dwayne the rock Johnson yeah yes be there for three days waiting for a 20-minute window to film with a rock but did you a tree eight hanging out the rock attorney knows so this light is going to be our prop light if you also you know work it's a light but we're not going to depend on this buddy actually shadows that we do this deal with sudden we're actually using a more advanced piece of technology known as LED lighting Thank You shark we're going to be shooting this all on sticks which means like tripod engines and dollies I don't really know what to expect right so let's go through the blocking really quick come in flip around the grandeur of this old warehouse one of the demons brass but they physically grab you though they grab your shadow and that affects you by cop of you like get back and this base is your death position if you like this oh and even and then our end comes in right after that and defines your back on the ground like the lightness here that's from the the light reflecting off of our reflective ground up and kind of making the shadow a little bit less opaque and so with the do between there that's absorbing the reflected light so that we get a nice harsh shut up what's up guys is Sydney Park here she's like Nora on lifeline wants to ask you a couple questions I'm actually kind of curious your on walking dead right yeah so how does how does a set of walking dead compared to this set okay well your setup set of walking dead we are in Georgia in the woods there are no sound stages we're working with the heat were working with humidity it's a really like big crew obviously because it's a huge production but it when it's dark no games are played it's just this like fun and friendly as it is here everybody you know it's so close knit and we work very closely together and that's what I've loved about both sets definitely been so much fun and working on this bed and you know you and Sam set a really great tone oh yeah they're going to be directing Marvel's doing a lot of their events even on the set of walking duplicate I have I heard that you guys have worked with him he's in me I have a really funny story about him actually yeah and said she was running to get some like shrimp pad thai for me and my mom so I'm like great that's so cool you know I'm going to come downstairs with like cash and give him the whole [ __ ] right and I just met him maybe like 15 minutes before it turned around like all sweaty it was bright face and this big white smile he's like hi I'm Steven I was like yes you are I think hi Steven nice to meet you comes to hotel you know he's act like the food and sherry the teamster was like driving us wait finish the damn story it's so good all right that's good this time when you push the bottle lean on the ledge and watch it fall all the way down to the imaginary street great I think the beetle good you think about my image to like show that resolution the two things that come to mind is you know the term like setting your jaw yeah so you try that what's like you know or it means a fire I wish I had a beer to work with yeah yeah thank you everybody makes it so much more dramatic you fiction work right right doctor name is Bulls are and your mission is peaceful looks like your one mission in life okay Emma ghoul what's your name Gulzar what's your mission so what's your name goals are what's your mission eats already man you're ready you one action your ring your breast but for a little bit by taking gaff tape attaching it to a piece of cardboard sticking that cardboard right on his cheeks that when I pull them across the floor his 200 pounds doesn't affect me as much easier he looks calm there - there it is again oh it's gone wait so your favorite story real quick okay so even though I've almost took my shrimp pad thai and I'm standing there and he's like here you go and he's like he opens it and he's looking at he's like oh yeah that was good and he's giving me like a look I'm like what do you want to do right so let's do it here's like reluctantly gaming so that's my seat auditory get to work with him yet so most of our food and so he was so sweet and generous he bought it for me really well like let me give you cash he's like no no no no take it and sherry the drivers like he's trying to be nice sweetheart I was like oh okay thank you thank you we shall finish filming the magic will commence Oh magic magic so much since this concept is based around kind of like a monster demon we want to give them claws so I'm going to show you a cheap convenient and pretty easy way to you make demon claws how I mean is a regular piece of paper you take your piece of paper to look at it portrait wise take your right end and fold all the way across and increase now we're getting to it a series of triangle that so then you take your left side that you've made your point connecting it to this crease here so this is the triangle you want to get to but we also don't want to waste paper fold it up here fold it up here and tuck it up face your base shape but now that we're at the triangle all we do is take our point again point right down the middle to make the shape of your cloth but it's not really you can really stick your finger and it's not actually a claw yet but it's starting to take its shape what you do here is just fold over all the excess paper and it only really takes two folds so one to change your shape almost there but you're going to have this little extra flap all you got to do is tuck it in there kind of make sure it's nice and tight fold it and all that did was make a nice little pocket for your finger so you just open this up make you taking shape BAM we got a nice monster call with that kind of that scary-looking knuckle kind of similar to a ring race in Lord of the Rings or something like that hey you know who's Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his favorite youtube channel is the nerdwriter Channel one of my favorites as well in fact my favorite video that he's put out is the one talking about helms deep from the two towers it's an awesome video really kind of analyzing and deconstructing just how it is as a scene and how that's just great storytelling in general I recommend you check that out at the end of this video a 39 minute sequence it has to carry the dramatic weight the ups and downs of a mini movie within a movie to hold our attention intelligibility is really important for a giant set piece like this not only do you want the audience to be able to see what's happening you want them to have a sense of how the fighting is developing for each side
