welcome back to new rockstars I'm Erik Bosse in Rick and Morty season 4 episode 3 one crew over the crew cruise Morty reveals that Rick hates high steep lot twists so much that he creates the world's most elaborate heist one that includes genocide just to stop Morty from selling another heist to Netflix with all the endless exhaustive double-crosses it's a bit tough to keep up with all the jokes and deep cut references that are flying past us so let's go back through this episode's scene by scene for all the subtle animation details you might have overlooked boilers ahead let's get started the episode opens with Rick and Morty making their way through these ancient ruins morty scales a cliff wall while rick hovers beside him eating lunch if you look closely the bag flies past us you can see he's eating Arby's and this whole gag was lifted from a scene in Star Trek 5 the final frontier in which Kirk climbs El Capitan and Yosemite and Spock floats beside him and hover boots Kirk Falls and Spock saves them just as Rick does for Morty here they zip up in these anti booby suits to protect from the booby traps and these ruins all a nod of course to Raiders of the Lost Ark including the boulder love that they included the dunk when it hits them and it's probably not important but I love the detail that was put into the design of these ruins and the ancient culture at once was like notice the statues are wearing backpacks and beanies and headphones and they appear to be writing segways as if this was some hipster culture that collapsed under the weight of its own smug and one of the travelers makes total waste the snakes a nod to these snakes and Raiders of course but also to Rick's recurring use of snakes and his trick where he makes people think he can turn people into snakes I always keeping a spare snake of his leg instead of treasurer Rick is disappointed by the contents just like the Nazis were disappointed by the contents of the Ark of the Covenant but in this case it's a reference to another Harrison Ford movie an origami horse just like people work on a unicorn in Blade Runner a calling card from Miles Knightley a heist artist aka hipster dick whose adventures are 60 percent putting a crew together and 40 percent revealing that the robbery already happened and he's not worth our time because he's a hack piece of [ __ ] Rick's anti heist rant is actually based on co-creator Dan Harmon's hatred of the heist genre films like Ocean's eleven inception now you see me and yes I would argue the latest two MCU films spider-man far from home and Avengers in game both of which were centered around heists but I went into the real reason harman might hate Marvel and the reason I'm sort of explained so go check it out Marvel fan culture is definitely a target in this episode though as they head to night police heist con modeled on comic-con notice how it features its own Hall H Rick's pride at one scene a professional tear badge and refusal to buy one is a joke about industry types having too big an ego to buy a convention badge there are booths for pocket grappling in nightly vision goggles and a nod to ocean 12 an ocean 13 star Catherine zeta-jones o siding with Catherine's alpha through omega Joneses and the way you enter is by cutting glass circles like they do in high school easy the attendees include cameos by the nerd from blitz and chits in the morning night run episode this guy's taken really off the grid another guy he's safe he later snatches the mailbox that Rick chucks the crystal skull into Rick tries to check in as a professional he's a getaway driver with Asperger's in my butthole is a demolitions expert Rick is referencing baby driver another heist film in which the getaway driver has a condition that some like described as such and his demolishing butthole as we saw his mecha-giant form to last episode and rick assembles his crew with a jazzy team assembly montage with music and editing in the style of Ocean's eleven each of his teammates he greets with a hand grasped and a you son of a [ __ ] parody in the trope from predator in the Fast & Furious films the movie macGruber also included a hilarious parody of this kind of putting the crew together montage it also ends with an abrupt twist and I love how Clark got a gig playing the piano when clearly his fingers are way too massive to ever be able to play piano keys Angie Flint appears to be a lara croft inspired heist ii adventurer with cybernetic swiss army knife hands at rick Moxa's impractical referencing his own super practical cybernetic inserts that actually show up later this episode and then there's truculence tur truck in which the monster is a vampire is a nod to the putting the team together montage and Ocean's eleven within Mormon brothers who race monster trucks also in this demo derby is a ridiculous banana car and then after putting the team together they return to get their con badges notice how each badge has the image of Knightley's origami horse in Hall H we meet miles nightly voiced by Justin Theroux perhaps a nod to his pointless master codebreaker character from the last Jedi and he finishes a story of a recent heist police stole the paintings because the police were us in police outfits he's referencing the heist in Ocean's eleven which ends with the thieves disguising themselves as SWAT officers and the Thomas Crown Affair which features an elaborate art heist Rick bypasses security lab coat rip off dr. strange Rick is referencing the cloak of levitation from dr. strange which also could be a nod by Dan Harmon to his own uncredited work in the Doctor Strange film in which she said that Marvel used none of his ideas another example of how this episode is targeting both the heist genre and the MCU the MacGuffin that Knightley proposes stealing and the heist off is the Crystal Skull of Horowitz reference to the Crystal Skull and the crappy fourth Indiana Jones movie and possibly Rick and Morty staff writer Dave Horowitz and we meet Knightley's ate a la ocean's 8 which includes snake arms double microwave monitor Lourdes key catcher in shapeshifter it's plus the three from Rick's five which the number is eight and five is kind of like yeah ocean's 8 and Fast Five their heist involves swiping keys while pushing a hotel towel cards just like the Ocean's eleven crew did and in our vaults just like in Ocean's Twelve and this vault contains a parody of American Gothic but Rick reveals that his real crew is really just the robot heist Oh Tron and during this we get a glimpse of the heist screenplay that Morrie's writing with the words approaches and his misspelled there's also a lame twist about a dead body being a cake before I continue link in the description below Rick uses hiset Ron to assimilate all 3,300 convention attendees to be in on it and they rip house tightly to pieces as always the violence is horribly graphic they rip out his bones and grip cage and skull leaving the skin as a droopy mask another looter steals the head of Abraham Lincoln not the head of the late a bridge or Flagler from season one different guy and a combat ties to Tron from assimilating everything in existence as part of his crew Ric instead assembles a random team including the return of mr. Cooper butthole now professor poopy butthole who Benton's off karate attacks with students using his cane and slow-motion berserk combat skills similar to hurts in the Kingsmen movies they also recruit the Greek god Hephaestus who works in a volcanic Forge I love the detail that he can lead their reflection in his hammer and then they find ventriloquist us claw an alternate reality Elon Musk but with tusks Elon Musk actually voices his character in this episode last March he changed his Twitter name to Elan tusk has a reference to his role in this episode notice how Tom was designs on his dry erase board feature coils wrapped around tusks as if his tusks were like the flux capacitor style inspiration for his inventions meanwhile hiset Ron applies lame obvious heist tactics to steal a planet's core it disguises itself as a security guy with a nametag Hank a pizza guy with a nametag Tony he crushes the planet's surface with a colossal security camera and a pizza box that drills into it kills the entire planets population I like how the news-graphic says zero injuries and on one of the screens one of the residents was peeing in a corner at the moment of this but the one resident we see escaping is attacked by angry birds as he flees into the mountains with wildlife the whole planet gets wrecked and looking back on this episode yeah again we must acknowledge that Rick committed a genocide just to stop Morty from selling the script and Netflix and Rick introduces Rando Tron instead of to heist movies I slept through Rando Tron's algorithm is derived from the plots of three David Lynch movies I pretended to like to make my friends shut up yeah and Rick's mind the narrative opposite of plot II contrived heist movies is the surrealist non plot stories of David Lynch like blue velvet mahalo Drive and Twin Peaks Rick passes the time by playing Minecraft as he did with Morty in the episode the Praetorian Morty dates and due to ventriloquist knowledge of the stars not being properly aligned Rick realizes that the earth has already been heisted with a night sky playing on a pre-recorded loop a nod to the trick that they used on Dennis Hopper in speed a brief shot shows the earth in a massive rate of collective planets along with other ones like Uranus with a bite taken out of it spikey Ramos it's got an Illuminati I may be a nod to bill cipher from gravity falls krump Bigham em nine nine nine nine Zippo big Pluto Mars fran drescher lekar probably a nod to Fran Drescher tzimmes slump and this has a big butt maybe it's the butt to mention that we've seen before and Schwing probably not to Wayne's World and then in the lower right corner screwby something flew be doop yeah probably another one of these nonsense words it just to roil it just likes improvised Randa Tron sends them all on random bits of Estes eats precious brand diapers and vomits groceries and then does one-handed push-ups on the roof then shrill aquiver runs in circles on a polar icecap Tuscola puts a turkey in the freezer then bakes the fridge items morty subscribes to a boring looking history of new york podcast and professor poopy butthole runs a cattle auction and all ends with rick confronting highs to tron on his space station heightening in a series of impossible to follow double crossings reference obviously to the NORAD AI tic-tac-toe climax in the movie war games and both heisted ron and brandon tron are voiced by dan harmon all the commentary about how robotic and formulaic hi sorry's coming from his voice directly morty makes his pitch meeting at netflix which looks exactly like the exterior of Netflix's actual sunset bronson office in hollywood and hallways there are posters netflix your movie here and weirder stuff three four yes stranger things three but we learned morty losing interest in his own pitch was all an inception style heist by rick who waits outside on a ship just like how brad pitt waits for clooney outside the prison at the end of Ocean's eleven to give him a ride and Rick eats a lollipop throughout this episode as a nod to Pitt in that movie who's always eating candy and junk food in every scene and finally in the post-credits scene ex-professor poopy butthole realizes that Rick must have trained to all the students karate to attack him and they see dark storm clouds forming on the horizon and Rick says could be a twister upon not just for a tornado but coming additional twist oh wow Morty twists a Rubik's Cube last episode similarly ended with gathering storm clouds we'll see if this storm on the horizon and is indicating some darkness looming in on upcoming episodes the next episode won't come out for another two weeks in December but they will be titled claw and hoarder special victims Morty probably a murder mystery SVU episode and rattle star Rick lactic ax a Battlestar Galactica episode so let me know what you think this post-credit scene could be referencing in the comments below
