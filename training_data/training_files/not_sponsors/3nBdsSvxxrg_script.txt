there's so many things going on here that's wrong idea what you want to be on your stomach shoot that thing when you are in an urban environment it's absolute chaos yep dead chicken did it get bird sup guys I'm Jason Patrick can be watched in some modern warfare 2 whoa you guys dig it make sure you like subscribe to game ology EFC let's send the freaking new guy I don't remember that part that was pretty epic there just like we're here to kill people in to bubblegum and I'm all out of gum is that a war crime killing civilians yeah that's um that's a war crime non-combatants with no weapons that are standing there yeah yeah that's that's no bueno look yeah the Ambo box it's a drum yeah it real-world is plastic the plastic green it looks like a a que variant magazine if there's so many things going on here that's wrong I don't know about you I hate to carry that 240 like that the entire time idea what you want to be under stomach and shooting that dink yeah the best position for that weapon the guy that's crawling quite obviously needs to just he killed see there you go it's what you get for calling around just in general I would say this would be frowned upon by the international community yeah I love how they stop and just ride the escalator down with some mall music in the background so PFC Alan is integrated with this group right so I see just rolling through with these guys just waylaying civilians yeah that's not legal in any way shape or form here's the good one for you the US Air Force actually has those in our inventory that Russian helicopter to the head it's a troop transport now shooting a hip and aircraft and in the air with it that's a pretty badass shot yeah you can actually fire that thing into the ground right in front of you and it will go off it's got to go a certain distance before it arms itself I love how there's commies are using American love if you're an internationally known bad guy you're making big money I wouldn't be carrying around a goddamn ak-47 I'll tell you that okay and I want them for I like it stacking on the door your door sir that was no message hey thousand baton you don't get any onions he's doubt I'm guessing that was the PFC PFC is like bottom of the barrel that dude would never in a million years work undercover in any kind of operation and PFC is deluding through the Army or the Marine Corps that demographic of age is usually eighteen be like 21 I see why he got smoked you don't saying he's he's PC Joseph he doesn't have a Russian accent definitely super Hollywood like would probably never happen it's on fire everywhere is that does that shut the dill it looks like they're getting ready to torch just dudes kneecaps well they should have show them where there's a hand drill trust me the bad guys in Iraq Afghanistan a hand drill is the weapon of choice you know I really wished in real life I had a heads-up display any time there was a grenade around me yeah for sure I'd have less bullish embedded in my [ __ ] hand if I had heads-up just play for remains that's like magazine number five great dude's got like magazine just wrapped around his leg yeah it's not like I mean I have a 12:12 magazine chest bridge and that's a lot of weight yeah that's a lot let's just say one magazine weighs two pounds it's a hundred and ten degrees outside you've got 75 to 85 pounds of gear in your run anybody in an urban environment that's the reality of the situation goddamn nation born right here where's the rest of this dude's team is he just solo yeah I don't know I would hate to be in the students position yeah when you are an in terment environment it's absolute chaos you can get shot from almost anywhere and you need to be absolutely prepared and that's one thing that comes through on this so they do a good job with that yep dead chicken did it get bird legit I've seen the crazy combat I've know staking the knee by this blown up car and there's a dog with a Cuban Iraqi head in its mouth and I'm like looked at me and I was just like holy Sh like one of those moments like this is real life and it like looked at me and growl at me I'm like dude that's all yours man thanks you man good night legit that's a really bad situation I would not want to climb up out of that ladder taken fire you always want to be in the high ground you always want to be looking down on your enemy and shooting at him you don't want to be looking up because you don't have the advantage for sure did they just both fall out of the window under that car that's how it works man you always fall out of a window under the car it needs to be an explosion of the background same time this is like a popcorn and candy of videogames right here it's like a fun short shooter game and it's all entertainment that's it you shot a chicken which was really cool that was the highlight of the mission Bela is not a war zone it's a cool map but obviously it's unrealistic run through a shaky town shooting everybody be routed I'm glad that 99% of you people watching this will never experience this you know dudes like Patrick and I like live with this daily and we chose that route and laughs you did but it only not everyone order and we're doing a good job by keeping the war outside of our our own lines here [ __ ] yeah another PG version of that please you're being mean so if Patrick makes noise it's it cuts into your audio [Music]
