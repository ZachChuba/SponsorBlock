this video was sponsored by curiositystream in partnership with my streaming service nebula hey happy friday this week nvidia made the graphics cards compatible with arm chips from mediatech we got some promising news for android smart watches and some new right to repair rules were passed in the u.s our quiz this week requires you to identify 20 smartphone classics from their photos see how many of them you can get right links are in the description and welcome to the friday check out [Music] okay my release highlights this week start with the realme gt master edition which has a funky suitcase inspired rear cover designed by japanese retailer muji and i think it looks absolutely fantastic finally something other than glass then my personal favorite new release was a louis vuitton bluetooth speaker that is about as ugly as a speaker can possibly get the company calls it a multi-sensory experience because it has rgb lights and it costs 2890 cool cool yeah that makes total sense and finally the community favorite of the week was the oneplus nord 2. and i can definitely see why i've played with it for a few minutes and at 400 euros this phone feels almost as good as the twice as expensive oneplus 9. i'm happy oneplus hasn't given up on providing value completely just yet as always to see all of the new releases and their details go to the crowd app and upvote your favorites to let them rush to the top and to let me know which ones to pick next week okay my first story of the week will be nvidia making their graphics cards and fancy gaming tech like rtx compatible with arm processors and linux showing off a demo at least of playing games like wolfenstein youngblood on a gtx 3060 and a mediatek processor called the companio 1200. the demo screen capture shows a version of arch linux in the background so i suppose that's the software that they actually used but mediatek's website refers to the companio specifically as a processor made for chromebooks and since those run on a modified version of linux as well i wouldn't be surprised if this setup could technically support chrome os in the future too and since nvidia specifically said that their tech would work on arm in general i wouldn't be surprised if other chips like those from snapdragon powering windows pcs would be supported in the future as well of course this was just a demo so far plus most games aren't really optimized for neither linux nor arm at the moment so i wouldn't expect masses of gamers switching to chrome os anytime soon but the implications here are quite interesting arm processors on both windows and linux computers have typically been stuck in the role of low powered options for thin and light machines so far but with more and more advancements like this maybe in a few years we could have high-end machines running arm on those computers as well okay and my second story of the week will be a ton of news around where os first qualcomm admitted that only 40 million aware os watches have shipped with qualcomm chips since 2016. that would mean on average maybe 8 million units a year for the entire platform pretty much and just to put into context how little that is apple alone has shipped almost 13 million units in just one quarter according to counterpoint none of the top five smartwatch players used wear os last year which kind of explains why both google and qualcomm have almost forgotten about it in the past but it now looks like there will finally be a significant revival for the platform first google has completely revamped the play store on watches making it easier to use as well as the wear os section on the play store on phones with better discovery and the options so users who have apps on their phones that have companion apps on the watch can finally install those right from the phone beside that qualcomm has announced that they will be launching a new wear os processor after ages and they have also launched a wearables ecosystem accelerator which is an industry alliance designed to bring together 60 different companies although we don't actually know what exactly it will do or how it will help anyone yet and finally samsung's upcoming wear os processor has also been leaked which will supposedly run one and a half times faster than its last one so it looks like after five years of google and qualcomm and watchmakers just sitting and like pointing fingers at each other and saying you do the first move no you take the platform seriously no you do it after all of that it looks like they finally sat down and decided okay it's time to take this seriously let's work on it samsung will be launching their watch 4 on the 11th of august with all of the new hardware and software and i think that by then we will actually know if this renewed alliance has built anything meaningful or if it's just hot air after all okay and my last story of this week will be the united states fdc unanimously voting to enforce new right to repair rules this means consumers in the us who want to repair their electronics and cars will no longer have to worry about voiding their warranties and there is now even debate about manufacturers being forced to release their repair schematics and allow any independent repair shop to have access to the same diagnostics tools that were usually limited to authorized ones in the past of course manufacturers tried to lobby that consumers repairing their own stuff might cause them to create i don't know security vulnerabilities on electronics or break emission standards on cars for example but it's good to see that the ftc rejected most of that nonsense and it passed the rule anyway description and i'll see you next week
