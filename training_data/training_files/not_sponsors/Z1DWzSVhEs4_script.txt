platform to build a beautiful online presence hi there I'm a famous singer I'm a popular actor I'm an online influencer I'm sure you've heard my hit song maybe you've seen my movie I've probably been recommended to you in the sidebar make sure to LIKE and subscribe we come from all walks of life we all do very different things but the thing that unifies us is that we're famous and you should listen to what we say make your voice heard don't forget to vote it's your civic duty annoying when celebrities tell you to vote like we're these stupid peasants who have to be reminded by our betters of the importance of voting this bothers me for so many reasons and we're gonna talk about all of them today about one so brave why I'm so tired of people acting like celebrities are so brave for telling people to vote make sure to get out there and vote yes Queen thank you for breaking your silence Thank You Robbie the car no courage was had here probably like 99% of people in this country think voting is a good thing to do okay like if I had the stunning bravery to announce that all the sudden that pizza is delicious maybe somebody somewhere disagrees with that but I'm not doing something courageous by announcing something that was already basically implied and speaking of implied things too I hate old people but the implication from these woke celebrities always seems to be that old people are ruining everything when I hear this this is your world are you gonna let the older generation decide its direction for you the more honest version is this we can't legally stop old people from voting so we need you to cancel them out look I'm just gonna say if all the old people would just die America would be a much better country so true slash brave well hashtag brave you know in some cultures elders are revered they're honored they're a vital piece of the culture that needs to be preserved and respected here they're just ignorant wastes of space who unfortunately vote so the question then becomes as long as I'm letting someone else do my thinking for me whose opinion should I pay more attention to people who have been on this earth longer that I have and have more experiences than I do or someone that I saw on on a movie I don't know a few times off three the most important thing you will ever do this is the most important election of our lifetime the stakes have never been higher it's always got to be the most important one because this it's not as marketable what the stakes were once slightly higher but these stakes are still pretty high stakes please vote sure okay I'll give you this it's important which people are in charge and it's nice that as long as people have to have power over us that we get some say in the process but I sincerely hope that voting is not the most important thing that you accomplish in your life please I walked into that building and I cast my vote Wow grandpa that really is the most important thing you ever did you helped pick the leader of the free world not really the person I voted for lost but it was very good that I took part in the process so just in general that added to this will be annoying if the attitude that politics is the most important thing going on in the entire universe maybe things seem bad right now because that's the assumption people make every thought of that bow fool the smugness look I'm trying to keep this video as a political as possible trust me but I think that when a celebrity begs you to go vote we all know exactly what they're really asking you to do I don't consider myself a celebrity at all I'm more often awkwardly explaining what I do for a living to my neighbors and I am meaning people who know me but imagine if I were so smug that when someone did approach me the very first thing that came to my mind was to do this hey aren't you that popular youtuber yes I am and while I have you here here's a list of candidates that I think that you should vote for and I tell you what I'll sign it for you to play Thanks yeah if you really think about it it's dumb like what if I'm wrong you know have I ever even considered that like I have an opinion and because I'm famous other people should share my opinion and maybe this is is the most annoying part of the whole thing the fact that there are impressionable kids out there and they're going to take what celebrities say is Gospels what's a better use of your platform to tell people who to vote for or just to tell people to think themselves if you want to go vote go vote more power to you just just don't and don't vote because it's celebrity told you - okay you're smarter than that and here's something that shouldn't be so brave but unfortunately kind of is I like you no matter who you vote for wait a minute I thought you were gonna tell the young uns to vote Republican well he's certainly not brave enough to tell them to vote Democrat just stick to your dumb little internet videos and stay on a politic Sonny couldn't agree more he's on the wrong side of history but I could bring you guys together for once stay domain that squarespace.com slash cow I sincerely hope that voting is not the most important thing that you accomplish in your life please thank you hey aren't you that popular youtuber yeah yeah me know while I have you here here's a list of candidates and I really think that you should support and I'll sign it for you oh man oh man well remember
