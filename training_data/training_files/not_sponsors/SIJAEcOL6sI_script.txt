oh yeah so this is a little awkward see this right here is a laptop but it's also not a laptop well I guess it depends on how you define it most people probably expect a laptop to have things that the next talk to doesn't have like an operating system or storage or RAM or even a processor this is just a screen keyboard track pad and some ports there's a battery inside but it's not just a prop for a display at IKEA the next stop - could very well be the future of computing or at least part of using offer code Linus to save 10% and get free worldwide shipping [Music] the next talk to is part of a very small category of devices known as laptops laptop shaped shells that you can dock some other computing device into motorola was first to take a swing at this idea in 2011 with the Atrix 4G for just an extra three hundred dollars you could get a compatible laptop from Motorola's web top software complete with browser and a handful of applications it was basically like me and Grady it was lame and nobody liked it Microsoft partially revived the concept with continuum in 2015 a desktop mode for Windows Phones but well I think we all know what happened to Windows Phones for one out boys since then we've seen a few attempts at the concept but razors project Linda never arrived and there's a ton of people commenting on the crowdfunding pages for the mirror book and super book that they never actually got their units bringing us back then to the next talk - most people are expected to use it with a smartphone that has a desktop mode so Samsung phones with Dex and Huawei phones that support emui desktop but this is cool you can hook up basically anything you want to it there are some slightly janky Android Forks and home screen launchers that will work with any phone you can hook up a Raspberry Pi or a similar Micro PC for what is probably the cheapest overall configuration and if you really wanted to you could even hook up a game console to it if it's got an HDMI port it'll plug into the HDMI input that's right over right there now let's take a look at the rest of the device design-wise while the first next dock seemed to channel kind of a cheap Chromebook vibe the next off to goes more toward MacBook Air territory it's got this smooth looking blasted metal finish which surprisingly isn't actually that smooth you know it kind of gets me like a cat tongue or like a shark skin vibe like it's wait rougher feeling than it looks and the unit is surprisingly heavy due to a steel inner plate in the bottom and this crazy rigid screen like I don't remember the last time I saw a screen with that little flex in it I guess so if you're designing this thing to last for like multiple compute unit upgrades it makes sense to build it as ruggedly as you possibly can the screen is a 13.3 inch IPS LCD with a 1920 by 1080 resolution no touch support and it does have some pretty unfortunate bezels but both of those things are apparently being addressed in the next next duck which is dude sometime in July below the screen we've got a keyboard that's got a bit more dec flex than I'd like but is surprisingly nice to type on with solid non wobbly key caps and a distinct tactile bump and much of this review is actually written on it with Riley's only complaint being that the keys are a little bit on the large side unfortunately the trackpad well it's usable but then so is a car that only goes backwards the cursor jumps around sometimes when you click on the bottom and it'll drift for a half second after you stop moving with your finger also you can't even fix that problem with like a firmware update because there's no firmware like they what would you install it to on top of that the texture of the pad is pretty rough and it's kind of plastic you feeling so I'd like a little less friction and maybe a glass surface on the next one if you're listening mister next doc thankfully there's a full-size USB a 3.0 port on the right side that you can use a wired mouse with along with a micro SD card port and a headphone jack so you can stick it to the phone manufacturers and still use your existing headphones with your phone through a laptop optimal on the other side of the machine is of course where the magic happens so here we've got our HDMI in with three USB type-c ports next to it but don't imagine that you can just plug in a bunch of USB C peripherals because all three of these are for very specific purposes the leftmost one is just for charging the laptop the middle one is a standard USB c 3.0 that is intended to provide power to raspberry PI's and other devices and the one on the right supports the DisplayPort over USB C spec so that is where your desktop compatible phone would plug in we've got it right now inside instead of the 38 watt hour battery that was listed in the specs on the Kickstarter page we actually found a 52 watt hour unit upgraded it since the campaign concluded last April but the extra capacity is definitely appreciated since the next doc will actually charge your phone while it's connected no chitchat though let's talk experience who tried it out with Samsung Dex a Raspberry Pi running raspbian and some other things with HDMI outputs and well I don't really know what to tell you it's a monitor with the keyboard and a trackpad and a battery now I don't want this video to be about Dex or what it's like to use a Raspberry Pi but I will say this if you just need to do some web browsing or use word Samsung's desktop environment has come a long way since when they first showed it off with resizable and snap the windows keyboard shortcuts and a sensible UI the unfortunate reality though is that Android apps on desktop lack the polish that most people would expect from a desktop or laptop as it were operating system bringing us to the question then if you're relying on Android apps anyway why would you get this instead of say a 250 dollar Chromebook which has a screen keyboard trackpad battery and everything else the answer is most people probably wouldn't a Chromebook can do everything that a phone connected laptop can do and more and you don't need to have a little doohickey hanging off of it the whole time but the appeal of the next talk too isn't really that it's the most sensible option price-wise it's that by getting it you're participating in what could be the future of computing smart phones have gotten so advanced that many traditionally heavy workloads like even video editing are bottlenecked by the cramped user interface rather than by the performance of the actual hardware in the future devices like the next dog could allow occasional users of these types of apps to save some money compared to expensive Windows or Mac laptops and the kicker is that they get to upgrade the performance of the unit over time as they get new phones reducing waste as well and to balance some of the dongle inconvenience using just one device is pretty cool it means all your files apps and login information are with you all the time in their promo video they show a concept cafe where there's a stack of available next Docs in the shop customers grab a doc plug in their phone write their tech link and fiction then they put the dock back when they leave with their phones you stop for the rest of the day in this future there's new logins no two-factor authentication everything is just ready to go seamlessly or better yet what if there was no need to even dock the device at all and all the data could just be streamed via 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi that would be cool but let's get back in the TARDIS and come back to the present for a second here the phone desktop experience as we mentioned is just not there yet as a true alternative to Windows Mac Linux or even Chrome OS which doesn't mean though that I'm not rooting for it I really hope Samsung continues to invest in decks and I also really help Google stop screwing around and adds a real usable desktop mode to Android and enables display output over us PC on their pixel lineup while they're at it why not so for now we've got a well built super versatile gadget that can not only combine with your phone as a laptop substitute in a pinch but also be a portable monitor for everything from consoles to TV sticks to even just acting as a secondary display for your real laptop now I wouldn't necessarily recommend the next doc to to the average user but for a certain kind of tinkerer for about 250 bucks for this thing I do think it offers a compelling value the mass drop Sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones are one of mass crops all-time bestsellers with over 90,000 units sold and why not they've got an unchanged driver design and sound structure as the HD 650 meaning you get nice balanced mid-range natural sounding bass they've got a detachable 6 foot cable instead of a 10 foot cable that was based on community feedback they are super comfy the HD I forget if they're six hundreds or 650s but one of the two those are actually my daily drivers they sound pretty similar and they use an eighth inch plug that's versatile for everyday use with a quarter inch adapter if you're into that they come with Sennheiser's long-term support and new users who sign up on the website at the link below can get $25 off a purchase over 50 bucks so buy it today at the link below did I mention the link is below bye
