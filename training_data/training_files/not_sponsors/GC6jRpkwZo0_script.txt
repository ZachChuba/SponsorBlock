sike double psyche you totally thought [Music] what's up everybody Peter bikini here welcome back to yet another two minute Tuesday so great to have you here and see all of your smiling faces we're talking about content-aware fill today how to remove anything from Photoshop but there's a new way to do it it's not like brand brand brand new but the software the engine the brain the magic behind content-aware fill has advanced to something that is even more incredible it's way more usable and now it makes it even easier to get anything out of your photos not just removing people from landscapes we're talking removing cars signs buildings clouds and everything removing everything from your photos I'm not even gonna say anything more about it I'm gonna jump right in and show you how great it is but first I'm gonna show you how the old one works because then it'll make more sense for how the new ones better and just watch okay so once you have Photoshop open and let's say right now you've got this photo of the four rapper not sponsored I wish it was Ford if you want to give me a raptor I'll gladly take it let's think you've got this door that's just peeking out the side of this frame it's it's a it's a pretty good frame I like this shot but I don't want the door there so what are our options well first of all what you could do is come over here hit s and you can start clone stamping the door out but that's not gonna look as good because as you guys know when you clone stamp a lot like I'm doing right now you can kind of when you zoom out you can kind of see a stamped area it's kind of like a dead giveaway unless you're like a master at it I am NOT so you would revert to content aware fill by hitting else licked in the last so last soo yeah so last soo whatever and what you're gonna do is highlight the entire door just by coming down the side okay once that's done you would hit shift delete hit okay and content-aware fill would do his job now let's zoom in and move over here so you can see this you see that dirty taillight and like a half rim and a piece of a tire that stamped into the sand most of the door is gone yes but we've still got this problem area and that is inherently the problem sometimes as you run into using content-aware fill in photoshop so what content-aware fill is doing is it's scanning that image and it's finding an area that's like that to replace it with so sometimes it gets confused and it's stamps areas from other parts of the photos into what you're trying to delete which gives you this kind of floating tail light sometimes it's spot on like if you're doing something small in a big sky and you wanna get rid of a couple of birds it's got lots of areas to sample from there's lots of space around those birds you can delete them out boop it fills it in no problem but because there's not a lot of space here between the the raptor and the side of the frame its sampling from a very small area that's why we're getting that tail light stamped over where we don't want it this is where the new features of content-aware fill come in because now we're able to choose the area that we want Photoshop to sample which makes all the difference I'm sorry my phone's ringing in here it's driving Squarespace off Squarespace with Squarespace you can what you're gonna do now instead of hitting shift delete to activate content of where you're gonna go up and hit the edit button so do the same thing by hitting L on your keyboards select the door of the object whatever you want to remove in this case it's the door of the other truck once it select it and you see those marching ants they're gonna go up edit you're gonna come down and hit content-aware fill it's gonna open a new tool window which you can see here where we have our masked area and green we have a preview on the right side coming back over to the left side everything that's in green is where the software is taking from to sample to replace what we're trying to delete right now so it's taking from this whole truck so what we want to do is use the eraser tool that's already selected and we want to erase out to the truck because we don't want that taillight so we're trying to tell Photoshop by removing this truck don't use this part of the photo to sample out we don't want to use this we want to use the desert in the sky to create more desert and sky we don't want to use the truck to create desert and sky so we're moving it to say no we don't want this selected I'm gonna paint away in this entire truck so now watch this when I let go it's gonna Reece sample not using anything from the truck and we can see on our preview on the right instantly that tail light is gone because it's not taking anything from the truck so now we have as you can see a really clear clean deletion of that door we can output to a new layer hit OK you can see over here the background copy I can just hide that and unhide that and that is a super super clean removal of something in a photo using that new content aware via the edit button very excited on that and that's it guys that's all I wanted to share with you for this video because that is a tool that I use on a daily basis I use content-aware a lot in my photos but when this new kind of this new toolkit opened up we were actually able to select what we wanted Photoshop to sample from that opened up so many doors and made life easier for a lot of people because half the battle was just then cleaning up what content-aware fill didn't do right now it's on you and you're doing it right so guys I hope you use that I hope you get something out of it hit the like button if you liked this video give me some comments below if you have any other tips using content aware fill or we can teach each other some new tricks as well if you're doing something or you've already been using this that's amazing kudos to you I'm super excited about it thanks again subscribe if you aren't already salt assault the like button ring the bell and all those very dramatic things that youtubers say at the end of videos very much appreciate you guys watching thanks so much and I will see you on Thursday got my hat back hit the mic I totally hit the mic look it's in the frame now I really if all the things like I just suck at that so badly it's a tight little spot around the monitor and
