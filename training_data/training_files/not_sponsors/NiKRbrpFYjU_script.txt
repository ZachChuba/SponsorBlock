hey what's up guys my name is tom spark welcome back to another video today we're going to be discussing what is the best and most popular vpn provider alright guys let's get into the video back to the video links down in the description down below i looked up some of these results on google analytics and comparing the differences between these products and what people are searching for in the past 12 months so guys according to this and kind of obviously nordvpn is probably the biggest vpn provider they really do spend a lot of money on their product mostly advertising it trying to get as many people as possible to use it it doesn't mean it's the most successful or profitable or even the best vpn product but it certainly is the most profitable other vpns like ipvanish are also quite big expressvpn as well purevpn and cyberghost there are also other vpns as well that are quite popular but i think these are some of the biggest ones out there well nordvpn is the most popular by a good margin if we're looking at the data here and we can even look more so let's do the past five years to see get more of a representative sample if you know how these vpns have grown so back in 2016 on around that area going back here it wasn't expressvpn it was ipvanish we also probably could look at other things let's go ahead and take out purevpn since it does seem to be a little bit smaller let's go ahead and put in a private internet access because that's probably also a very big one so let's see how that looks like so private internet access as i expected it was probably the biggest vpn provider back in the heyday 2015 and it really really got a big spike um around there so probably internet access used to be popular more popular than anything i'd be vanished had at the time in the spotlight and um expressvpn has been kind of constant there as well um and then we kind of see nordvpn start to break away in 2018 um a lot maybe they got some significant money invested who knows why but they just started to really take off you know maybe it was their inflated commissions or the fact that they seemingly bought off most of the review sites or whatever with some kind of deals whatever the case is they really skyrocketed and here we have ipvanish still doing pretty well and if we look you know in the past um let's say past 90 days you can also get some idea of how things are going so it looks like the expressvpn and ipvanish are still kind of contested here kind of going back and forth but around um and we see a private internet access is a little bit more popular cyberghost private internet access is probably not as popular as some of these other ones so just out of these ones which i think are probably some of the most popular vpn providers what do i think is the best from the most popular [Music] i think that's going to go to expressvpn expressvpn itself i think it deserves more credit than some of these other options um they are very expensive and they have some limited simultaneous connections and they don't include a proxy however i do think they have a pretty good product it's very easy to set up and use you just copy it code and paste it in and you're good to go the speeds are very good they're also developing a new lightweight protocol which is pretty cool has some interesting kind of promises of extra good speed however it's not really out for testing quite yet it's pretty good for streaming as well although lately not so much it's been getting blocked more recently and other vpns too this reputation is pretty solid hasn't had any big leaks or hacks or anything like that like nordvpn it's not giving away logs or anything like that like ipvanish and private internet access has sold out to ironically the other vpn on this thing right here as well cyberghost the company owns cyberghost is cape or formerly crossrider a lot of people don't like cape buying private internet access because it kind of had a kind of history with uh advertising and stuff like that so a lot of people have kind of become sour to private internet access and cyberghost as well so that really only leaves expressvpn as the one to pick from these popular vpn providers if you guys want to click and check out expressvpn check out the full review it's on the tier list vpn2st.com you can also check the links down description down below to visit expressvpn this video was specifically talking about the best and most popular vpn provider and i do think that expressvpn fits that role to a t however that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best vpn on the tier list that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best vpn that i personally recommend because there are vpns above expressvpn in the tier list that are more recommended by me they're just not as popular not as many people use them but that actually could mean that they're better products [Music] so these are things to think about when choosing your product do you want to choose a product that is just more popular and pretty good product or do you want to pick a product that's least popular or less popular but actually a better product that's some of the things that you can think about when looking at the tier list to go ahead and check out vpntureless.com like i said let's look at all the rankings for all these vpns and let me know down in the comments down below if you liked this
