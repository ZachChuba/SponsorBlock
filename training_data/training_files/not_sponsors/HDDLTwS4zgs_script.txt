we've seen all the comments Linus please focus on budget parts for a change something we can afford we've heard your cries in fact here at Linus Media Group we take your concerns very seriously so here it is my friends the build on the tightest budget yet bask now in the glory of the $69 gaming PC the be quiet pure bass 600 features a versatile design noise insulation and optimization for different liquid cooled radiator configurations learn more at the link below okay so I guess before moving forward we should give credit or rather absolve ourselves of credit for this build where credit is due a little while ago while perusing the pcmasterrace subreddit we stumbled across a thread where a user wanted to build a gaming pc for under $100 and anonymous really came through for him or her specking out probably one of the most astonishing pcs we've ever seen for a mere 69 US dollars disclaimer if you actually need to build a gaming PC for under $100 it is possible get an old Bell Optiplex or something in through a used video card in it I can guarantee that'll be a better experience than what we're about to make but come on maybe that's been done a thousand times on YouTube already and we were far more interested in finding out just what kind of gaming experience could be had for exactly $69 so then the backbone of any PC is the power supply which is why we recommend the incredible Diablo tech and da series 250 watt to always be in close proximity to one of these Ram we've got covered by this one gig stick of kingston ddr2 running at a rapid 667 million Hertz this will occupy all of the one memory slots in our via VV 7000 won which by the way is still more memory slots than a razorblade 2017 now for our motherboard we did end up with a slightly different one than the original post but it has the same basic features and most importantly processor the via c7 is the heart of our build a small power single-core CPU from 2007 running at a whopping 1.5 gigahertz with via yuna chrome onboard graphics with support for the latest DirectX API if by latest you mean dx8 even at the time this was far from a powerful solution and 10 years later it hasn't exactly aged like fine wines so let's get this party started shall we we started with planning building up the machine in the only case we could afford so the cardboard box that the motherboard shipped in and installing our operating system on the only boot drive we could afford a USB boot drive but we were quickly foiled by trash Windows XP booting support so we moved on to plan B Puppy Linux only one small problem with that we couldn't even get the machine to post with the single sided stick of memory that we got for the build so fortunately this dank AF ocz gold xt c memory that we had lying around to the rescue but then more problems steam wouldn't run due to minimum requirements issues on linux so we caved grabbed a hard drive and a CD drive off the shelf began to install windows only to have disaster strike all of this excitement was actually too much for the venerable c7 on our original board and during the Windows XP install the poor thing died never to post again so a month later we have our second board from China that quite frankly looks a fair bit rougher and the fact that it came without a CMOS battery didn't lend much credence to the tested working claims but who knows maybe we'll get lucky today this time we aren't taking any chances with the Windows install so we completely broke the price limit and connected the whole thing to an SSD in order to speed up the process where did you find ps2 keyboard Knights plug this in flip the switch you want to do the honors yeah there we go alright there it is we got the post screen let's keep this right here between us that way it's a equidistant either of us can grab it easily all that beautiful Windows XP boot screen okay Wow what the hell is this are you really young enough that you don't even know how to change the position to at least I mean if you're gonna make it scary you gotta make it full scary what game first should we start with the synthetic benchmark no that's probably good for last because it might break it cool Rainbow six maybe Rainbow six oh wow I went to just start typing Rainbow six I forgot how the old start menu worked now my friends this isn't Rainbow Six Vegas or Rainbow six some other suffix this is Rainbow six oh gee Wow look at that cutscene it's beautiful Wow those graphics wow that fan manages to be pretty loud yeah I think the bearings are bad on this one because it didn't sound like that on the other one that's actually running not bad I mean all things considered look at those animations it's beautiful the whole rainbow 6 concept just didn't make a ton of sense to me like the idea of relying on AI which is inherently garbage to complete the mission rather than being a super soldier it's just crash oh you just suck okay this games no fun Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 no I know that one doesn't open ok Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 words alright do you remember game demos we're running demos it'd be so good for our job to it's like then we wouldn't have to buy games to benchmark them oh wow this actually running ok this is legit running pretty smoothly I mean that doesn't help me much I even got like some blood effects when I fell down there he's a really good skater if he can take these directions we're playing a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 yes ok how do you play this game I think I did it on console ok whoa you did a 360 no compliance all the boys so V does something how do I get up speed it keeps beeping whenever you press a key if I press finish dance do a thing and jump out of it oh yeah yeah landed it Taryn was good at a video game what the hell just okay what's next you installed tf2 on this yeah I could've told you that wasn't gonna happen well it has a DirectX 8 mode though so I was hopeful ah well let's find out if quake 3 arena will run all right oh okay now this okay what res do you think we can run at 800 by 600 she would go for it might as well push didn't like max at first well I mean okay here we go yeah no I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go any further than that okay here we go here we go hey that's running not bad oh damn it what go away all right no I haven't even noticed to kill him woods yet I'm almost dead dad if I had any shame whatsoever this would be really humiliating okay let's fire up 3d mark 2001 se benchmark alright in one car in slow detail okay 1413 fps okay so quantitatively this is not the best experience you can have for the gaming PC not even under $100 but was it a blast finding a three year old reddit post that someone obviously created kind of tongue-in-cheek to make fun of someone for not having a big enough budget and recreate it and bring it to life yeah for sure but like it's so bad that it's almost good again everything that doesn't run on it just crashes immediately yeah everything that does run on it is fun to do so there you have it $69 gaming PC right there boom you saw it here first and last skill share is an online learning community for creators
