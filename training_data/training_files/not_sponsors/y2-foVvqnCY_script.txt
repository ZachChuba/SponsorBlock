the rule was you can't talk about goku young man and you're here talking about the rooster looks like we're gonna have to get at least a tip anyway you don't even you don't even need the tip that's like honestly honestly it's even if i just cut the tip you have eighty percent of the shaft so it's okay okay no one needs to tip anyway left yeah yeah because i'll cut off the tip okay and that will leave with you eighty percent of your wow it's only a pinky what sorry yours is only pinky sized dang dude keep it man oh no i am i had an inch wait what i would feel bad if i chopped off a tip of that no keep it dude that's just that's messed up hello hello oh my god can you see me yeah wow this isn't your house this is not your house this is your your parents house there's no way you're living this well there's no way you're cleaning up after yourself this good uh yeah uh no it's uh it's just like my apartment i don't know what are you single uh no i have a girlfriend oh she lives with me she's the one who takes care of the place so all right not interested anymore i will move on to the next guest okay anybody else wanna be interviewed i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding oh uh i don't know i'm back i'm desperate for interviews there's nobody here oh yeah yeah no i think listen train brought me on his podcast recently and i think he he brought me on like the day of uh so i'm kind of i've learned this week that i'm like the backup wait jake enough yeah here it is again and i'm pissed off jake how'd you get in here same thing every time okay hey hey sorry about that that was a yeah wait what's up don't worry about it you were saying oh yeah um i just think i'm like the backup interview person for people this week so i'm like you know oh no you're not the backup jake it's the backup key you were saying keep going oh hey i've been told i'm like a dollar store version of jake actually like i'm like the discount version of him as a streamer i don't do as interesting of stuff uh i can't speak mandarin so i need to know more about you who are you uh yeah i'm uh so i think a lot of people know me as a riot games employee but more people know me now as a streamer what i don't think they realize is that i'm actually a manufactured corporate chill riot set up this strategy where they basically wanted me to stream and interact with people and seem like a real person that interacts with other streamers and tries to be cool and stuff ah at the end of the day it's actually all part of a broader corporate strategy to connect eventually i'll probably say something out of line and get fired or they'll just kind of silently move me out of the company and then another uh person will take my place so you're like a man bait uh yeah so they took probably took a look at jake and bake and was like you know we need to find someone that looks like jacob and then they chose you yeah pretty much i'm not actually good at my real job so my real my my real fake job is that i do um research and strategy for uh the r d department but i actually don't know how to do that so they were like well we think he can kind of be a streamer and pretend to work for the company so it's just you and i and it seems that we're pretty close now we've talked for a long time and you know pretty much everything about me i've been vulnerable towards you um we have this connection oh what secrets can you tell me you know i do feel pretty close to you actually right very close how do you do you want to know about the riot mmo yeah okay but you're not going to tell no i won't tell anybody okay so you know it's an mmo right so obviously it's a massively multiplayer online game but we have been studying players in league of legends for many years and uh people say too many naughty words uh in league of legends oh sorry sorry yeah like that see if that was indeed [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] oh sorry sorry yeah see you you'd be banned for that um we call that negative gaming um so what we realized for the mmo is if people are too naughty and say too many bad words and negative game too much they can't play with each other yeah yeah yeah so we're gonna make the mmo where you actually don't play with other players you play with them ai that are specifically made by riot to be positive gamers the problem is they i mean you're a technician or your technician might know this uh the ai takes up too much of the uh ram so you can only have four to eight of the ai at a time so you're not playing with other players per se and there's only like four to eight of them in the game um and uh yeah that's the mmo were you nervous playing among us are you nine dudes yeah have you ever been in a sausage fest have you ever had nine boys surround you okay and one of them has a big gigantic imposter dick and wants to pretty much penetrate your freaking butthole i work in game development so yes okay so you know what that's like okay so that's what it was like playing among us of nine dudes oh yeah so it's like every day okay cool oh yeah okay so you know what that's like but i i did i did really well i was um seventh place seventh place yeah it was pretty pretty damn good you know seven if you squint there's ten players though look look if you s if you look at the seven okay look at the number seven and squint really hard it kind of looks like number one you know there's no shame in in losing look the seventh look seven top off okay top of the little little thingy that pokes out out of the seven and what does it look like it looks like number one okay so seven and one is exactly the same yeah okay seven is just one with a bigger dick oh man i need to castrate my own [ __ ] dude i need to i need to cut off the cop i'm sorry what i need to cut off the [ __ ] i you're right i talk about roosters way too much yeah like the figurative one yeah i need to chop it off yeah yeah in a sense yeah yeah i'm gonna start chopping it off okay so from now on from this okay from the beginning of this stream okay till the end of the stream i will not talk about clock once yeah this is gonna be we're gonna have a cockless discussion deal yep well you gotta chop off yours too okay if i'm going cockless you have to go call class okay i will go cockless like the figurative [ __ ] that is do you watch anime mikko i am yeah sometimes but not really i haven't seen an anime in like 20 years the last anime i watched was pokemon so yeah i do i do watch anime yeah what you just did there that's something out of an anime that i watch actually really really yeah what what what anime is that um well it's not an anime necessary it's it's animated it's kind of anime um i don't speak japanese i actually don't know the name of it but um it's there's a few that i watch that have scenes okay i drink a lot of water you like hydration yeah it's i guess um presumably i would say presumably the characters in the show drink a lot of water they do seem hydrated yeah that's good hydration is very important for the body your name blastoise you're a very healthy boy aren't you you are a very healthy boy look at that smile he's proud of it actually i suffer from type 1 diabetes and i'll probably lose 20 years of my life as a result of it but um yeah well i got oh you know jokes aside obviously i've been memeing here but you've been meaning i've been serious oh even about the [ __ ] part oh we weren't supposed to talk about [ __ ] okay sorry that's strike one the rule was you can't talk about goku young man and you're here talking about the rooster looks like we're gonna have to get at least a tip anyway you don't even you don't even need the tip that's like honestly honestly even if i just cut the tip you have 80 of the shaft so it's okay okay no one needs to tip anyway left yeah yeah because i'll cut off the tip okay and that will leave with you eighty percent of your wow it's only a pinky what sorry yours is only pinky sized dang dude keep it man oh no i i had an inch wait what i would feel bad if i chopped off a tip of that no keep it dude that's just that's messed up do uh can you become like the next

have that's the weather blizzard's a weather i love yeah blizzard is a world yeah you know what they made that game and they're like yeah we're gonna compete with riot games to try and create esports but they poorly balanced their game they mismanaged the meta and eventually the game lost all of its momentum when it first came out everyone was addicted i was addicted i loved overwatch for the first i don't know six months i bet you everyone in your chat spammed that game for the first six months it was amazing then the meta became this degenerate gameplay of tanks up in the front and the healers healing the tanks and everyone's swarming up into this giant death ball and blizzard poorly managed the balance of it and now it's a terrible game how would you describe me ah yikes um oh well okay why don't you get up why don't you stand up for a second i gotta oh my god oh okay so dip sit back down sit back down sit back down oh my god you're adorable i want to like keep you you like oh

moodle i'll take that over soyboy someone said i was a himbo what's a himbo um what is a himbo let me see him sounds like a attractive male that sometimes a bit dim but super sweet and always respects women a male bimbo i can see a him though if i get fired because of this interview can you adopt me yes you can be my himbo there's this bazillion nut company called these nuts have you heard of it

league of legends character actually because she's wearing tights dude what do you mean is there anything else you need what what you're one of yeah you're one you got bloopers and she's wearing ties dude she's 16. uh what yeah she's 16. check the lore i don't even make that game and guess what she's 16 weeks and you just yeah wait why did they do that you're you know why that was wrong with blizzard why would they do that well oh wait your chat says she's 19. oh never mind i thought she was 16. dude you got scared though for a second yeah because they could literally just slap a number on this fictional character like for oh you know i technician could have made me 15. i don't know how old their characters are like if technician decided right now to make me 15 i would be 15 years old i would prefer if the technician made you uh 18 or older yeah same i i i definitely identify more as a 22 year old not not a 15 year old true i mean if i'm completely 22 okay listen not 22. i have 22. i don't want to say that we're projecting but i think there's this whole crew of streamers like myself and you probably a son as well probably um yeah there's a bunch of us who feel the inevitable progression and decay of our bodies uh and we feel like we're getting older but we stream on twitch and talk about [ __ ] and coomers and all this sort of stuff to make us feel young again and hip and connected with this new generation of minecraft youtubers who are eventually going to replace all of us and it's just a it's just a shallow grasp at trying to stay relevant um yeah but i fart for comedy bit would never get old or changed how do you feel about project melody would you fight her well i actually think she's lovely first personal memes aside memes aside i actually think she is um a lovely young woman a young lady and um i think she actually is a very sweet a huge sweetheart but memes in for putting in memes then she is my mortal enemy okay so listen to this what if the two of you fought like in a digital space pay-per-view that's the thing that's the future miko here's the thing about project melody though project melody is very very sweet and and docile and she would never fight like she wouldn't that's not in her lore or anything so she wouldn't she probably want to [ __ ] fight um meaning she probably want to compete with me in the ways of sex but um in terms of in terms of like that what what do that you want me you're gonna compete you want to compete with her right you want me to have a kuma off with you want me to have a coom off with project melody well if i'm gonna speak about the future of where humankind is going i think a future in which two real people pretending to be fake anime characters on an app with a bunch of people spamming yep [ __ ] and the two characters then fight in a comb off that that to me sounds like the future i want to live in so i see i don't think i do well with the ladies oh come on you must look at you you got you're all tatted up with um and you got some bling on your necklace you you clearly have money you you have um hair okay that's more than you can say about a lot of 30 year old guys um you have 29 29 you have a thick eyebrows and you have eyes and nose and lips i'm bipedal yeah i can i can walk we were bipedal you can you've got feet there's there's so many things about you that's you know that i bet you anything there's hungry hungry people in my chat that just wants to grab you and take you in in this consensual way like you know like like cuddle you you know date you miko i said i don't think i do well with the ladies uh yeah i got those in my chat that you don't uh i do well i have girls in my chat miko you have girls in your chat like the girls that i meet in vr chat anyways um i don't do well with the ladies i do well with the guys oh wait are you are you gay no uh i'm i'm straight um yeah um i mean i thought i was playing like you were straight but i i kind of thought that you might be gay oh yeah everyone thinks i'm gay yeah because you have the twinkles um yeah um you look very happy yeah uh i my um when i lived in uh san francisco i actually used to work for uh you know sony playstation yeah i used to work for them and i lived in san francisco um and uh all of my best friends who i lived there were gay and i would go out in the castro if anyone in your chat's from san francisco castro is the gay district and my gay friends would play this game uh when we were like out drinking and they'd ask all the you know guys on the street and it was which one of us is straight um and i was never picked and i was the only straight one well you you um you've you feel like one of my gay best friends you know you give me that same vibe so i can see like i i feel the best friend energy coming from from you and so now i give friend energy yeah like not not like a straight friend energy but like a gay best friend energy i feel like i actually you know what i actually think that's okay i saw some people in your chat say friend zone but i no i think this is okay because if i'm the gay best friend i think that's better than being friend zoned as the straight no it's true because yeah because you'll change in front of me right like you're like and you get all the booba photos before she sends it to her you know her man asking if yeah look nice if if it's too [ __ ] or if it's just enough you know yeah honestly i'm okay with that yeah it's better to be gay best friend than the worst one is when you're um when you are a guy best friend but you're also you're also seen as a girl best friend because um because you're still a guy best friend but she talks to you like a girl best friend so she'll talk to you about her menstruation cycle and all that you know i wouldn't really talk to my gay best friend about a menstruation cycle you know what i'm saying yeah yeah you talk to them about about the boys and the boobas and stuff yeah yeah yeah to the gay to gay best friend we talk about the boobas we talk about the boys you know how to impress the boys by showing him all the loots etc etc you know so so i'm your gay best friend now right yes so um all that stuff yeah for me right yeah of course and you'll also get brandon's dick pics okay yeah yeah okay okay yeah it's a win-win would your kiss would you kiss your homies good night yeah i've i've i've i've i i've made out with a guy before wait what yeah wait tell me about that uh well i've made out two guys before wait what well yeah so uh one was my straight homie okay this was when i was in san francisco of course and two girls were like you know we're gonna we'll make out with each other if you guys make and so i'm like i mean again for me i know a lot of guys would be like oh i don't want to do that but for me i'm like i want to see two girls make out with each other because i think that's i'm i'm interested in that so if i want to see two girls make out with each other and this is my homie like he and i go way back yeah and he's totally comfortable and so we're like [ __ ] yeah we'll make out with each other whatever somebody knows each other all right how far okay yeah i mean yeah okay the other time was with so that was a straight homie the other time i made out with a gay homie and it was like when a bunch of us were at like um uh we were up at like lake tahoe like on a ski trip all of us were like drinking we were playing like drinking games it was some drinking game where like the two of us had to like kiss or something we didn't have to make out we had to kiss right and he was so shy because like you know he he's he's he he's he's this cute uh you know cute little boy wonderful kid one of my one of my good friends he's a little shy kind of you know smaller than even me no smaller smaller little boy than me but uh he's a cutie um and he's all shy about it um and you know when when we made out i just went for you know like we were both drunk but like i was like i was like you know i'm just gonna i'm just gonna go for it i wasn't just gonna kill you know if i'm gonna kiss a homie i'm gonna make out with a homie right cause i really care hey wow what if me and brandon made out how would you feel about that um brandon is trying to start to get a scruff going on um and he he's starting to feel a bit more rougher um so you i mean yeah i'm not asking how i would feel i'm asking about how you would feel oh um i mean is there dick involved i just said we were making out oh okay okay okay just making out um am i watching do you do you want to i mean i mean i mean where would i be what i was asking for i'm just asking hypothetically like if you two were like making out then like where would i be well i i guess i guess again i wanted like where do you want to be right do you want to to watch i mean it seems like a special occasion it seems like it's his first gay kiss so i would want to be there no no it's not a gay it's not a gay kiss what all right straight homie kiss it's just yeah it's a his first straight homie kiss so i would want to i would want to be there for him for emotional support and not for horniness oh okay so yeah he'd be there so yeah okay yeah did you have fun i did have fun actually but ironically i had a lot of fun i i hope to come back on i will definitely come back on another time because oh i would love it i would absolutely love it i also really need friends so um hit me up whenever you want through the dms literally seriously hit me up whenever i will okay and i feel like we connect as again as the as
