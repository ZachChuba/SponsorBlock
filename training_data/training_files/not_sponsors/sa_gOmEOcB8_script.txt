welcome back to new rockstars I'm Eric Voss and Avengers in games releasing more and more deleted scenes on Disney Plus so if you're looking for a quick smile hey why not watch them even sadder black widow death scene and game featured an alternate Vermeer battle between Natasha Hawkeye and Thanos and watching it it's the most fully polished of the deleted scenes completely effects music it's as if this thing came right out of the movie so let's break down this alternate seen in this episode of inside Marvel [Music] okay the seat begins exactly how it plays out in the theatrical cut of endgame whatever it takes we don't get that stone billions of people stay tuned I think yes we both know it's got to be I guess we do you're starting to think you mean different people here then some alternate dialogue Natasha says I am the logical play I have nothing to lose Clint responds and I got nothing to live for so there Natasha says if this works you know what you get back but then plot twist green blasts fire at them Clinton etosha take cover as one of Thanos's cue ships and some of the necro crafts close in on them red skull hilariously disappears in a puff of smoke as if to say this would have been a consequence of earlier Thanos scenes and in-game second act after he and ebony moss can 28 teen nebulas memories to see The Avengers planning the time ice to figure out what they were gonna do this led Thanos to Morag we're 2018 nebula tried to warn Clinton Natasha about 2014 Thanos Thanos knows the last time we see Thanos to ship it continues to plow through space as 2018 MBL is being tortured by 2014 nebula in 2014 Gamora which ends with 2014 nebula finding the Pym particle presented in Sethe a nose and a theatrical cut this set up 2014 Thanos to follow the Avengers to the present day but in this deleted scene Thanos uses this knowledge gained from nebulas memory to travel to another stone destination for mere so in the midst of this battle Clint shouts to Natasha not good they're boxing us in Natasha says do we break out hit him from the back Clint strategize this okay I take the left flank you take the right save your ammo pick your targets on my mark three two bullets before Clint's can finish Natasha runs out right down the middle of no man's land she painfully takes one blast through her midsection and then she stumbles in pain but gets back to her feet she takes another shot to her chest and then one really nasty shot from the back through her shoulder forming an exit wound on the front side it is so painful to see those shots go through these characters because most of the time blasts just kind of hit them in their core with their shoulder and it gets absorbed by like armor or something so that it looks like they just took a hard punch this exit mooned reminds us of that cringey stab that stark took at the end of the fight against Thanos on Titan luckily Stark is a genius engineer with a magical sealant spray natasha has no such spray that we know about though she should all of them should when all the Avengers have the spray therefore an exit wound is a tangible sign of their mortality if your body is being blown away in chunks there only so many more chunks that can get blown away all the while Clint fights on with a sword he takes a shot to his arm so he drops his sword but he continues to fight with his knife his last attackers about to kill him but he's taken out by one last shot from Natasha she has dragged herself across the altar to the edge of this cliff and now which she looks back at Clint she sees a familiar specter Thanos himself marching up just as he was through the jungles of Wakanda and she knows that if she does not act now they'll both be dead and 2014 Thanos will have one of the stones so with the ergency raised to maximum threat level she does what has to be done and throws herself over the cliff flash of light and Clint gets caught in that flash presumably teleporting him from this mountaintop saving him from Thanos and bringing him to the pool where he will wake up with the soul stone in hand but with your feet the director said that they cut this scene because even as they were shooting it they began to feel something was off and after bringing it into post-production with editor Jeff Ford they realized that the scene would be far more emotional if the conflict was between Natasha and Clint as opposed to anonymous minion that no one has an emotional connection with and you know what I hear that but I gotta say see Natasha and Clint on the same side fighting a bunch of baseless drones well that's kind of how we've always seen them in the first Avengers fighting Chitauri an age of Ultron fighting though the Ultron drones this deleted scene doesn't really ring emotionally hollow for me I kind of love it see Natasha takes several shots to and through her chest and shoulders it hurts it makes her death a gradual drawn-out certainty something with honestly a bit more weight instead of you know what it was in the movie which I got to say yet now that i rewatch it feels a bit almost comedic like a mr. mrs. Smith type gotcha tango who's it gonna be is gonna be Natasha no it's gonna be [ __ ] no that's gonna leach and it's a dead Avenger and I don't know which version of this black widow death do you prefer the version they end up using in the final cut or this alternate deleted scene comment down below with your thoughts follow me on instagram and twitter at EA vas and follow the new rock stars and subscribe to new rock stars here on YouTube as we go deeper and deeper inside Marvel thank you for joining me [Music]
