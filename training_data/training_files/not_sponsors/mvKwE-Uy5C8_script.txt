there's a dog driving that car oh my goodness what a good boy you're so smart that's what I don't even see the person Ione how can you reach the steering wheel and the pedals little friend [Music] so today in this video we're driving a 2018 Ford Mustang EcoBoost engine yes this is the entry-level Ford Mustang with a four-cylinder engine and a four-cylinder engine and a Mustang sounds like this alright so the whole point of this episode is should this vehicle exist yes I will say or right off the bat it should exist Mustang has like the pony car you've always been it's a muscle car it's right it's kinda it's got a big ol honkin American v8 in it usually yeah that's what you think of yeah so then we got a six cylinder must any people like a line yeah people are a little upset about that people a little shook and then we got an EcoBoost four-cylinder which is more fuel-efficient yeah I focus yes how much fuel economy does your focus gets I'm averaging like twenty three point six okay but I will say that's probably because it's only a five-speed and on the highway here in Texas people are going like 85 so it's be a super okay yeah that's fair this gets twenty one city and thirty two highway 32 highway which like 32 mpg highway and a mistake it's awesome it's pretty great yeah it's not bad [Music] three three two one a little bit of tiger spin there's 60 that's fun that's fun that's that's yeah it's not scary it's just arguably a good which is arguably a good thing if you've got teenagers driving this car yeah they can get into a little trouble but that's not gonna get them killed yeah this doesn't feel like it's going to kill you quite the same as like the Viper no no that's like a beast that you're trying to fight to survive with this is very tame this is tame or tame in the sense that you have control oh it's still aggressive like that engine for a being a four-cylinder it does not sound that bad and I think it actually sounds that maybe the best sounding four-cylinder engine I've heard I love how much thanks look I love other new ones look yeah to be fair I do not like how ones made from like roughly a 2011 to 2014 Oh even earlier than that I think like all through the 2000s I know you don't like the Fox bodies no I don't at all I agree I think it looks fantastic they really figured out it looks not bad not bad for a four-cylinder this doesn't sound tear it doesn't sound terrible it's working yeah but like I was saying they I think they've really gone back to their roots in terms of looks cuz the Mustang for a while was kind of chunky yeah it was a big a big chunk is for a while yeah but now they've they've trimmed it down it's more slender it's more lean it's still muscular and kind of angry looking it's very angry look at my thing and I think that's it's a great balance that they've struck the one thing that I don't like about it is the fake air intakes on the hood like a little tacky that's very in vogue right now a lot of cars do that a lot of quotes cars or even non-performance course they'll have hood scoops or louvers are all these tools yeah I know it's common it's just a trend that I don't really like yeah I would agree with that all I will say of the entire package that is the exterior design of the Mustang I don't like the back of it all that much and I know it yeah I mean I like it but it's I don't like how angled is I wish they would just kind of cut it off it make it like square it off at the back a little bit more yeah versus the the long taper but that's it that's nitpicking for sure now the the one way precisely exhausts to tell that this is not a big point Mustang is it doesn't have like the GT branding on there doesn't have a big old GT it's got the thing it doesn't have a Cobra on the front yeah but that stuff like most people aren't really gonna notice that anyway I mean honestly like to your average person who sees this they're going to not be able to tell the difference between this Mustang and our really high performance Mustang and I think that's a big part of the appeal for for like for parents for example because your kid really wants a Mustang and you're the type of parent who's gonna buy your kid a car you can get this for $26,000 yeah and that's that's what leads into the price yeah of course this car is brand new is twenty six thousand three hundred and ninety five dollars before options yeah there are some options that you can tack on to this but I'm pretty sure this is the most pair bones basic model that is twenty six thousand three hundred ninety five dollars yeah I don't think there's any options in here it even has a manual transmission which is doc when which yeah it should I like this because I am with my car with my focus it's not a performance car so when you try to dump the clutch you're just gonna stall out your car's gonna complain but this thing yeah I was I gave it to it I just basically dropped it and you got a little tire spin a little bit of squeal and it took off yeah that's great this is a $26,000 car and you can treat it like a proper sports car yet that that experience right there just made me think this is they've convinced me that this is worth it for the price yeah absolutely man that was fun wasn't terrifying no just fun just just a blast it's just a goofy stupid thing to do yeah two things I have noted in the past of 30 seconds one shifter very nachi I like that I like a good naughty shifter yeah I'd agree with that other thing I've noted it kind of sticks a little it's the stalk the blinkers are the exact opposite it feels rubbery and squishy and it doesn't have positive clicks so yeah that's I mean that's a very nitpicky complaint but I like a good I like knowing when you've put on your blinker yeah so for theater technically technically speaking yes I will say the back seats aren't bad no they're doable once you're back there yeah it's a little challenging to get in there yeah can be with you have to of course pull the back seats I mean the front seats you have to pull them up this isn't a 2 or sorry I'm losing gel you can't even close it a 4 so stupid this isn't a four-door car yeah yeah it's a coupe you need to play coupe a you need to pull the front seats up to climb in yeah but once you're back there it's surprisingly surprisingly yeah it's snug I mean I'm like five nine and my head's brushing the roof which so if you're any taller than the NIOSH like average person it's gonna be snug it seats they're nice bucket seats but they are it's it's a snug fit and there is very very little like roomis even if people pull their seats up other than that I mean you've got two cupholders I don't think they're any back here I don't think there are any back there no you have like very minimum storage space there's like kind of like spa got a cubby here which you can fit like three four or five Wendy's chicken sandwiches and maybe more but yeah that's thing you've got like a little bit of storage space on the doors got a very small glovebox tiny glovebox surprising this does have a backup camera also most laughably small to anybody has seen our Polaris slingshot video it's roughly comparable to that it is a tiny tiny screen it's got to be like three inches yeah across yeah by like three inches tall probably it is smaller than my phone screen by a significant margin one other thing is like you clearly hear the engine in this car which is nice but besides that it's a fairly quiet ride it is it's you don't hear you like the wind noise that you hear is almost non-existent yeah animal I made a note of that when we when we got in and closed the door it was it was windy and noisy outside and there was music playing and then we closed the door in that all went away yeah this thing feel solid yeah the silence and quiet that you can get in here besides the engine it's pretty solid I feel like you only get the noise that you want to hear like yeah that engine noise yeah I want to know if this is one of the cars that sneakily puts a little bit of that engine note into the cabin through maybe use in my I don't know I know a lot of cars are kind of are doing that these days what is the competition for this car well FRS there's that for CR / laugh j / Toyota 86 yeah which costs I just looked this up the Subaru BRZ is twenty five thousand seven hundred ninety five dollars so it's six hundred dollars less than this that's I mean that's about as direct a comparison as you can get because it's also performance oriented sporty or cylinder and for six hundred more dollars you can get this and how'd you do that I would I never I've never driven the the 86 family I have and I would prefer having this yeah personally this feels faster it looks cooler in my opinion which is very subjective yeah but it's I do love to look at the Mustang and this thing does yeah it's got even though it's a four-cylinder it's got 310 horsepower right that's not decent yeah and it hauls like it's zippy yeah it feels fast yeah I mean that's the thing you wouldn't you hear that it's a Mustang with a four-cylinder you're like oh it's gonna be really slow it's not that slow yeah it's not I mean just certainly like if it can had the v6 or the v8 you'd feel quicker yeah but honestly not that much more the 4-cylinder this one the EcoBoost has a zero to 60 time of 5.3 seconds yeah which is quick even the GT 350 like not the R but the gt350 is like 4.3 I think yeah I was gonna say even the ones that like the GT that comes with the v8 is like 4.3 4.4 yeah it's only a second faster yeah and that's a whole lot less expensive yeah going into this episode I was kind of depressed and thinking I would hate this car which is like a common refrain with me on this shows a common thing with jtt always thinks he's going to hate yes cars before he actually did I never do I don't think I've ever hated a car we've driven other than the Corolla yeah well that's not a car that's an appliance like we decided yeah yeah this is this is fun this is another fun car I think every car just about has redeeming features and this has a lot of them even if it's not the big obnoxious loud 8 cylinder Mustangs that we're used to this has its place yeah I think I think this is an ideal starter car starter for my school I would that's probably the last thing to say before we get into the actual like rating is that this is the perfect car for an entry-level sports car enthusiast totally agree against I wonder if somebody's eventually gonna catch on that every Sunday yeah around this exact time people combine just the heat cars look there's the tire so on to the reviewing portion so starting out as always we're going to begin with performance which is a tease it's a little testing a little testing right now around these twisty roads our twisties and i am not as confident that this will do what i want versus some of the other cars we have reviewed like this there's a bit of body roll going into corners the steering's a little bit loose nothing that's concerning but I am taking these curves slower than we have in previous episodes five and a half nothing yes five and a half right there yeah five and a half on performance for both of us it's for me it's just a bit above average yep five and a half yeah I think that sounds fair practicality not great yeah for yeah yep no no I'm gonna no no I have to go to three point five okay yeah hi I'm gonna go to three point five nothing agreed just missing is just not great yeah it's not great alright value which I think this is where this car scores highest I would say so because for 26 grand it was a fun car probably seven I was honestly getting it give it an eight alright I think this is a great value that's pretty high yeah yeah seven and eight that's ah it's hard to find a fun car under 30 grand and this nails it that's true I'm still gonna stick with my 7 that yeah but yeah it's definitely high value and then cool factor which I think it's kind of Mustangs are calming yeah everybody sees them there's nothing like anything particularly cool pi 5.5 yeah I was gonna give it just a straight 5 honestly all right so five point five on Maya and a five on Jade seasoned pretty middle-of-the-road and then for quality which is that's a knock it's a knock but again this is only $26,000 yeah but the quality is not high no prices at high either so you don't expect high quality no it's about on par with what you'd expect we give a five I think a five is yeah I give it a five because it's what you expect in my mind it's what you expect at this price that's fair yeah I'm gonna give it a five point five all right there's nothing that I is like in dire need of changing no yeah I think it's really truly horrible moving on a fun factor yes last thing last thing what what do you think for far out here like it's this car is kind of an oddball because it's not terribly fast you're not gonna win really any races but I had a blast driving this yeah definitely I had I've had a great time even being in the passenger seat this is fun yeah it's fun going around twisty roads it's fun accelerating I'm at a seven and a half I was gonna give it less I was probably gonna go with a six yeah yeah a 6s affair I am I'm inflating the score for this because I know I'm driving a sub thirty thousand dollar car yes and that is to me that's amazing like if I were driving the P 100 D or the Lotus Evora I would be kind of I would always have in the back of mine man I better not wreck this it's really expensive it's really yes that's fair I mean you could drive this around and have fun with it and you could like hit this or I mean you could damage it and it wouldn't be as catastrophic yeah wouldn't ruin you yeah right so I've done the math all right figured it out average score for this is a 34 yeah which I think yeah I think that fits that seems reasonable that's pretty high for $26,000 card yeah I can spare one that doesn't perform at nearly the level of some of the other cars we've reviewed and yet we both really like yes and we cannot both I think a hundred percent recommend this car to someone yes this gets the GT a seal of approval yes it does so if you're a young person and you're looking for your first performance car I would live here solid bet yeah yeah and I think that's the perfect tagline for this car it is a perfect entry-level sports car for the everyday person agreed all right well as always thank you guys for watching we hope you enjoyed this episode this is your first time tuning in thank you hopefully you will stick around next time maybe we'll go up a couple of cylinders and maybe review something a little bit quicker letter until then
