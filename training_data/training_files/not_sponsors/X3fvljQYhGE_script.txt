this video is brought to you by charles.ting.com hi the disney era of star wars has been interesting back in 2015 the release of the very first of the new trilogy the force awakens i saw this movie on opening night and it was a ton of fun i gotta be honest seeing it on opening night after so many years of no star wars films i mean the energy was just amazing i just remember when the title sequence came up the cheers from the audience like that was such a cool moment that was such a fun environment to be in the movie it was fun like the first time you're seeing it you're not really thinking about like the implications of it or the storyline of it but you know i had a good time looking back on it i can see all the reasons why a lot of people might have said it's not that great when the last jedi came out ugh that was tougher with the exception of this scene which was incredible but then we moved on to the rise of skywalker and we all kind of hoped that it might fix a lot of the uh issues that were left over from the first two films it didn't do any of that i would say the overall consensus with the new trilogy is kind of a disappointment and i'm not gonna lie i really kind of fall into that camp i was not very impressed i mean yeah there's some cool components to each of the movies they all have their moments but something interesting happened disney wanted to cash in as disney does they made standalone movies in between the trilogy releases to keep us all occupied while they figured out how to ruin the legacy of star wars the first of which coming out in 2016 was rogue one and i gotta say i think that rogue one might be one of the best star wars films that's ever been made i think that rogue one has one of the greatest ending sequences ever in the entirety of the star wars universe and just in film in general it's a great ending sequence the first time i saw this the first thing that stuck out to me was the brilliance of the music now we're gonna be talking about the ending sequence to rogue one so obviously major major spoilers ahead so this is right after the death star takes out the imperial archive on scarif which is the whole sort of you know film builds up to this big battle sequence on the beach they transmit the plants to the death star up to the rebel fleet all is well cool okay now they blow up the planet every character dies which i get it it's a great story it is disappointing because they were fantastic characters but this begins the ending of the film okay let's look at [Music] this okay right there so we're establishing kind of that we're in g minor here [Music] interestingly the uh imperial shuttle there it's like right around the pitch that totally not on purpose just a fun little kind of got close there the imperial shuttle is flying or the i guess it's the tie fighters that you're hearing somewhere in there somewhere in there [Music] really really great writing here michael jacquino fantastic writer wrote the incredibles really really really brilliant composer fun fact writes a lot of like big bands i mean the incredibles is all sort of like that big band style uh sort of jazz influence which maybe we should do a video about the incredibles because that music is phenomenal but he did the music for rogue one and oh boy did he do a fantastic job i mean not trying to be john williams but but paying homage to john williams in a really really great way and here we're establishing this this beautiful low brass melody really nice we're keeping this g in the bass g minor f major g minor f major that's a really really great uh sounding sequence and you know this very much feels like it wants to lead into like an e-flat matrix that does it not it feels like it wants to lead to e flat major seven i don't know that's just what i'm hearing [Music] there's the in the trumpets there we have that e flat there now we're still sticking to this we're still sticking to this g minor sound however we are getting a little bit of that that raised fifth which kind of makes it an e flat chord here's an interesting thought here we have g minor is this indeed e flat major well there's a few different ways to look at it i mean you could say functionally it is e flat major with a third in the base so the third one two three g right so it's like e flat major with a third in the bass that is or is it g minor with a sharp five one two three four five sharp there's just regular g minor sharp five i don't really know definitively how i would explain which one it is necessarily but i don't think it really matters that much i mean you can look at it as g minor sharp five you can look at it as e flat over g same kind of deal oh my god okay okay man every time i watch the scene you're just like yes what a reveal i mean just the the tension build up the chaos and then the silence and the breathing and then the it's okay i'm sorry i'll stop geeking out there are people who are way more dedicated star wars fans than i but i i geek out over that every time i see it it is just incredible and this is in my opinion what i think sorry this is the chord that saved star wars you know people were already a little bit disappointed with the first film and then the second and the third films people were just like well this was a disaster but rogue one as far as i know it's pretty universally liked i think i mean i loved it everybody i know that saw it thinks it's the best thing to come out of the disney uh star wars era the mandalorian as well is another really great product of the disney era as far as films go this is just such a great film and like this is one of the reasons why this sequence right before we get to this we're hanging onto this g we're gonna let it just sit there right and it's gonna just fade out in the lower strings it's going to give way to the environmental sound of the creaking ship and your steps oh the steps and the breathing wow okay this is why i think this chord is super interesting because this whole time building up we've been sitting on on this g minor sound when the lightsaber illuminates the high brass is still playing the same g minor chord okay but but check this out so the lightsaber changes the chord i don't know if they meant to do this they probably did did they i don't even know but the lightsaber changes the cord watch this can you hear the pitch of that lightsaber way down right it's e what happens when you take a g minor chord and you add an e to it [Music] it makes it a half diminished chord an e minor seven flat five chord right i don't know if this was i have no idea the lightsaber cuts out and then you hear that the orchestra is just playing this straight g minor chord right it's just consistent it's just g minor but the lightsaber is an e and the combination makes this dramatic disastrous kind of sound that encapsulates what's happening here it makes the whole thing feel like oh god right because we're here and this is you know this is uh dramatic it's it's intense and everything right but then whoa it's like oh no okay the fact that it cuts out when the scene chain when the when the camera angle changes and that leads me to believe that maybe this wasn't intentional maybe they did not mean to do this if it was not intentional then this is the most brilliant mistake ever because i think that that chord alone makes this scene so much more formidable it just adds another level of disaster to what's happening here right [Music] okay so now we're getting kind of an f sharp coming out of the lightsaber by the way if you if you ever wanted to know i don't have perfect pitch and you know that because every time i sing something and i'm trying to find it i'm like [Music] yeah well i'm getting an f sharp out of that which obviously that doesn't go we're still sitting on this on this g minor but what's really neat is that check this out wow [Music] yeah e flat minor now hearing that that is a very star wars sound so that makes sense so we're going from g minor to e flat minor but what is the third of e flat minor e flat natural minor there it is g flat and harmonically f sharp that's the lightsaber so we we're here in the lightsaber and then we get the chord and the and again the lightsaber matches [Music] well hear it [Music] i don't know if this would be at all thought of even right because it just sounds like a lightsaber i mean it's the classic sound of a lightsaber would the pitch of the lightsaber be even something that they would even consider i don't know but if they didn't this is like the greatest happy accident ever because it's perfect [Music] uh props to that guy he had one line and he nailed it look at him look at him yes [Music] we're getting away from the music just a tiny bit but like here's where everyone watching this film was like i mean we were already like that because this scene has just it's incredible but like this moment was when you when it clicked what they were doing with the film when it clicked that how they were gonna tie it in you're just like oh my god cause you've had this amazing final battle sequence and what i think is a really great resolution to that i mean despite all the best characters spoiler alert um dying i thought it was a great storyline and then the scene with darth vader and everybody's just like and then we get to this part and now everything's starting to click and you're like oh i know what they're doing [Music] now we've changed key so we've spent that whole scene in g minor now we're in a new key we're in c minor we're doing the exact same things we did in g minor g minor [Music] that is dropping a major third [Music] okay dropping a major third both minor chords so here we're in c drop a major third minor chord two minor chords major third apart same thing as the g just in a new key that's all we're doing [Music] fantastic yep and then and then and here's where everybody started going are we gonna secure the airlock and prepare the escape pods your highness the transmission we received up until this moment when i saw this in theaters i was like there's no way there's no way like there's no way they're gonna do this what is it they've sent us oh my god i grew up watching star wars i mean like i said there are people who are way way way bigger fans than me but like it's always been a part of my life is this fan service i mean yeah i guess so to an extent but like what a great way if you're gonna use fan service like yikes this is the best way you could possibly do it anyways e minor seven flat five e half diminished whatever you wanna call it that unintentional chord i think is what truly captures the sheer epicness of that darth vader reveal and thus the entire ending to rogue one solidifying it i think is one of the greatest star wars films ever but i'm curious to know what you think what has been your favorite star wars film most people love the mandalorian i think it's fantastic out of the films what do you think has been the best film so far of the disney era did you notice anything of like this did you notice any of the the music and the lightsaber interacting at the end scene i'm curious let me know in the comments below because that stuck out to me immediately and i was just like yes sorry for geeking out over this but yikes this is so much fun to look at because you don't know if anybody thought of it or if it was intentional or not i kind of feel like it probably wasn't but i don't know i have no idea i know is that michael jacquino wrote a fantastic score for rogue one it's absolutely phenomenal go check out the score if you haven't seen the movie sorry now you kind of know what happens but go watch it anyways because
