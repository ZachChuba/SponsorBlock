Please hold on to me
Please find me now I don't want to be trapped inside scattered memories Don't leave me alone
I want to find me that is yours only I went breathless the moment I saw you You stole my heart Take everything from my heart Things became clear as soon as I saw you Light filled my heart Let me show you, from my heart Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me I feel like it will hurt
Like it will be painful When I hug you
I feel so fulfilled I've been wandering, lost for so long Don't let go of this hand
 I want to find me that is yours only I went breathless the moment I saw you You stole my heart Take everything from my heart Things became clear as soon as I saw you Light filled my heart Let me show you, from my heart Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me Your eyes ask me Why am I leaving you alone? Since you've met me All the other guys turned boring Sounds cliche but I'm the one who found you, that's fact You don't know you, I don't know me But I know you and you know me At the end of this crimson road Here we stand, you and I I want to keep this moment a memory forever
and run off to wherever I can I went breathless the moment I saw you You stole my heart Take everything from my heart Things became clear as soon as I saw you Light filled my heart Let me show you, from my heart Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me Look at me, me Hug me, me tight Find me, me, me
