everybody's saying that the Niners are this unsinkable ship like this defense is just a colossal that gladdie like Aaron Rodgers has got no shotgun in there do you agree with that or not no I'm gonna take the Packers and the points I don't know if I got a win but I think it'll be a close game I'm gonna take the seven and a half here that's where the line has been it's interesting when you look at the bets on live on my program that I do for visa and I mean 55 62 percent of the money is coming in on Kansas City but 55 percent of the tickets are split but 62 percent of the money's on Kansas City I mean excuse me 62 percent of the tickets are on Kansas City fifty-five percent of the money which means there's a lot of money being bet on Tennessee okay and then when you look at the Packer game it's straight across fifty six percent of the money fifty six percent of the tickets I think the Packers have a chance they're a little contrarian and what they do I think that they'll not play as half as bad as they did the first they were one for 15 on third down pack they have 15 third downs in the game and they held the ball for 35 minutes I've never seen that before my NFL career that's back to the magic I think they'll play better I think Davante Adams will make some plays through I think they can over the course of the game can they keep up no but I think they can keep this game close I think it'll be a fun game to watch alright so you're taking Niners money line obviously and Packers plus seven and a half yeah that's it yeah is that gonna be high scoring or low score do you think I think I think that tightness game could be a little high scoring only because I think the backdoor cover is always in play and the other one I think could be and the other game I think will be in the tweak it could be a 2724 game I think it's gonna go below 51 well the Packers Niners are 46 and a half right now over/under yeah and I would say that I would lean towards the under their the over I have at Southpoint right now at 53 for the other game okay all right so a little trifecta in the Packers Niners game Packers plus seven and a half Niners moneyline and under under yes all right we're about to make a bunch of money by the way you just made six bets I just made six picks six recommendations six we'll put them in there
