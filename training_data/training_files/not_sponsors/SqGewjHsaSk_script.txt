what's up guys we're alive I'm da mcc's and today I am joined with let's start with Albert okay this is Albert from okay my channel is slightly musical I do magic tricks and balan covers anime stuff cool and this is true that's that I guess that's why we're here today watching we're watching oh yeah Sakamoto disk gah or otherwise in English it's haven't you heard I am Sakamoto for those of you who don't know what's going on I mean we've done this for like a year but in case you're you to this we do a watch along on an anime show on crunchyroll and how it works is we won't be showing the actual episode on the screen you'll just be joining us with our our reactions to the show you'll have to have it on a separate window to this side and to watch this with the trial or with a premium account so for today like we usually do we watch at least two episodes but if it's really hype we'll go to three so we'll be starting in a bid just trying to get everyone in and join in the chats really tight it's like a landslide I can't really remove yeah so have you guys watched this III have only watched the first episode last year I don't know what happened on why I didn't continue it I think I just got distracted with like another anime but I remember it being really entertaining it and like really out there and truly I guess so you haven't watched it even watched it I've only read the synopsis I'm not gonna gather it's just like a like a gag gagg anime where he's like kinda like one punch man but for you but like coolness tone down to like the school boy yeah you know yeah I did that's pretty much all you need to know and like I don't know if it develops into anything deeper in the series maybe he becomes more powerful than one punch man but for now he's just a school boy so you guys right maybe we should just just jump right into it or maybe I'll wait a minute till you guys like sign up and stuff people are probably wondering where's jack I know Jack's not here before can I have to like compensate with two people you just like takes that much space you know I can't use no substitutes well that's a nice way to put it though you can substitute right not a replacement I'll still watch with giant where is he right now it's probably like climbing a mountain somewhere yeah well hope he's having fun right now oh yeah we're actually um in Santa Clara right now cuz crunchy roll Expo is happening this weekend so we thought we'd do this thing like right before so we have all the time during the con but I'm pretty tired but I'm so excited to watch this I just flew in today from a flight and it was dude flights are fights are crazy I can't I can't I don't know how like I can fly here every single time I mean I like traveling but the actual process of traveling is just really tedious that's why you don't live in Toronto like me and just live here in California right everyone loses to LA all right we'll jump right into it so I'm gonna be counting down to press play there should be a timer on the bottom left of your screen like right right here right above your nipple I guess Oh God so keep track of that just make sure you guys are in sync with us if any lag happens we'll like pause and probably a resync also we'll resync at the end of every episode so it's not just back-to-back rapid-fire you know we'll probably discuss the episode after each one are we doing some like hard part our core analysis yeah yeah we're gonna like like see what kind of Enneagram like a personality here so I guess we're ready we're ready okay all right all right he wants to do a countdown I guess I'll do the countdown I'm an experienced freshman you know I got I got a guy them on the senpai now okay all right you ready okay three two one sakamoto desk a let's go yo this anime hype I queued they're talking about him oh so the high quality animation this is a really good animation ooh this saves so much the animators are geniuses they're like you just got to repeat these friends you know exactly can't lead a band drop the ball yet I should do this when I lip-synch my videos just like have a picture of a bush and then like have a character talk then this is a whole five minutes to just them talking bleep just laughing that part of it and then the animator was like damn not gonna animate in the ball going that way like nichijou like that shimmer yeah yeah I guess it sound like that made you just really great mm-hmm on this frame oh my god I thought it was frozen okay that's oh he's cute he's got that perfect oh my glasses thank you there's no reason he needs to be walking up there why is he playing pool on earth oh my gosh he's so cute that's him oh my god joke all right we got a deep analysis the intro he's really attractive really I think he's the main character well nah man his hairs not pink he can't be the Menken oh I'm just kidding it's a bit anime seems really troll is it are you supposed to wear like your class number on your uniform because it says like his class number on his collar he's different cool its enemy yeah what then he count reminds me of um have you watched Black Butler yeah yeah you might think Sebastian but like I said under his left eye yeah and the mole adds character man do they actually yes maybe is related to Bayonetta where's bane of all it's like it's like here th it's summer haven't what are these English good just some special breakout breakout like and some acne wake up they'll literally show like no other characters use the main carry I guess he's the only character everyone's expendable the stereotypical prank just a prank bro I'm an [ __ ] yeah who would do such a thing just to impress people what even if he caught it like that so I'm sort of like sprinkled on his head I see sparkle like a vampire yes Sebastian so I'm guessing these are the three guys that were like volleying the ball I can't tell cuz they were really far away for the first five minutes my god was this what high school was like for you guys what isn't that I'm lucky though is this something unrealistic standards for guys yeah like look at that body oh no where's my desk I wonder if the bullies think they just throw it out the window that's messed up gee I don't know teach oh my god oh my god there can't be enough space on the windowsill for him to just balance yeah he's a protagonist that's sure he has that natural adhesive to the window oh yeah that's why they're trying to bully him yeah but then they probably become best friends because that's how it works like they're probably pretend these like disciples or something maybe the way to be cool yeah CUDA the eraser doesn't work let's just beat the [ __ ] out but if it's male on his shoes you got you got to tell people when you kick them in the face you know this name they're gonna steal his pants oh he's so attractive with glasses that's not fair it works either way yep innocence private academy there's not like a Saitama move we're regular punches the girls probably like that whoa oh my god whoa he strips him and then he realized like oh my god you're beautiful what don't smoke indoors Oh suck so you just want to save them and then it be like wow how to save this oh yeah it's Oh cuz of the thing oh wow bad rng wait hello at all how did them know this is some chemicals but this flammable oil on it looks like so calm he was never tired what secret you know like I said you - this is probably one right he's gonna cause wind currents nah man Sakamoto yeah he could just do this with a shirt but instead he's got my cup they're gonna fall in love with him look in his eyes it's beautiful dude he's playing the music oh my oh my god take it easy thank gym teacher for sure this is really weird so next time there's a fire don't stop drop and roll just strip sidestep and repeat and repeat oh and then he joins into alright the fire extinguishers oh he's so smart oh what a nice guy sent by now I like the music life is like jazz jazz first I'm from tribal masters the guy we were bullying took a hit for us what does that mean now who writes in cursive anymore dude my mom does oh why don't you have no eyebrows is the fire from before laughter oh my gosh didn't start strike suddenly they became attractive oh my god beautiful sky oh oh here we go again at least they accepted it what would you talk about other than the guy you've been bullying and admiring at the same time how do we know that's even a Bobby ball could be a melon yeah yeah these animators are geniuses this is still episode one I thought it was flow I was floating I really like the jazz music in the background it's so musicians he's Mary Poppins down like he's just like a clear brother how else are the people gonna see how beautiful he is what what is that like a billboard kind of save the Berta's music wow this guy has infinite good rng I'm sure that's totally possible controls the weather why is even outside in the first place where are you going he just looks for trouble just so he can look cool yeah perfect what what was that yeah I guess it's just similar to like Nietzsche but in every scene just shows how here here I am to him they hate him but he's blonde man I see that blonde so I won't exchange student that's a big acid you speak is that a school paper or like a newspaper that's a high quality photo nope no big deal I was just flipping everyone and a villain was born I know I'll also try to set him on fire does a backflip he's smart too it's probably super athletic too perfect isn't that perfect eyesight [Laughter] you can't man you can't [ __ ] with him Yeah right he is that play dodgeball oh my gosh dude if I tried that faceplant he's still on pee yeah someone nerf in please you didn't read them do not use sign no he's gonna see me all what you know what's gonna happen he's gonna be beautiful it's gonna be like those face wash cover calculated glasses no glasses hair up hair down he doesn't matter he's just default good see you know the sharpening his compass our DS supposed to be the nice ones depends on the type of bees right no more like awash Hornet yeah Hornet yeah that's the bad one who did that oh my gosh have you guys ever been stung by like a wasp or Hornet not a Hornet I've been stung by a bee before oh wait that makes no sense this teacher has some repressed urges oh that's that's a lie he just wants to see them my god like oh now that I'm trapped with all the boys my chance Oh unique real man where people unfazed you're like can you really die from my Hornets think you're allergic oh geez well you could die from anything [Music] oh he's cute all too when you scold a wasp or Hornet my god what why their smartness looks like a Joe do it so yeah yes okay how do you go up from here this is the first episode the teacher was like drafts I was so close to them being fully nude he's had another New Englanders possibly yeah like I by the end of the semester he just has yeah is this like I might tweet my puns yeah that's you you're Sarah besides that then you push up your glasses like that to know that Dana needs a 45 degree tilt that's the end of that suit yeah that was a it's like climax not perfect that's it how many of those are there total I think it's like well we probably talked I mean how can you how can you not survive four episodes of just watching a guy so much better than so this sort of lightweight a man who's gonna do like magic and like music after you know I don't watch anymore so this is sort of like one punch man I guess where it's like he's perfect everyone else and so so you're predicting like like there's gonna be like an exchange student it was like but he can't lose though right that's like though there's no way that's when we have a conflict I guess these were these - episode 1 guys of sakamoto deskah what's this we're not gonna watch all 12 that's it's too much for my pride so I guess well we'll see how episode 2 goes I've seen this episode before actually but it's still I was so surprised by it because I watched it last year and it you know second day maybe that's why I stopped because I just felt so inferior I was like oh man my self-esteem they're still playing oh no these guys are gonna work out with the arms the fourth wall I don't know we'll play for 12 more episodes I guess oh all you had to do was change it from day to night and it's a whole different scene like uh I gotta go I don't - oh she's like the most desired girl versus the most desired boy anyone it's potty in my answer ah she's like how can you not fall for me she's a little manipulative yeah yeah she's uh uh she's that type eight wing nine no idea what you're talking about okay I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna I'll just like positive but okay so that was episode one guys they figure if you're just tuning in this is the watch long that we've been doing for the past year I guess today we're watching haven't you heard I'm Sakamoto and if you haven't heard of him that's fine you can watch along with us we just finished episode one will probably watch one or two more episodes depending you guys are still feeling it well how's it go pry dried now it's like oh it's fine alright that's good that's good you well you're a really good challenge unless you get challenged by that dream so any thoughts on Sakamoto do you like him do

he meet you why don't you get expelled for this oh I don't like a because it's trying to woo every guy and now all the girls were jealous of her holy crap she's scary these damn birds and now she has

the gates the dogs you dog is call cooter you supposed to be like the spirit box these just like trolling no we're thinking probably jeez dude what do you want a six-foot art like temple or something oh no he's a child would that make him a sociopath - he like knows how to yeah like manipulate not really many people like playing with people slap it [ __ ] snap out of the desk I want more wholesome episode oh well he favored Oh but I thought you never lifted anything heavy she's a strongest of all of them mm-hmm now they become best friends is that the wholesome part of those episodes it's all calculated truth I ship them already in the end they didn't need Sakamoto they just needed each other each other exact who's called I have a lack of knowledge with this culture slider know this let's suppose that he passed through the gates he's back Oh see who some wholesome comfy so the lesson is he should troll people so they could learn to love each other I guess instead of actually talking about like this guy's a genius calculator you see that like he read it so he's like I understand women now no he's a witch haven't you heard [Music] I mean it's wholesome actually yeah but through unconventional methods yeah like I you can't imagine bringing people together in that way I just don't know like doesn't do you think it keeps its pace up like next ten episodes every just solves people's like social problems every episode like what's this who's this what's his family there's thing that's I'm predicting that Shh there's no way this guy exists yeah he's a shapeshifter yeah any talk today I feel like 12 packs on command yeah you're liking it that's oh you're interesting that's really funny it's not what I expected at all I'm just like full troll there's some life lessons good yeah actually don't [ __ ] with Cody or whatever it is really yeah he's cute but usually so Joe's like yeah like a girl with like five cubed guys so this is a guy with every area [Music] however there was mole what oh hey that's not him what's happening what's going on that is mom why is the music so sad hate us for that jazz I just wanna try one now we both know who's okay it's gonna be a sad episode guys Aaron boy Sakamoto dude I think we're about to we're gonna get hit with a fields next episode who's that that's the first half errand boy yeah oh yeah each episode is like made of like two like mini episodes right I don't know you guys what I keep going I want to down for like one more I think three is like the nice sweet spot [Music] one more and then you have to do a magic trick there Oh God it's like wait Lily what happens is amol that yeah like it's like oh there's more of him he's not the only Sakamoto they send all right we got a dupe now we gotta do this three ways we're gonna do this three-way handshake you're gonna like you gotta like yeah it's called the Cinnabon alright so that was episode two guys hope you liked it I know people are still joining people join like every now and then too and they're just probably confusing what's happening we're just like talking to the screen and they have no context but so what are we doing what are we doing oh I was talking to right so we're doing to watch a lot and we're watching soccer ball to deskah otherwise known as haven't you heard I am Sakamoto but we haven't heard of him because I'm really interested in like what happens in the later alright so they can't just like milk these things everything they do I don't think this is one of those shows where there's like an overarching like like like you know like larger overarching plot that's some babies like it's like okay this is a anime and then they just like 188 I like episode 8 or something you're in luck yeah exactly watch that this is a good enemy that's like my top 3 top 50 he wants to I don't know I can't press it in your lie in April I was like by the hood musicians anyway if you guys want to join us you can go to quench roll da bomb / le da mix I got I got it second now and that'll give you a 14-day trial of premium membership that means no ads HD episodes you know all that jazz no interruptions and that's that's two weeks that's two weeks it shouldn't take you two weeks to finish Sakamoto you don't have to finish that much you could watch like all the other things on crunchyroll there's so many selections probably not enough to watch in your lifetime but you know try to cram as much as you can in 14 days but yeah that's how we're watching this right now we have a TV behind the camera so we're not looking at you guys we're looking past you like Sakamoto know we're looking through you through the TV and yeah so yeah so how you're gonna watch it is you have it on the side while we accompany you in this great adventure yeah yeah there should be a timestamp on the bottom if you guys want to stay sync hopefully its thing I mean if not then it might be kind of weird if our reactions are like two seconds ahead Oh why it are just pants off of something it's just people giving us some compliments please keep posting videos yeah I should do like volleyball and maybe more like like that like personally I don't know maybe we'll invite them for the next watch alarm or something do a magic trick after looking actually be curved I just don't know if they can see anything it's like Somali I don't know I mean okay well he has a good one anything goes okay you're gonna mess it up in front of all these people I don't know how many people are watching but there's that many people eyes on you so anyway uh yeah we just finished episode 2 we're gonna watch I guess one more episode and then probably isn't that I don't know some shenanigans or something but yeah so episode 3 of haven't you heard my title like I don't know if I should say the Japanese title or the CDJ just Sakamoto cuz he's the only one into it anyway will actually know the cat in yeah what if it's the same voice actor they'd be cool that's this is his back story of how he became an IME okay alright episode 3 guys alright five four three two he's class 1 t means they had the first year of high school all right I just I thought that meant like you're in the smartest class though I appreciate source I don't know John you're a wee on your leap someone's gonna crack this in the comments they do like 1a 1b and stuff like that I know 1a is like the top class is his name Dominic or just wait what there's someone of the thumb made or I guess from their perspective midlane like which one has time okay your left class one first few seasons first year high school which means he's one so what's their 15 yeah like that when you that young I don't know man really it's anime people peak in high school like printed tennis they're all middle school but they all look like already man but your favorite thing about Sakamoto like about him as a character yeah just him yeah what are you the character what's your one favorite thing about him I don't know I'll come back to your house how do you pick one quality out of something perfect I like the way I can weigh you carries himself okay yeah very serious answer like how are you can teleport I mean do you think it's really that or it's just like a it just seems like that because because we're slow are you so cool that actually controls time away he's got yeah I remember it is multiple of gods I guess I think these are the same guy oh okay this guy I don't this guy that's a crash that looks something even know what it is know what I want to eat it it's really good the way he like crunches it yeah it just looks it would he's only eating like 50% of it the rest falls from his face that is true did they get him a drink is everyone here in high school why didn't you look like well this guy's like blonde a sucker monkey it's like a yeah coos oh yeah so live in a high school house there he's a bully boss this guy's smoking you know what happened in episode one what's that was eating the [ __ ] this is the food episode now probably like a meat bun the meeting hall this is how you summon him oh my god but it's not wait what he doesn't have a small that's not him wait really oh yes

like his [ __ ] now I don't know but there has to be a lesson at the end of this like he's doing it for a reason you're right he's here to change people he goes to class for him but in the end he makes him realize there's more to this guy does get more thick like every see but really it's him again I think the animators are just lazy man you gotta take that initiative this is where the lesson comes in trying to see where this guy I want to see the lesson I too like laughing maniacally while I take a [ __ ] he's gonna make his life hard cuz he's in 2nd year oh oh no will you do sandpaper he's just okay with him teleporting you he's gonna help him wipe - oh yeah he has a crush on him I feel like he's gonna become really like imposing them that's a thing nah man medium-rare delicious my foot oh can't follow him man he teleports so the [ __ ] let me know maybe he is slender oh okay slender moto sack was that that might kill him actually [Music] he's in the room Helly can't run away

I can do it yummy like quick less I can do like like take like two minutes yeah sounds like the camera but you need someone to like who's this guy who hasn't yet to see anything cuz cuz they've seen a lot of much that I still get like impressed no matter I get I guess yeah I guess to me so how're you like doing it okay alright alright guys prepare to see the true Sakamoto Albert alright which one is he gonna be actually don't tell me I got 200 going to be so like well what's that look at what can we see right now it's like just Kenny can you go like closer yeah alright yeah it's pretty good like I might do this gonna see the card okay no no you're part of the trick now alright let me know you ready all right it's a dumb that is my name pick a card okay any card all right I want you to show show the chat card can you see the reflection not cheating bastard no no no no Queen all right so before you put it back I want you to remember this moment in time right the deck looks like this all right and you're holding on to your own card right so I want you to place the card back in the pack I don't just make sure everyone remembers the card yeah right and what does leave is sticking out right there so this is going to be the demonstration of time traveling all right so we're going to break the laws of physics and we're going to travel back in time to the exact moment right but in order to prove we gone back in time we need to change the current condition of the cards all right so we have somewhere to go back to and so normally you would change the order of the cards just by mixing them up like that so how do you shuffle like that we're getting a few cuts but I'm going to mix up the cards in the way it's obvious this is this isn't the order that we start in right I'm gonna shut the cards face up into face down just like so we're gonna make a big mess all right though some people think that maybe I'm like fake shuffling right the cards aren't really makes but I want you to see right we do have cards are face up cards that are facedown going pretty much throughout the pack we have some cards that are face to face some cards that are back to back so it's just a big mess so the dong can you hold your hand for me just like like this like yeah like a little pincher and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to cut to a card all right let's see was this your card no no okay this wasn't hard so I want you to do I want you hold on to the tenth let me just like this we're gonna go one minute back in time all right that's 60 seconds 50 40 30 20 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 did you feel anything change all right he touched me all right so we gone back a min ago should see all the cards should now be facing the same way all right so we gone all the way back in time we should come back the exact moment where DOM picked his own card can you show everyone the card that's like the eighth time I've seen it I can't I'm like this close to Japan I can't see it can we just watch you for another like two hours yeah I can tag one more but I think I think that's a that's a good dose all right that does a lot of fun guys all right good finish guys all right we'll probably see you next time not sure where it'll be but I'll let you guys know see ya that's where guys [ __ ] right
