today's video is brought to you by Vince ro hey brother and welcome everyone to another super Carlin brothers review today we'll be giving our full spoiler review of frozen to that's guys before we dive on in I over $200 or 25% off orders over $400 link is in the description down below no it's more like we can't do we cannot do it we've had this is why we don't sing this is it this is it this is that's the exact explanation right there yeah oh my gosh but that like single tune he's like ingrained into my brain I've just been like humming it whatever I'm like my voice isn't doing anything right now or such at home my broom is new Hermetic words no no oh okay I don't have a new broom but like I was just trying to think of like words that would play well with it that definitely is the best choice of four words absolutely if you guys have got that jingle stuck in your head add some words put your jingle in the towel section down below yeah maybe at some point we'll like have a video where we just sing good know Oh pitchy little you should do it welcome to the spoiler frozen to review oh my gosh what a movie like so we're coming off of frozen one yeah basically the the most successful animated animated movie Disney animated movie yeah massive box office weekend early thoughts initial thoughts yeah give me your feedback yeah I really really liked it coming out of the theater the first time I was like whoa that was really good I think the number one thought people keep asking or people will keep wanting to know is like do you think it's better than my first one and I'll say right out of the gate that I'm finding it very difficult to even compare the two because there's such different movies they they are massively massively different yeah and I do think that that makes that question in particular very challenging to go about answering yeah like this movie is like a pretty action-packed it's a very heavy movie there are some there's some very heavy moments and I think that like basically one of the things that frozen 2 did very well is executing having really heavy themes and then interjecting enough humor yeah so that you're not like being dragged down by the movie right because I think that that could have happened right um my earlier off-the-cuff review is that if you if you remove those moments the movie can be like a bit of a downer and the comedic moments are almost unnecessary oh you think so like maybe we should do like a yeah I'd be interesting be like to edit together like a cut without frozen - but none of the jokes but no the joke well the number of things you can delete from this movie and for the story to still be able to like narratively go along is a lot you think so like you could chop chop this movie into like a blur line short by taking out things that are irrelevant to actually like what is important to the story interesting yeah thought about it like that yeah it's it's interesting do we want to just like start from the beginning is there anywhere you were a lot like want to jump off from no I mean where yeah the beginning is a good very good place to start yes yes yeah you don't wanna be like the middle first then we can go to the middle if you want that Olaf song about right it'll make sense when I'm older ah what a message what a message no I think yeah we get started the beginning because it opens with what does the name of that song some things never change yes yeah it starts with those little kids right with sort of the like that the backstory yeah so we set up the set up we did a little bit more explanation from the parents Queen Edina and King AG not ignore of the parents names and that's sort of interesting you get like a little bit more of an idea of like what they were like as parents went on and also like we're like as kids yes and it definitely like lays the groundwork for why something would have happened too long ago and then hasn't really been relevant up until now right do you feel like that was executed well like did you have any sense of like why wasn't this a problem always right yeah I do I do think this set it up really well they even tie in tie it in to the reason the parents left eventually sure like as if stuff for the sequel was happening right there in the beginning of the first one and you just didn't know yet sure sure is good and then when you think about like everything like the first one you're like how could you not come up it's like this is the first one is so much just about it's such a tiny adventure comparatively like it's like Elsa coming to terms with her powers whereas this is like Elsa coming to terms with why she exists sure about that but so and you're okay with the idea that it was absolutely 100% required for Elsa to have come to terms with her powers have mastery of her powers before the spirits ever would have come calling I think so because it's not until she has the master of them that she's even able to awaken them I think it's because she has that sort of mastery that she's able to start feeling because she says like my magic can feel it right which like before she was simply trying to not even she was trying to not feel her magic now she's living her magic itself feel things sure so I do think it was necessary okay guard and then I don't I don't love how they handled like Elsa telangana that the spirits have been awake and she's like accidentally awakened the spirits of a notation for things she's like I expected you to say oh yeah wait what is that what you just personally did were they not weren't they calling you ahead of time that was a little confusing and you just have to blow past it well and that's the reason I asked the question is because like like you said like yes she awakens them like it's part of like what her powers are maybe capable of doing but they were calling her first right like there's there's sort of that like summit that was one of the things where I was kind of like well okay and maybe you're right maybe just kind of like you know let's establish the plot somehow somehow someway this needs to have not come into effect prior to now yeah we're gonna roll with that and assume it's okay yeah okay so then where would you say then you feel like Elsa is at as an individual at the beginning of this movie I think so the movie takes place I think they say like five six years after the first one is that right I actually did not catch that that's the case yes I think it is taking place years in the future okay like in real time years I guess because that's not one since the first one came out sure so I think she's at a place and they kind of dive into it in that song that some that some things never change I know I can't remember that one where she's very I think like she's at a happy place where everyone she loves is around her all the time they're all inside the castle and she's like she has this internal feeling of not knowing like kind of like knowing she's this isn't where she belongs but this is a good place to be okay so like she is able like she is basically like living as an outsider in her own Kingdom in a way exactly exactly what's happening okay yeah so instead of like a kingdom of isolation it's like isolation within a kingdom this is this is why we never talk about the movies I feel like you and I before we review them because sometimes there's so many good thoughts that come out and it can only happen once so there was watch lightning strike that was that yeah that's that's pretty much exactly what it is I feel like she's sticking around and she's doing her like she knows she's the queen yes which is something she has to do okay it's not responsibility she wanted or sought out or was even ready to accept it's just like this is her birthright so she has to do it okay but I think she's also struggling with I must have powers for a reason and until now I've only wondered about how did not have powers and now I'm wondering why do I have powers like what's the why of it not to be like should like should I have powers like yes that's cool I got it but now she doesn't know why and it's like she can feel that like that calling starting to come and I think she she's sorting those like I physically have to do this I must be the queen because I'm the queen my knees people need a ruler but I think yeah she very much knows she's doing it as a responsibility not as a desire okay so I I think that's kind of interesting because there's I think a common sentiment is this idea of like am I meant for something greater mm-hmm and that's a strange thought for the Queen to have well like it I agree it's to stretch out for the Queen to have accept it's like a weird thought for everyone has that feeling yeah of course not right sure sure but not everyone has magic powers right she does which gives her a little more I think credence to wonder am I actually meant for something sure you are yeah is there a reason okay so then moving on from there the the the whole plot of the movie is going to be kind of set up by this idea that their grandfather on an else's grandfather once upon a time was the ruler of arendelle he had basically you know made contact and they were like associating with the North alder people and they sort of had in existence a coexistence that seems to have worked in some capacity yeah he basically comes up with this grand plan to you know build a dam and the dam is supposed to make the waters more rich and you know it's better for everybody and it also serves as like a physical literal bridge really between you two it's like a physical metaphor right a physical metaphor yeah of course we know what comes to happen is that the king ultimately like turns his back on the leader of the north all drew people which then angers the spirits in the process on on else√≠s father a ganar as a child is basically knocked unconscious and their mother a member of the north ultra tribe then rescues her as a I'm sorry rescues him then as a reward for those actions effectively Elsa is given powers right and effectively becomes what I'm going to call the chosen one first yeah I guess you sort of the chosen one I don't love the idea that it's like a rule I mean I guess like a reward like that feels like you've won something and they say like gif is a better word okay that's fine and I'm sorry poor phrasing maybe but I think what what we end up seeing ultimately is sort of this idea that Elsa is quite literally when you've got like one of her parents from the north ultra one of her parents from the royal family of arendelle she becomes like the firstborn bridge between these two two times right so like the parents are like the people who like bridge the gap and then what they literally create is Elsa right yeah yeah who then becomes like the living breathing yeah for Fifth Element right okay yeah so here's where I think the movie takes on like some interesting choices as it pertains to like the inclusion of the other characters okay because effectively I feel like frozen one the original Elsa is the plot right Allah is the main character sure okay in frozen - I believe that the spirits are the plot Elsa is the main character and almost no one else matters almost yeah like their inclusion I think every single other characters inclusion in this movie is ramped up by the requirement of that you can't have them do nothing right they need to be in the movie they need to be in the movie but you you kind of don't need them mm-hmm so well there there's except for the fact that Donna is the one who leads like the big golem guys at the end to the end sure right I know it feels like did they do that so on a head purpose or whatever but I'll come back to that because I feel like on a on an Elsa okay that's it take a hard left turn or anything but I feel I was thinking about like what it's like what is this movie like we're just like the messaging right this means I'm having a hard time answering about you know I'm curious to hear what you have to say alright I think it has to and they're both spearheaded well I thought there's like I'd say I'd say three I'd say three big ones okay and they're spearheaded by otto Elsa and Olaf the first one the most basic and easy is Olaf who is going through like who sings songs about transformation and things like changing and stuff like that okay and you know he walks in he's like I think this is gonna transform all of us I don't know what that means office ladies talk about that yeah what so anyway and I felt like that has to do a lot with that's why like everything's fall is part of the theme as well which I thought was interesting because when you see the trailers you're like oh the last movie was about winter and now this one's about fall but like winter was like a theme of the first movie to the tomb that Elsa has ice powers whereas it felt like autumn and fall were a theme in this movement to the tune of everyone's undergoing the transformation and fall is a time where all the leaves are changing colors sure so it's like the fact that it's following us doesn't matter except that it just adds to that particular theme sure it's a little bit like symbolic of the idea of transformation and I feel like there's a bit of a almost like that's almost like a little bit of like a more aesthetic meta theming happening going on because that sounds really pretentious but I think in particular this movie was made like specifically for the people the intended audience aged up from the first one like I think this movie like if the movie let's just say was made for 12 year olds like frozen one was made for 12 year olds sure I think this movie is specifically made for 18 year olds for those exact people who loved it as kids and have aged up exactly at the time like so you're not you're it's basically if you're disney you're not creating frozen to for 12 year olds again writing like recaps the audience you're literally trying to recapture the yeah I mean it's still general viewing of course yeah I think this movie will be the absolute most impactful for the people who saw it as kids grew up experience the time in between and they're now watching this one as well okay because I think that's part of the big transformation process like Olaf literally looks at the camera at one point says hero an older like he breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience like he's talking to those kids who saw it to the 12 year old girls and like the whole thing is like I like to use the phrase seasons of life a lot okay and I think literally there's like a season change in the movie but I think that's literally what happens and he's seeing you like everything will make sense I get older and else's whole journey is about like self-acceptance sure I think that's the other another big theme of it but I think that in particular is part of the the transformation thing as well like wherever you were six years ago like just think about that right now if you're listening at home or watching or whatever like where were you six years ago where are you now like guaranteed your life is so much different right absolutely especially if you were like a 12 year old when you first saw it and are now an 18 year old like the difference in your life between 12 and 18 is so vast it absolutely knows where is like not that not that anyone might not have changed as well but if you're like going from like you know 40 to 46 or something it's probably a lot more the same than it was at images at different ages like whoa I would argue for us six seven years ago we were like we were all getting out of college we had a friends were getting their first jobs maybe getting married Oh first time or sure and now everybody's having kids yes my life is vastly different than it was six years ago for sure you know like that's true so I think you can still feel it that way but if you're seeing this movie like if 10 years from now you're twelve year old and you watch frozen one and then an hour later you watch frozen - I don't think it's gonna have the same impact because you didn't experience that time and then see the characters again who have also gone through this change with you okay so you almost feel like part of the viewing experience involves having seen the first one and then waiting for the second one to come out yes and growing up in that time because it's about growing up in a lot of ways and like especially if it's so weirdly in the scope of history this is going to have been in my mind like made for a very specific gen narrow slice of people like anyone can watch it and enjoy it but maybe one intended messaging who will get it the most is a very fortunate group of people who or a certain age when it came out and then we're a certain age when they grew up in that little slice when we've gone through time and that would be like the perfect intended audience for this movie perfect intended audience anyone can enjoy maybe that will end up being its own new generation name the perfect intended audience the animation series unknown okay so all that being said do you think any of the characters in the movie actually come out of the Mist transformed I mean I also literally transforms like she puts on yeah she goes from the blue dress to the white dress she lets her hair down she has the big swirling smoke okay so it's a literal transformation so she changes clothes yeah gets a haircut yeah sure I did that last Wednesday hola also I mean literally transforms and then he's turned into powder and is revived I mean there's a physical I mean there's there's some light symbolism there's I will give you that symbolism and they does transform he does grow up I mean he starts through he's like I'm so much more mature now he's hilarious in that way and he's like nyeh buddy about maturity but he is also like at one point when Elsa shoves her and honour away he experiences anger for the first time ever and Ana's like you're bad and that was like I think that's part of his transformation and like growing up too is that he's like you know not just this happy carefree go lucky a little snowman all the time at every moment anymore well I think there's something to be said for that like this I think there's an idea with Olaf where he's sort of like developing this almost like encyclopedic knowledge where he just has like all of this information funnel into him yeah but then you are also seeing the difference between like what is what is always like the phrase that we use like he's being learned but inexperienced in life and we are watching him actually have a life experience right that then yields things you can't learn out of a book basically rather you like wisdom rather than smarts exactly exactly so I think there's something to be said for that but I feel like a lot of the characters and I went through and this is like one of the big challenges I'm having with this movie is like what what is the message like what is the main like theme of the movie and and do any of these arcs actually go anywhere that I personally felt like we're meaning like I feel like across the board almost everybody goes into the mist and then doesn't really super change like for me I looked at it as if like Elsa is this person who is she's battling sort of with this idea at the beginning of the movie where she's like she even in her her first song she says like I've already had my adventure where I need to resist this one like I need to resist the temptation to go and do it and then she immediately is tempted by it and goes after it right uh and immediately she wants to go off on her own and on immediately doesn't want her to and like as she's just like navigating throughout it's sort of like even the decision to like ascend on and Olaf away if she's sort of like continuing this idea of like no I need to go off on my own and just I don't know like I felt like sort of all the way throughout like then the end of the movie literally reaches the point where Elsa besides I'm gonna go live on my own right like I need to be independent I need to be independent I need to do this alone I need this alone I'm gonna go live alone and it's like I I think maybe she feels that but I do I think Elsa undergo is probably the greatest transformation on the other side of things I guess like I've been listening to her final song which is my favorite one which was show yourself yes what she's singing like in the cave as she's like skating down the glaciers and doing all the really cinematic beautiful stuff I'm just like gosh what amazing animation in that section of the movie sure that was really awesome but like as I'm like watching it the first couple times like you're still like wondering like who's she gonna find like that question sort of running through your head once you know what she finds and you're listening to it again I feel like it has like all these extra layers of meaning all the way through I've just been listening to that song in the car cuz is really good and you should go listen to it but very succinct of you to say yeah yeah yeah it's very good it is it is but okay so the whole song she's like she's like searching for whoever's calling her right and she's determined that who calling her is going to have the answers to who she is and stuff like that like why she is and like what she's supposed to be and all that and she keeps saying show yourself like who are you and then she gets in there and it's herself like that's who she finds and well I'm being emotional yeah yeah it like I don't know like really started hitting me listening to it like she like doesn't know that it's her so I don't know hmm I'm having trouble putting it into words but like that she thinks she's talking to someone else but like she hasn't really accepted who she is like that's why it's so hard for her to be the queen because she's having to like pretend to do that okay I think that that's interesting because I would argue that the entire first movie is about Elsa finding herself and understanding who she is and coming to terms with what she is and I think that for me I love the song but I think that whole scene doesn't make sense to me oh I do I do i cuz I think the first movie isn't necessarily coming to terms with herself it's coming to terms with the fact that she has powers okay but I feel like the powers are intended to be a metaphor because not all people have powers the relatable message with there is like the things that make you who you are are things that are okay to embrace yeah I agree with that and so for me I thought it was very strange because even the trolls in the very beginning of the movie that they warn onna it's like these powers like don't let her go too far and I was like I won't let anything happen to her and then like you know finally Elsa is like she's facing down like these big heavy waves she's doing all this stuff she's being attacked by you know the water spirit like under water she like conquers the water spirit she's like you know breaking free you know there's like the chills moment where she's like literally galloping across like you know the surface of water which is absolutely gorgeous she finds you know the the glacier River which I feel like a super fitting because they've always heard of this river and it's like a frozen river in the right area like you know like very also like but then I feel like what Elsa is unfolding the entire time she's in there he's like she's she is she's found the place she I found the home of information and she's like watching it all come together and she's able to see all these past Saint scenes and events that like have all led to where they are today but no part of me feels like her trying to right this wrong trying to seek you know the answer to the question is her falling victim to her own desires or something like that like pushing it too far right to the point where it's sort of like the further in she goes it's like she's gone too deep all of a sudden yeah and I don't like I just don't agree with that it's like it's like her effort to attempt to find the answer to this question ultimately leads to her freezing to death yeah I still don't totally understand why she freezes I'm sorry that yeah that doesn't make sense to me they say it in that little song that lullaby their mom keep singing like don't go too far or you'll drown or something right and it turns out they're like more like instructions for what to do when you get there and there is that member what she's like staring down but it's weird because the like the point of the movie or else like the the resolution to the plot is that they need to right the wrongs of the past which means destroying the dam and she can't learn that information if she doesn't go down there cuz that's where she learns it right but she can't go down there or she'll die so I'm like I don't I feel like the her freezing part is mostly the Anand meet something to do part of those script okay and and I'll come back to that over and over and over again yeah fact that I feel like this is else's story and I don't think that Elsa finding this thing like I feel like the entire spiritual journey Elsa ends up like ultimately being like weirdly punished for where I don't think that for me at any point in time the way that she is seeking information is a negative like it's it's not her falling victim to her and desires it's not her like really doing it's not like behaving recklessly it's not her putting her needs before the needs of her people it's like she's doing all of the right things and then you know finally sees the scene unfold and shoots the the into the world for you know to go find on right which then brings me to what I feel like is the other just very like frustrating part of this movie is Allah's in this cave with our loft and she gets this you know ice blast that comes in that basically explains you know like here is Grandfather about to slash you know the the north older tribe leader yeah like from behind while he's like kneeling with a cup of tea and it's just like her interpretation of what that means mm-hmm is over-the-top like it reminds me of and I said this even after we walked out of the theater but like the scene in Toy Story 2 or Woody's like watching the roundup and the prospector and Jesse are inside the cave and he likes the stick of dynamite little woodland creatures run over and tell ya woody what's going on and Woody's like what's that Jesse and prospector and an old man in behind the prospector accidentally little stick of dynamite thing it was match and now they're about to be blown to smithereens and they're like yeah that's exactly what I felt like Ana's interpretation it's like oh my gosh grandfather who we've never met before was actually gonna slash the North altar a leader in half and because of that it means that the dam that he built as a treaty - you know it's a representation of the bridge between two people is actually designed as a way to like destroy their waters and move them away and now we need to go and destroy the entire dam right oh it's like on a no like a bill I don't it's like that's that's so much interpretation in the idea of destroying the dam and then what she is doing effectively is as far as she knows sacrificing her people right because like we know that if the dam breaks that is going to basically wash away all of what is Aaron right and in in that moment she believes Elsa to be dead so it's not even like well maybe Elsa can save it and it's not even like Elsa sent me this so that I could do this so that I could execute it and and know so like the whole well I think that is what she I think getting that so the only like I agree with you it's a little she she interprets it a little too spot-on sure yeah but I will say like at the very least she knows Elsa is looking for the answer so that for her to receive this like it must be the answer in some way like it's meant for her to jump to conclusions okay in a succinct way I think she does a little too good a job of it but I'm it's yeah like I understand where you're coming from but it's frustrating how much she gleaned from it from what is otherwise having a small amount of information yeah however she does also say that the wreath she also the other thing that she gets out of this is that's the reason everyone was forced out of the town because we have to destroy the town it's like so they do throw that in there is like a one line explanation for like oh it's okay to destroy the dam cuz everyone's out of the town anyway right I'm not worried I'm sacrificing the buildings but arendelle is the people not a place you know is some of that but I think I don't know let me ask you what you think about this cuz so said Olaf sort of spearheading the transformation thing elsa is kind of doing the self acceptance thing and then i feel like the other one so I think almost weirdly what this movie is kind of about especially towards the end is like mental health yeah like like really taking care of yourself like I think that's what Elsa was failing to do was like she's been so busy taking care of literally everybody else in the kingdom like she is like failed to let herself take care of herself why sure like maybe she's not deserving of her own like self-love or something sure and that's why when she finds out the person who's calling her and the purpose is just to be herself it's like oh that's so but anyway I feel like on the other hand has like is her her section of the mental health spectrum is like depression right writing like that she's like wearing all black throughout the movie and I just made a list of everything that Anna is going through before she ends up singing her little song and it's that first her parents died then also keeps the that she's been hearing this voice from her then they literally confront the boat that her parents died on and she sees like a reenactment essentially of it in the statue then Elsa literally shoves her away then Kristoff leaves or that already happened but oh he leaves without a word Olaf dies and then all these things happened to her and then she's left at like the bottom of a cliff in a dark cave and it's just like man I did it no and that's bear now I do think that like you're taking such a sunshine and rainbows type of character that is right and it's like it's a little like crushing to me to think that anybody like that would ever have to endure oh yeah like so much negative along the way right and I actually do I feel like one of the more like I love one of the decisions that they made about animating her is at the end like when Elsa is like laying all the truths on her like I'm alive the town's okay like everything's all right I love that she's having this like some ugly cry yes it's so it's like because that is the most relatable kind of crying yeah I felt like that was like there's a little not like him everywhere she wakes up and her hair is all like right there like a very real like moment right like yes this is what people look like when they cry and their snotty of the gross and I think that was perfect that was good okay do it okay so yeah so literally what I wrote down about this I'm gonna read it because I feel like I'm gonna try to relay tit and I think maybe I got it right here but honest arts the movie with her song alongside ooofff about how things aren't going to change she's maybe clinging to this idea that they have found a world that is great and like why would they ever do anything to jeopardize that like Elsa's mission like you know like leave or whatever right I think that she's way overprotective of Elsa to a point where it's like at points I think she even exclaims to Kristoff that's my sister and it's like yeah he knows well yeah I think it's when she's like in the wind or right or whatever and it's like okay okay well a little overprotective she well I'm willing to let her take on the journey alone and ultimately has to be sent off for Elsa and discover how much she has to like make it on her own so like I almost think Ana's unwillingness to let Elsa take things on alone is like a projection of her inability to take things on which is then why like her big moment he's like taking down the dam I'm like by yourself sure sure and it's it's it I think it is a weird psychological projection because this is a thing you know it's like if if you're exhibiting a certain behavior or you know whatever I think very frequently you will put that on to the other people around you and assume that they're all acting in the same manner and I feel like Anna can't possibly come to terms with the idea of Elsa taking it on her own because in her mind what could possibly be worse than having to take something all on your own hmm which I do think I mean even that makes sense though because she spent you know or like being I mean key she spent you know whatever all that time as a child basically completely alone in the castle right why could you ever want to do anything alone if I could go with you right you know like I was alone forever and that was no good right yeah exactly to be alone right so I think I think on eyes like I think maybe that and that's the best transformation explanation and maybe it took me until this conversation is sort of the idea that anna has become dependent on all the people around her maybe because she grew up with such a childhood that involved her in isolation exactly yeah and so it's like the gates are open people are around why would we ever not to be like ever want to go back to the idea of being by yourself yeah so that's that's an interesting take on it I think for sure yeah although it does it does involve peeling back some layers for sure for sure but that's okay that's okay cuz you can experience it just you know over time so let me ask though cuz it's definitely about depression her like song when she's just stranded there and like her way out is basically the teller stuff to like just do the next right thing yes which I mean it's an effective song it's really cool C Conn's if she's like I mean like kind of but it's almost like he's almost like I don't I don't know if the message there if you thinking that an appropriate interpretation would be that like if you find yourself extremely depressed and alone just hike up your pants because you got stuff to do that's you know that I I think I found something a little like the dots weren't connecting so much the idea of continuing to take the next step forward mm-hmm is congruous with doing the right thing okay hmm okay like like a step forward is not necessarily I mean it may be symbolically if you wanted to call it a step forward but like like I think she literally says like a physical step a physical stat I think the song she says she can't see past the next heartbeat or something like that's how like stuck she feels right now and it's like I guess that's that just may be a good thing if you're like depressed like just you got to keep moving forward like that's probably a pretty good I've no mental health professional at all let me tell you like to like you know you got to keep moving forward and keep looking up even if it's just for one more breath you know if that's as far as you can see maybe that's okay but like it's sort of I feel like maybe that's the message they're going for but they sort of also just sort of just like toughen up buttercup it's sure sure yeah like you know your your backs against a literal cave wall yeah you know you're gonna have to jump really far in order to make it to rights thing that's not most people's physical depression location right right yeah yeah so that's that's a that's a question oh yeah I'm just interested to know how people interpret that I like that that's like a healthy interpretation of it or if they get the message they're going for if that's sort of like a yeah right because I'm sure they're not trying to give any sort of like condescending no of course not of course not um I I think what's fascinating about this movie and maybe even the way that we've both psychoanalyzed it and as we've been talking I feel like me even knowing what's going on in your personal life with certain things it's like it's easy to see one of the things that resonated with you resonated with you I did and we were in Salt Lake City this past weekend we were doing our movie meetup for it so you and I spoke to 300 individually yeah about what their thoughts were and it was fascinating to me that so many people had wildly different moments and where it was like oh that's the one that got me yeah this happened that got me so bad it's like man so this movie I think must have just packed in so many relatable circumstances right so many different corners of the movie that like depending on who you are and what you're going through somehow someway it was going to speak to you right yeah they definitely like poke you and a lot of different spots and like it seems like everyone has most of their guards up but like they found it seemed like most people like the movie found a way to like poke through their defense and like one spot or another to get the pressure point yeah yeah I think so I think so so that's that is like I think the movie is is very well executed yeah oh yeah so maybe maybe moving on to something a little less heavy which is exactly what this movie d-did us think we're going to talk about depression depression and mental health and taking care of yourself in this review you should totally do that yeah you should oh so the comedy factor in house movie yeah is spectacular it is like brilliant yes yes it is like Olaf is wonderful comic relief as always and this is okay I've started since we parted that's doing these reviews I've started to like notice the common thread and that is that if I walk out and my favorite character from the movie was the comic relief maybe that's not a good thing sure like that means like because you're supposed to like the comic relief like they're there to make you feel good in the rest of the movie but they're not like the point of the movie no so like oh like when I came out of row Guam k2s o love did my favorite part right walking on the Lion King Timon and Pumbaa my favorite part so I walked out of this whole op was amazing it wasn't my favorite part he wasn't like my favorite thing that happened in the movie okay that's that's interesting because I do agree with you I think that what I wrote down literally my notes is that else is my favorite part but I do think Olaf is absolutely the second and that is that even in itself in and of itself I think is fabulous execution of the comic relief because I mean it's like the Cars 2 phenomenon where it's like everybody loved mater and cars one and then cars two with like well give you way more mater and it's like well that was yeah it's like comic relief is there to be the comic relief not to it is a dimension of storytelling not story tell right everyone hated that little off Christmas special things it made him the main character right just mmm right guys so I think what they did so well with this though is having Olaf just be like so ridiculously likable to like I loved it one of my favorite things in the movie is his recap of frozen Wow that that is an amazing scene on so many levels I think a number of people's favorite scene was what he's like at least their parents are alive also I love the lieutenant's reactions oh my gosh he's like following it beep for beep that was a that to me yeah I thought that was such a fascinating decision to include sits only like one or two cutaways like it's not a lot yeah but it's the fact that like whole office giving this entire reenactment everybody's confused as to how these people just showed up somebody's magical powers ooofff is a talking snowman and yeah it's like he's put all that aside it's completely captivated by this story like yeah like they very easily could have cut to him being like what is going on cuz like oh it goes on for like maybe like one beat too long which is the perfect amount it's like yes that's part of the humor right like they could have made to lieutenant very easily just been like what was happening but he is just like engaged and that's so much funnier it is so really it was a really good decision it was really good to Sterling Brown yes this is us yeah there you go yeah that was that was really good yeah so I thought that was really good Kristof song oh my gosh Christoph song okay so I feel like there's there's a question to me about how important it is to like the movie the way that you end up liking the movie based on your first watch of the movie because the first time I watched it I was a little put off by it who are you I was kind of like I was like it's funny but like for one I don't know this song and frozen one I think absolutely nailed the ability to lighten every single song on your first listen I know what I don't think frozen to had that though I do think the music is amazing but so frozen are watching it the second time though and I knew that it was coming and I was like a little bit more in tune with the song because I knew where it was going and everything I was like this is pretty great oh my god and so I was laughing out loud the second pass yeah I think the second time for me it was a little bit because the first time you're just like you don't quite know where they're going with it right right and they keep upping the ante like yeah over and over and like at first it's sort of like like spends actually singing you're like okay okay like I see what they did they did the little magic thing they want Sven to talk it's you know right cool but then you've like literally got like Christoph like he's like face taking up half the screen he's like over here and like the other one yeah he like goes up the pine cone and does like like you know like three a paper popping out from the trees been just like 100 set leaned in did this like eighties rock ballad slash boyband just pause the movie for a music video moment that keeps getting funnier and funnier yes yeah and I think this is I for one I think Christoph is basically irrelevant a story basically he has one beat the whole time attempting to propose to AMA yeah and I don't really think even in the end he is that much better at proposing to onna than he would have been at the beginning of the movie yeah like I don't think at any point in time he has the wrong intentions when it comes to his love and relationship with her it's like it's pure for the beginning it's pure in the end the whole time he's trying to do it he's kind of picked okayish moments even at the end it's only an okay dish moment it's like you just had a massive you thought your sister was then your entire city was gone and now I'm just gonna go ahead and like swooping out it's like it's like dude you know choose your own thundercloud yeah but I think what happened is it in frozen won the voice actor of Christophe Jonathan Groff Jonathan Groff was not like in quite exploded yet since then he has super EXTREME reloaded and his agent deserves like a huge box of chocolates well because he got him a song and like the limelight you know the spot like literally a spotlight yeah in the movie yeah and so I think he had to have a song well he had you because I was a big critique from frozen one everyone was like you didn't give Kristoff a song right like all off and on and else all got songs whose another main character a Broadway actor yeah Broadway can you do it he's on Glee come on man right does he does he have the pipes he does yeah I will say though that from the moment that song ends he is just out of the movie yeah that's like okay there's your spotlight you're just you're off you're lost in the woods cool see you later when you come saying honor from that one step from the Giant and that's the other thing you do we needed that yeah totally totally needed that mm-hmm yeah so anyway so I thought I thought comic relief Kristoff Olaf you know I think it's all it's all well executed if not a little unnecessary okay this is total nitpick nitpick right at the beginning of the movie Alice is staring up at these giant portraits in and she's saying like how everyone she loves is inside these walls or whatever yes one side mom dad on it else those little girls other side Elsa Anna Olaf Kristoff Sven huh right okay I don't really have a problem with this except that Christoph's plot in the movie is proposing and it just seems like maybe they wouldn't have a giant portrait of him in the castle until he was like actually I think I think that's a I think that's a reasonable critique especially yeah like otherwise it's sort of like she would paint the boyfriend and yeah let's do it we're going to take it down if they break up this is this is like the classic family photo when you're dating someone not like married to them yeah and nobody knows like a wedding photos it's like do we include them until you know whether or not they're gonna be here forever because otherwise they're gonna be in the photo forever and like we you know Beth and I have this big sign from our wedding that we use as like our guestbook yes people to sign so everyone's signed like as a couple and stuff yes and there's definitely like two or three names on there and it's like those people broke up then we only liked you when so if you're one of those other people why don't you poor Melvin yeah okay so back to frozen and not Melvin other things that we have going on here are the spirits yeah so basically our compass needle from the beginning we do learn that they are in fact earth fire wind and water with Elsa being the obvious fifth other element ice oh my gosh you know it's so annoying is that we totally figured out this whole compass thing but we failed to realize that diamonds point in two directions and that they were pointing to the center as much as they were pointing out well you know what I think we still did fine I think I'm gonna give us 70 percent credit for all four elements oh yeah element yeah yeah no I think we did pretty good there and when Elsa pulls the water out of the ship and sort of like reforms the the scene that happened there for I thought that was step one of elemental master you know because I would argue that water is a different elemental mastery than ice well I would yeah it just seems like like if you watch like The Last Airbender all the water butters can also do ice okay and they can like control it and make it like freeze it and whatever but well come on true and also if you've seen frozen it's not like she's ever flipping water around never threaten No so I would say for the sake of frozen that literally call her a Fifth Element as well I'm calling it two different things and then she came in back control it all so this is two two thoughts one they break the dam and then Elsa races out on the horse and the way she saves the town is just by instant ice dam construction yeah divert the water which also I understand she's just had her bit Gandalf Elsa the white moment and she comes out and I'm gonna just assume she's way more powerful because 20 minutes earlier she's trying to like freeze the wave in the ocean oh right just cracks yes this is a much much much bigger wave and she just blocks it just blocks it there's no problem I I there I had I had some issues with the way in which that water was then immediately not impactful like it would have still flooded at bare minimum like ground level of the castle sure a beat like I understand that it maybe wouldn't like that the water would have eventually like reached equilibrium yeah that's sort of the idea but it was enough water to where the water level would be considerably higher yeah yeah like you can't it's hard to block a Lakes worth of water yes that's a single wall like it's okay if account gets a little damaged you know right save it without it right yeah yeah then you can do like some rebuild the city and you don't want Ventanas big reveal at the end as queen of arendelle has been prepared yeah yeah that's what they did that's how it could have been but anyway so the spirits I thought were interesting because the decisions were a little they were interesting choices in terms of how I think they were executed in the movie so for water we have the water spirit the horse which i think is under explained in the fact that i knew what a water spirit or a neck spell and okay guy knock yeah knowing what that was from our research yeah helps me be perfectly at peace with it although i don't think that the movie actually helps you understand what a water spirit is the salamander being the fire spirit is there just the one salamander or is it salamanders yes he just the one I don't know it's also not super clear why the wind gale and why the lizard are just like attacking all of a sudden right like that's not super clear to me like other than for Elsa to have something fun an action need to do like they just sort of attack out of nowhere and it's not as if then water and earth also attack like when she goes into the water the water attacks but it's not like it hits her on land it's not like the earth giants are like you're here I guess they do feel her presence and they sort of look for her but not you think those would be the ones that would find her the fastest okay so my issue with the spirits is that I feel like there's a this sort of an epic moment with the with the fire spirit where she's like you know doing the whole like putting out of the the forest all at once then she sort of like pins it and she realized you know she's like sure it sort of shows it mercy right so I think like you can understand that the fire spirit is sort of like oh okay like you're not here to kill me like you were just afraid for yourself right and so they're like sort of at peace with each other so they sort of like work that out I think the water spirit is the horse and she's sort of like tames the wild stallion so you speak like in the water I'm like and I think that that makes sense like the water spirit is like you're like we're not at odds with one another we can work together to help accomplish the goal I think the wind is a little less clear like with Gale yeah it's like was the wind intending for her to do the ice blast and get those like moments in time like was that the point like I said not actually attacking her it just wants her to freeze these moments I'm not sure so that's that's the thing yeah so it's like the other two are like physical manifestations kind of sort of something something you can see yeah whereas Gale is only ever like a gust of wind and it's sort of like she attacks it freezes everything out and then it just sort of like rustles everyone's feathers and it's sort of like oh we're cool gale yeah and then the earth giants she like goes on her final mission without ever reaching peace with the earth giants and we run in so it's like it's sort of like if you're gonna have her master you know water check fire check yeah you know wind check it's like have something you know the earth Giants before we get there right well so here's the question then do you think cuz they make it so much about else I think it's like on a kind of tricks that are the Giants or whatever but you know at the end she's like you're the bridge and she's like actually in bridge has two sides which I really loved that line but like does that mean that like both Anna and Elsa are both the bridge so like like Elsa covers three of them but Donna gets the last one like is it okay that they both get some or is it all about Elsa see that's the thing though it's not like I'm not sure I mean I guess there's there's something to be said for that and like in a way onna is just as much both North Andhra and arendelle Ian yeah as Elsa is right you know they're they both represent that yes and I think that I don't know like I feel like this is Elsa story and I don't really think that tricking the earth Giants is quite the same as the taming of the water stallion or the lizard yeah I kind of agree um I kind of agree like hey it would have been one thing if she like convinced them to destroy the dam yes as opposed to trying to destroy it and they're trying to destroy her and hitting the dam right what can you do okay so sort of I feel like we can wrap up here because we were talking for a little while a little bit um I have a couple questions for you because I specifically wrote down answers and I'm sorry to put you on the spot without any preparation at all that's fine but I'm gonna ask you favorite song favorite character and least favorite character oh so favorite song first go every song to show yourself okay that's actually the same as mine yeah which I said would actually caught me what is her first song is into the unknown into the unknown so for whatever reason in my mind walking into the theater the first time I was sort of like oh yeah into the unknown like my favorite song but I think that's because I for whatever reason was just placing show yourself as like a reprise oh yeah that song and it's not at all it had the same sort of like that I won't write again oh no we can do it but ya know so I think what I was thinking was the ice cave scene yeah that's my favorite song but I was calling that into the alright when it is very much its own songs well it was sort of weird cuz the marketing like they're released into the unknown like on Instagram like right a month ago and it's sort of like I can't believe they would put like there let it go ahead of the movie right or something but I was like wasn't it because it wasn't I think because of that a whole bunch of people we spoke to over the weekend we're saying and to the unknown was their favorite but I think let it simmer for a couple weeks yeah that said a lot of people I feel like asked let me know in the comments if this happened if you got panic get panic at the disco Oh panic at the disco this was a thing that happened and I'm so curious about this because it was the weirdest thing but so many people that we spoke to had this phenomenon happen where they were specifically attempting to avoid listening to the soundtrack for the album which I agree with which I totally agree with I mean you can have spoilers and it's better to get it like the first pass yeah on a Broadway show I would say I would disagree with that and I would rather know the music before run to a Broadway show any different thing but what happened to a lot of people and I don't know if there's weird overlapping certain circles with super Carlin brothers and Panic at the Disco but a lot of people were listening to and collab people are waiting for right they can sing they can better than us yeah a lot of people were listening to like the panic at the disco Spotify pancham Channel yeah and they were getting the into the unknown like you've just got added to all the playlists right learn your song right so they have heard and that's the song that plays at the credits by the way yeah so they had heard into the unknown like by accident in advance of the movie right and I was like a funny thing so be sure to let us know if that happened to you because I thought I mean we must have had 1012 people tell us this exact same yea happen to them and it's like wow that's that I love their version it's very good very good I think it is one of the better artist renditions of a song favorite character well suck mary said that yep I think for sure I think he continues to be just like a insanely cool character like when she is actually being attacked by the wind when they first get into the forest and she does this like like lands on the ground is like blasting ice in either direction I like got chills I was like she is so cool yeah like oh such an awesome character even that moment because the tornado has all of them and it just like like spits out the other characters and that was like the movie saying like this movie is only about Elsa right yeah we're not here for you I'm just here for this right yeah that was yeah I gave Olaf my honorable mention because I love Olaf and I think that he was fantastically executed hopefully that statement aged as well at least favorite character like of the main of the main crew Christophe just does the least he's just kind of pointless whoa I'm sorry the people in the forest are kind of pointless ultimately like they were just such non entities and that thing I was expecting them to be a much bigger deal and they just work but of the main core I'll take Kristoff okay doesn't do much so my sort of shocked me because my fiancee Alice has always reminded me of Anna Oh like she is there both of these super bubbly people that have like very contagious personalities you know like gravitate towards them and I love Donna in like just hurt her like consistent enthusiasm and excitement and like I mean she's a character that has always made me happy and very understandably I think the my portion of what we're seeing is her handling all these hits that are throwing her right before like it is a depressed version of her but I feel like for the first half of the movie she does almost nothing but reiterate also my sister and you're not doing this alone right and we promised and it's like there's three sentiments on repeat where I think I think that the writing could have allowed for scenarios forward to bring better counters to all the things instead of just saying the obvious like but you're my sister and you promised right where it feels it felt like nageshwari ana point where it's like okay but like Elsa has proven herself a bit here like yeah and and she might be the chosen one like she might need to go do her thing a little bit right well there are some moments where else is like like I need you to trust me or like like I have this feeling and whatever and Otto like to accredit is like okay like like you have a feeling that you have to go do this and that's what you're going on she's like okay I believe you I'm in right oh yeah but also we're doing it together and you have to bring me right or else also this is the total aside but the journey from arendelle to the mists way too short though there needed to be like you know if if the journey is going to be like you know from here to here between these exes like at bare minimum we need something to happen right there you know we need a middle X there needed to be son of Lex no middle axe no huh so scale of 1 to 10 of 1 to 100 how we rank these do we have a system let's go out of 100 out of 100 get our number I'm going with a 90 a 90 right Oh fascinating ok I think I would give it an 81 an 81 81 less 81 I have been giving this an enormous amount of thought I've been having a hard time with it but I'm I might still like frozen more I think that's fine I mean they're both really good it's like I said at the very beginning I find it very hard to compare the two movies because they are just so different they are wildly different and and I will tell you without giving numbers there is a there is disparity in a weird inverse way between the Rotten Tomatoes critic score audience score where the critic score is lower on this one higher audience score and then it's a flip for the other really and I feel like that is the general tone that I've gotten from most people that I've spoken to where as a casual viewer of the movie it is a wildly enjoyable yes I will say I feel like frozen one gets a lot of bonus points cuz like I'm sure if you're in the film sector of YouTube at all the phrase subverting expectations has become like a really popular phrase sure and the last one it's like a real buzzy kind of phrase but I would say that frozen one was like the super mega popular thing that like really did that first okay Mike like in in that like they had Walt like Hans being the twist villain wasn't I mean that was like Prince Charming being a little bit yeah like there was that and like that the romance song was kind of the villain song but mainly that the actor true love was sisterly love rather than yes and I think that was a huge thing that people like loved yes that realistic bird of expectations and I feel like since then it's that I feel like that was like the catalyst that's just my personal opinion I don't know if that's true I'm sure you're gonna tell me I'm wrong frozen didn't break down any barriers or anything I like that's what I loved it back in the day and I I kept trying to articulate that exact phrase in my head for so long I think a video I almost made was like why frozen is so amazing like before we even did fandom content sure and I think I would have danced around the phrase subverting expectations forever is it nice though when you finally get something in your life tricked me at every corner yes yeah anyway so is that it for your questions I think that's it my questions I think that's everything all right well let us know what was your favorite song who is your favorite character better than frozen one oh no there's so many things to discuss about this there's a lot be sure to leave everything in the towels section down below Vince arrow for sponsoring today's video and if you want to see our other movie reviews you can
