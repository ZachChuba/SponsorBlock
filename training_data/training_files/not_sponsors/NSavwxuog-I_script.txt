alright ladies and gents welcome to a very stiffly at least on my part episode of X or Y but still sponsored by our whatever floats your goat really it's all within your reach sponsored one more time and are you gonna samuel l.jackson pulp fiction me know they sponsored again mothertrucker do you yeah I mean that was the reference yes o was okay yeah okay cool well maybe while we're in the other dimension which everyone is like go go go go go go go go go I feel like we should queue up just a little bit of um a dead ash in here because we don't have very many time as I was thinking what if what if diamonds are gonna be useful in there monsters in there we could use good armor and all that stuff and also uh oh we forgot about the whole slime boot thing so that I could travel quickly you're gonna quickly that's fun you might want to give yourself some slim boot yeah I do that via what's mechanism oh did you do the rice things yes ah I raced up and then I want to say to the man exchanger what you do for the block let's see slime boots I mean I figured it out so we can we can figure it out again I believe we got slime balls by way of something cool cool Oh Oh cactus into the mana pool will give you slain balls oh really yeah oh that's nifty that's even easier than rice if only I had known that earlier on before I was dealing with me and all the rice and stuff well you need that you needed the catalyzer I don't know if we had it then so we'll just we'll just say that we didn't have it what do you mean you need the catalyzer in order for that conversion to work at hat you have to have the catalyzer on the on the mana pool oh there's like an add-on to the mana pool yeah you you you're who built it you put it on I did it okay cool I remember yeah I can tell by the way you can't remember totally remember that yeah it was from you and it's a block that you put underneath the mana pool and it makes it so one mana pool will work and one mana Valon so he's got a gotcha you gotta go right you got to get it right if you don't get it right then you'll be wrong you know I mean that's not what I wanted I'm trying to remember what it was let me just let me just check this out real quick no that's not the one what are you trying to member which alchemy catalyst did I put that under it yeah god I do not remember doing that okay weird good throw good throw it's very difficult sometimes to do that wait do I need to do oh it's just uh it's a 2x2 right to make the block yay it's okay easy peasy lemon squeezy easy peasy lemon squeezy you just throw and slime everywhere dude I'm Hawking slime all over the place you're giving me mud bricks cuz that's what you do cool thank you for that can I have the slime oh yeah you know might might be nice and helpful cool I don't know I thought you got some too you know but I so yeah you shouldn't need anything but rice balls like that should be everything I don't even need rice balls I'm all good this is what I'm saying oh you're saying I didn't even need anything but rice balls no I you should even need the rice ball oh yeah [Music] okay cool actually you know uh you know let's see alright what I need to guilty pools under the pylons it's fine or it's not high-priority what I do have a question about though is how can I have hey rammer well we're in the other dimension are there mean things they're gonna try to do you monetize us in with diamond armor be useful or there are gonna be mean things okay so Diamond Dharma might not be the worst idea in the world don't know the worst idea in the world I mean that just sounds dramatic they are pretty annoying to de monetize he says okay so perhaps diamond is uh decent idea we can leave out the boots because we have that slime boots it lays the slime boots so yeah they are small I do he says so maybe it'll be like the obnoxious rats in RL crafter the most difficult thing to do monetize okay yeah a diamond chestplate diamond chestplate x2 diamond leggings time in leggings x2 and diamond helmet and diamond helmet x2 and we still have eleven diamonds left over good times good times all right he did you ready for this you ready for some diamond oh I'm ready for so I've been I've been so I was born ready cool let me know I'm just gonna toss my iron armor dude don't even need it anymore dude don't even mean for the longest time I didn't even wear it and then I started fighting the bees and I was like ow ow ow you're like yeah I came I came really close to dying to bees hey but hey I came pretty close to getting recta bees as well to be honest it was kind of rough it was very rough oh I need the hang glider - yes yes indeed yes yes indeed I would recommend the hang glider that's how you the sick hang time I like hang time stop hanging time Bom Bom Bom Bom all right okay so you're lighter you see how do we make you glider wings do we have a lot of leather we should have rotten flesh which I think you can manifold into leather can't you oh you gotta love it you gotta love it where don't they oh there it is there it is dude no clams are still filtering go away as well all right less fish really didn't i frickin didn't get enough leather buy one oh that's rough yeah it is rough oh god no it was like it was by two I needed any 12 instead of ten I've I way I'm sick I also got through a leather into the mana pool so yeah you're just right now absolutely now I'm operating an eco mode it's cut the cylinders down in half oh oh I see can you stop throwing fish at my feet though what have any fish yeah I don't believe you I don't know you're talking about I've been accused quit maligning my character oh right there we go got meself oh yeah you're you're drying clownfish and telling me all I've never dropped fish on the ground I don't know what you're talking about how dare you defy be like you are doing good yeah that I'm honestly impeccable imitation I know I'm unstoppable a force to be reckoned with unrecognized snack food possibly getting some ash queued up did you want to do that or you want to get going mmm it's good question it is a good quick here's what now is a good question I suppose that I could we do have some f1 I just tossed some of that boy and then we could do it okay here we go here we go here we go boy I don't know what mountain you said you were leveling but it's just the one straight off into the right from oh I forgot I can go oh that's tunnel that's a tunnel there through that mountain yeah I see it I see it now yeah and I've been taking the top off of it too so it's you know I've like I said I've been I been digging in I can see that my dude oh that's acid into all of my ass shoot oh you're gonna lose a lot of ash yes I should you know I've noticed that is problematic and I've made a mistake here I'll fix it and now it's only water thanks mate yep dude what dude to do I should have also I mean it's not the f1 but there you can make an obsidian excavator which is pretty good for well no well when we get the ender pearl I can do the full-on chunk miner that's the ultimate goal that'll be nice yeah I dude yeah that's right leave it it's misty gravel going yup yeah misty gravel is really the gatekeeper for our everything you gatekeeping dude nobody alright here we go throwing some ash blocks into the big boy and we'll have at least a little bit cute alright time for the misty world a finish my ash collection cuz I was doing it - oh you're collecting some dude nice we're working together place actually I want to go on and I want to travel I'm gonna travel the world right now there you're gonna give a little give a little swing a brewski oh you better believe it dude we don't go traveling oh my god oh my god what a wonderful world what a wonderful world nothingness and despair yeah no no the first shirt there's also not much around either I forget what the hang glider can you accidentally run into the side of a cliff and do badness I don't think that hurts you okay cool I found in a village but no no rune stone they're not is that the one that I took out half of whoa what the heck Brad do you know you can find more portals to elf know there's an they're poor laughs over here dude well that's different way stone activated home portal wait can I just can I do I could just link some guilty maniples I don't know if that makes any difference for us I like I mean we have plenty of men apples so but it's you've got the waypoint so if we need it we can just go back to it do that's not so okay ah nuts Ola dude hangglider hangglider is the way to live morning yes that's all yeah that's a great cereal t cereal okay are you ready to go oh yeah I'm ready to go let's do it let's do it let's do it come on thing okay my way stones taking a moment have you jumped through the portal by any chance no no no okay cuz I don't know why way stones just it's thinking are you thinking well you might have generated Oh No there we go yep okay we back under step stairs let's see I can probably put some stuff down here you take that alright the fact that the boots the sling and the hang glider have no durability is just absolutely monumental alright you ready go uh if you go into it I did India it says waiting for a survivor what happened to you why are you laughing I'm just I'm just stood inside of just sort of a bugs the transparent block a bright yellow block oh wait are you supposed to right-click I mean it's doing it's obviously where it's doing is it's trying it's generating oh now I'm now I'm going through places either you pulled me with it or disconnected me I'm not sure but we're gonna fine Oh yep timed out okie dokie always good venturing into new dimensions it's a good time to do a sneeze arun e alright we're all back oh we are back indeed boys whoa whoa I fell down it is very misty why am I getting hurt what's hurting me ow what's hurt why hurt I hurt why am i hurting help I'm hurting I don't like it I'm just hanging out waiting for you to kind of settle down and then I'll come through no I'm hurting I'm hurting why am i hurt then just this is bad go home he says bad go home he says ok ok did you apparently yes I went back that's poison um so did you spawn in poison he says you're not supposed to spawn there oh I bet if you go through you'll be fine because I always have weird whacked-out sparks and your spawns are fine so Stephen King has just ruined me this looks fine it's a nice area God dang it why does it me every time or is equal it reset me maybe it'll L we're good what I don't know what you're by Frick there you are welcome back I think you just stepped back into the portal okay theory so where did I where did I spawn check it out check it out I've made I found a stone that's cool yeah what is it whose man's is this what the heck it's a sprout he's looks like a Pikmin with me okay can you take him back can you I wonder if you didn't like hi just kidding have them bring them back through the portal did oh that's an evil what the heck it's a helicopter skeleton I just all I do is look over in here / alright I'll my entire goal is this interesting what gross sprite all right nice got a helicopter boy on yeah it's like a drone it's a skeleton can I pick him up hold on hold on I want to pick him up ah poop I wanted to pick him up I just want to find foggy uh uh gravel that's like my entire life is foggy gravel right now I don't know anything else directly into a deers anus doesn't seem to mind [Applause] like really yeah no for sure it looks like oh there's a drop-off in the misty area oh there oh I see so we're on like a plateau thing yeah we can we way point this somehow yes we have way stones so I don't know what we're trying to Waypoint like why we want to remember oh yeah we can just go home right I forgot about that wait so I guess this is like a pre-generated kind of dimension oh yes you don't want to go off there that's a bad news place to be yeah if you were to spawn down there then you'd probably just sit there and complain me like I'm dying I'm going oh B's I'm dying and then but there's there's actually a lot of stuff over here in are you in the forest area yeah just kind of exploring around yeah I see we we now have tech progression so perhaps we should look into that orientating I just want gravel I'm in a new dimension oh well I saw plenty of the gravel down there plenty of the gravel down in the place where you do monetize I just want to Crabble maybe you have to go down there maybe a weird dude I betcha Dalit I need to orientate this planet is very foggy all over but it has some elevated areas above the fog with some plant life i revamped my compass to be able to locate I need saplings from those trees though I found out that I need to break the smallest targetable branch directly adjacent to the leaves to be able to get them okay you need to break the smallest targetable little branch I'm gonna need money next to the leaves I tried a I tried it did it work nope maybe you didn't find the smallest target why is there a freaking why are there ender mites that are mad at me hey kill the Ender mites get the inner dust oh oh that's how you get pearls huh and ER dust is everything is it okay hey oh yeah remember the whole word gated like crazy right any pearls so I go with a foggy oak branch I got it what Darko stones birthday cake I got a cake that's six happy birthday dark coast oh wait Oh mr. gravel Oh gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme I'm gonna save the crap out of you like literally the saplings there you'll work it out I believe it says like the smallest branch next to the leaves all right bud all right buckaroo and pick you up I'm gonna pick you I'm trying to pick up skele copter it's not working I think you can only pick up passive mobs which is disappointing to me I can't make sure what Marcin what if I what if we monetize this Grove sprite could I I just I just had a moment where I was like no but then I was like oh the waters not acid this would he give me a sampling is the question you are a sapling I'm breaking the branches but it said do the smallest one what are you filter coal or holy crap this takes a long time to break uh no saplings yet I can't break the smallest one right there it doesn't give me a hitbox I can't break that one this is the smallest one that I can break and Oh Oh got it got it got a sapling got a foggy oak sapling hey it's nice to have a rain where it doesn't you know end you yeah what is in fact nice oh yeah oh I have two sapling okay I am getting gravel nice - that's exciting you've waited a long time for this island it's been an important thing and you can mock me all you want I would never do though I never do that you do but I got the fourth sapling do these trees are actually very much like the ones in that that place you know oh yeah RL crafts place no I have no idea oh you mean just in how they kind of break we should have brought a crafting table with us I have wood I can make a crafting table can oh can we okay I mean I'm pretty near the portal I'm just over that I can't do the okay Frick dude oh it's an endermite we're okay we want this we want you assuming in termites drop ender does they do oh good I'm just gonna go back and get a crafting table actually no I'll just make the thing I'm gonna do hit curly do you Hicker okay what's up no these guys are all wandering around holding saplings in their hand right now is wondering if I wrecked them if they do drop the sapling I literally got an oak sapling from him okay that's cool that's that's not that's not helpful it was just a generic oak sapling I just ease but it's not working that's the worst I'm having a crisis missed help help have we made compasses no but I just didn't want to like waste stuff oh yeah a compass is gonna take gold no it's not you're thinking of a clock oh I am thinking of a clock I'm picturing a clock and managin if you will in a world full of clocks I've made a naturist compass tis very excites all right I feel very orientated now do you mad to hear it it's getting dark over here more saving yay are you dude so what's that more sitting tech progression more sitting the gravel I found especially at border biomes near the down biome has some interesting properties I wonder what I can find my sitting yep that's what I'm doing in fact it's done because I have been doing it there are a lot of biomes here apparently okay what the heck or is this usually there's biomes aplenty the heck is that what in the world you sound confused I'm supposed to be showing every type of biome that exists okay as five is plenty in general so I don't know what we're supposed to do with it I mean I assume it's to help us find specific biomes that we're looking for what are you alright we need to run a toggle downfall if I'm gonna be slime slinging through this now you're good yeah are we good we're good okay so we definitely don't want to go into the mist that'll be bad news Stephen King will come out there you are right well oh yes oh wait where are you going where do you want me to go I don't know where you want to go where are you wanting to go III had no designate I've just met like my life is gravel but I've got some now so if you want to go somewhere then cool or I can go back and start soon the gravel that's what I want to do is slash toggle downfall and I have permission to use this come in wow dude how you lock me out honestly how are you gonna lock me out it's rough it's rough to be you go look at a deers anus oh there we go see how did you want to explore this want to give it a look look skadoodle we've been waiting so long to get here might as well see what we got going dude yeah these down low this tree looks kind of special this is a special treat it's just a mango tree wait the trees not that special it's just a mango tree why are you like this let me fly high it's not let me fly high what do you yeah there's certain spots where you for whatever reason it's like you hit a ceiling and I don't know what the rhyme nor the reason is it could be we're already a pretty high wise so it's possible the pretty high why oh oh we do not want to go off edge this is the you're just talking about the gravel right here yeah God do you want more gravel I I think we're gonna want as much as we possibly can get okay but I don't I don't know if you know once we get some then once we get under pros I'll just stop I'll just chunk in you know so that's what that sound is this dude is chucking razor blades or saw blades at me oh yeah dude I've seen those guys they're bad news you don't want them Oh God oh hey that hat no oh god no see are you happy we have Dimond armor this is hurt I'm sinking slowly this is very frustrating okay there's floating Matt type stuff that you don't want to go in and do a barely floating mats it's like it's it's like something I don't know that's the worst explanation I've ever heard for something in my entire life I'm using all my words it's like a swamp and and you can count like you slowly sink into it like it's a mud it's a blog okay and it was called floating Matt and it was hard to spell I didn't like it m80 all right how much gravel did you get I have two and a half stacks okay you you and him I'll go a little more him yeah I mean you know like I said it's fine I have I I can get it easier than you can why wait why is it because I have the excavator that I was mentioning that you didn't listen to but I still have the excavator oh okay got you well there's many gravel on the sides of these danger mountains yeah that sec that's what I was just running along the mountain just tagging it out of the little spots I was finding so if you go below the level of the fog do you get inhalation issues respiratory failure what I did is I didn't do that because I knew that you would had problems so I just didn't try it's a very ominous place to be there's a lot of mist you know but I mean I think that with this like this new place it does offer a lot of opportunity yeah I'm expecting Steven King to just pull here's Johnny on me any moment now popping out of them oh I found it or nah opieop if you were to say that if he didn't if that didn't happen then it would be a missed opportunity I'll give you that one that was quality feel like you were waiting to use that oh no I was cueing it up like a critter and then you jumped in and then I was just like alright I'll incorporate that into it and I mean you know it wasn't just you know it's not all the top of your head you know you got it you got to work it out alright uh cool I'm going back gonna deposit and get that what the Oh apparently we do need some of that niobium I've found that's not where you want to be I've not seen niobium where was where did you find the niobium in the ground that is the worst description I've ever heard of any that was far more specific than you saying a thing okay that's actually not not incorrect either go away drones not incorrect okay waypoint home these puns cause you misery oh I think we made him a little misty-eyed all right well head out naming it this was a mistake I wonder if you dig through a Hugh son of a dick if you dig to a son of a dick then what are you fine so what what meshes are receiving through that's what I was just looking for okay is tiny power bender dust comes from saving which is diamond sniffing mesh in the gravel okey-dokey worked it out all on my own I already have three tiny piles of ender dust I have four Oh which can make me one ender dust so I haven't entered us now and then that you can put in the condenser to get an ender pearl so we can get an ender pearl no way dude okay that's what it wants for us so I can go do that right now and answer I'm gonna make a new chest for mr. world related things come on come on get him get him get him do the locomotion come on camera do the locomotion with me okay  yeah it's like everything's unlocked you got a pearl did I got a pearl dude oh there is a lot of stuff a new way of resource gathering oh my god we can avoid mine holy cannoli fast-tracked we have to I think we have to avoid mine to get some stuff I'm gonna go ahead and take out your misty gravel so that I can remove some of the meshes that aren't going to be useful okay ah shoot what do I do for the oh there we go oh oh what's that you want a haste upgrade huh think I can do that there we go yeah cuz everything was really slow there how did what did you have to do to do that I have a haste upgrade on my flexible I could pickable oh I see yes yeah gosh darn it set up the chunk miner you need two chests and a stack of charcoal why don't you stay a trickle I know what we get a lot of charcoal so you just use the yeah I just I'm just curious why the stack of charcoal where it comes in yep take that I'm gonna enter pearl it up dude cuz I am gonna make the thing I'll use charcoal as fuel charcoal oh [Music] all right come on save already sip sip sip we're not getting that much if it must be a low-percentage game more like Civ tech am i right you are right I've always said man this guy is right and you are right okay which chest to open up here yep just wasn't made another to be a helpful boy what I hope what a guy you know that I am there what can I use rocks for our rocks exciting rocks are something that you can eat because you're obnoxious for throwing that moment at my feet every two seconds I have not thrown them at your feet sir okay so I need a flexible okay so that's handy porous foggy stone the heck is that I need to ender pearls is oh you're so kind there's something at your feet and you weren't me that's the first time you've ever thrown something at my feet without my asking and it's been a nice thing bra first time ever that's just rude right now I am about to chunk this up I still don't know what the pollen is for still have no idea what the exodia polymers worry about it we'll get to it when we get to it no I don't know I don't know why this is snow I'm concerned I need to know what it does we worked so hard for it I have to know don't you don't you tell me not to worry don't worry bones I put bones in the grater actually no okay sugar cane - I mean you know you know yeah okay well this clay is apparently special clay that's only misty we'll play and then you can get cracked clay and it's it's great anyway and so receiver a grade brick city in time and oh my god I will end you what I didn't throw that at your feet I just threw that down why you gotta be mad all right so stiffened diamond mesh requires the flaked diamonds and then the iron a whole deal to make okay it needs to be a double chest you say some of these okay words I am about to get so much gravel up in here you ain't even know I ain't even know yeah here we go here we go I'm gonna put it right there this is gonna be the reception chest so do this get you in there and now he binds to you actually no I'll bind to you right now I know what I don't know that means then it's just gonna Chuck axe hey do you want to you want to come out here and check out the grand reveal not a double chest what oh my god Frick wait one chest for the fuel I don't know how this thing works I thought you were grande revealing are you not grand revealing where this grand reveal is not very grand yet it's one chest for fuel one chest for output I don't know how you do both of those things how do you do that it's a pound a chest how do i toggle what it's selecting there we go but I need another chest to put chests in wouldn't if you'll just be my inventory you place down the chest with the fuel next to where you want to chunk mine that's a bizarre strategy why don't I just put the freaking thing in my inventory this strategy is bizarre this is a bizarre strategy like diamonds back a little space back it's dust over here we're making it all good go it is lots of ash man narf the cake you snarfed it dude just snark that cake got them mala shhhht there's one tons owed kid did nothing how's your grand reveal going man whoa what's happening right now what the use minor chunk you used mine are chunk you what the heck is wait what's going on what is happening I don't know you're saying all these words but you're not saying anything Oh huh okay it's it's kind of like a quarry I thought I was just gonna make the chunk disappear but it's it's kind of like a quarry interesting all right where is it is this happening and so check that chess that I put down I don't know where you are I don't know what chest you put no no no did I put the chest down in in there inside it's kinda next to the Y it stopped it stopped why did it stop oh it ran out of space on the chest probably that must be what happened okay hold on I could check if you told me where the chest was it's the one right here that I just put down oh yeah look at that wait so can i I wonder if I can make it a double can I get a doubler it doesn't have to be a single anyway so there's a lot ash that's pretty cool and then you can just take that out and do it and then it what oh dude is it still going is this still going no you set you idiot why did you move it it's bound to that location okay then put it back you Amy it is it one moved it so that I can automate there we go there we go there we go it does wow that's actually that's pretty nifty that's pretty nifty I gotta say dude we can just get ash super quick okay I mean it's gonna wear the crap out of my pickaxe but I mean super quick ash is good ya know that that that gives us ash that's quicker than a flu dang boy and then the redstone engine okay I need to go and fetch that actually before it runs out of durability and breaks yeah do what you gotta do do what you gotta do say what you gotta say oh well it's got a lot of durability wait there we go huh nifty quite nifty now that you've figured it out it's no longer dumb and it's actually nifty but before it was varied it was very dumb we don't need to quarry though cuz it's nifty that's it a redstone or they're just wood engine yeah alright ok so actually we want tungsten that cool I will put most of that elsewhere over here I will need do we know if the once the flexible thing runs out of durability will it just like will it go bye-bye or will allow me to repair it I wonder before that happens I wonder before that happens as well oh it stops that's very nice and that is very nice indeed okay want this go back here and tie in on this end with the chalk wrench well I thought about grabbing the wrench and then I didn't grab the wrench it should be open that should block and then okay what okay no oh gold silly goose and transport transport transport okay so let's see so which one are you working on I am making your stuff work oh cool that's obviously going the wrong way Oh hmm niobium pickaxe I just need one more one more or I'm gonna go back to misty world and see if I can find myself some more niobium you know yep I know oh I knew I could chunk mine it too no but actually your ash isn't here your trunk line isn't chunk mine even more did you intentionally on this alright so now your ash will Auto sort also do we know what what this phosphors for phosphor you say yes negative Elian empowers excuse me trade it with water where I can put the ball and get lava I didn't rise we could get a lot out of it oh you can use obsidian that is nice a lot of nighter right there - that does not give you very much durability none now does it nope it don't hmm oh my god I need to blow my nose it's so bad why are you so bad cobblestone transport can go back in there that can all go there that can go there for the best for recharging apparently except diamonds aren't like the cheapest thing in the world yeah we don't have a ton of diamonds anymore noob oh actually we we we do leave a lot of diamonds do we yeah we just we just and quite a few more actually another 22 by putting that nest through yeah pretty sweet that's nice could actually make more diamonds different meshes that's I did make one oh you did okay so but then we were running out of diamonds sure we didn't have enough to make - alright so that's got everything feeling a certain sort of way right there and yeah the diamonds different meshes like I we can the annoying parts building up to him right it is actually well we do a lot of iron now and that was a limiting factor for what leads into it you guys and also I did just pour out another 41 iron so I got that going for us good so the plate Flint points there's two Flint's there's 45 so let's see what do we have how many spots do we have one two three four five seven seven open spots stiffened is made one stiffened which is made from fibermesh seven six all right I have 47 plus five dang it but that's okay we can get more tap-tap-tap what up I'm happy cool dude flake in this Flint more cold I guess I could just look around for some niobium I wonder how much let's compare how things region the expiry I am dude so start point is three three one six two three three seven six that only does sixty my god that does three three one six two oh three three one six 200s yes so gold hardly replenishes the thing at all three one six two three three eight six so golden obsidian actually obsidian is better than gold diamond is far better than either of them makes it okay oh and apparently if we need more furnaces now we can just use misty Worldstone and it does its normal yes that's very exciting I saw that and was like oh that's nice cuz those hardened stone was obnoxious to me yup this isn't directly one-to-one so I might end up having to do I just hear you uh you know chipping those rocks do those rocks smacking rocks together listen we're not banging rocks together over here we're doing science but you are banging rocks together actually and that's what we're doing here okay so let's head on back there and I'll see if I can find another one of that stone that we need alright easy bud can you do that toggle e downfall we get a redstone from D monetizing that man's I don't think it works across dimensions and can you give me permissions I can be trusted I swear oh actually just stop it just stop it okay and then in order to do that I need the meshes oh these plant fibers what's up dude give me that old mule dust that's twine fiber I don't get fiber was that yeah leaves in here right don't fall off the side of the mountain please yeah this dudes in the most precarious location its precarious it's preposterous no where is it I get it oh I got it okay we're fine wonder if I should chunk my but the chunk mine is gonna start at the top I think oh well look at what we have over there look at what we have fine what you're looking for oh yeah that foggy stone is very very no bueno the what isn't what's happen right now it does take a very long time to mine that I tried with just my picker or x-ray I don't know I just have the flexible pickaxe and it it just broke and I didn't get it out of the filter yeah the foggy stone is is bad it what I'm saying is it might not be you might not have an oh it's going to the other place yeah I got it over here oh god where do you have that chest wired out to you know it ends up in a ditch there don't worry no I am worried because it has something I need to fetch from it come over here this is the excess like oh okay stuff so we'll end up in the unfiltered spot cool yeah we're gonna need a bigger chest okay because when I when I do that if I chunk thing it's gonna it's gonna just fill that sucker up a sample app I guess [Music] no you just do an easy smelter ooh the easiest to smelt aru's you dude here I failed to take note of what I actually need to be doing okay well oh this is the one with the weird man which one what I hate weird math dude weird math no fun this is this is the weirdest math yeah is I got a like I don't know it's just it's several steps and it's figuring out I need seven of the iron meshes for eyes or I need 56 oh that yeah that was always yeah yeah and it's like carry the one I just kind of say hi to manually I don't know what that is so you smelt it in the opium ingot no I know but I don't know what what's the reference there it's man to leave cool does that explain you right there did that explained it I now know your tie you you you said it again and I was like oh I didn't get that yeah definitely do now yeah no I know I know what you're saying and I like akin iffy through Abbott air let's let's find out it actually but air it's like can it be through but here wait is it the guy who made the periodic table really oh my god it's always raining sounds rough well it mines quicker and it just drops a lot of rocks sick there we go so eight of those will make will make one and give me permission can you do slash OPM I do three I get more slash Opie CaptainSparklez eight is seven I forget it three I get four seven time and of course half they don't be fooled by the rocks that I got because I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block oh my god can't I jump mine with the flexible tax pitbull through this foggy stone though like but can you guess we're gonna find out see you there whoa hey no Frick get it freakin sawblades out of here no stop y'all suck yo y'all suck just FYI just catching you up on current events you suck alright there's some you know that chest you set up yes has no more room in it um well I was going to set it up so that it would drain faster okay it but you got mad when I moved it so I could do that no I'm just giving you a heads up like it's there's probably not some forest dirt why are you getting a forest dirt apparently there are meshes in a chest that exists yeah I know about that oh no we're okay but I wanted to keep some because different things need to be different sieve differently or need the different meshes I didn't want to use the ones we had I just wanted to make all enough so we had all the diamond we can fill in and then that way if we do do the other ones who can got you it made total sense to me well that's about all I can do so far because we need we need large large large chests yes all over the place yeah just a few rocks just just some rocks you know do our rocks like do we need rocks what do we I mean I guess we can make cobblestone out of it control for advanced Info yeah that me rocks can you shift cables rocks mining corners or go down centipede running across the floor over there yeah chests with hoppers is probably the easiest way to do it like we just do a gargantuan stack of chess and hoppers you're still gonna go faster in the hoppers probably but we could it would at least you know be able to go and then it waits a second then it goes and waits make diamond two chests we do that I don't feel like we're getting a little loosey-goosey with these little diamond thing use all your diamonds yeah no Bentley everything takes diamond yeah in order to do that we actually need to yeah go basically go and use a lot of a lot of resources because you need a lot of gold for that so but we could use silver tin chests because Oh God art art things here are quite full to really we're not working on it I'm doing working on everything here we're too bad we're too good at resources dude I'm doing everything I can [Music] dude you're good at resources yeah we've we've got all the resources that and you swapped out so that we're now getting a bunch of life I guess I can probably already won more diamonds boys I don't have any more voids everyone want diamonds is good it's good to get diamonds y'all believe and we need more plates of iron but there's gold I just don't know where I should wear the most efficient place to set up this chunk minor situation is I don't have answers for you on that one I wish I did Oh what we could do is we could yeah pump pump all those rocks into a void pipe I mean that's part of it but I need to get a lot faster pump - yeah for sure is there a magnetic dynamo of some sort that we have access to I know we have the the Stirling engine but do we have an engine that can just run off magma as far as I am aware I'm not aware is that the combustion engine if the combustion engine does that then I can do some shenanigans maybe I'll just do some SH in again re because we're getting towards the end in fact we we are pretty much at the end what I'm thinking I will try and do is figure out how to get an engine that will extract from this chest and then I can use this stone because the stone I don't know it's not stone it's the phosphor I can use the phosphor to try and generate more lava so I can hopefully make it self beating okay but the and then do stuff so that might be something I do in the interim and then continue to compress our resources and and utilize them is there anything else you want me to work on no that that sounds like a good idea Oh what we can do is okay so we can make a respirator in order to go into the layers down below in the mystery world so cool that will open up the ability to set up the chunk liner in a better location so that's great yeah okay sounds good cool cool well he sounds good to me yeah making a chest that can dump out into other chests is good good call or maybe some drawers or something something that can like a void drawer could help yeah yeah I'll put it into it I put the cobble into a drawer with a void to upgrade and then that way it'll just dump away and we all have some but we won't be storing we won't be running is it cobble or using the rocks the rocks okay which I can put into a compacting drawer and it will turn it into Kabul and then that way I never know whether or not that or not but regardless tell me about it I got it cool sounds good dude Oh next I need with less sniffles after you get done with your outro Wow Wow I forgot about the outro I'm out of it okay jumping that gun man he's like I'm going I'm out but before he runs away he everybody wins also in that same description you can find a link to the playlist so you can catch and count all the episodes of which he just fills up with sniffles and then finally or that you might have missed whichever you prefer and then finally we do stream these live so you can see the sniffles as they happen twitch.tv slash CaptainSparklez and twitch.tv slash zine anything else mister sniffle man nope you you covered the sniffles dude you covered them bye guys see ya
