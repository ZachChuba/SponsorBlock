I get attached to things like really attached hey babe do you need a new toothbrush oh no I've had this one since I was a kid wait what and quickly very very quickly hi I'm Anna nice to meet you I read no I'm sorry this is my no I don't do it consciously I can't help it I'm an imaginative person so of course I immediately fantasize about the outcome of things the moment the possibility presents itself whether it's a job opportunity I'm excited about so your resume says you're proficient with Adobe Premiere Pro CC I'm gonna like it here excuse me I mean you guys have kombucha on tap that is crazy yeah I love LA oh and the office labs are so like Fung Shui you know what I should probably get back to my desk I've got a lot of work to do uh or if I meet a guy and we have great chemistry well I'm Japanese Hawaiian so I'm historically self-destructive you're funny thank you so what are your emotional triggers your attachment style your level of self-awareness of your childhood traumas and how are you working to overcome them oh and what's your birth time well look if we're gonna make this work I'm gonna need to know your ascendant we had just a TV show I hear this show is really good but there's only two seasons out and there's a rumor that it gets canceled do I bother and what if I really love it and I know I'm setting myself up for huge disappointments because you don't always get that job and sometimes that guy doesn't call you for a second date and most definitely that show is gonna get canceled but on the other side of the extremest spectrum never getting invested in anything kind of sucks too I mean without the hope of anything happening life is just I mean hopeless and that would be definitely way less fun than the emotional roller coaster of becoming overly attached to something instantaneously and riding the high of expectation and of course the answer always lies in moderation like I don't know how many times I have to learn this lesson but here we are again a decade on YouTube and I'm still rediscovering that all of my problems usually have the same answer you know sometimes it feels like when you get older your problems just sort of like mutate like bacteria or something and they become smarter and stronger and you as the anti body have to remember hey wait a second you're the same problem I dealt with like two years ago only a right to version cuz this is bullsh so now I'm striving to pace out my emotional investment in all possibilities in a healthy organic way instead of just like shoving all of my expectations into this one desired outcome so that anything other than what I imagined will just leave me in despair I self hope for what will happen but I don't immediately get married to the idea that this job is mine this boy is mine or that's gonna be show better go on for forty three seasons instead I try to actively and consciously just trust that if the job is mine it'll be mine if that's the right boy for me it'll work out I surrender everything to the universe and I know that it's gonna unfold exactly as it should and I immediately freak out and think that's all wrong and I surrender again and the cycle repeats forever and ever and ever and ever until we die yay I'm Anna Akana don't get attached to an outdated outro that no longer feels awesome thank you
