hot ones have figured out how to send wings and sauce in the mail and they are continuing to produce hot questions and even hotter wings a fan on instagram tossed me a link to eric andre's recent appearance and he mentioned a drink he invented that i just couldn't resist giving a try to so let's do it today on how to drink we're gonna make eric andre's yellow number two with an internet betwixt them sean evans and eric andre have sat down for a revisit on their previous you know now famous maybe it's infamous interview come on go get them baby and as a result i've learned a few things about eric uh one that guy's got some seriously amazing plants i am very envious of his lush indoor tropical garden these are home goals for me that is exactly what i want and two uh he's mixing and inventing drinks if you're not fresh squeezing that lime right before you make that drink get the [ __ ] out of my face shawn probed him about a creation he was proud of i asked him whoa can you name me a drink that you made that you really like and eric gave a spec for a recipe he calls yellow number two yellow number two which um i'm actually not sure if there is or isn't a schedological joke in there so i'm gonna just go with yes anyway the recipe he gave was interesting and i wanted to try it out and then my next thought was i should try that on camera uh that'll be good content as they say so that is what i am doing now we're gonna try out his yellow number two for the first time his recipe calls for mezcal yellow chartreuse simple syrup lemon salt and a shishito pepper uh and very importantly yellow pepper juice now i've never heard of yellow pepper juice but he said it so nonchalantly i figured it must be some very common thing and a quick google would clue me in and i didn't find anything super conclusive but it does look like yellow pepper juice is a really common ingredient in these juice cleanses that some people are into i'm going to assume it's just like an la thing and then it went over my head what are you doing here uh so yes it is just juiced yellow bell peppers and there's no really mystery there at all so i got some yellow bell peppers toss them in my juicer and bottled the result here it is you know what it tastes like let's give it a little shake you do it's really sweet it's actually really really nice like i actually like this a lot and i'm not like a bell pepper fan if you made this into like a soft drink i think people would enjoy this it is a a relatively sweet um fresh tasting i i maybe i would say it's like borderline grassy but grassy can imply other things like more vegetal i i think it's probably some of those same compounds that would result in a grassy taste but in a different mix very very enjoyable actually that's good stuff tasty the other thing we're going to need is a charred shishito pepper for garnish you should make these in advance or if you have a blowtorch you can do on the spot i don't have a kitchen blowtorch anymore because i'm out of fuel for it um here they are but what i did was just simply place them on the grill of my gas range and charred them up you may notice that these are not shishito peppers i tasted them they're pretty sweet and fine they're close enough um i can't get sharpie to peppers where i'm at for some reason and so for smoked small he didn't smalt for smoked salt he didn't mention what brand he was using and there's a huge variability from one to next so i kind of just picked something and went with it i'm going to put a link in the pin comment down below yeah this is what i've got it's uh trad cell cell de grande grand smoked course sea salt i bought this actually at fairway back when i lived in the city and i have had very little use for it but um if i can find a link i'll put a link to this or something comparable in the pinned comment below so i'm going to begin this show by [ __ ] this glass with smoked salt we're gonna give it a little rim job yes that's a double entendre you filthy souls there's a sticker on here it's not good for camera uh i'll take this lemon and i will slice it in half because we're gonna juice it as well so there's no reason to like make something useless like a wedge or whatever i'm gonna take my glass and i will half rim this by taking my half lemon and running it over the outside of the lip of the glass where i want my rim to stick i'm half ribbing because i don't know if i'm going to want to have a heavy dose of smoky salt in every sip of this and this gives me options when i'm enjoying the drink later stuff does not want to hang out on this glass looks like uh dirty sand that's great like wet dirty sand it doesn't smell like it smells delicious and i did a terrible job of ripping the glass i will do better in the close-up um that's how that works i need half an ounce or 15 millimeter millimeters did that again i need half an ounce or 15 milliliters of the lemon juice so let's put that in here that's a heavy lemon that's a big lemon that's a big boy for my little juicer and then i need half an ounce of simple syrup this is mine is two to one uh eric didn't specify but half an ounce 15 milliliters simple syrup now i need an ounce and a half of that yellow pepper juice otherwise known as 45 milliliters i juiced this and then ran it through a fine sieve a couple of times to make sure there was no pulp in it i need half an ounce of yellow chartreuse yellow chartreuse is um really i mean it's high proof stuff right this is 43 alcohol by volume but it is the more mild of the two between this and the green chartreuse it's a little bit lower in proof a little and uh sweetened a touch uh generally speaking i think the they keep it a secret but the consensus is that it's probably at least some portion honey and then i need an ounce and a half of mezcal i'm going with vida mezcal uh that's pretty good stuff ounce and a half of them as cow put some ice into my big cup here big cube goes in i'm to crack one strain this into the prepared glass it's a real look i'm not really sure what the intent is here with this garnish if you should just drop it in like a floater or put a little notch in i'm going to try and put a little notch here i'm good to sit on the lip of the glass i think that'll look a little bit better there you go that's not bad at all um yeah i think possibly it's supposed to look like something floating in the pool uh wow that's a surprising drink it's got a little bit of a frothy white head on there from the pepper um this is cool looking honestly kudos eric that's fantastic let's find out what it tastes like the yellow number two invented by eric andre away i go boy that's nice that is a really surprisingly fresh and bright sweet type of sour the sour component is mild it's got a lot of smoke in it from the smoked pepper from the smoked salt and of course from the mezcal i'm somebody who can find that flavor to be overpowering very easily as a matter of fact there's a place near me that does uh some smoked barbecue chicken smoked fried chicken that it's like it's too much smoky it gives me a headache as soon as i bite it um certain eyelashes can be like an instant headache this is uh it's moderated enough here that i actually find this to be extremely enjoyable it is like a very lovely uh springtime like sweet but not too too sweet but sweet like fruit punch something you might want by the pool with like a kick of smoke in it with a little bit of that salt oh man that's great it's very tasty eric yeah and if you just get like just the right amount of salt in there with a sip it really it really kicks it up it brings something to that i wonder if you're supposed to like char the shishito right on the glass so it's like still smoking when you drink it that might have been the trick with a blowtorch unfortunately i didn't do that right if that's the case but i can sort of imagine that the effect would be lovely easy to drink as you can see i am just like ripping through this sucker it gets very woody i mean just like like sitting by a campfire damn that's cool it's really neat the yellow number two from eric andre thank you so much not normally something i do on the show saw this on hot ones i saw eric andre on it big fan thought it would be really cool to do this um maybe there's like other like this is so cliche and dumb but maybe it's worth it maybe there's other like celeb drinks celebrity drinks that we could explore and do on the show maybe there's like a whole little sub series in that i don't know let me know if you want to see that especially if you have any ideas if you have any suggestions about that shoot me a comment shoot me a dm i would love that i'll put a link around up in here for that to eric andre uh thank you for inventing a tasty drink that is worth knowing really good to come on the show sometime i guess it'll just be like hot ones we'll just be on cameras i don't know what we'll do together nothing you don't want to hang out with me i'm a loser oh ooh that salt is salty i'm supposed to ask you to do all those youtubers things
