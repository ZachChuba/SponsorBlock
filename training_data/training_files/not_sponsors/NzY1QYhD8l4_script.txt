well the past two weeks have been sort of weird you might know that I recently uploaded today is spaceship day a short film written by artificial intelligence which I adapted into a 3d animation in the days since the film has blown up wrecking in over a million hits in less than a week and this is due in no small part to all of you watching it sharing it with others than watching it again and because of this it has become one of the biggest videos on my channel and all of this has helped me get through sort of a creative rough patch that I've been going through recently so thanks I suppose it's a testament to my abilities as a writer that out of all of the narrative short films that I've created in my life this is the one that really means something notice that somebody added it to my IMDB page so what do you do when you've made a short film that folks just can't seem to get enough of merchandising merchandising merchandising Hagrid the table t-shirts ordinary sounding words t-shirts ordinary sounding words coffee mugs ordinary sounding words phone covers buy them all while you still can at the merch store available for a limited time only but I went even further than that I might have told a few of my patreon supporters that if the film happened to go viral than I would adapt it again except this time as a children's read aloud book well here we are and here we are today is spaceship day a full-color 48 page children's book this took way too long to make and today I'm going to share with you how I did it so the first step is to plan everything out and to do that I took a bunch of paper folded it into a book and loosely sketched out what I wanted each page to look like illustrated books the good ones aren't just a collection of screenshots or movie stills much like graphic novels they have their own visual structure and aesthetic often you only have a single page to convey everything that's supposed to happen in a scene and this means figuring out key images that can fit lots of story detail in only problem is the animated movie I made it doesn't have a lot of master shots like this so I needed to figure out how to combine various assets together to both tell the story and entertain readers the biggest roadblock of writing children's books at least that I can tell is that they need to be short sweet and memorable after my first attempt at sketching everything together I realized that this book was way too big 60 pages in total I needed to cut things down but I didn't want to cut down the story so that meant consolidating pages and streamlining the overall presentation I cannot stress enough how important this planning stage is much like storyboarding a film doing this it gives you a solid roadmap of the book and it ensures that you're not going to waste time going down creative rabbit holes of which there is no escape before I even touched a computer I wanted to get this step right so my second time around sketching things out I managed to squeeze the story into 48 pages still not ideal but I honestly couldn't consolidate anymore and still keep all of the proper story beats so with this basic blueprint in hand I could move on to assembly full disclosure I only had about a day and a half to make this thing while professionals use things like Adobe Illustrator for design and go through a traditional printer or publisher I needed something that was fast with very little learning curve I settled on using blurb a website that allows you to quickly and easily design a print and sell illustrated books and magazines this video isn't sponsored by them they have no clue who I am there are lots of print on demand sites that have comparable services to this I just did a quick google search in their site was the one that happened to pop up first I downloaded and installed their application which is a fairly simple and straightforward user interface for designing books through their company I just entered the type of book I wanted to print the size how many pages and within no time at all I was designing at this point I opened up Adobe After Effects imported the movie and using my sketches as a guide extracted various visual elements from the flick and put them together to create some panoramas one great thing about blurbs interface was that I could either isolate a single page from the book or double up and assemble two-page spreads a technique that actually helped me condense a lot of the story the big things I needed to look out for included the safety margins where the company might cut the page during printing and the text size now you don't want any key visual information cut off so if you do this be sure to keep an eye on those margins any text in these areas is likely to be cut off on the final product and interestingly enough blurbs app let me know whenever there was a possibility that this could happen and advised me to reorganize text size is always tough for me to determine and in a book that has very little empty space I needed to employ drop shadows to ensure that the white text could be legible when reading 48 pages of work later I had something resembling a children's book this led to the final step which is review and revision is eager as I was to hit publish I needed to check things over where the images aligned properly could I tell what was going on in each scene where their spelling or grammar errors this stuff matters and I actually found quite a few mostly text alignment and spacing issues which I did my best to revise and finalize a good trick I learned for spotting errors was to review the book on different monitors and in different settings something about looking at your work with different lighting and at different elevations makes you look at it harder and you're less likely to skim over typos and mistakes finally satisfied that everything in the book was cleaned up and ready to go I exported a finished PDF file and uploaded it to blurb and let their storefront software take over getting a book on the public market requires an all standard book number or ISBN which in my corner of the world can be obtained from the US ISBN agency these can be bought in bulk or as singles but if you don't mind giving the exclusive publishing rights over to a print on demand service several of them offer these for free I wasn't comfortable with that so I bought my own from that point it was just a matter of having a printed proof copy delivered to me for final review and yadda-yadda-yadda today is spaceship day the children's book available for public purchase on that note by far the biggest downside to print on demand services is the huge markup price selling this thing on the public market means charging an arm and a leg and I will see almost none of this money in my pocket at the end of the day glowing review right but it is true you're not going to be making a fortune if you go this route but like I said I wasn't really worried about the money I just wanted to throw something together quickly and easily voila all in all putting a book like this together it was a really fun experience I've never done anything like this before it got me thinking a lot about visual design and telling stories through still images as opposed to video or animation still have a lot to learn in those areas but this was a neat way to experiment making a kids book like this and self-publishing it all seems very intimidating but it really doesn't have to be there are so many print-on-demand services out there these days that anybody can do it and hopefully today I felt to maybe demystify the entire process will I make another AI story in the future no I don't know other creators are starting to get into the game surreal entertainment I saw the other days throwing his hat into the ring I want to focus more on narrative stuff that comes from here and to that end all of this merchants isn't just some kind of cheap money grab I promise every time you support me by picking up a t-shirt or a coffee mug or anything else from my merch page the proceeds help me to fund my next film thank you again for all of
