in 2006 I want a national competition to spend two weeks at NASA's Kennedy and Johnson Space Center's I saw the Space Shuttle land I met astronauts I did astronaut training one of the BBC reports I featured in described it as a once-in-a-lifetime trip and I hated that but first let's backtrack one day a few people in my year 10 shooter group discovered this competition called edge into space we had to design something which is gonna improve life in space in some way like me they were massive dorks love you guys and so we formed a team our idea was to create a temporary pressurized oxygenated environment that you could use in space exploration base it was a tent but basically we designed a space 10 that you could use on the moon and you could extend your range of operations away from like a lander and so we've made a presentation that explained what the idea was how you would use it and some of the science involved like using electrolysis of water to create oxygen and we sent it off 2006 me year 10 me was very different to the version of me that you see on youtube today there wasn't a single thing in my academic track record that was notable in any way I was just a kid in a normal school in the West Country of England but after this trip everything changed because somehow we were selected as the winners of the competition from the southwest of England and so we were taken on this two-week trip along with the winners from other parts of the UK to NASA now the two weeks we went to NASA were officially designated as the work experience weeks we hear 10 students in the UK so those are the weeks when you go and you work in a company that's relevant to your career interests and you get same spot on your CV but we didn't do that because we went to NASA but considering at the time I wanted to be an astronaut and I still do now who doesn't and that whilst we were there we learned all about the space industry from the inside and did astronaut training in a way I kind of did to work experience at NASA however if you click this video expecting a detailed breakdown of how you two can successfully apply 2d work experience at NASA then you might be all like Master Kenobi you disappoint me but should you click off this video oh I don't think so incidentally am I going to be using prequel memes in my videos from now on I mean something Goods got to come out of how terrible Attack of the Clones was the trip was a once-in-a-lifetime event in that you can't go on it it only ever happened once but in this video I want to talk about what happened on the trip how it changed my life and eventually why the phrase once-in-a-lifetime trip is the verbal version of Attack of the Clones firstly before even getting to Florida one of the scariest events of my entire life happened on this trip when I was pulled aside at Newark Airport so this is in New York because I flew from London to New York New York to Florida I will put aside I think because I've got some paperwork wrong and taken into this small room with a massively tall desk and a border official with a gun and asked what what you're doing in New York and I said I was getting a connecting flight in Florida and then no joke his response to me was to look me dead in the eye and say okay why are you pretending to do that what do you say what do you say to that I'm going to NASA to be an astronaut I'm going to space count actually I think I did literally say both those things there let me go in the end for whatever reason in Florida we spent several days at the Kennedy Space Center so this is the Space Center where Rockets are launched into space and we did a historical tour of sites like the Apollo 1 launch memorial we saw two of the unused Saturn 5 rockets which are impossibly big and we also went into the block houses which were the protective buildings that were used in the very early days of NASA we also did a workshop building paper rockets and this was mine visited the planetarium and went to SeaWorld where I did not enjoy the rides each day was completely different but basically we got super up close to the nuts and bolts of the space industry this was a million miles away from anything we'd experienced before we were seeing the culmination of decades of technical and scientific expertise in the flesh this was tens of thousands of hours of effort and preparation and payoff but I didn't come away from looking at this thinking oh wow isn't that amazing that people have done that or even I want to do this I want to do this as well like I think the message I got was simply this is possible yeah I love space and spaceflight then as I do now but seeing literally the history of rocketry evolving in front of me didn't make me want to recreate it it made me want to build my own things and of all the things that we did in Florida nothing conveyed that more than seeing the space shuttle land from the VIP area it was shuttle flight sts-121 if you must know I can promise you that it is one thing to read about space hardware and entirely another to see it in action right in front of you I mean seeing what what is basically the most iconic spacecraft ever land right in front of you and nearly supersonic speeds and it's blackened and charred from going through the atmosphere that's possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life I think I said as much at the time actually [Music] [Applause] you leave us just been out in space no just looks like a plane is just landed all the same it's raw star just saw it it was going so quickly it's like a dot on the horizon and suddenly is there and it was all you can see it was child from going through the atmosphere and I think that's because I was clearly such a natural on camera when we next flew to Houston in Texas to do some astronaut training at the Johnson Space Center including a simulated spacewalk and a simulated lunar walk with lunar gravity I was put in front of the camera again this time it was after I've been on the multi-axis generator so I've been spun in loads of different directions all at once came to a halt and then whoop camera right in front my face if they tumbled out of control in orbit you could realign yourself and I can't pay for the experience and that was weird your head still swimming the blood rushes the air and then it goes down the other half of your body and then you put your stomach's at the centrist he didn't get in or check you try and do a coherent interview after being spun in a million different directions much as the astronaut training day was fun I think the thing which changed my life happened at the very end of the trip because in Houston we saw the training facilities for astronauts we saw the neutral buoyancy lab we saw the actual space shuttle used to Train astronauts we saw the Mission Control for the International Space Station I'm tween that software and that preparation and the hardware in Kennedy there's the component without which the whole thing would be pointless on our last night in America we met the astronaut twins Scott and Mark Kelly the latter of which had just piloted the space shuttle back to earth two days before and he wasn't scheduled to meet us he just knew that his brother was gonna be there meeting some kids and decided to turn up saying that I just I just would've been on the safer otherwise service in space the tumors in space two days before these guys were to me then and still now living legends they were the culmination the neck of decades of scientific and technical and engineering expertise of hundreds of thousands of hours of training and preparation and studying they were what was possible they represented what I now saw I could be so when I went back home to England as I said earlier everything changed like a line in the sand before the NASA trip nothing academically exceptional about me at all after the trip best GCSEs in my school went to Oxford to study physics got my PhD a phrase that I really like is that we are all prisoners of our previous reference point it's difficult to seriously dream big when you are limited to a small part of your country where frankly nothing happens going to NASA open my eyes to what was possible if you are willing to train and put the time in and do practice problem after problem after problem after problem until you can do something flawlessly it prepares to the point where you can do something perfectly every time like Marc and Scott Kelly did in space edge into space redefined what I thought was possible with my life which brings me on to the phrase once-in-a-lifetime trip it implies that once something amazing has happened you should contend yourself by just saying well I'm glad that happened and then going on living the rest of your life how pathetic is that yes there are events which can only ever happen once in a lifetime like seeing Halley's Comet or watching a particular star goes supernova and yes trying to recreate exceptional events can literally drive a person insane but why should you ever be content to have your life your one chance at life to ever be limited every time I've experienced something wants in a lifetime and I've been lucky enough to experience quite a few I've not come away satisfied I wanted more and I've used the event to springboard me to further success I used it to redefine the reference point that I'm prisoner to in the case of going to NASA I came home and I got serious about studying I'd seen what was possible if I dedicated time to the grind to preparing for my exams to studying and so I adjusted how I was living my life to realize what I saw as my new potential that potential had always been there I hadn't fundamentally changed as a person but I didn't see the heights that I could reach and so my new reference point had removed the limitations that I'd subconsciously put on my own future because that's the only way to respond to being told that you're doing something once-in-a-lifetime by changing that lifetime to prove the speaker wrong by changing how you live your life to make what was once exceptional your new normal as long as this is for positive experiences we don't want attack of the clones to become the new normal quality for Star Wars pip oh no after my trip to NASA something that I very specifically did was up my game in terms of past papers and doing practice questions for my GCSEs doing problem after problem after problem after problem until I thoroughly understood the concepts on the mats and science syllabi I think you work pretty well and if you'd like to follow the premium subscription I hope you enjoyed this video do pop it alike if you did if you're not already subscribe to the channel and
