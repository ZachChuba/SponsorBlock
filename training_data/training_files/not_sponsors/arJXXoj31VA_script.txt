business or tech subject you can think of [Music] [Music] people big dog let me see please ji D is a really really good rapper but in 2019 being a really really good rapper isn't good enough think logic or even Eminem what was once a skill that could earn you respect and admiration is now the butt of jokes in Instagram comment sections everywhere and I think that's because lyrical rappers lost sight of the amazing storytelling they're capable of pulling off in their music even Kendrick who's often considered the greatest of all time watered his music down on damn we live in the age of trap music and as a lyrical rapper you have two choices incorporate the trends or stick to your guns it just so happens that sticking to your guns is corny and incorporating the new style will make you a sellout so how does ji D simultaneously pull off both without a hitch from his soul and jazz inspired trap flavoured instrumentals to his energetic lyrical rapping he's a rapper to pay close attention to for the foreseeable future in this video I'm going to talk about ji Dee's musical origins his storytelling production and road to success let's get into it I mean I still that that she gave you that name because like even on some of your songs your rap flow is kind of jittery sometimes yes like coming to doing City a sporadic but in a good way awesome like real nice you know melodic ride the beat type [ __ ] not just like you saying anything from Houston but I think a lot of fans now just because of the whole Gucci Mane wave they just automatically assume everybody from East Atlanta is a super trapper and representing six but I don't really get that vibe for you yeah like can you break down exactly like your low area and what influenced you to harden from the same area okay I stayed on both Chris role I stayed on flesh hose I stayed on Linwood I stayed I got family in crushing like kennel role like I stayed on the whole east side and I can have families on teams that stay in each of these areas but it's the same type story I'm I'm just telling it from my perspective you feel me like everybody thinks that land is correlated with like trapping wool but it's just a different perspective you think because I wasn't into that [ __ ] I was into some other [ __ ] when I was around people around me and so and she's got a brain to be who you wanted be nice to crowd JIT was born in Atlanta Georgia in 1990 as the youngest of seven kids he comes from a big family his family and friends exposed him to music from an early age his earliest musical influences include classic funk and soul bands like Sly and the Family Stone and Earth Wind and Fire as he got older he drew an interest in the 1990s New York hip-hop scene learning from rappers such as jay-z NAS and mob deep before JIT discovered a talent for music he spent some time pursuing a career in sports he got a college scholarship to play football at a school in the southeast majoring in entrepreneurship and sports management he even planned at one time to consider law school or sports coaching as possible future careers but life had never exactly been easy for JIT and they wouldn't stay that way either in an incident he's mentioned in various songs and interviews gid was kicked out of college before he could finish his degree and he had to head back to Atlanta but he wasn't going to waste time in an interview with vibe magazine he talked about how when he was kicked out of college he immediately went home and started making music like many rappers before him he worked at call centers and delivered pizza using his money to get his music career off the ground ji DS first mixtape cakewalk came out in 2010 while he was still in college it didn't make it outside of his college campus and for good reason it was mixed poorly with bad beats and Ji DS rapping didn't sound anything like it does today but all great rappers have to start somewhere and if JIT hadn't made cakewalk he wouldn't have met earth game the hip-hop duo also from Atlanta that were attending the same university as jad earth gang inviting him to join their musical collective spillage village a partnership that exists to this day over the next couple of years ji d continued working hard on his raps from 2010 to 2013 he dropped four mixtapes and skipping from the first to the fourth the difference between his instrumentals mixing rapping and storytelling is night and day para 2 J IDs fourth mixtape honestly sounds a lot like the music he makes now it's pretty unpolished but the sound is there it was around 2013 2014 that ji G's music started taking off in Atlanta he opened up for ABS Souls these days tour with earth gang in 2014 and he released his first EP in 2015 meanwhile his musical collectives village village self released their first studio album bears like this too much in 2016 the album featured production from Mac Miller Jay Cole and childish major bears like this too much is a quiet laid-back record with atmospheric beats and thoughtful songwriting themes include the black experience in America money and relationships shortly after the release of bears like this too much jad was signed to Jay Cole's dreamville label it was a perfect fit Jay Cole is a legendary rapper renowned for his lyrical storytelling technical ability and world-class production dream bells cult fanbase is well-known for their adoration of Cole's music but as they would soon find out ji D is more than capable of living up to any expectations set before him maybe a little more ji Dee's first studio album the never story dropped just a month after he was signed to dream though and it's crazy well polished ji D worked hard during the seven years this is a unique idea that means something ji D or an event in his past that made him who he is today the records beats are generally trapped flavored but they keep it fresh by incorporating funk and soul instrumentation overall the never story is a record that exists in two places at once but it doesn't feel torn between either of them and that's what makes me think it could easily become a classic one day ji D was able to find the perfect balance between trends and substance and how did he do that well it's pretty simple ji D is a lot older than the average rapper bursting onto the scene with a catchy single or funny gimmick he's been making and listening to music for a long time and the result is a rapper that stays true to his past without ignoring what makes music popular right now ji d's second album came out a year after his first DiCaprio - was again released by dreamville it's slightly longer than the never story with an extra 10 minutes added to the total running time sophomore albums are famously difficult and a particular quote comes to mind when I think about DiCaprio - I don't remember exactly who said it but I think it goes like this you have over 20 years to write your debut but only one to write the follow-up the quote refers to the sophomore slump a seemingly common problem where an artist's second release fails to live up to the expectations set by their first I mean sophomore albums are pretty hard to pull off you can try to recreate the magic of your first album or do something completely different it's going to be either better than your debut just the same or worse either way everyone's watching and no one's going to be completely happy and that kind of pressure can often result in some pretty harebrained sophomore albums but DiCaprio - expertly dodged these pitfalls experienced by countless artists releasing their second record DiCaprio - was made with the same toolkit as the never story but it tells news stories JIT experimented with new sounds and inspirations while keeping his same soulful trap style intact each and every song on the album offers something different from the others and JIT showcases a number of unique vocal styles from fast technical rapping on 151 rum to laid-back sing rapping on working out the album feels much shorter than it is thanks to the way ji D paces his raps song lengths and storytelling DiCaprio - is a lot like the never story but it doesn't feel like too much of a good thing ji D steams aren't even close to feeling worn out he talks about drugs family friends and of course the pitfalls of modern romance his rapping and lyricism is cinematic and what I mean by that is he makes the mundane seem larger than life his neighborhood is the stage his family and friends are the supporting cast and he's the hero constantly ducking in and out of trouble dodging fiendish women just barely getting by while his interest in music slowly but surely grew into something brilliant dedicated sod underdogs in the building sort of people feel underappreciated who's working hands off right now this is for the people like like like Russell Westbrook that's right I saw Jay ID live at toads place in New Haven Connecticut with the capacity of around 800 people it's a nightclub style venue with standing room only and as I looked around the room on that cold March evening I couldn't help but notice that the venue decorated the walls with pictures of different musicians that had played there over the years Kanye West just a month after the release of the college dropout kendrick lamar a month before dropping good kid maad city and Radiohead two months after the release of the bends it was exciting to stand in a room that had seen so many of my musical idols at the very moment they were reaching their prime but what excited me more was the idea that one day picture of ji D himself could be posted on that wall to DiCaprio to and the never story our amazing works of storytelling and style in their own right but like Kendrick and Kanye before him ji D is at a crossroads he's told us who he is his origin story is laid out on paper across two amazing albums but what really matters is what he decides to say next while we wait to hear what I'm making videos so check it out and start learning you
