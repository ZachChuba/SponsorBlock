Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa Woo- babe- oh snowman! Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa Woohoo- What if you fell apart, I fear the wind tonight You look more tired, but wait
I'll make you feel better soon As soon as I touch you, it feels strange You blinked your eyes, flinched your fingers, right? Oh snowman! Hug me tight! Oh snowman! You're not cold Oh snowman! I worry you'll melt away Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa Oh snowman! (Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa) Tell me, the stories we laughed about last night Your darkened face makes me worried, I'll look after you better As soon as I touch you, it feels cool You blinked your eyes, flinched your fingers, right? Oh snowman! Hug me tight! Oh snowman! You're not cold Oh snowman! I worry you'll melt away This is the first time I've shown all my feelings This is love, love, all my love
It's only you, oh! Snowman! I'll wait for you Oh snowman! Until it snows Oh snowman! I worry my heart will melt before then Just like now, oh! Snowman! Woo, hug me! Oh snowman! You're not cold Oh snowman! I worry you'll melt away Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa Oh snowman! (Oohwa oohwa oohwa oohwa)
