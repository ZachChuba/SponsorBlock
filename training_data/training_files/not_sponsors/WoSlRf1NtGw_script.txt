by New Belgium Brewing Company balanced news or a balanced beef the Republican Party has struggled with the youth vote in recent elections but now there are some good news for conservatives a new Gallup poll found that the GOP has an overwhelming advantage among young people who look like old men the poll shows Republicans hold a solid lead among the coveted elderly youth demographic including 18 to 24-year olds who wear suspenders and bowties to class everyday I'm joined by a Republican strategist Rob Powell Reb these are pretty encouraging numbers for the GOP aren't they of course it's very encouraging Millennials who look like they're permanently dressed for boat trips are a rapidly growing segment of the population and according to the survey the prematurely aged are also very politically active only about 20% of young people vote overall but there's almost 100% turnout among youth that dress like a dad from a 1950 sitcom now what about the criticism that the GOP only appeals to white men not true we also have a lot of support among sorority girls that wear pant suits and pearls paunchy Chinese college students and we're making inroads among African American ham radio enthusiasts so what is it about the party that is so attractive to young buzzkills 19 year olds with comb-overs know we share their interests and values like standing behind podiums wearing American flag pins being louder than other people these are the things that are important to Millennials who look like toddlers that crawled into a rapid aging machine Republican leaders must feel pretty optimistic about the upcoming midterm they are but we can't take these moon-faced man babies for granted candidates are going to keep reaching out to them on social media holding campus get-togethers with free snack wells and cream sodas and of course there was also some encouraging news for the Democrats the poll shows that they continue to hang on to their own key demographic of adult men who dress like teenagers it's going to be an exciting race it is good inside as always thanks Rob next up the giant garbage island in the middle of the ocean makes a bid to host the 2024 Olympics
