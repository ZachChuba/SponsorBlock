brighter than the sky I changed everyone's plans to walk you guys through this one shot you guys saw the shot you guys I'm talking about you saw it I don't you know explain it let's go I want this to come together out of thin air like in fortnight right when you build stuff in fortnight pieces what I got here is a noodle wall so I clone just a cylinder and make sure it was all due to the measurements of the actual foam wall once I have my phone wall modelled group everything into one drop-down so I can just work with that one mama first thing I'm stacking effects I threw the noodle wall into a fracture object and in the fracture object I told it to not just look at the whole thing but break it up into all the different segments that it's made out of next thing throw that into a random effector randomly moves all the objects in your you know whatever you put into the randomizer randomizing to position it randomizes the scale and rotation I'm gonna put the random effector into another effector that is called the push apart I don't want to push them apart I want them to go from nothing and scale up to their final size to push apart effect actually has a drop down here in their mode called scale apart that's what I'm animating I'm animating the scale apart and I'm animating the random effector and that is going to give us the look of this phone wall materializing out of thin air that's what I love so much about cinema is you have all these cool things in this program that allow you to do a bunch of fun stuff and you get to tweak them in a bunch of fun different ways that's what it looks built from the outside in you know it finishes on the inside that's that's the that's the gist of animating the wall now we're in a position where I need to put this animation into shot that is very shaky I'm not the best camera tracking Loretto the way you camera tracking works is that it actually tracks dozens of points across the shot figures out how all those points move in relation to each other to figure out a 3d camera moving through space my problem here is that there's not enough detail so yet unsharp mask and I've talked about this in the previous video before you have to add three different layers of unsharp mask it it's it's a gross looking shot but it's now ready to track so that's what I'm gonna do my exported that as an image sequence and then I opened up the 3d camera tracking program of choice for me which is Buju because that's just the one that we still have if I track the features go to advanced and sometimes I go to large-scale that seems to track things a little better but for this when I go through normal scale next search this is 30 this is a fast-moving shot since the TV you don't want to bump up all that high let's start what exactly makes this shot hard to track there's a lot of noise and I don't mean like like classic noise you'd get in on an image sensor I mean like visual noise in the sense that there's a lot of different things that are hard to differentiate from each other for instance the computer struggles with telling the difference between different blades of grass and so it might be tracking one point and then all of a sudden that tracking point moves to a different spot in the video and it you end up with inconsistent and so it ends up giving you a wonky track and to resolve that you have to actually go in and manually track the points you want to track stuff that's really far away stuff that's really close to the camera stuff that moves throughout the sequence especially the best things you can track are things that have been completely obscured by the camera for some point in time but then come back before the end of the shot because the computer doesn't know the difference between a point here and a point at the end of the shot because it disappeared for a while but because humans have contexts and are able to apply that I know that that point is the same so I can establish and tell the computer that it's the same so now that I've gone through I've added all those manual tracking points I threw it into the camera solved to figure out the 3d camera and then it spits out this 3d camera so as you can see here here's all these tracking points you can see all the points in the distance better track the mountain the big tree off in the distance here is we're all right here right here at the front and I kicked this out to cinema 4d and that's work Clint takes over and actually put the stuff in the scene and we are back so now what we're gonna do is take the animation on that wall and put it into the scene that red tracked it you guys can see here bird's-eye view of kind of the scene you can see virtual me running with this camera all these yellow lines what are these yellow lines that's the fall-off for all of these walls I don't know how to hide those yet I tried searching on Google I don't know how we have four copies of the wall lined up next to each other that's just where they need to be for the shot to make sense for the story and the seed has been changed for all these walls so the same basic animation is happening but in different ways you know it's like if you make a pizza every pepperoni pizzas not exactly the same no in this case if I'm like worried that oh I don't know if the track was good or not then I would just render out like a really low res version of this animation and bring it in After Effects incompetence see if it works but I don't need to do that because Ren is really good at tracking stuff so another great go grill plug-in is light kit bro it's really cool because it lets you use essentially a sunlight tool to control the Sun in sign of cinema 4d in combination with the HDR I studio rig I am lighting the scene with an HDR eye a lot of great school gorillas stuff is like things that you can do in cinema 4d but it would take you like 10 times longer so they've streamlined and get you to that final results so much faster on top of that I want the shadows from these foam walls to be comped into the final shot so what I'm gonna do is throw a floor down and on that floor I'm using a shadow catcher material does exactly that it catches the shadows two things kind of happening the background we have Gabe who is rotoscoping Niko and Ren running through the scene because the fences are gonna be on the right they're gonna be in front of all these fences that gave us to go through shot by shot by hand cut out Ren and Miko once this render is done it goes to Ren for the final pass storm father and at that point storm father renders out the very final shot remember simple to setup I always knew there was something special about that guy what how many bugs do I have yeah now that Clint has built the assets and rendered out the shot I'm gonna composite it so remember these are two different stages of the effects process you gotta make the elements and then render it out to create it into a real thing and now I gotta add it to the footage and it's not just a matter of putting it on top of the footage as we learned in that previous video what was that previous video now the walls move with the camera that's great but they're obviously on top of Niko and I so that doesn't work we're going to rotoscope Niko and I think Gabe did that and they don't they don't match the shot they're too bright the two contrasts are too saturated and the shadows are way too dark so I have to somehow separate the shadows bring those down this is how I did that and right off the bat you can see the shadows are actually built into the shot I know of a great trick to get rid of it so check this out if I add the extract filter it's kind of like keying out dark stuff or light stuff if I slide this down it'll start keying out anything that's bright and I don't want to key out what's bright so I'm gonna count what's dark and just like that the shadow because it was like basically straight black was able to be removed numbers man so here are my walls first I used extract got rid of the shadows entirely that's okay because I just duplicate that layer later as you can see here add a bit of fast blur and you want to tint it to the same color of the shadows of the scene and add the shadows in and now the shadows look more normal and already you can tell a big difference they look like apart from the fact that they're on top of Niko they look like they're sitting just above the ground here another thing I added was ambient occlusion is proximity darkness it's not actual shadow is more just the absence of light so here's without ambient occlusion here's wit without weight without weight the next thing I added was levels I also have info panel so if I click up here I actually go down to HSB this is pretty much the number one tool I use for trying to mesh renders to a scene what is the brightest part of our shot it's the sky here so just hovering my mouse over the sky I can see the brightness is set to 93 percent if I hover over here and say a bright spot right above this blue here that's sitting at 100% brightness that means the render is brighter than the sky that shouldn't be the case and also the shadows I'm gonna raise the shadows a little bit and but then I'm also gonna increase the gamma kind of add some contrast back in now on top of that I added what's called color match shirt but it's from red giant King suite which is pretty much the best King suite out there for After Effects has all these really cool effects that allow you to match a green screen element to the background but it also works great for matching renders to the backgrounds and then the other effect I used all the time is which is also from red giant edge blur edge blur is fantastic because it just blurs out the edges of an object without blurring the interior of it this is basically matched to the shot now obviously it's underneath Niko and I so I literally bring out Nikolai and boom look at that well look at that we're on top of the world so this is an actual digital cutout frame-by-frame manual-labor of Niko and myself away from the footage yeah this is pretty decent like it blends in nice enough that it looks like it belongs there it may not be photo perfect but hey this shot 271 frames long that's three seconds so I get a lot of questions about whether or not color grading should come before or after visual effects are done and the answer is always after but once the shot is rendered there's still one last thing you got to do and that's to put that rendered file back into the Edit which is what Clint was super in charge of this whole process as the director Clint's finished this off [Applause] guys I really appreciate your interest in these these tutorials and these effects they take a long time took a long time to figure out how to do it's so much fun though and it's really fun to share with you guys like how this process works it means a lot I really do appreciate your guys's interest in this kind of stuff yeah I hope you guys like the video it's not a work if you're not subscribed each bug subscribe gonna give Jake a little piece of his own security medicine here and just walked out for a phone call and I'll watch the door on them nah you're not above the law you gotta give me that Squarespace fact you can get 10% of your first purchase by going
