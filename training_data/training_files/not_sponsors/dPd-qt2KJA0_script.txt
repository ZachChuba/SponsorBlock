I've been sitting on my review of the Oppo find X for weeks now not because I didn't want to do it but because I've actually in my opinion very patiently been waiting for them to fix a game breaking bugs that has made the phone infuriating for me to use as a daily driver well it's still not fixed but the clocks run out and we're just gonna have to go ahead with this is the phone with arguably the world's sexiest design actually any good or are we just being expected to spend a thousand US dollars for a fashion statement you know what's sitting position learn more at the link below [Music] one of the first things I do with any new device that isn't an iPhone with Apple's taptic engine is turn off the haptic feedback Android devices suck at this basically across the board but the find X's is particularly bad given the price point and you guys are probably sitting there thinking wow that's an awfully nitpicky thing to open with on a device review but it kind of sets the stage for my overall impressions of the find X more on that later though first let's get to the good stuff nothing nothing I've ever touched feels quite as premium as the find X op oh and by extension their subsidiary Oh oneplus have spent years playing catch-up to the Samsungs and the apples of the world but the find X is clearly a statement piece that stands entirely on its own the gentle notch on the back where it belongs and the way that the rear cover accent color shifts from subtle to bold depending on the angle gives it a truly distinctive look and furthermore the form factor not to mention the balance of this thing is damn near perfect with gently curved Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and back that tapers to a nearly seamless transition to the chassis that manages to fit comfortably in your hand pretty much no matter how you want to hold it that is assuming of course that you can keep a handle on it at all this is an exceptionally slippery phone my unit actually ended up falling off of a surface that was very gently inclined minutes after I had placed it there because of subtle vibrations from a nearby speaker fortunately there was no damage which was a bit surprising especially given the engineering marvel that is opposed front camera and facial recognition system simply swipe the lock screen or open up the camera app and you'll be greeted with a competent little selfie camera and a sophisticated facial scanning array that managed to match the speed of the iPhone 10 in my testing and actually the good news keeps rolling here the specs of the find X right on par with any other flagship phone on the market meaning that you'll be enjoying the best experience that Android has to offer and you'll look good doing it at least until snapdragon 855 shows up in the next few months and sorry did I say the best Android has to offer no it's not that it might be the best that opposed color OS has to offer but color OS is quite frankly not representative of the best that Android has to offer there are just so many usability issues here I mean first up was the impossibility of setting up an oppo account for recovery purposes long story short I finally fought through the steps of multiple instances of verification with no copy/paste allowed for whatever reason and got to this Chinese site that according to my in-laws said something about being verified and then I tried to login all need to be told the account isn't active and it's still not active apparently then I was really impressed by the way that Apple handles junk ware installation giving you the option on first boot to nuke it that is until I realized that there's lots of stuff still on the phone and there is no way to switch to an app drawer style homescreen with the stock launcher so what that means is that anyone who is not a power user is gonna end up with a useless junk folder like on the iPhone let's continue I'm not really one to complain about the visual style of an Android skin in general and color OS mostly seems fine to me but this one might actually be a first for me the system font really grinds my gears and not for like artsy reasons I just have a much harder time telling at a glance if my messages are unread in my gmail app for example now to oppose credit the find X has great battery life but I was pretty annoyed when I found out one of the reasons why it turns out it's been putting my hangouts app to sleep entirely without asking me if I wanted that behavior go ahead David send me hangout right now so what happens is I just don't get my notifications until I open up the app manually at which point I will get spammed by everyone who's been trying to reach me for the last hour this is the thing I reported to Oppo three weeks ago there's the pain that currently has no ETA for a fix then buggy behavior in chrome and that usual nonsense where Netflix has to be installed manually with an apk instead of through the Play Store on some Chinese phones it's just icing on the cake I mean yeah every one of those things except the hangouts thing that's really stupid every one of those things is a pretty minor issue on the surface but the longer the short of it is a phone is it's like your daily companion you take it with you everywhere it's about the experience and I didn't like using this phone it just cuts a lot of little corners for the sake of being sexy like that crummy vibration motor that I mentioned earlier and it just doesn't do enough to redeem itself in my eyes the camera launches quickly but it can't be triggered with a DoubleTap of the lock screen and it is decent at best especially given the price and this pain train is just leaving the station folks the find X lacks NFC making two factor authentication more of a chore it's not waterproof or even water-resistant presumably due to the sliding camera mechanism it doesn't have wireless charging it has no microSD slot for expansion it doesn't have a headphone jack it doesn't have an always-on display or even wake on lift meaning that you will need to unlock the screen and swipe it to activate their facial recognition every time you want to turn it on and the display isn't HDR certified for Netflix which results in noticeably worse image quality to go along with the degraded mono speaker listening experience bottom line if you were considering buying the find ex get a note 9 it's better in every measurable way speaking of better memory the way they're coming soon to Victoria and Saskatoon so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked or if you work
