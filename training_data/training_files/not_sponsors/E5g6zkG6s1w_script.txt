hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today i bring you guys loot from 3 000 terror dogs released into the game january 22nd 2007 these terror dogs truly do stand apart from the normal dogs in runescape at level 100 and 110 this terrifying dog beast requires 40 slayer to kill it's also the only monster in the whole game that drops the infamous granite helmet so for this video as always all kills were tracked in the slayer ring log but not be doing this full time so i really do appreciate them and let's go ahead and get into today's video 3 000 terror dogs you know i wanted to kill 3 000 instead of 1000 for this video just because of the mechanics of this monster as you can see just sitting in this room they all just come up to you and start attacking you right away and it does not take that long to kill them at all the fact that they're only 82 hp and i was using a whip with full max strength as well as the divine super combat potion meant that these were going to be killed pretty quickly and especially the fact that they're all going to be surrounding you and they're all going to be attacking you at the same time means that the kills per hour for me were roughly 120. now that was an hour where there was no clue scroll drops and that was actually the only hour where there was no clue scroll drops because as you can see we did get one pretty early on with the drop rate of the hard clue here being 1 and 128 as it is with many other monsters and speaking of 1 and 128 there is another drop that has those odds this one being the granite helmet at a staggering price of just shy of 32k this helmet is no joke well it does look a little funny but either way it does go kind of good with bandos you know you got the gray on gray action there and through this video you guys will see a ton of granite helm drops and it was cool to explore this you know i've never killed a terror dog in my life before this video and here we have a rune spear drop which is a 1 in 3 100 with that ring of wealth equipped and of course we did have the ring of wealth equipped the whole entire time because you will see a lot of coin drops from these guys so always important to bring that alongside you and if you're curious as to how to get to this location you simply use a slayer ring and you teleport to tarn's lair this is the fastest way to reach this room you just have to go north one room just one click and you're here so the banking for this video is incredibly fast which i love because with other monsters it's not necessarily always like that if you don't have the slayer ring unlocked and if you haven't done the mini quest then you do have to get here by foot and the trek to the terror dogs is highly dangerous especially for lower levels it is recommended to bring high healing foods prayer potions and d-hide or something like that maybe graceful and if you don't have access to protect from magic you will encounter skeleton mages within the lair and you have to be on the lookout for them if you do need help and you go on youtube and look up tarn's lair the greatest guide i can recommend you is slayer music one he did a whole guide on this area uh four years ago and four months ago so important to look into that he is awesome good friend of the channel and from what i'm looking at on youtube as well there isn't a single loot video related to terror dogs but there's a lot of guides on them so you do have quite a few people up to 10 to 12 years ago making videos just showing uh terror dogs in general showing a couple kills and no one really seemed to invest a lot of time here at least that i know of you know sometimes there is a player out there who's killed an incredible amount of something and i just forget it so if anyone does know anyone who's camped a lot of terror dogs make sure to let me know maybe you yourself have killed a lot of these things and there's another rune spear drop hitting the rare drop table yet again now these dogs are first encountered during the mini quest lair of tarn razor lore which i did a very long time ago and i'm actually unable to remember much about it but in this mini quest the player must fight two terror dogs alongside some animated armor in addition to tarn razor lore himself hope i'm not butchering the pronunciation now upon completion of this mini quest more terror dogs will appear in the room that the player battled the tarn razor lore in this room is multi-combat so you will be needing to play melee the whole time or you're going to be taking some heavy damage because their max hit is an 11 and since a lot of them are always going to be on you you're going to die very quickly if you don't pray and that was a nice kill there a clue scroll and a granite helm in the same drop some more information about these terror dogs you know they are very similar to hellhounds in that they can hit hard and accurately but they have very low defense and it's very important to know that while you're in this room they do drain your prayer at a rate of one point per two game ticks or 50 points per minute much faster than barrows so that is why you guys see eight prayer potion fours every single inventory alongside that divine super combat as well as the sarah doman god sword because even if you bring prayer gear here it really won't matter much and you just have to deal with it i mean it's really not that fast i mean i never got smited a single time and i was on three accounts so it does you know train progressively but not all at once throughout this video i was also seeing quite a bit of long bones and curve bones i did receive one curve bone pretty early on which is one in five thousand and of course the long bones are still one in four hundred so that's some nice construction xp and we'll definitely see how many we get towards the very end and speaking of the drop table you know just looking at the normal drops uh the adamant full helm the rune dagger the steel battle axe alongside the plate legs and of course the mithril items you know the kite shield axe and spear what is the one monster that comes to your mind when all of those items are listed well i'll give you a hint it looks a lot like the terror dog it's just a little bit bigger this being the green dragon i'm really not too sure as to why this is i have started to actually realize that quite a few monsters in this game do share very similar drops but you'd expect you know some drops to be in common but certainly not all of them uh and it seems in regards to terror dogs and green dragons all of the drops are the same they even have the unnoted bass drop and of course the unnoted adamant ore drop not to mention the same rate for a hard clue scroll although i will say i don't think you can get curved and long bones as often at green dragons as you can at terror dogs and you can also use a cannon at green dragons but you can't use a cannon in this location you're just unable to so that's a little unfortunate especially since it's multi but you know you can't get your way all the time so if you do have it i do recommend that you bring a bone crusher as well as a herb sac and a gym bag the bone crusher isn't necessary but you do get 15 prayer xp per kill and you know 3 000 kills that's 45k prayer xp for free so no reason not to only downside of this is that rune light won't track every terror dog individually since you know the bone crusher will ruin that now as it goes for the herb sac you can expect a ton of herb drops from these dogs uh mostly low tier but i did actually pick up every single one of them high tier loads here didn't really matter to me and here we have the second curve bone in 2 400 kills as we are coming to a close here a lot of long bones on top of the curved and a ton of hard clues and granite helms adding up as well the clue scrolls were definitely the highlight for this video i was really looking forward to seeing how many hearts i could get and also all the master clues that i would get alongside those and i did see in the comment section of the last video that you guys want to see some live commentary so what i did was when i was opening up all the clue scrolls or maybe it was just the master clues but either way i did end up doing live commentary for the end of the video so i hope you guys enjoy that if you yourself decide to kill these things i do recommend you bring high elks don't be like me and pick up all these weird items that are worth absolutely nothing save yourself a lot of time bring some high outs make some money although you do have to spend a decent amount in prayer potions but that's just the mechanics there's nothing you can do to change that also important to mention that i only tried melee here i didn't use a blowpipe with armadill or anything so maybe you can use range here but personally i just went with melee i'm sure range would work fine though but you might be spending a little bit more money on supplies then and here we are loot from 3 000 terror dogs has been completed and i gotta be honest this one was actually really fun i always love a laid back monster that's fast to kill good xp decent drops and especially since it's slayer related you know 100 videos later and we're still killing slayer monsters nice to have some left even the ones that aren't that popular and that aren't boss related well here we are it is time to price check all of the normal drops from 3 000 terror dogs and then we will go ahead and open up 25 hard clue scrolls so it looks like overall we got 20 granite full helms 2 000 nature 16 000 waters 163k cash from the ring of wealth probably made 200k and just the armor pieces that you know ideally you should out and the very first price check does come out to be rounded up 1.8 million 700k just from the granite helms that's awesome to see we still have one more price check to do this is now going to be all of the herbs as well as the tooth and loop keys and then we will start on the clue scrolls after that but the main value that you can get from the herbs here as i mentioned there's so many low tier ones uh most of the price check with this one 430k overall comes from the renars so 400k from the second price check which does mean that the overall loot from 3 000 terror dogs comes out to be 2.2 million plus the long bones and the curb bones and while that may sound somewhat decent i think i was close to spending just about that on prayer potions so there's not much profit from the overall loot you know this is more so a slayer task than it is a money maker however now it is time to open up all the hard clues and see what the real profit is gonna be and when we get to the master clues that is when the live commentary will come into effect and that's in just about one minute so hope you guys enjoy that and if you do let me know and i'll try to do live commentary more often you know there's no reason as to why i can't do live commentary i just never really know what to say in the moment you know so that's kind of my flaw but it's much easier with clue scrolls so as you can see though we did unlock one master clue and on the very next clue we did get another master so 17 hard clue scrolls left to open and two master caskets already sitting there staring at us so at least we have those to look forward to and overall the loot from the clue scrolls is pretty above average i'm seeing a lot of 100k and a couple pages here and there wish i had the page rng on this account that i do on my ironman account and if you ever get assigned terror dogs in the future and you're not a big fan of the drop table at least you have the clue scrolls to look forward to and usually while i edit these videos i always stare at the wiki page just to double check anything that i might have messed up on and it says here that the only slayer master that assigns terror dogs is vanica that's really interesting i wonder why more slayer masters don't assign them but maybe that's why you don't see that many videos of terror dogs on youtube or you don't hear a lot of people talk about them not many people using vanica these days and here we have my best hard clue scroll reward the whole video it's actually nice to see something above 200k this one is 900k sarah dominic d hide boots and now that all the hards are opened we can see how much we made and then get into the masters so overall 3.5 mil from 25 hard clues okay so here we go live commentary for the master clue let's do it all right 405 k from the first one that's pretty average and from the second oh it's a mimic okay perfect all right let's go do it all right the mimic is completed um we got some plank or a plank there you go all right and we got the mimic chest so let's go ahead and open it up uh see what we get all right and what are we gonna get three two one oh all right let's go ahead and open this mimic casket hopefully we get something good this is the true end of the video here good luck to us three two one look at that five mil that's a beautiful reward uh looks like we got an extra 15 manta rays from that mimic wow but yeah oak colt ornament kit five mil from that that is more than i made this whole video so that's uh as it goes for the loot from the terror dog so yeah that's great to see uh let's go check out the overall bank tab and we'll wrap this up okay and heading into the bank tab here this is the end result from all that we did at 3 000 terror dogs uh it's easier to just kind of look at roon light for this part but as you can see here we have two master clues 5.4 mil from that 25 hearts 3.5 from that and of course three thousand terror dogs just about another two mil from that so overall price check from three thousand terror dogs with everything added up according to rune light 10.9 mil from 3 000 terror dogs so that is awesome to see uh really happy with the outcome for this video i really did enjoy them they were much more fun than i expected and i hope you guys enjoy the video thank you all for your continued support and i will see you in the next one until then mr no sleep out
