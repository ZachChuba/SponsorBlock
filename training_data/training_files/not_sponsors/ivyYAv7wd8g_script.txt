do you like to game yeah do you like to game at your house yes do you like the gaming kind of unusual places hell yeah okay whoa dude okay I was kind of thinking like in a hotel or coffee shop anyway the point is if you are gaming on the go you're gonna have to make some kind of sacrifice be it performance weight or battery life so today we're gonna investigate which option makes the most sense for mobile gaming but not multiple systems check it out at the link below [Music] now there are really three approaches for gaming on the go huge honkin gaming laptop thinner gaming laptop or thin enlight notebook with an external GPU and today's objective is to find out which one is the best objectively the best option so let's meet our contenders coming in at a whopping ten point three five pounds this laptop has been described as a shot of adrenaline a big heavy beast of a laptop and barely even portable the Asus G 703 is possibly the only mobile asterisk device on the market that can actually take advantage of Intel's Core I 989 50 K some people have even gotten it to do five gigahertz on all six of its processing cores and when you combine that with a GTX 1080 32 gigs of ram and a raid zero nvme storage array this laptops banks most people's gaming desktops then over on the other end of the spectrum weighing in at a featherweight 2.9 pounds is the razer stealth which is well for being honest basically useless for serious gaming that is until we hit it with a gtx 1080 in an external enclosure via Thunderbolt 3 now it's rocking a quad core Core i7 16 gigs of ram nvme storage and of course the GTX 1080 that we just duct-taped to it helping it kick gaming laptop stereotypes in the balls by combining extreme portability with extreme gaming performance also an extremely useful sometimes touchscreen finally the middle weight in our bout is the Razer Blade 2018 at four point six three pounds this laptop is on the heftier end of what we might call total but it does have the muscle to make up for that junk in the trunk it's got a six core i7 87 58 and a gtx 1070 max-q which some might say is the perfect compromise for gamers but then again some people also love the Olive Garden but like you go there and at first you're like stoked about the unlimited bread but then you get your pasta and it's well basically it's more bread so then we have designed a few challenges for these machines to compete in so without further ado let's get ready to ride not allowed to say that because I will get in trouble now challenge number one our three contestants arrived with their laptops in their backpacks at some destination let's say the gym huh just kidding these guys um then they need to game so they got to get it out and ready as quick as possible Ready Set goldfish all right so Colton Oh Colton's got the G 703 whoa that's gonna be a bit of a challenge here the Chimera the Chimera has a whopping two power chords for him to set up to power bricks for him to figure out how to manage but it does make up for some of that with its massive IO where it blows pretty much everything else out of the water it's got Thunderbolt 3 it's got USB 3 it's got an SD card reader it's got an actual Ethernet port James meanwhile is already completely set up the blade strikes kind of a middle ground so he's got ample USB he's got it he's got no touch screen unfortunately on this machine I'll help you out with I'll help you out with that there he's got Thunderbolt 3 he's got mini DisplayPort and HDMI along with Thunderbolt 3 so he can do multiple displays out and Alex are you set up now yep Wow so coming in first is the thin gaming laptop coming in second actually is the ultra light with the external GPU enclosure I mean you do give up some IO though it's only got 2 USB ports plus that Thunderbolt port and a headphone jack so but then again if you're willing to carry this around you do get additional ports including Ethernet over here and coming in dead last poor Coleman are you even at the desktop yet though no one can see what you're typing it's pretty clear that the winner here in terms of setup is our thinner gaming laptop but now it's time for round two the drag race of the computer world Cinebench which hopefully colton will figure out how to open at some point look we had we had Riley we had Riley cast for this spot and it just like he was busy with teklynx anyway on your marks get set bench it no Colton wrong one fortunately you have a super fast machine so we can just cancel that run the CPU one you'll probably still finish before them so you can actually see here colton six core 12 thread processor has already overtaken the blade Seldes quad-core 8 thread processor has remember there's more to it than just how many cores and how many threads you have there's how high it'll turbo and how long it'll stay there in fact it's even closing in on the blade although this one does look like it's gonna come in slightly ahead with about a thousand points finishing well second in time but that's only because of Colton with nearly 1200 points the chimera is clearly the fastest machine here when it comes to multi-threaded CPU intensive processes and the blade stealth does show some of its weakness because there's only so much cooling and therefore curbing up that you can do in such a thin and light chassis there we go about five hundred and thirty points so when it comes to getting serious work done on the road you're pretty much stuck with something at least this class with more serious work being most suitable for obviously the most powerful machine now it's time for the main event gaming performance so let's get shadow the Tomb Raider fired up here make sure you guys are all on the high presets and fight whoa did Colt and get the game launched both well before everyone else looks like that raid zero nvme is working out for him over there alright everyone set up and good to go everyone's on high yeah everyone's on directx12 go see who manages to load in first pull pull out wide so we can see Colton's out ahead with the loading times followed by I mean this is basically what we expected I can't act too surprised right now now what's interesting here is that even though our chimera has the same GPU a desktop grade GTX 1080 as our blade stealth does in its external enclosure the frame rates that it's seeing are significantly higher because you're gonna be limited not just by the PCI Express 4x interface / Thunderbolt 3 here but also by the fact that the data has to be sent back from the core to the display over that same link causing a little bit of bottlenecking also this processor doesn't turbo up to 5 gigahertz or whatever so what that means in the real world is that the blade which also has the benefit of a nice fast 120 Hertz display compared to our blade stealth ends up with better real-world FPS at the same resolution even though it has a gtx 1070 max-q so that's like a neutered 1070 so no real surprises in shadow of the Tomb Raider or in any of the other games that we ran while we're at it bigger is more batter when it comes to gaming performance but with that said our razor blade stealth and therefore the Ultrabook category in general is not down for the count yet because our final category is portability as I alluded to before the G 703 has terrible battery life like you could put the largest battery allowed in it and it would still barely have juice for over an hour as for the razor blade well it does a bit better but even if you're just watching YouTube videos or using Excel you're still looking at around 4 hours of battery life max not to mention that both of those laptops are heavier than I'd like to carry around with me all day the stealth on the other hand is easy to cart around and has a battery that lasts over eight hours with light to moderate use that is over double the blade and almost eight times the G 703 and this is where things kind of get a little bit tricky so we set out to determine which one was the best gaming laptop but you could make a pretty strong argument for the clear winner being having a gaming desktop at home and a thin enlight for when you're traveling with that said for people that travel a lot or are on shift work or our truckers or whatever else the case may be that might just not be an option so for me personally a big part of me is leaning towards the external GPU because I hate carting around a gaming laptop a lot and probably 80 to 90% of what I use my notebook for is kind of writing scripts on the go so that gives me the flexibility to do what I need to do during the day without running out of battery but still be able to have the full experience when I'm able to get to a desk with that said it's just hard to recommend to most people because first you need a notebook with a Thunder pool 3 X 4 port then you need to buy an expensive enclosure then you need to get a GPU knowing that there isn't going to be enough bandwidth over thunderbolt to take full advantage of it meaning in the end you have paid top dollar for a middle-of-the-road gaming experience so for the time being I'm gonna keep rocking this but will have to let you guys decide and let us know in the comments below who do you think ultimately won the game off but you know
