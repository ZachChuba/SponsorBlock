all right so I'm just testing out this new firmware there just got uploaded in my car yesterday 24.6 dot four and the release notes are the same as the dot one no real changes in the release notes but just seeing if there's any functional improvements with auto pilot and the stoplight functionality in particular [Music] all right so this one I do have to confirm since there's a no car need car in front of me looks like this is gonna be a red light perfect people are so impatient but that's just fine with me and gives me a lead car race up to your red light right still doesn't allow you to go more than five over this earth doesn't let you go more than the speed limit when you're using the stoplight functionality which really hoping that they at least allow us to do that soon it's really quite annoying people don't just seem to like going the speed limit they really prefer to go at least five over the speed limit so the next couple of updates maybe they'll allow us to do that I'm sure it's just a safety function it's calibrating these neural nets or the full self-driving they don't at less chance of there being a severe accident I don't think there's that much difference from five miles I'm still confused it's done that twice now I'm not little area I'm not sure why it gets freaked out there but sees there's kind of a like a line in the pate paving I don't know if it sees that as another Lane line but that is really bizarre behavior why it freaks out every time right there to confirm since there's no lead car here recognize that lead card though and let me go through the life this one's too far out so it's not gonna let me to confirm this one as well so far haven't seen a dramatic difference with this firmware update I think it was some minor bugs I haven't really seen too many I haven't seen anything myself that seemed to be different but I think I read that of the people that have seer serious FM there is an update in this in this version for the to fix some type of and that would just be us the next cars I'm pretty sure and they my and the three Kent don't have the option for serious at that man but I don't think it's an option on the the newer Essen taxes it was just a brief option in the past so one of the stop signs that in the previous version the car wouldn't always come to a stop before what's this one right here so I'm just gonna see if it just do any better I was I think the last time I had trouble that I was turning left here so slightly different but seemed to take that one just perfectly you can see it kind of hesitated there with the crosswalk which is good I guess it's checking to make sure there's no you know pedestrians that are about to cross so it does hesitate just for a second or if it just briefly it I think it slowed down by like 1 mile per hour be addressing if it sees this car I don't think it does so I'm going to take over here it's definitely one of those things they need to work on so it's on tack here don't think that was actually illegal parking there on the road but the car still needs to be able to handle that and stop still doesn't seem like a very smooth transition I know you have to turn for the stop signs but it's very jerky even on tack it kind of like slams on its brakes mid turn which is not ideal so I wish tussle had fixed that either do the whole turn for us ideally or like slamming on the brakes through in the turn was pretty guilty so this is one of the roundabouts you can see it comes to a stop before the roundabout but it won't go through it and even if I try to confirm it oh yes it will go through as you can see it'll just plow through the middle of the roundabout so still not something that it can do on this version thanks for can have a conversation alright thanks for watching
