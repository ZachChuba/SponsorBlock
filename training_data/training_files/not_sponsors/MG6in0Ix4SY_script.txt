[APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE 2019 LEADERS  DEBATE. I'M LISA LA FLAME AND I'M ONE OF THE MODERATORS TONIGHT. THE AUDIENCE IS MADE UP OF  MOSTLY UNDECIDED VOTERS, SO  THEY'RE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF  THIS IMPORTANT NIGHT. ONE NOTE, HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THEM TO HOLD BACK THEIR APPLAUSE THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE TO KEEP  THINGS MOVING. AND JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS TO NOTE BEFORE WE GET STARTED. WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE FIVE MAJOR THEMES TONIGHT BASED ON THE  QUESTIONS CANADIAN VOTERS WANT  ASKED AND DEBATED. THERE WERE MORE THAN 8,000. SO THE THEMES TONIGHT REFLECT  THOSE QUESTIONS. THE LEADERS WILL ANSWER THEM  BASED ON AN ORDER SELECTED IN A  RANDOM DRAW. WE ALL WANT A MEANINGFUL DEBATE  TONIGHT. VIEWERS WANT ANSWERS SO THE  LEADERS HAVE ALL AGREED TO  RESPECT THE TIME THEY ARE  ALLOWED TONIGHT. AND BELIEVE ME, WE WILL ALL MAKE SURE THEY DO. OUR FIRST THEME IS LEADERSHIP IN CANADA AND THE WORLD AND OUR  FIRST QUESTION FROM REAGAN LI,  RIGHT HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. >> GOOD EVENING, LEADERS. MANY CANADIANS HAVE FELT THE  IMPLICATIONS OF A DIVIDED WORLD  MORE SO THAN 2015, FROM U.S.  PROTECTIONISM TO BREXIT TO OUR  GROWING TENSIONS WITH CHINA. AS PRIME MINISTER, HOW WOULD YOU EFFECTIVELY DEFEND BOTH THE  INTERESTS AND VALUES OF  CANADIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE? THANK YOU. >> Lisa: REAGAN, THANK YOU FOR  THAT. MR. TRUDEAU, YOU ARE FIRST TO  RESPOND. 45 SECONDS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THANK YOU, REAGAN FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT AND THANK  YOU, ALL, FOR JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY  AND COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE  VARIOUS PLANS WE HAVE. WE KNOW WE LIVE IN A VERY  CHALLENGING TIME RIGHT NOW. PROTECTIONISM TO FEAR-BASED  POLITICS, TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE  TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE PEOPLE ARE  FACING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT  CANADIANS ARE EQUIPPED AND  TOOLED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN  AN UNCERTAIN WORLD AND THAT'S  WHY WE'VE VESTED DIRECTLY IN  CANADIANS TO HAVE THE TOOLS TO  SUCCEED. WE KNOW THE ENVIRONMENT IS A  MASSIVE AND PRESSING CHALLENGE  AND BUILDING A STRONGER ECONOMY  FOR THE FUTURE MEANS PROTECTING  THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FUTURE  AS WELL. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT. >> Lisa: THANK YOU FOR THAT. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  THANK YOU. WE ARE THE PEOPLE'S PARTY AND WE PUT CANADA FIRST. THE OTHER LEADERS ON THIS STAGE  ARE GLOBAL LEADERS. THEY SPEND YOUR MONEY TO BUY A  TICKET AT THE U.N. COUNCIL AND  ALSO THEY ARE GIVING YOUR MONEY  TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO FIGHT  CLIMATE CHANGE IN ASIA AND BUILD ROADS IN AFRICA. THE U.N. IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL  ORGANIZATION AND WE MUST BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. ACTUALLY, WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY  THAT WILL HAVE FOREIGN POLICIES  THAT IS BASED ON OUR SECURITY  AND PROSPERITY FOR OUR COUNTRY. >> Lisa: THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY  FOR MR. SINGH TO RESPOND. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THANK YOU, REAGAN, FOR THE QUESTION. IT'S TOUGH TO ASK QUESTIONS IN  FRONT OF A BIG CROWD. THANK YOU, CANADA FOR TAKING  PART IN THE DISCUSSION. TO ME, LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT WHO  YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR. THE CHOICES YOU MAKE. AND WHETHER YOU'RE DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR PEOPLE. AND WHETHER IT COMES TO  INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, STANDING  UP TO TRUMP, MAKING SURE WE  FIGHT TO BUILD A BETTER TRADE  AGREEMENT THAT ACTUALLY PUT  CANADIANS FIRST. FOR ME, THE QUESTION REALLY  COMES DOWN TO, DO YOU HAVE THE  COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THE  POWERFUL AND WEALTHY INTERESTS,  THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE HAVING TOO MUCH INFLUENCE OVER CANADA? AND I'VE SEEN SO FAR IN OTTAWA,  WHETHER IT'S LIBERAL OR  CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS, THEY  HAVEN'T HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE DIFFERENT. WE'RE IN IT FOR YOU. I DON'T WORK FOR THE RICH AND  POWERFUL, I WORK FOR THE PEOPLE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THANK YOU. I WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR  CANADA AND CANADIAN INTERESTS  AND PROMOTE FREE TRADE AND  DEFEND OUR INTERESTS AROUND THE  WORLD, BUT JUSTIN TRUDEAU ONLY  PRETENDS TO STAND UP FOR CANADA. HE'S VERY GOOD AT PRETENDING  THINGS. HE CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HOW MANY  TIMES HE PUT BLACKFACE ON  BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER,  HE'S ALWAYS WEARING A MASK. HE PUTS ON A RECONCILIATION MASK AND FIRES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,  THE FIRST ONE OF INDIGENOUS  BACKGROUND. HE PUTS ON A FEMINIST MASK AND  FIRES TWO STRONG M.P.s FOR NOT  GOING ALONG WITH HIS CORRUPTION. HE PUTS ON A MIDDLE CLASS MASK  AND RAISES TAXES. YOU'RE A PHONEY, AND A YOU'RE  FRAUD AND YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO  GOVERN THIS COUNTRY. >> Lisa: THERE WILL BE AN  OPPORTUNITY LATER IN THE OPEN  DEBATE TO DEFEND EACH OTHER. MS. MAY, IF YOU'D LIKE TO ANSWER REAGAN'S QUESTION. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER HIS  QUESTION, IN CONTRAST TO WHAT WE JUST HEARD. WE'RE ON THE TERRITORY OF  ALGONQUIN PEOPLE, TO THEM,  MIIGWECH. WE HAVE A HISTORIC REPUTATION  FOR BEING AN HONEST BROKER. FOR A COUNTRY THAT STANDS UP FOR MULTILATERALISM. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE GOALS. ENCOURAGING THE EDUCATION OF  WOMEN AND GIRLS. THAT'S A CORNERSTONE. ON TOP THAT, WE NEED TO  RENEGOTIATE THE WORLD TRADE  ORGANIZATION AND PROMOTE CLIMATE ACTION. WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE RULE OF  LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE  WORLD BECAUSE WE'RE WORLD  LEADERS. >> Lisa: AGAIN, THE QUESTION,  HOW WOULD YOU AS PRIME MINISTER  PROTECT CANADIAN INTERESTS AND  VALUES ON THIS CHANGING WORLD  STAGE? MR. BLANCHET? >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): IT'S A BIT UNLIKELY. FIRST, GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON  BEHALF OF THE BLOC QUEBECOIS. HAVING LEADERSHIP OR SHOWING  LEADERSHIP SOMETIMES MEAN NOT  MAKING MISTAKES. ARRESTING THE CHIEF FINANCIAL  OFFICER OF HUAWEI MIGHT HAVE  BEEN A BIG MISTAKE FOR WHICH  FARMERS, OR THOSE WHO IMPORT OUR BEEF, MIGHT HAVE PAID THE PRICE. WHEN YOU'RE FACING POWERFUL FOLK LIKE CHINA, YOU DON'T TRY TO  SHOW BIASES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS  TO BE LEARNED. AND WE WOULD SUPPORT SOMEBODY  WITH REAL LEADERSHIP, NOT MAKING MISTAKES. >> Lisa: THANK YOU FOR THAT. CONTINUING WITH OUR THEME  LEADERSHIP IN CANADA AND THE  WORLD, IT'S NOW MY OPPORTUNITY  TO ASK A QUESTION ON BEHALF OF  CANADIANS. AGAIN, TO A LEADER CHOSEN BY A  RANDOM DRAW. SO THIS QUESTION IS FOR PEOPLE'S PARTY LEADER MAXIME BERNIER. EVERY OTHER LEADER WILL THEN  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE  HIM, BUT MR. BERNIER, YOU LIKE  TO TWEET, SO LET ME READ SOME OF YOUR TWEETS BACK TO YOU. YOU CALLED DIVERSITY IN CANADA A CULT AND EXTREME  MULTI-CULTUREISM. YOU USED THE WORDS GHETTO AND  TRIBES TO DESCRIBE NEWCOMERS WHO YOU SAY BRING MISTRUST AND  POTENTIAL VIOLENCE. ON GRETA THUNBERG, THE  16-YEAR-OLD CLIMATE CHANGE  ACTIVIST, YOU CALLED HER  "CLEARLY MENTALLY UNSTABLE". ARE THESE THE WORDS OF SOMEONE  WHO SHOULD REPRESENT US ON THE  WORLD STAGE? >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  MUST TELL THE TRUTH TO CANADIANS IF YOU WANT TO BE THE LEADER OF  THIS COUNTRY. AND WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT  EXPANDING MULTICULTURALISM, IT  IS NOT THE WAY TO BUILD THE  COUNTRY. WE DON'T NEED THE LEGISLATION  LIKE THE MULTICULTURALISM ACT TO TELL US WHO WE ARE. WE ARE A DIVERSE COUNTRY. WHAT I'M SAYING IN LINE WITH  IMMIGRATION, WE MUST HAVE FEWER  IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE SURE FOR THESE PEOPLE TO  PARTICIPATE IN OUR SOCIETY. SO IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY, BUT  IT'S TIME TO HAVE DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION. WE DON'T WANT THE COUNTRY TO BE  LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE,  WHERE THEY HAVE HUGE WITH  IMMIGRANTS. >> Lisa: WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING  TO HAVE A LIVELY DEBATE, BECAUSE NOW IT IS MR. SINGH'S  OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE MR.  BERNIER ON THAT QUESTION, THE  TEMPERAMENT REQUIRED FOR A GOOD  LEADER. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): MR.  BERNIER, AFTER HEARING WHAT WAS  JUST SAID, YOU COULD HAVE SAID  HEY, MAN I MESSED UP A . I BELIEVE A LEADER IS NOT  SOMEONE WHO SHOULD TRY TO DIVIDE PEOPLE, A TRUE LEADER WHO TRIES  TO BUILD BRIDGES, BRINGING  PEOPLE TOGETHER. A LEADER WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE  WHO NEED HELP. NOT HELPING THOSE AT THE TOP AS  WE'VE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT IN  OTTAWA DOING FAR TOO LONG. THEY GIVE MASSIVE CORPORATE TAX  CUTS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GO TOWARD  THEM. WE SEE OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS  CONDITION. THE WAY TO BUILD A FUTURE --  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  SPECIALIST POLICY. IT WILL HURT EVERYBODY. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WHAT  YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS NOT GO TO  HELP. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  MUST BELIEVE IN PEOPLE. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WHAT  YOU'RE SAYING IS NOT HELPFUL. >> Lisa: THIS IS A DEBATE AND  THE VIEWERS HAVE A DIFFICULT  TIME EVEN HEARING ANYTHING IF  YOU'RE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER. SO THIS IS A PORTION WHERE THE  LEADERS CAN DEBATE MR. BERNIER,  AND IT IS NOW THE OPPORTUNITY OF MR. SCHEER TO DEBATE MR. BERNIER ON THE QUESTION OF LEADERSHIP. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHAT MR. BERNIER FAILS TO  UNDERSTAND YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY BE PROUD OF CANADA'S HISTORY, OUR  IDENTITY AND THE THINGS WE'VE  DONE AND ACCOMPLISHED IN THE  WORLD WHILE AT THE SAME TIME  WELCOMING PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE  CANADA STRONG. PEOPLE COME TO CANADA BECAUSE OF OUR FREEDOM. OUR FREEDOM TO  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S WHY I WANT PEOPLE TO  SHARE THE CANADIAN VALUES. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MR. BERNIER, YOU HAVE CHANGED  FROM SOMEONE WHO USED TO  BELIEVE --  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): LIKE THEY DID IN THE PAST --  >> Lisa: WE'LL LET MR. SCHEER  FINISH THE QUESTION. >> Andrew Scheer  (Conservative): -- AND NOW YOU  ARE MAKING YOUR POLICY BASED ON  TRYING TO GET LIKES AND  RE-TWEETS FROM THE DARKEST PARTS OF TWITTER. WE CAN BE A COUNTRY THAT  CELEBRATES CONTRIBUTION FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): I  WANT WHAT UNITES US. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU CAN DO THAT. WITHOUT INSULTING PEOPLE WHO  HAVE COME TO THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  MR. BERNIER AND MYSELF ON THIS  ISSUE. WE BELIEVE, WE BELIEVE IN MAKING CANADA STRONGER BY WELCOMING  PEOPLE, ADDING IT TO OUR COUNTRY AND CELEBRATING THE THINGS THAT  HAVE MADE US GREAT AS A NATION. >> Lisa: NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MS. MAY AND MR. BERNIER. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  IT WAS ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LEADERSHIP. I THINK LEADERSHIP IS SERVICE. I THINK THE THINGS THAT MAKE A  GOOD PRIME MINISTER IS  RECOGNIZING WE'RE PUBLIC  SERVANTS. WE HAVEN'T WON A LOTTO. WE DON'T GET TO LORD OVER  EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE AS YOUR EMPLOYEE. I HAD A QUIBBLE WITH THE  INTRODUCTION SAYING WHO WILL BE  INVITE D BACK? IT'S NOT TO BE INVITED TO GO TO  PARLIAMENT. IT'S TO SIGN UP AND WORK. I FIND THE THINGS MAXIME BERNIER HAS SAID TO BE COMPLETELY  APPALLING. HE KNOWS I FEEL THAT WAY, WE  USED TO SIT TOGETHER. I HAVE TO PUT MY HEAD IN MY  HANDS BECAUSE IT WAS SO  HORRIFIC. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): I  APPRECIATE YOU, BUT I DON'T  SHARE YOUR SOCIALIST POLICY,  BECAUSE WE WON'T CREATE WEALTH  WITH YOUR POLICY. YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF POLICY LIKE VENEZUELA. THAT WON'T CREATE WEALTH. YOU MUST ADMIT THAT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  CLIMATE CRISIS IS THE BIGGEST  ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN A  GENERATION. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  THAT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  AND SUPPORTING IMMIGRATION IS  WHAT WE NEED FOR THE ECONOMY. I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT THE  EUROPEAN -- IS THE ONLY PARTY  THAT IS PRO-IMMIGRATION, SO ARE  WE. >> Lisa: IT IS MR. BLANCHET'S  OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE WITH MR.  BERNIER. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): HOW MANY SECONDS  WILL YOU LEAVE ME? SOMEBODY INVOKING THE TRUTH  SHOULD NOT BE SOMEBODY DENYING  CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE USE OF SOCIALISM SEEMS  TO COME A LITTLE BIT TOO EASY. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): I  DON'T DENY --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): OH, 10 SECONDS. [LAUGHTER] IMMIGRATION IS NOT  THAT MUCH A MATTER OF NUMBER. IT'S A MATTER OF RESOURCES. WE INVEST IN IT IN ORDER TO HAVE THOSE PERSONS WELCOME IN CANADA  AS THEY ARE IN QUÉBEC WITH OUR  DESIRE TO SHARE OUR LANGUAGE, TO SHARE THE VALUES. AND IF WE DO HAVE RESOURCES  INVESTED IN THAT, THIS IS  WORKABLE. YOU DO NOT DO IT BY SAYING OR  SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT THEY  ARE NOT WELCOME. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  EVERYBODY IS WELCOME IN THIS  COUNTRY. 49% OF OUR POPULATION BELIEVE  THAT WE MUST HAVE FEWER  IMMIGRANTS. THEY'RE NOT RACIST. THEY'RE NOT RADICAL. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BECAUSE I'M  IN LINE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE  RADICAL. NO, WE HAVE THE RIGHT IN THIS  COUNTRY --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): DID ANYBODY TELLS  YOU THAT YOUR ANCESTORS ARE  IMMIGRANTS ALSO? WE ARE ALL IMMIGRANTS. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE ALL PROUD CANADIANS. >> Lisa: AND TO MR. TRUDEAU AND  MR. BERNIER. THE TEMPERAMENT REQUIRED. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE'RE IN A WORLD  WHERE THESE DISCUSSIONS, THIS  POLARIZATION, THIS FEAR OF THE  OTHER IS EASY CURRENCY FOR  POLITICIANS WHO WANT TO STRIKE  UP UNCERTAINTY IN PEOPLES'  HEARTS AND LIFT ANXIETY AND TRY  TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE AGAINST  THINGS. MR. BERNIER IS PLAYING THAT ROLE OF TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE  FEARFUL ABOUT THE MIGRATIONS  THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND  GLOBALIZATION AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO REDEFINE EVERY  SINGLE DAY WHAT IT IS TO BE  CANADIAN. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE CANADIAN. AND, YES, IT WILL EVOLVE. IT WILL TRANSFORM ITSELF. AROUND THE WORLD. WE MUST CELEBRATE. I'M PROUD CANADIAN LIKE YOU. WE BUILD THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER  AND WE WANT THIS COUNTRY TO BE  LIKE THAT IN 25 YEARS. WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S  SAD, BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE A  DISCUSSION ABOUT IMMIGRATION,  THAT I'M RADICAL. ONLY 6% SAY PUBLICLY WHAT --  >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): YOU'RE SAYING WHAT  MR. SCHEER THINKS PRIVATELY. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  YOU'RE NOT IN LINE WITH THE  POPULATION. >> Lisa: ON THAT, WE WANT TO  HEAR FROM ANOTHER CANADIAN  TONIGHT. THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS TO THE  ISSUE OF LEADERSHIP. SO THIS QUESTION IS COMING FROM  SUSAN FERNANDO WHO ASKED HER  QUESTION FROM CALGARY. HI, I'M SUSAN FERNANDO IN  CALGARY. >> MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT  APPEARS PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS  AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE  ON DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS, NO  MATTER WHAT POLITICAL PARTY,  COOPERATION IS KEY WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUE OF PENSION, WORKERS  RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH  CARE. AS PRIME MINISTER, HOW WOULD YOU DEMONSTRATE STRONG LEADERSHIP  WHEN WORKING WITH THE PROVINCES  AND TERRITORIES? >> Lisa: THANK YOU, SUSAN  FERNANDO FROM CALGARY. AGAIN, BASED ON A RAN DOWN DRAW  THIS GOES TO MR. BERNIER FIRST  AND THEN EVERY OTHER LEADER WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO ANSWER. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  FIRST OF ALL, I WILL RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION. I WILL RESPECT PROVINCES AND  THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I WON'T INTERFERE IN  PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION. I WON'T INTERFERE IN HEALTH  CARE, BECAUSE IT IS A PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION. AND THEN YOU KNOW, WE CANNOT IN  OTTAWA, SOLVE THE CHALLENGES  THAT WE'RE HAVING FOR HEALTH  CARE. AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRANSFER  THE MONEY TO THE PROVINCES AND  WHAT I WILL DO, I WILL LET  PROVINCES BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH  HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION. THAT IS OUR CONSTITUTION. SO PROVINCES WILL HAVE THE MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER  TO YOUR CHALLENGES. >> THANK YOU, IT'S NOW MR.  SINGH'S OPPORTUNITY. CONSE >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.):  THINGS ARE GETTING HARDER THAN  EVER. AND SHE TOUCHED ON A WHOLE HOST  OF ISSUES. I WANT TO SINGLE IN ON HEALTH  CARE. I THINK OF THE PEOPLE THAT I  MEET, THE YOUNG BOY THAT I MET,  THAT HAS A CHRONIC ILLNESS AND  HAS TO PAY FOR MEDICATION AND  INJECTIONS AND BLOOD WORK. THEY TOLD ME HE'S NOT WORRIED  ABOUT THE ILLNESS, BUT IS  WORRIED ABOUT BEING A BURDEN TO  HIS MOM AND DAD. THAT YOUNG PERSON SAYING YOU'RE  NOT WORTH UNIVERSAL PHARMACARE. THE BIG PHARMACARE COMPANIES ARE MORE IMPORTANT. I WANT TO SAY THAT TO YOUNG  PERSON, THE NEW DEMOCRATIC  GOVERNMENT WILL BRING UNIVERSAL  PHARMACARE FOR ALL. YOU'LL BRING YOUR HEALTH CARD,  NOT CREDIT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALWAYS  RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF  WORKING WITH PROVINCES, BUT WE   LEADERSHIP TO GET THINGS DONE,  LIKE INTERPROVINCIAL FREE TRADE. SOMETHING MR. TRUDEAU HAS FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH. ONE THING I CAN PROMISE VOTERS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERS WON'T HAVE TO TAKE A CONSERVATIVE  GOVERNMENT TO COURT TO FIGHT THE CARBON TAX. AND MR. TRUDEAU HAS IMPOSED HIS  CARBON TAX ON PROVINCES THAT  DON'T WANT TO GO ALONG WITH HIS  HIGH COST SCHEME. THIS IS INCREASING THE COST OF  EVERYDAY ESSENTIALS, LIKE  GASOLINE AND HOME HEATING AND  GROCERIES. AND IT WILL ONLY GO UP AFTER THE NEXT ELECTION. HE IS REFUSING TO TELL CANADIANS HOW HIGH HIS CARBON TAX WILL GO  IF HE'S RE-ELECTED. THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT  UNDER MY LEADERSHIP WILL SCRAP  THE CARBON TAX. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THANK YOU, SUSAN, FOR THE  QUESTION. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND  COOPERATION IS IN OUR DNA. NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE SOLVE  ARE GOING TO BE -- FACE, ARE  GOING TO BE SOLVED IF WE ARGUE  WITH ONE ANOTHER, WHETHER IT'S  IN PARLIAMENT FOR BETWEEN  FEDERAL PARTIES. MODELLED AFTER WHAT IS DONE IN  AUSTRALIA, WE WANT TO A CALL OF  CANADIAN GOVERNMENT. SO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,  PROVINCIAL, TERRITORIAL. THE LOCAL ORDERS OF GOVERNMENT  NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE, SO,  TOO, DO INDIGENOUS LEADERSHIP. FIRST NATIONS, METIS, INUIT. FINDING COMMON GROUND ON ISSUES  LIKE HEALTH CARE. AND WORKING TOGETHER IN THE  PUBLIC INTEREST. >> Lisa: MS. MAY, THANK YOU. MR. BLANCHET. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): I REMEMBER SEEING A  STUDY, HE'S SAYING THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT FEDERAL ISSUES, BUT PROVINCIAL AND QUÉBEC ISSUES. THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. IF YOU WANT COOPERATION WITH  PROVINCES OR QUÉBEC, YOU NEED TO RESPECT THE JURISDICTION AND  SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO STOP DOING AND THIS IS ONE OF THE DEMANDS  OF THE GOVERNMENT OF QUÉBEC ON  MANY ISSUES, IS GIVING A HAND TO THIS, OUR MONEY BY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND GIVING BACK TO US WITH CONDITIONS. THE MONEY HAS TO BE GIVEN TO  PROVINCES IN THEIR OWN FIELDS OF JURISDICTIONS TO BE GIVEN BACK  WITHOUT CONDITIONS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): SIGN HISTORIC HEALTH  ACCORDS WITH MASSIVE INVESTMENTS IN HOME CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE WERE ABLE TO INVEST IN  INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE HOUSING AND  PUBLIC TRANSIT ACROSS THE  COUNTRY AND WE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH PROVINCES ON RENEGOTIATING  A NAFTA THAT IT HAD EVERYONE  PLAY ON ONE TEAM CANADA. WE'RE WORKING ON THE DEFINING  ISSUE. JASON KENNEY AND DOUG FORD AND  OTHER CONSERVATIVE PREMIERS  DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ON  CLIMATE CHANGE. WE NEED A GOVERNMENT IN OTTAWA  THAT IS GOING TO FIGHT THEM AND  FIGHT FOR CANADIANS ON CLIMATE  CHANGE AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT  WE'RE GOING TO DO. >> Lisa: WE'LL HAVE THE OPEN  DEBATE COMING UP VERY SHORTLY. WE'RE GOING SWITCH GEARS NOW,  THOUGH, AND GIVE A LEADER A  CHANCE TO ASK ANY OTHER LEADER A QUESTION ON ANY TOPIC THEY  CHOOSE. AGAIN, THE ORDER OF THIS WAS  CHOSEN BY RANDOM DRAW. THE FIRST LEADER THIS TIME IS  N.D.P. JAGMEET SINGH. MR. SINGH, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THANK YOU, TO MR. TRUDEAU. YOU TALK ABOUT HOW CONSERVATIVES CUT TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY AND  CUT EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE  AND OTHER SERVICES. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I'VE HEARD  YOU SAY THIS OFTEN. MY QUESTION IS, YOU CRITICIZE  MR. HARPER ON HIS CLIMATE  TARGETS BUT YOU FAILED TO  ACHIEVE THEM. YOU CRITICIZED MR. HARPER ON  HEALTH CARE FUNDING, YOU ALSO  CUT THEM. YOU CRITICIZED MR. HARPER GIVING BILLIONS TO BILLIONAIRES, YOU  GAVE $14 BILLION MORE. THE QUESTION IS THIS, WHY DO YOU KEEP LETTING DOWN THE PEOPLE  THAT VOTED FOR YOU? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): FIRST THING WE DID  WAS CUT TAXES FOR THE MIDDLE  CLASS AND RAISE THEM ON THE  WEALTHIEST. AFTER 10 YEARS OF STEPHEN HARPER DOING NOT, IN FOUR YEARS WE'VE  REACHED THREE QUARTERS TO THE  WAY OF OUR 2030 TARGETS WHICH WE WILL MEET AND SURPASS. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO  MORE. LIKE PLANTING TREES AND GIVING  MONEY UP FRONT SO PEOPLE CAN  RETROFIT THEIR HOMES. MAKING CANADA NET ZERO BY 2050. WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO  MOVE FORWARD AND RIGHT NOW, MR.  ANDREW SCHEER HAS PROMISED THE  FIRST THING HE'LL DO IS TO RIP  UP. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON BECAUSE  CANADIANS EXPECT US TO. WE LIFTED 900,000 PEOPLE OUT OF  POVERTY. AND THINGS THAT MR. SCHEER AND  MR. SINGH, THE N.D.P. VOTED  AGAINST. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN  FAMILIES BECAUSE IT'S CREATING  JOBS AND HELPING PEOPLE OUT OF  POVERTY, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT  CANADIANS EXPECT. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO  DO. >> NOW THE LEADERS HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE OPEN  DEBATE ON THIS. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  WANT TO SAY, WE LOOK AT THE  TRACK RECORD OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN REALITY, STATISTICS CANADA  POINTS OUT IN 2017, THE  WEALTHIEST ACTUALLY PAID LESS IN TAX AND GAVE MORE IN WEALTH. WHEN WE LOOK AT ONE OF THE  BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE'RE FACED  WITH, IS OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS. NOT ONLY DID THE FINANCE  MINISTER USE OFFSHORE TAX  HAVENS, BUT ALSO THE TREASURY  BOARD. HOW CAN YOU TELL CANADIANS, WE  DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FUND  THINGS LIKE UNIVERSAL PHARMACARE WHEN YOUR TOP TWO CABINET  MINISTERS DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR  SHARE? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): MR. SINGH, YOU MIGHT  REMEMBER THAT --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I'M  VERY DIFFERENT THAN MR. SCHEER. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT  WITH THE WEALTH YILS CANADIANS  AND THE CONSERVATIVES. WHEN WE CLOSED LOOPHOLES TO GIVE TAX BREAKS WORTH $50,000 TO THE  WEALTHIEST CANADIANS. >> Lisa: MR. TRUDEAU WILL GIVE  MR. SCHEER AN OPPORTUNITY TO  RESPOND. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU CALLED ENTREPRENEURS WHO  CREATED JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES  IN OUR SOCIETY TAX CHEATS, ALL  THE WHILE PROTECTING YOUR TRUST  FUND AND THOSE OF YOUR  MILLIONAIRE FRIENDS. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS LOWERING  TAXES FOR ALL CANADIANS. WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL TAX CUT THAT WILL LOWER THE FIRST BRACKET,  THAT WILL -- >> WHAT YOU'RE DOING. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN --  >> Lisa: MR. BERNIER? >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): THEY ARE SPENDING AND SPENDING. EVERYBODY HERE ON THIS STAGE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY. AND YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT CREATE  WEALTH WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS  SPENDING MONEY. YOU MUST HAVE THE RIGHT POLICIES FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR ACTUALLY. WE WANT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO BE ABLE TO INVEST. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO UNDO  THE TAX BREAKS. WE'RE GOING TO UNDO THE TAX  HIKES. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEGMENT, MR. SINGH POINTED OUT THAT MR.  TRUDEAU HAD NOT CHANGED THE  CLIMATE TARGETS FROM THOSE OF  MR. HARPER. IT NEEDS TO BE SAID CLEARLY, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE I  BELIEVED THE LIBERALS IN 2015  THEY WOULD GO WITH  SCIENCE-B SCIENCE-BASED, EVIDENCE-BASED  POLICIES, BUT IT'S A TARGET FOR  LOSING THE FIGHT BECAUSE IT  IGNORES THE SCIENCE. ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT, THE GREEN PARTY IS THE ONLY PARTY WITH A  PLAN, MISSION POSSIBLE THAT  WILL --  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): A  PLAN THAT WILL DESTROY THE  ECONOMY. >> YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. OUR PLAN IS TO STAY IN LINE WITH SCIENCE. OUR PLAN IS THIS. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WHAT SCIENCE DID YOU FIND? >> IT'S TO KEEP WARMING WITHIN  1.5°. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I LOVE TO SAY IT? BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT OUR  CHILDREN'S SURVIVAL. I LOVE TO PROTECT. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): TAKE  ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE'RE IN. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE  COURAGE TO FIGHT BIG POLLUTERS. IT'S GOING TAKE THE COURAGE TO  STAND UP TO THE LOBBYISTS THAT  MR. TRUDEAU HAS CAVED INTO AND  THE REASON WE CONTINUE TO PAY  SUBSIDIES TO THE FOSSIL FUEL  SECTOR. WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY END THE -- >> MR. SINGH, MS. MAY, WHAT A  CLIMATE PLAN NEEDS TO DO IS TO  BE AMBITIOUS AND DOABLE. AND OF THE PLANS THAT ARE  FORWARD HERE ON THIS STAGE,  THERE IS ONLY ONE PLAN THAT THE  EXPERTS QUALIFIED AS BOTH  AMBITIOUS AND DOABLE AND THAT IS THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE BEGUN TO  PUT IN PLACE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MR. TRUDEAU'S PLAN IS FAILING. IT IS MAKING THINGS HARDER. OUR PLAN TAKES THE CLIMATE  CHANGE FIGHT GLOBAL RECOGNIZING  THAT CANADA CAN DO MORE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE BY EXPORTING OUR  CLEAN TECHNOLOGY AND HELPING  OTHER COUNTRIES LOWER THEIR  EMISSIONS. >> Lisa: AND THAT IS ALL THE  TIME WE HAVE FOR THE OPEN  DEBATE. THAT CONCLUDES THIS SEGMENT. YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU GOT TO JUMP RIGHT IN. THANK YOU, ALL, VERY MUCH. FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THAT  SEGMENT. [ ♪♪ ] HELLO. I'M ALTHIA RAJ AND THE THEME OF  THIS SEGMENT IS POLARIZATION,  HUMAN RIGHTS AND IMMIGRATION. AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH MY QUESTION TO N.D.P. LEADER JAGMEET SINGH. MR. SINGH, I WANT TO ASK YOU  ABOUT BILL 21. YOUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT COURAGE. BUT YOU HAVE NOT SHOWN THE  COURAGE TO CITE QUÉBEC'S  DISCRIMINAL LAWS. AREN'T YOU, AND FRANKLY THE  OTHER LEADERS ON THE STAGE,  PUTTING YOUR OWN PARTY'S  INTERESTS IN QUÉBEC AHEAD OF  YOUR PRINCIPLES? AND THE EQUALITY RIGHTS OF ALL  CITIZENS? YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO ANSWER. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): SURE. IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY OBVIOUS TO  FOLKS THAT I AM OBVIOUSLY  AGAINST BILL 21. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HURTS ME,  MAKES ME FEEL SAD. I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIMES I  GREW UP BEING TOLD I COULDN'T DO THINGS BECAUSE OF THE WAY I  LOOK. I THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT  GROW UP IN CANADA WHO CAN'T  ACHIEVE MORE BECAUSE OF THEIR  IDENTITY. I THINK OF THE PEOPLE IN QUÉBEC, WHO ARE TOLD BECAUSE THEY WEAR A HIJAB THEY CAN'T BE A TEACHER,  OR A YAMKA, THEY CAN'T BE A  JUDGE. WHEN I GO TO QUÉBEC, I SAY, HEY, I'M HERE, I'M SOMEONE HAS  BELIEFS IN FIGHTING THE CLIMATE  CRISIS. I BRIEF IN FIRMLY THE RIGHTS OF  WOMEN, THE RIGHT OF A WOMAN TO  CHOOSE AND BUILD MORE ACCESS TO  ABORTION SERVICES. I BELIEVE IN MAKING SURE WE  TACKLE THE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS THAT ARE INFLUENCING GOVERNMENT  AND NOT ALLOWING -- CHALLENGING  OUR ABILITY TO LIFT UP PEOPLE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I WANT TO START OFF BY  CONGRATULATING YOU ON THE WAY  YOU'VE HANDLED SO MANY ISSUES  AROUND RACE AND IDENTITY. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THE VICTIM  OF THESE RACIST ACTS IN THE  PAST, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE HANDLED IT IN THE PAST. ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO  SCANDALS DURING THIS CAMPAIGN. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO  UNDERSTAND WHILE WE'LL NOT  INTERVENE IN THIS COURT CASE, AS A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT, WE DO RECOGNIZE AND THE CONSERVATIVE  PARTY STANDS FOR FREEDOM,  EQUALITY AND WE WILL MAKE SURE  THAT -- WE WILL NOT PURSUE THIS  TYPE OF BILL. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  WANT TO TALK ON THE THEME OF THE DISCUSSION, POLARIZATION. WHILE BILL 21 IS GOING TO SINGLE OUT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE WAY  THEY LOOK. OTHER THING THAT IS HAPPENING  PEOPLE ARE PIT AGAINST EACH  OTHER. PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FIND A HOME,  CAN'T AFFORD THEIR BILLS, CAN'T  GET THE MEDICATION OR THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED, ARE TOLD IT'S  NOT THE FAULT OF POWERFUL  CORPORATIONS AND THOSE NOT  PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, BUT  IT'S THE FAULT OF A NEW  CANADIAN. IT'S THE FAULT OF A 12-YEAR-OLD  REFUGEE. OR IMMIGRANT BREAKING HIS BACK  12 HOURS A DAY. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO  TACKLE ECONOMIC SECURITY IF WE  WANT TO TACKLE THE POLARIZATION. >> Althia: MS. MAY? >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I WANT TO ECHO ANDREW'S  COMMENTS, I THINK JAGMEET HAS  DONE, AS WE ALL HAVE DURING THIS STRANGE PERIOD OF ELECTION  CAMPAIGN, CONFRONTING ISSUES  OF -- OF PRIVILEGE AND ANYONE  WITH PRIVILEGE. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT BILL 21 IN  QUÉBEC, I THINK IT CHALLENGES  ALL OF US. LIKE THE N.D.P., THE GREEN PARTY OPPOSES BILL 21. THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH THE  QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO  PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN  QUÉBEC, QUÉBECERS ARE FIGHTING  THIS OUT WITHIN QUÉBEC, QUÉBEC  GROUPS ARE GOING TO COURT TO SAY THAT BILL 21 DISCRIMINATES. AND WE'RE FRANKLY LOOKING AT A  SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  UNDERSTAND. WHAT I WANT TO ALSO JUST TOUCH  ON, WHILE BILL 21 IS OF COURSE  POLARIZING, WE HAVE TO TACKLE  THE POWERFUL CORPORATIONS THAT  DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. IT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN'T FIND  HOUSING OR GET THE MEDICATION  THEY NEED. >> IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT PAYING  THEIR FAIR SHARE --  >> Althia: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS. MAY, THANK YOU -- MS. MAY,  THANK YOU. MR. BLANCHET, YOUR TERN. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YES. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I'LL  GIVE YOU MORE THAN 10 SECONDS. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): WITH 70% OF THE  PEOPLE IN PARLIAMENT AND QUÉBEC  SUPPORTING BILL 21, IT'S HARDLY  POLARIZATION ISSUE IN QUÉBEC. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IN ENGLISH TONIGHT IT WILL BE  QUITE CLEAR, EVERYBODY HERE HAS  PROBLEMS WITH THE VERY IDEA OF,  I WILL SAY, IT BECAUSE THERE IS  NO WORD FOR THAT IN ENGLISH. BUT SAY IN BEST OF CASES THEY  WOULD UNDERRATE IT. BUT QUÉBEC DOES NOT NEED TO BE  TOLD WHAT TO DO ABOUT ITS OWN  VALUES NOR ITS LANGUAGE, NOR  THEMSELVES AS A NATION. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THIS  IS A BILL THAT SAYS TO PEOPLE  BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY LOOK  THEY CAN'T DO A JOB. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT TRUE. AND YOU TWEET THAT --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.):  INSTEAD OF THAT, WHAT WE SHOULD  BEEN DOING --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): WAS WRONG. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): LET'S PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. LET'S BUILD UP MORE PROTECTIONS  FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY. LET'S BUILD MORE PROTECTIONS TO  BUILD A SOCIETY --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): DON'T --  >> Althia: THANK YOU. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): MR. SINGH YOU HAVE  SPOKEN ELOQUENTLY ABOUT  DISCRIMINATION AND FOUGHT  AGAINST IT ALL YOUR LIFE, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO SURPRISING TO HEAR  YOU SAY, LIKE EVERY OTHER LEADER ON THE STAGE, THAT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT UNDER YOU WOULD NOT  INTERVENE IN THE QUESTION OF  BILL 21 IN QUÉBEC. IT'S A QUESTION WHERE, YES, IT'S AWKWARD POLITICALLY, BECAUSE AS  MR. BLANCHET SAYS, IT IS VERY  POPULAR. BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE  STAGE WHO SAID, YES, A FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE TO  INTERVENE ON THIS. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  NEEDS TO PROTECT MINORITY  RIGHTS. NEEDS TO PROTECT LANGUAGE  RIGHTS. NEEDS TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS  AND NEEDS TO DO THAT ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU WOULD  POSSIBLY INTERVENE. YOU LEAF THE DOOR OPEN. -- LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): LET'S BE HONEST. EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE IS FIGHTING A BILL LIKE BILL 21. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): SO WHY NOT FIGHT IT  IF YOU FORM GOVERNMENT? >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE I CHANNEL THE  FRUSTRATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE  TOLD THEY CAN'T ACHIEVE BECAUSE  OF HOW THEY LOOK. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WHY NOT LEAVE THE  DOOR OPEN FOR CHALLENGING IT? >> Althia: MR. BERNIER, YOUR  CHANCE TO GO. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  ABOUT THE BILL 21, WE MUST  RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION. AND WE WON'T INTERFERE AT THE  FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT'S THE DEFINITION FROM THE  PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE MUST DO. BUT ALSO, MR. SINGH, YOU SAID  THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE  HERE ON THE STAGE TO HAVE A  DISCUSSION WITH YOU, SO YOU'RE  FOR DIVERSITY. BUT WHAT ABOUT DIVERSITY OF  OPINION. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ANOTHER OPINION ABOUT IMMIGRATION. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE  NOT -- YOU'RE A LEADER AND YOU  MUST BE TRY TO HAVE EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE, BUT ARE YOU  BELIEVING --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): LET  ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION. -- ONLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING  THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR? >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): LET  ME ANSWER IT. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF  THIS DEBATE TONIGHT, I THINK  PEOPLE CAN CLEARLY SEE WHY YOU  DIDN'T DESERVE A PLATFORM. THE COMMENTS YOU'RE MAKING, THE  TYPE OF THINGS YOU SAY -- IT'S  ONE THING TO SAY YOU DISAGREE  WITH SOMEBODY, BUT WHEN YOU  INCITE HATRED --  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): NO,  NO, IT'S NOT TRUE. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): --  MENTAL STABILITY, IT SHOWS A  LACK OF JUDGMENT. I'M HAPPY TO CHALLENGE YOU ON  THAT. YOUR IDEAS ARE HURTFUL TO  CANADA. I'LL ALWAYS WORK TO BUILD UNITY. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  NEED PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T AGREE WITH YOU. >> Althia: CONTINUING WITH THE  THEME, WE HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING  THIS DEBATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY,  INCLUDING A BIG CROWD AT THE  STUDENT UNION BUILDING AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. AND OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM PAGE WHO JOINS US FROM  VANCOUVER. >>  HI, GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS PAIGE. I'M HERE TONIGHT AT U.B.C. BUT I LIVE IN COLD STREAM, BRITISH  COLUMBIA. MY QUESTION IS ALONG THE LINES  OF POLARIZATION AND TO ME,  CANADA FEELS MORE DIVIDED THAN  EVER BEFORE. IF DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH,  BUT DIVISION IS WEAKNESS, HOW  WILL YOUR LEADERSHIP SEEK TO  PROVIDE A UNIFIED VISION FOR  CANADA AND HOW WILL YOU ENSURE  THAT ALL VOICES ACROSS THE  POLITICAL SPECTRUM ARE HEARD AND CONSIDERED? THANK YOU. >> MR. SINGH? >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. I APPRECIATE GETTING A CHANCE TO CHAT WITH YOU. THANKS FOR TUNING IN. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE  DIVISIONS WE HAVE IN THE  COUNTRY. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIVISIONS AND THEY'RE GROWING. I POINT TO A LOT OF REASONS FOR  IT. RADICALIZATION. THERE IS HATEFUL DISCOURSE. THERE IS A CLIMATE WHICH ALLOWS  PEOPLE TO BE EMBOLDENED. BUT THE OTHER REASON PEOPLE ARE  EXPLOITED IS BECAUSE THEY'RE  WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  CAN'T GET THE BASIC THINGS THEY  NEED. HOUSING. AND IT'S THE NEGLECT OF THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE  BROUGHT US TO THIS POSITION. I THINK THE WAY WE TACKLE A LOT  OF THE POLARIZATION IS MAKING  SURE PEOPLE GET THE BASIC THINGS THEY NEED. >> Althia: THANK YOU. MR. SCHEER? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): IT'S IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND WHY CANADA IS A COUNTRY OF  DIVERSITY. IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE COME FROM  ALL OVER THE WORLD TO TAKE  REFUGE HERE, BUILD A BETTER  LIFE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FREEDOM. THAT'S THE COMMON GROUND THAT  EVERYONE WHO COMES HERE, NO  MATTER WHAT GENERATION, CAN  AGREE ON. IT'S IMPORTANT WE REMEMBER THAT, PROMOTE THAT AND ENSURE THAT  PEOPLE WHO COME HERE, EMBRACE  THAT ASPECT THAT MAKES OUR  COUNTRY GREAT. BUT WHAT IS VERY DANGEROUS, WHEN YOU HAVE A PRIME MINISTER LIKE  JUSTIN TRUDEAU WHO USES  LEGITIMATE ISSUES LIKE RACISM  AND HATEFUL LANGUAGE TO DEMONIZE ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH HIM,  CALLING HIM UN-CANADIAN FOR  DISAGREEING WITH HIS FAILURE ON  THE BORDER --  >> Althia: THANK YOU, I'M SORRY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THANKS, PAIGE AND HEY TO YOU  B.C. I RAISE MY HANDS TO THE  MUSQUEAM, SQUAMISH TERRITORY. WE NEED THE LEADERSHIP THAT  LIFTS PEOPLE UP. THAT DOESN'T FEEL THAT POLITICS  IS DISGUSTING. WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE IDEA OF  REAL DEMOCRACY WHERE EVERY  CITIZEN HAS AGENCY AND POWER TO  WORK TOGETHER. MISSION POSSIBLE FOR CLIMATE  ACTION. WE CALL ALL HANDS ON DECK. WE'RE GOING TO NEED EVERYBODY. AND TO HAVE THE KIND OF  DEMOCRACY THAT REFLECTS  EVERYONE, WE NEED FAIR VOTING. WE NEED TO GET RID OF  FIRST-PAST-THE-POST, BECAUSE IT  CREATES EACH POLITICAL PARTY AS  RIVAL WARRING CAMP, EVEN WHEN  THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER. >> Althia: THANK YOU. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YES. I BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY GROWS  ON INFORMATION. SO TRANSLATING WITH PEOPLE, BY  VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE  YOU IS AT BEST DISHONEST. AND MAY I REMIND YOU THAT IN  2011, THE EXACT SAME PHRASE WAS  SAID BYIN MICHAEL IGNATIEFF. IN 2015, THE SAME SENTENCE WAS  SAID BY THOMAS MULCAIR. SO PEOPLE --  >> Althia: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M SORRY, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. MR. TRUDEAU? ? /* IT'S 40 SECONDS. EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME TIME. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THANK YOU, PAIGE, FOR YOUR QUESTION. IT'S GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY AT  U.B.C. ONE OF MY ALMA LAYNE MATECHUK -- ALMA MATERS. IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THE  DIFFERENTIALS THAT ARE  HIGHLIGHTED. THE REALITY IS CANADIANS AGREE  ON MOST THINGS. WE WANT TO RAISE OUR KIDS IN A  WORLD THAT IS GETTING BETTER FOR THEM. WE WANT TO PAY FOR THEIR FUTURES AND RETIRE IN COMFORT. WE WANT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES  FOR OUR NEIGHBOURS AS WELL. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BINDS  CANADIANS TOGETHER RIGHT AROUND  THE COUNTRY. AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS A  POLITICS OF FEAR AND DIVISION IS THAT IS CONTINUING TO DOMINATE  HERE UNDERLYING WHAT WE'RE  ACTUALLY DOING. >> Althia: THANK YOU. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  SPEAKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION, IT  IS NOT -- ACTUALLY CANADA  RECEIVES MORE IMMIGRANTS PER  CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER WESTERN  COUNTRY. THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE U.S. SO WE MUST HAVE A DISCUSSION  ABOUT THAT. IT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE NOVA SCOTIA EVERY THREE YEARS, THE  POPULATION OF NOVA SCOTIA EVERY  THREE YEARS HERE IN CANADA. SO YOU KNOW, ALL FOR MASS  IMMIGRATION. I'M FOR IMMIGRATION, BUT WE MUST HAVE FEWER IMMIGRANTS. WITH MORE ECONOMIC IMMIGRANTS  FOR OUR COUNTRY. >> Althia: THANK YOU. WE ARE MOVING ON TO A ONE-ON-ONE FORMAT FOLLOWED BY AN OPEN  DEBATE. WE START WITH CONSERVATIVE  LEADER ANDREW SCHEER. YOU MAY PICK ANY LEADER AND ASK  ANY QUESTION OF YOUR CHOOSING. [LAUGHTER]  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MR. TRUDEAU, YOU BROKE ETHICS  LAWS TWICE. YOU INTERFERED IN AN ONGOING  CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDING. YOU SHUT DOWN PARLIAMENTARY  INVESTIGATIONS INTO YOUR  CORRUPTION AND YOU FIRED THE  ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN YOUR CAUCUS  WHO WERE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST  WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO, JUST FOR TELLING THE TRUTH. TELL ME, WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO YOU? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THE ROLE OF A PRIME  MINISTER IS TO STAND UP FOR  CANADIANS' JOBS, THE PUBLIC  INTEREST AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE  DONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. UNLIKE THE VISION YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD OF GIVING TAX BREAKS  THAT HELP PEOPLE MAKING $400,000 A YEAR MORE THAN SOMEONE MAKING  $40,000. YOU'RE OFFERING A $50,000 TAX  BREAK, WHICH IS MORE MONEY THAN  MOST CANADIANS EARN TO THE  WEALTHIEST CANADIANS WITH YOUR  PLAN. OF COURSE, WE DON'T ENTIRE KNOW  YOUR PLAN BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T  RELEASED YOUR COSTED PLATFORM,  WHICH IS A DISRESPECT --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHERE IS YOUR COSTED PLATFORM? HALF OF IT ISN'T COSTED? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): OUR PLATFORM CAME OUT WEEKS AGO AND WE WORKED WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICER AND WE HAVE A VISION, BUT IT IS A  DIFFERENT VISION THAN YOURS,  BECAUSE WE'RE CHOOSING TO INVEST IN PEOPLE. YOU'RE CHOOSING JUST LIKE DOUG  FORD, TO HIDE YOUR PLATFORM FROM CANADIANS AND DELIVER CUTS, CUTS TO SERVICES AND CUTS TO TAXES  FOR THE WEALTHIEST. >> Althia: MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU'RE MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN. HALF OF YOUR PLATFORM ISN'T EVEN COSTED. YOU'RE MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS  WITHOUT ANY DETAILS. AND WITHOUT ANY NUMBERS. YOU AREN'T --  >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THIS IS ENTIRELY  UNTRUE. YOU'RE HIDING YOUR PLATFORM FROM CANADIANS. >> Andrew Scheer  (Conservative): -- IF YOU'RE  RE-ELECTED. YOU STARTED OFF TALKING ABOUT -- >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WEALTHIEST 1%. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU SAID THE ALLEGATIONS IN "THE GLOBE AND MAIL" WERE FALSE. YOU SAID YOU NEVER PUT PRESSURE  ON HER. WE KNOW THOSE WERE ALL LIES. YOU HAVE FAILED TO TELL THE  TRUTH IN A CORRUPTION SCANDAL. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY PRIME MINISTER IS TO STAND  UP FOR JOBS. AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULDN'T  HAVE DONE THAT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): SNC-LAVALIN NEVER THREATENED  JOBS, YOU ARE MAKING THAT UP  AGAIN. >> WHAT WE HAVE IS MR. SCHEER  AND MR. TRUDEAU ARGUING ABOUT  WHO IS WORSE FOR CANADA. WE HAVE TO START ARGUING ABOUT  WHO IS GOING TO BE BEST FOR  CANADA. MR. SCHEER, YOUR SMALL TAX CUTS  ARE NOT GOING TO HELP A FAMILY  STRUGGLING WITH THE COST OF  CHILD CARE WHICH COSTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. YOU'RE SMALL TAXES AREN'T GOING  TO HELP FAMILIES WITH  MEDICATION. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE'RE GOING TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET. $850 --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN PHARMACARE  FOR ALL. >> PHARMACARE --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN CHILD CARE. WHICH IS GOING TO SAVE FAMILIES  THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE  THAT THOSE FAMILIES THAT EARN  LESS $7,000, WE'RE GOING TO GET  DENTACARE. >> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THE  MONEY? >> THIS IS THE CONSERVATIVE  SPIN, WHERE WILL WE FIND THE  MONEY? >> WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE  WEALTHIEST CANADIANS. THOSE WITH FORTUNES OVER $20  MILLION, WE'RE GOING TO ASK THEM TO PAY MORE. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  YOU KNOW WHAT IS FASCINATING  ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL, BECAUSE  THEY HAVE THE SAME, WHEN THE  PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET REVIEWS  THEM, THEY FIND THE SECOND  BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY, THEY'RE  WORRIED THEY'LL HIRE LAWYERS AND AVOID PAYING THAT TAX. IF YOU GO LOOK AT THE REVIEWS,  THEY'RE AGREEING TO SPEND MONEY  ON PHARMACARE. THE WEAKNESS THEY SAY IN OUR  REVENUE SOURCES IS THAT WEALTHY  CANADIANS WILL CONTINUE TO HIRE  LAWYERS AND EVADE THEIR TAXES. THAT'S SHOCKING. WE NEED TO SAY TO PEOPLE, THIS  IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WEST  COUNTRY ON EARTH AND YOU HAVE  WEALTH, YOU HAVE OBLIGATION,  RESPONSIBILITY. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): IF I MAY --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.):  PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR  FAIR SHARE. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): I  REMEMBER THAT MR. SCHEER  REFERRED TO THE SNC SCANDAL. I WANT TO --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): I WANT TO SPEAK FOR  PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING WRONG. WHEN MR. TRUDEAU TRIED TO FIND A SOLUTION, HE DID IT THE WRONG  WAY AND ADMITTED IT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING MR. SCHEER IS  PLAYING THAT OLD CARD. YOU'RE TRADING THE IDEA THAT  QUÉBEC IS CORRUPT. THOSE 3400 PEOPLE HAVE DONE  NOTHING IS WRONG. NOW THE VALUE OF THE SHARES ARE  GOING DOWN. THE EMPLOYEES ARE LEAVING. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MR. BLANCHET, WITH ALL DUE  RESPECT, THERE IS NEVER AN  EXCUSE FOR A PRIME MINISTER TO  INTERFERE IN AN INDEPENDENT  INQUIRY. WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A  COUNTRY WHERE SOMEONE CAN ABUSE  THE POWER OF THEIR OFFICE TO  REWARD THEIR FRIENDS AND PUNISH  THEIR ENEMIES. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): AND PEOPLE HAVE TO  PAY THE PRICE FOR THAT, INNOCENT PEOPLE. I JUST WANT TO ADD, I WAS THE  ONLY LEADER WHO SAID NO  CORPORATION IS ABOVE THE LAW. I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAID  THAT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S NOT TRUE. >> I THINK I SAID THAT, TOO MAX. IT MAY BE THE ONLY THING WE  AGREE THAT NO CORPORATION IS  ABOVE THE LAW. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  GOOD, IT'S A NICE BEGINNING. >> Althia: WHAT A WONDERFUL SHOW THAT'S WRAPPED UP THE TOPIC AND  THE SEGMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ ♪♪ ] >> I'M SUSAN DELACOURT FROM "THE TORONTO STAR". WELCOME, LEADERS. I'M MODERATOR FOR THE NEXT THEME WHICH IS INDIGENOUS ISSUES. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS  SEGMENT WHICH WAS ALSO CHOSEN BY RANDOM DRAW WITH MY QUESTION TO  CONSERVATIVE LEADER ANDREW  SCHEER. SO HERE IT IS. MR. SCHEER, YOU'VE SAID THAT A  CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD  FOCUS ON PRACTICAL THINGS IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CANADA'S  INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. AS YOU PURSUE YOUR PROMISE  ENERGY CORRIDOR, PRACTICALLY  SPEAKING, HOW WILL YOU CONSULT,  ACCOMMODATE, AND OBTAIN CONSENT  FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLE? AND WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOUR  PLANS COME INTO CONFLICT WITH  INDIGENOUS RIGHTS AND INTERESTS? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE  QUESTION. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS 12 FIRST  NATIONS RESERVES IN HIS RIDING,  I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF  BALANCING TREATY RIGHTS AND ALSO THE ABILITY FOR INDIGENOUS  CANADIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE  ECONOMY. THAT REALLY IS THE KEY. AND WHAT I'VE SAID IS THAT  CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL  ENSURE THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR THE NATIONAL ENERGY CORRIDOR TAKES  INTO ACCOUNT INDIGENOUS CONCERNS BY ENSURING THAT A CABINET  MINISTER IS RESPONSIBLE  SPECIFICALLY FOR INDIGENOUS  CONSULTATIONS. AND UNLIKE THE COURT RULING THAT FOUND THAT THE CURRENT  GOVERNMENT MISHANDLED THE  CONSULTATIONS UNDER THE TMX  PIPELINE, WE WILL ENSURE THAT  IT'S DYNAMIC, THAT IT IS MORE  THAN JUST TICKING A BOX AND  LISTENING TO CONCERNS. IT'S ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THE  CONCERNS. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE IN THIS  COUNTRY WHERE BIG THINGS CAN GET BUILT AGAIN. DUTY TO CONSULT MEANS THAT  CONCERNS ARE HEARD. AND ADDRESSED. BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT WE FIND A PATH TO LETTING THINGS GET  BUILT IN THIS COUNTRY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THANK YOU. I'M APPALLED BY THE FACT THAT  MR. SCHEER HAS FORGOTTEN THAT  THERE WAS A DUTY TO CONSULT ON  THE HARPER GOVERNMENT AS WELL  AND THAT THEY ALSO VIOLATED IN  THE FINDINGS OF THE COURT,  IDENTITY CAL TO TRANS MOUNTAIN  ON THE CASE OF ENBRIDGE. IT'S THE U.N. DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO  COME INTO FORCE OF LAW IN THIS  COUNTRY. I KNOW YOU OPPOSE IT BECAUSE OF  THE DEBATE AT MacLEAN'S, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT 35% OF IT  REQUIRES CONSULTATION AND IT  DOES NOT BOIL DOWN TO WE WILL  CONSULT WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE  UNTIL WE GET THEM TO AGREE WITH  US. IT'S HOW TO PROTECT TERRITORIAL  RIGHTS. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHAT DOES FREE, PRIOR AND  INFORMED CONSENT MEAN? >> IT MEANS FREE PRIOR --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHO WANT THE PROJECTS --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WHY ARE YOU SET TO ASIDE THE  HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL WHEN THEY  FOUND THAT OUR GOVERNMENT  CONDUCTED ACTS THAT WERE WILLFUL AND IN VIOLATION OF THE RIGHTS  OF INDIGENOUS CHILDREN. WE MUST LIVE UP TO THE DECISION. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHO WANT THESE PROJECTS TO GO  AHEAD BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S THE KEY TO PROSPERITY. THEY KNOW IT'S THE WAY FOR THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  TERRITORIAL RIGHTS ARE  INHERENTLY -- I DON'T WANT TO  ARGUE. >> Susan: MR. BLANCHET. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU SAY, MR. SCHEER, YOU WANT TO RESPECT PROVINCES  AND QUÉBEC'S JURISDICTION, BUT  WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PIPELINE  OF YOURS TO [Speaking French] -- TRANSLATION, I'M SORRY, IN  ENGLISH IS PIPELINE. YOU DON'T FEAR THE IDEA OF  EXPROPRIATING TERRITORIES AND  SAYING THAT THE CONSTITUTION,  YOURS, NOT MINE, THE  CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT I HAVE  THE RIGHT TO GO THROUGH  PROVINCES, THROUGH QUÉBEC,  WITHOUT THEIR APPROVAL. AND MAY I REMIND YOU THAT  QUÉBECERS AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF QUÉBEC HAVE SAID CLEARLY IT  DOES NOT WANT IT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S COMPLETELY FALSE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS ADDRESSING THE INDIGENOUS  CONCERNS UP FRONT. GETTING THAT OUT OF THE WAY SO  THERE CAN BE A GEOGRAPHIC SPACE  SO PROJECTS CAN BE BUILT AGAIN. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): NOW IT BELONGS TO  QUÉBEC. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AROUND  IT. YOU KNOW THAT QUÉBECERS PURCHASE A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THE ENERGY  FROM THE --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): NOT OIL FROM SAUDI  ARABIA WHICH IS FALSE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I MADE MY CHOICE. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU HAVE AND QUÉBEC  WILL MAKE HIS. >> Susan: MR. BERNIER, HOW WILL  WE RESPECT INDIGENOUS RIGHTS? I REMIND YOU. OH, MR. TRUDEAU. SORRY. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THANK YOU. WE ALL REMEMBER 10 YEARS OF  STEPHEN HARPER WHO DID NOT  RESPECT INDIGENOUS RIGHTS, DID  NOT RESPECT INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. AND MR. SCHEER, YOU'RE PUTTING  FORWARD THE SAME PLAN THAT  DIDN'T JUST FAIL INDIGENOUS  PEOPLES, DIDN'T JUST FAIL  INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND THEIR KIDS, BUT ALSO FAILED TO GET  IMPORTANT ENERGY PROJECTS BUILT. WE NEED KEEP MOVING FORWARD IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS INDIGENOUS  PEOPLES AND RESPECTS A RANGE OF  VIEWS, BUT IS GROUNDED IN THE  U.N. DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS  OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES THAT YOU  HAVE CONSISTENTLY BLOCKED  THROUGH YOUR PARTY'S ACTIONS. THAT IS NOT RESPECT FOR  INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. PERRY BELLEGARDE, THE GRAND  CHIEF HAS SAID THAT NO  GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR  INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. HE'S ONE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. >> THAT'S RIGHT, HE COMES --  >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): HE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU. GIVE HIM A CALL SOMETIME. >> I HAVE NOTHING TO LEARN FROM  MR. TRUDEAU WHO FIRED THE FIRST  INDIGENOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR  DOING HER JOB. SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO POLITICS  DIFFERENTLY AND YOU FIRED HER  WHEN SHE DID. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GETTING  PIPELINES BUILT. YOU CANCELLED TWO PIPELINES AND  THE ONE YOU BOUGHT, YOU CAN'T  BUILD. YOU'VE LET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE IN ALBERTANS AND  SASKATCHEWAN DOWN. >> ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT I'M  GOING TO ATTACKED FOR NOT  BUILDING PIPELINES FOR SOME AND  BUILDING IT FOR OTHERS. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU'RE DOING NOTHING. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  SAID THAT YOU'RE READY FOR  BUILDING PIPELINES ALL ACROSS  THE COUNTRY BY THE PRIVATE  SECTOR. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU SAID,  YOU KNOW, QUÉBECERS ARE READY TO BUY OIL AND GAS FROM CANADA. I AGREE WITH THAT. I AGREE THAT QUÉBECERS KNOW THAT IT'S SAFER TO TRANSPORT OIL AND  GAS BY PIPELINE THAN BY TRAIN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE QUÉBEC GOVERNMENT SAID THAT THERE IS NO SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY FOR A  PIPELINE IN QUÉBEC. WHAT WILL BE YOUR POSITION ON  THAT? DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE THE CONSTITUTION, BECAUSE AFTER CONSULTATION, IF WE DON'T  HAVE ANY AGREEMENT, WE MUST BE  ABLE TO USE A CONSTITUTION TO  BUILD A PIPELINE. WHEN YOU DO THAT, THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE FULL  AUTHORITY, THE FULL JURISDICTION TO APPROVE THE PIPELINE. BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, YOU  DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO USE  THE CONSTITUTION TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE PIPELINES IN THIS  COUNTRY FOR THE UNITY OF OUR  COUNTRY AND THE PROSPERITY OF  OUR COUNTRY. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL. I ALWAYS SAID THE GOVERNMENT  MUST STAND UP FOR FEDERAL  JURISDICTION. WE RESPECT PROVINCIAL  JURISDICTION. WHEN YOU HAVE THE BEST IDEA, I'M CONVINCED I CAN GET SUPPORT FOR  THE PROJECT. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT IN  QUÉBEC, YOU DON'T HAVE THE  SUPPORT IN B.C. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): IT'S BETTER TO TAKE IT FROM THE  PIPELINE THAN TAKING GAS FROM  THE TANKER OR DONALD TRUMP. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  WANT TO TALK ABOUT A RECENT  DECISION. THE HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL OF  CANADA FOUND THAT THE HARPER  GOVERNMENT AND MR. TRUDEAU'S  GOVERNMENT WILLFULLY AND  RECKLESSLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST INDIGENOUS KIDS. THERE IS A LANDMARK DECISION  THAT SAID THESE KIDS SHOULD GET  EQUAL FUNDING. FINALLY JUSTICE FOR THE KIDS. THEN MR. TRUDEAU, NOW IN HIS  GOVERNMENT, ARE GOING TO APPEAL  THAT DECISION. HE WANTED TO FIGHT HARD TO KEEP  SNC-LAVALIN OUT OF THE COURTS,  BUT HE'S GOING TO DRAG  INDIGENOUS KIDS TO COURT. THAT IS WRONG. HOW COULD SOMEONE DO THAT? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THIS DECISION WILL HAVE HUGE  RAMIFICATIONS FOR SEVERAL  ASPECTS OF THE WAY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT PROVIDES SERVICES TO  INDIGENOUS CANADIANS. IT ALSO IS A VERY LARGE  SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT AMOUNT  AND I BELIEVE WHEN YOU'RE  DEALING WITH THESE TYPES OF  IMPORTANT PUBLIC ISSUES, IT'S  LEGITIMATE TO SAY IT SHOULD BE  REVIEWED -- HAVE A JUDICIAL  REVIEW. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  DISAGREE OF COURSE, BUT ONE  OTHER ISSUE. I WENT TO GRASSY NARROWS. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY IMPACTED BY  MERCURY POISONING AND THEY WENT  TO A PRIVATE FUNDRAISER WHERE  MR. TRUDEAU MOCKED HIM AND SAID, THANK YOU FOR -- WHAT KIND OF  PRIME MINISTER DOES THAT? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): BECAUSE HE'S A FRAUD. I WISH I HAD THAT ANSWER, BUT  ONE THAT DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE  RE-ELECTED. >> Susan: THE OPEN DEBATE IS  OVER, BUT WE CONTINUE ON THE  THEME OF INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS. WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM AN  AUDIENCE MEMBER HERE IN  GATINEAU. NATASHA BEEDIE. GO AHEAD. >> GOOD EVENING. AS A MEMBER OF BOTH THE LIGHT  FIRST NATION, MY QUESTION IS  THIS, IF ELECTED, HOW WOULD YOUR PARTIES WORK WITH PROVINCES AND  TERRITORIES ON RECOGNIZING AND  AFFIRMING INDIGENOUS RIGHTS,  SPECIFICALLY NOTING THE U.N.  DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF  INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, THE TRUTH  AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION  CALL TO ACTION, AND THE CALLS  FOR JUSTICE IN THE RECENT  MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS  WOMEN AND GIRLS INQUIRY. MIIGWECH. >> Susan: THE LEADERS WILL ALL  HAVE A CHANCE TO ANSWER THE  QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, NATASHA. STARTING WITH MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THERE IS A LOT THERE FOR 40  SECONDS. THERE ARE MANY AREAS IN THE  MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS  WOMEN AND GIRLS, THE REPORT THAT CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN CALLING  FOR, FOR QUITE A WHILE. INCLUDING COMBATING HUMAN  TRAFFICKING. SOMETHING THAT IS VERY  IMPORTANT. ALSO, WE SUPPORT PRESERVING  INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES BY ENSURING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES WHAT IT CAN TO PREVENT SOME OF  THE LANGUAGES AT RISK OF BEING  LOST. TO PRESERVE THEM. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  U.N. DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS  OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, WE NEED  TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU TALK  ABOUT FREE PRIOR AND INFORMED  CONSENT, THAT LEAVES A GREAT  DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT  THAT MEANS. AND THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF  INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES WHO WANT  THESE ENERGY PROJECTS TO SUCCEED AND WE NEED CERTAINTY AND  CLARITY AROUND THAT. >> Susan: ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO MS. MAY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  NATASHA, MIIGWECH. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND GREENS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE  UNITED THIS. WE WILL HONOUR THE U.N.  DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF  INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. IT MUST BE BROUGHT INTO LAW IN  THIS COUNTRY. AND THERE ARE EXISTING WEB OF  LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH WERE PROPERLY DESCRIBED AS  CONSTITUTING STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE MUST BE REVIEWED AND BROUGHT UP  TO THE STANDARD OF THE UNITED  NATIONS DECLARATION. WE MUST BRING IN THE  RECOMMENDATIONS 0 THE INQUIRY  INTO THE MISSING AND MURDERED  INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS AND  THE CALLS TO ACTION OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION. IT IS ON US TO BRING JUSTICE. >> WE ALSO SUPPORTED THE U.N.  DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF  INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. I DO BELIEVE AND I SPEND THE  MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS WITH THE  PEOPLE OF THE FIRST NATIONS. THEY ARE A NATION AS WELL AS  CANADA AND QUÉBEC ARE A NATION. A NATION DOES NOT PUT THIS  CULTURE, LANGUAGE, IN THE END OF ANOTHER NATION. SO WHAT THEY ASK FOR, AND THEY  HAVE TO ASK BECAUSE WE ARE  NOT -- WE ARE NO BETTER THAN  THEY ARE, REPRESENT THEMSELVES,  IS THAT ALL THOSE REPORTS AND  INQUIRIES AND DECLARATIONS,  BRING SOMETHING REAL FOR THEM. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THANK YOU FOR THE  QUESTION. WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD ON  RECONCILIATION IN WAYS THAT NO  PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN  ABLE TO, BUT I'M THE FIRST TO  RECOGNIZE THERE IS MUCH MORE TO  DO. WE LIFTED 87 BOIL-WATER  ADVISORIES AND WE'RE ON TRACK TO LIFTING 50 MORE, BUT WE'RE  CONTINUING TO INVEST IN  COMMUNITIES ON THE ISSUE OF  CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE THE TRIBUNAL'S  RULING THAT SAYS CHILDREN NEED  TO BE COMPENSATED AND WE WILL  COMPENSATE THEM. WE MOVED FORWARD TO END THE  TRAGEDIES BY MOVING FORWARD ON  LEGISLATION THAT KEEPS KIDS IN  CARE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH  THEIR LANGUAGE, WITH THEIR  CULTURE. WE ALSO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD  WITH GRASSY NARROWS WITH THE  COMMUNITY ON A TREATMENT CENTRE  AND MONEY IS NOT THE OBJECTION  TO INVESTING IN WHAT THEY NEED  IN THAT TREATMENT CENTRE. >> Susan: THANK YOU. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): NO  OTHER LEADER IS READY TO BUILD A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FIRST  NATIONS. THEY ALL SUPPORT THE STATUS QUO. BUT THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WE STILL HAVE EXTREME POVERTY ON RESERVE. WE NEED A BOLD REFORM. AND WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT  WILL TRY TO IMPLEMENT PROPERTY  RIGHTS ON RESERVE AND ALSO  ESTABLISH A NEW RELATIONSHIP  BASED ON SELF RELIANCE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO BUILD A NEW SYSTEM  WORKING WITH THEM, BUT THAT IS  NOT WHAT THEY WANT. BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIX THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IF WE DON'T DO A BOLD  REFORM. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. REALLY, IT'S A MATTER OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY. ALL OF THE ISSUES YOU RAISED  COME DOWN TO THE BASIC QUESTION  OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE'D DO, WE WOULDN'T TAKE INDIGENOUS KIDS TO COURT AND CHALLENGE A  DECISION THAT SAYS THEY WERE  RECKLESSLY DISCRIMINATED  AGAINST. WE WOULDN'T DO THAT. WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS  ISSUES OF JUSTICE. THAT MEANS IMPLEMENTING ALL THE  RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORTS THAT ARE SO POWERFUL AND HAVE A  GUIDELINE TOWARD SOLVING THE  PROBLEMS. WE MAKE SURE THERE IS CLEAN  DRINKING WATER. I DON'T ACCEPT EXCUSES WHY WE  WANT IN 2019. GOOD QUALITY HOUSING AND  EDUCATION AND WELFARE SERVICES. WE CAN DO THESE THINGS. >> Susan: THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE TIME FOR ANOTHER  LEADER TO LEADER DEBATE ON ANY  TOPIC. LEADING THIS ONE OFF IS GREEN  PARTY ELIZABETH MAY. YOU HAVE I BELIEVE ONE MINUTE. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THANK YOU. MY QUESTION IS TO JUSTIN  TRUDEAU. PICKING UP FROM THIS VERY  FRACTURED DISCUSSION ON  INDIGENOUS ISSUES, BUT LET'S  FACE IT, RIGHT NOW INDIGENOUS  PEOPLE, THE ASSEMBLE OF FIRST  NATIONS IS TELLING US THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS CLIMATE  EMERGENCY. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE  BETTER RHETORIC WITH MR. SCHEER  AND IT'S NOT ABOUT RHETORIC. IT'S ABOUT A TARGET GROUNDED IN  SCIENCE. AND WE NEED 60% REDUCTION BY  2030. NOT MR. SINGH'S 38, NOT YOUR 30. WILL YOU, MR. TRUDEAU, JOIN WITH ALL OF US IN AN INNER CABINET  THAT GETS RID OF THE  PARTISANSHIP --  >> Susan: MR. TRUDEAU, YOUR  ANSWER. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE RECOGNIZE THAT  TARGETS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT  TARGETS ARE NOT A PLAN. WE HAVE A REAL PLAN THAT HAS  DELIVERED OVER THE PAST FOUR  YEARS ON OUR WAY TO BANNING  SINGLE-USE PLASTICS, ON PUTTING  A PRICE ON POLLUTION ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, IN WAY THAT RETURNS  MONEY TO CANADIANS. UNLIKE WHAT MR. SCHEER IS  SAYING, MOST CANADIANS BETTER  OFF. 80% OF CANADIANS BETTER OFF WITH A PRICE ON POLLUTION THAN THEY  WILL BE WHEN HE RIPS UP OUR  CLIMATE CHANGE IF HE WERE TO  FORM GOVERNMENT AFTER THIS  ELECTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE  THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND  BRING CANADIANS ALONG WITH IT. OUR PLAN IS REALISTIC AND  AMBITIOUS AND DOABLE. AND THAT IS WHAT CANADIANS NEED. BECAUSE THE DANGER OF NOT ACTING ON THE ENVIRONMENT IS  TREMENDOUS. THE DANGER OF NOT HAVING A PLAN  FOR OUR FUTURE, EITHER THE  ENVIRONMENT OR THE ECONOMY, IS  GOING TO BE BORNE BY OUR KIDS. >> Susan: MS. MAY, OPEN DEBATE. THERE IS THREE MINUTES AND 45  SECONDS. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR, YOUR  TARGET IS A COMMITMENT TO  FAILURE, THAT'S WHY IT'S DOABLE  AND ACHIEVABLE, BECAUSE IT  DOESN'T DO WHAT THE IPCC SAYS WE MUST DO. WE MUST GO OFF FOSSIL FUELS AS  QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. YOU BOUGHT A PIPELINE. YOU CAN'T BE A CLIMATE LEADER  AND SPEND $10-13 BILLION MORE ON A PROJECT THAT BY ITSELF BLOWS  THROUGH OUR CARBON FUNDING. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): A SLOGAN IS NOT A  PLAN, MS. MAY. IT'S IS A --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WE HAVE A PLAN. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): CANADIANS NEED ACTION THAT IS GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE  US BETTER, FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND  BUILD A STRONGER ECONOMY FOR OUR KIDS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WITH ALL DUE RESPECT --  >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): -- MORE IN THE PAST  FOUR YEARS THAN ANY --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THAT'S NOT TRUE. PAUL MARTIN. NO ONE REMEMBERS PAUL MARTIN'S  PLAN. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): OVER THE PAST FOUR  YEARS WE DELIVERED ON IT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT IS FALSE AND JUST BECAUSE  YOU SAY SOMETHING OVER AND OVER  AGAIN DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): IT WOULD BE NICE FOR  YOU TO LEARN THAT, MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THERE IS NO CANADIAN THAT  BELIEVES THEY'RE GOING TO BE  BETTER OFF PAYING A CARBON TAX. YOU HAVE GIVEN A MASSIVE  EXEMPTION TO THE COUNTRY'S  LARGEST POLLUTERS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): BECAUSE THE EXPERTS  POINT OUT THAT 80% OF CANADIANS  ARE BETTER OFF UNDER OUR --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THEY HAVE TO TRUST YOUR NUMBERS. NOBODY BELIEVES YOUR NUMBERS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): YOU DO NOT WANT TO  ACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): LET  ME HELP YOU OUT. >> Susan: ONE AT A TIME. MR. SINGH. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  WANT TO SAY THIS DIRECTLY TO  CANADIANS. YOU DO NOT CHOOSE BETWEEN MR.  DELAY AND MR. DENY. THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION OUT  THERE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO A REAL PLAN  THAT IS GOING TO TAKE ON THE  BIGGEST POLLUTERS CAN , TAKE ON  THE POWERFUL INTERESTS. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WHAT IS YOUR TARGET? >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): IT'S  GOING TO BE TAKING ON THE  POWERFUL. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  YOU NEED A PLAN THAT IS ROOTED  IN SAVING OUR KIDS' FUTURE. >> JUST WANTED TO ADD IMPORTANT  RIGHT NOW --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WE'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT. >> MR. SCHEER AND MR. TRUDEAU,  YOU'RE THE SAME ON CLIMATE  CHANGE. YOU WANT TO IMPOSE CARBON TAX  AND MORE MIGRATION. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THAT'S THE FIRST  THING ALL NIGHT, MAX. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  YOU'RE THE SAME ON CLIMATE  CHANGE AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO  KEEP YOUR TARGET. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU AND I HAVE TO  FIND COMMON GROUND WHEN WE GET  IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. GREEN >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  IT THREATENS THE ST. LAWRENCE  RIVER. >> THIS IS NOT WHAT I HAD IN  MIND WHEN I PROVIDED ANSWERS TO  THAT. I THINK LEGAULT SHOULD BE BOUND  TO ALMOST NOTHING. 13, 16, THAT'S ALMOST NOTHING. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IDEA  OF EQUALIZATION ON GAS EMISSION. THOSE ARE OVER THE AVERAGE  EMISSIONS THAT CANADA PAY AND  THOSE WHO ARE UNDER GET THE  MONEY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WORK  TOGETHER AND THAT'S THE QUESTION I ASKED MR. TRUDEAU. ARE ANY OF YOU PREPARED TO  ACCEPT THE NOTION OF CHANGING  STATUS QUO DECISION-MAKING --  >> I WOULD NOT WORK -- >> THAT IS -- >> DOES NOT HELP. >> Susan: THAT IS ALL THE TIME  WE HAVE. THIS CONCLUDES THE ROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ONTO THE NEXT ONE. [ ♪♪ ] >> Dawna: HELLO. I'M DAWNA FRIESEN. I'M MODERATING THIS SEGMENT ON  AFFORDABILITY AND INCOME  SECURITY. YOU'VE ALL BEEN VIGOROUS IN THE  DEBATE. SOME OF THE COMMENTS A LITTLE  LONG. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRIM A  BIT IN TERMS OF TIME, BUT WE'LL  MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE TRIMS  THERE AND EQUAL. -- FAIR AND EQUAL. MS. MAY, I HAVE A QUESTION TO  YOU. CANADIANS ARE CARRYING TWO  TRILLION DOLLARS OF HOUSEHOLD  DEBT. THAT MEANS THE AVERAGE CANADIAN  OWES ABOUT $1.79 FOR EVERY  DOLLAR OF INCOME. IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS HIGH. WE'RE BORROWING TO LIVE. SOMETHING MY PARENTS TOLD ME WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU HAVE MADE A BOLD PROMISE TO  BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET IN  FIVE YEARS. HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITHOUT  CAUSING FINANCIAL PAIN FOR  CANADIANS AND PUTTING PEOPLE  FURTHER INTO DEBT? WHAT IS THE SINGEST BIGGEST  THING THAT WILL REDUCE HOUSEHOLD DEBT? >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I'M PLEASED THAT WE'RE THE PARTY ON STAGE WITH A FULL PLATFORM. HAVE THE BUDGET NUMBERS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AND APPROVED BY KEVIN PAGE AND THE INSTITUTE FOR  FISCAL STUDIES AND DEMOCRACY. THE WAY TO BRING MORE PUBLIC  SERVICE, TO BRING MORE HELP TO  CANADIANS, CHILD CARE, BANNING  TUITION, INVESTING IN  POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION. PHARMACARE, DENTAL PROGRAMMES  FOR LOW-INCOME CANADIANS. ALL THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MORE  AFFORDABLE IS NOT TO HAVE CUTS,  BUT GO AFTER PLACES WITH  REVENUE. OFFSHORE MONEY THAT IS HIDDEN. FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAX. GOING AFTER PEOPLE WITH MORE  THAN $20 MILLION IN WEALTH. AND A SERIES OF MOVES TO  INCREASE THE REVENUE COMING INTO THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA. NOW THAT IS ALL, OF COURSE,  BASED ON THE CURRENT ECONOMIC  SITUATION. IF WE HIT A RECESSION, WE WOULD  NOT SLAVISHLY OR IDEALOGICALLY  BALANCE THE BOOKS, BUT RIGHT NOW WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A BALANCED  BUDGET IN FIVE YEARS. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): IT IS REALLY A BAD  IDEA TO BORROW TO LIVE. IT IS A NO BETTER IDEA TO CUT  TOO STRONGLY INTO SERVICES TO  PEOPLE THAT MAINLY NEED IT. WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA OF CUTTING  ALL SUBSIDIES TO OIL AS WE  PROPOSED TO DO WITH BRINGING  ALONG ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THAT. HOW ABOUT THIS IDEA WE HAVE  EQUALIZATION, BRING MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT? HOW ABOUT SETTING INTO THOSE  SHELTERS, INCLUDING THE TWO NEW  ONES CREATED BY MR. TRUDEAU? AND WHAT ABOUT TAXING THOSE  GIANTS ON THE WEB THAT STEAL THE MONEY FROM OUR ADVERTISING  COMPANIES? >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  IN OUR PLATFORM, WE CALL FOR  TAXES ON THE E-COMMERCE  COMPANIES, THE VIRTUALS, THE  AMAZON, GOOGLE AND Facebook,  THAT MINE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND PAY  VIRTUALLY NO TAX. WE HAVE TO CUT ALL FOSSIL FUEL  SUBSIDIES. THAT WAS A PROMISE MADE BY MR.  HARPER AND MR. TRUDEAU IN 2015,  BUT THEY'VE INCREASED BECAUSE  WE'RE SUBSIDIZING L.N.G., WHICH  WOULD I LIKE TO HEAR WHERE YOU  ARE ON THAT? AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE GIVING --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): I WAS THE MINISTER  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE --  >> Dawna: MR. TRUDEAU, YOUR  CHANCE TO DEBATE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE MADE A DIFFERENT  DECISION THAN MR. HARPER HAD. WHEN WE DECIDED TO INVEST IN  CANADIANS INSTEAD. THAT DECISION TO INVEST IN THE  MIDDLE CLASS AND PEOPLE WORKING  HARD TO JOIN IT LIFTED 900,000  PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY INCLUDING  300,000 KIDS. WE GAVE MORE SUPPORT FOR  STUDENTS GOING TO SCHOOL. WE MADE MORE SUPPORTS FOR  SENIORS. WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS GROWN OUR  ECONOMY MORE THAN A MILLION NEW  JOBS CREATED, MOST OF THEM  FULL-TIME AT THE SAME TIME WE  HAVE REDUCED POVERTY EXCEEDING  ANY TARGETS. WE'VE DONE THAT IN WAY THAT IS  RESPONSIBLE. THE INTERNATIONAL CREDIT --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  IT WAS 8 SECONDS LESS THAN ME. THE CONCERN I HAVE ABOUT ALL  THESE DEBATES AND A NUMBER OF  LEADERS ON STAGE, WE DON'T HAVE  ANY SECTION ON HEALTH COSTS OR  HEALTH CARE IN THE COURSE OF TWO DEBATES. SO I WANT TO TURN THIS TO THE  AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND HOW MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE LIFE WILL BE FOR CANADIANS WITH FULL UNIVERSAL  SINGLE PAYER PHARMACARE. IT'S IN OUR PLATFORM. IT'S PARTIALLY IN YOURS. IT'S IN MR. SINGH'S. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE'VE TAKEN CONCRETE  ACTIONS TOWARD THAT. LOWERING DRUG PRICES. LOWERING PRICES --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  BUT ARE YOU PREPARED TO ACCEPT  ERIC HOSKINS'S RECOMMENDATIONS? >> Dawna: YOUR CHANCE. >> I LOOK THE AT YOUR PLATFORM,  ELIZABETH, AND YOU KNOW YOU WILL SPEND $60 BILLION. SPENDING WON'T CREATE ANY  WEALTH. YOU CANNOT SPEND YOUR WAY TO  PROSPERITY. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PRIVATE  SECTOR INVESTMENT. AND AT THE END, YOU KNOW, YOU  KNOW THAT OUR NATIONAL CREDIT  CARD IS FULL. WE STILL HAVE DEFICITS. AND MR. TRUDEAU JUST HAD $70  BILLION ON OUR DEBT AND YOU HAD  ANOTHER $60 BILLION ON OUR DEBT. IT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE. OUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO PAY  FOR THAT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  YOUR FAMOUS PRIVATE SECTOR  HAVING GOT MASSIVE TAX CUTS WHEN YOU WERE IN MR. HARPER'S CABINET BASED ON THESE WERE THE CARBON  CREATORS. THEY HAVE NOT INVESTED IN THE  ECONOMY. THEY'RE SITTING ON PILES OF  CASH. MARK CARNEY CALLS IT THE DEAD  MONEY. WE NEED TO GET THAT MONEY INTO  INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS LIKE  A NATIONAL GRID. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): DO  YOU KNOW WHERE WE AGREE? >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  NO PIPELINES, BUT WE NEED AN  ELECTRICITY GRID THAT SERVES THE NEEDS OF EVERY CANADIAN. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  DON'T WANT SUBSIDIES TO THE OIL  AND GAS AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN  SUBSIDIES ALSO IN CAPITAL  AFFAIRS, SO WE CAN AGREE ON  THAT. >> Dawna: MR. SINGH? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WANTED TO SHIFT THE DISCUSSION  TOWARD HEALTH CARE. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST  CONCERNS THAT FAMILIES HAVE. CANADIANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,  THEY CAN'T GET THE MEDICATION  THEY NEED. THEY CAN'T GET THE DENTAL CARE  THEY NEED. I MET A WOMAN IN MY OFFICE IN  BURNABY WHO WAS COVERING HER  MOUTH BECAUSE SHE WAS  EMBARRASSED BECAUSE SHE LOST HER TEETH BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T GET  THE TEETH SHE NEEDED. THAT'S HEARTBREAKING. I KNOW YOU'RE PREPARED TO DO  THIS, BUT THE PROBLEM IS MR.  TRUDEAU DOES NOT HAVE THE  COURAGE TO TAKE ON THE INSURANCE AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYISTS WHO DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IF YOU VOTE NEW DEMOCRAT, WE'RE  GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, BECAUSE WE DON'T WORK FOR THE POWERFUL  AND WEALTHY. WE DON'T MEET WITH  PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND  LISTEN TO THEM. WE WORK FOR YOU, CANADIANS. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I HOPE YOU AGREE WITH ME, WE  NEED TO RENEGOTIATE A NEW HEALTH ACCORD. WE NEED TO GET BACK AT THE  TABLE. THE CONSTITUENTS IN MY RIDING,  EIGHT DEBATES WITH THE LOCAL  CANDIDATES IN THE RIDING, ALL OF YOU GUYS CAN BE PROUD BECAUSE  I'VE BEEN IN EIGHT DEBATES WITH  THEM IN THE LAST WEEK. ONE THING WE HEARD FROM EVERY  CONSTITUENT IN EVERY TOWN HALL,  WE'RE SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF  FAMILY DOCTORS. WE NEED INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH CARE. THE WHEELS ARE FALLING OFF THE  BUS. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): AND  MR. TRUDEAU CONTINUES THE SAME  CUTS BROUGHT IN BY --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT  AFFORDABILITY AND HOUSEHOLD  DEBT. AND THE ENTIRE THEME OF OUR  PLATFORM IS LEAVING MORE MONEY  IN THE POCKETS OF CANADIANS SO  THAT THEY CAN GET AHEAD. IT'S TIME FOR CANADIANS TO HAVE  A BREAK. OUR UNIVERSAL TAX CUT MEANS $850 IN THE POCKET OF HARD-WORKING  AVERAGE-INCOME CANADIAN. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK THE  CHILDREN'S FITNESS TAX CREDIT TO MAKE RAISING CHILDREN FOR  AFFORDABLE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK THE  GREEN PUBLIC TRANSIT CREDIT  MAKING TAKING THE BUS MORE  AFFORDABLE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN THE  GREEN RENOVATION HOME TAX  CREDIT. AND HELP LOWER EMISSIONS. WE'RE GOING --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  COSTS WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE CANADA'S  FOREIGN AID BUDGET BY 25%. SO WE'RE GOING TO STOP SENDING  MONEY TO THE RELATIVELY WELL OFF COUNTRIES, WE'RE GOING TO BRING  THAT HOME SO CANADIANS CAN GET  AHEAD. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  THERE MR. SCHEER, THAT MAY BE  THE WORST IDEA IN YOUR WHOLE  PLATFORM. FOREIGN AID. THIS COUNTRY IS COMMITTED TO  UNITED NATIONS, ENDING POVERTY  WITHIN NEXT DECADE WITHIN CANADA AND GLOBALLY IS POSSIBLE. BUT NOT IF WE EVER HAD THE  MISFORTUNE OF HAVING YOUR GREEDY AND SELFISH POLICIES. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): IT'S NOT GREEDY PUTTING MONEY  INTO THE POCKETS OF CANADIANS. >> Dawna: WE'LL HEAR FROM  ANOTHER CANADIAN ON THE THEME OF AFFORDABILITY. ONE OF THE MANY PLACES CANADIANS ARE WATCHING, YELLOWKNIFE,  NORTHWEST TERRITORIES. HERE THE COPPER HOUSE  RESTAURANT. EARLIER WE HEARD A QUESTION ON  AFFORDABILITY FROM SCOTT  MARSDEN. >> HI, MY NAME IS SCOTT MARSDEN  FROM YELLOWKNIFE. MY QUESTION IS, WHAT IS YOUR  GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO WITH  INCOME INEQUALITY AND  AFFORDABILITY IN CANADA? >> Dawna: MS. MAY? >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I'VE BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT. HELLO, YELLOWKNIFE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE MUST ASK FOR INCOME EQUALITY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OVER THE  YEARS, THE GAP BETWEEN THE  WEALTHIEST CANADIANS AND AVERAGE CANADIANS CONTINUE TO EXPAND. WE'RE CALLING FOR A TAX  COMMISSION. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PROPER TAX  COMMISSION SINCE THE 1960s TO  EXAMINE OUR TAX CODE. TO FIND OUT IF ALL THE CUTS THAT ARE PILED UP ONE AFTER THE OTHER AFTER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS IS  TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM THOSE  CANADIANS WHO NEED IT MOST AND  ALLOWING THOSE WITH MASSIVE  INCOME, AS MANY AUDITOR GENERALS HAVE FOUND, TO BE TREATED WITH  SPECIAL STATUS AND DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): FIRST, I MUST SAY  THAT, IF SAYING TWO THINGS AT  THE END OF TIME, IS YOUR WAY TO  DO THINGS, IT MIGHT BE DONE  ALREADY. HOWEVER, ABOUT THE ISSUE. IF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS TO  RESPECT JURISDICTION OF  PROVINCES, IT WOULD TAKE LESS  TIME. IT WOULD COST LESS MONEY. AND PROVINCES IN QUÉBEC WHO DO  WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO ABOUT  HEALTH CARE. OWED TO QUÉBEC AND PROVINCES. THIS IS WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. THE MONEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO  PROVINCES IN QUÉBEC BECAUSE IT  IS MOSTLY -- IT'S NOT ONLY THEIR JURISDICTION. THAT HELPS PEOPLE. >> Dawna: MR. TRUDEAU. THE QUESTION IS ABOUT INCOME  INEQUALITY AND WHAT YOU WOULD  DO? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE  NEED TO HELP PEOPLE MORE  DIRECTLY. THAT'S WHY THE FIRST THING WE  DID WAS LOWER TAXES FOR THE  MIDDLE CLASS AND RAISE THEM ON  THE WEALTHY 1%. WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. NOTHING FOR THE WEALTHIEST,  UNLIKE MR. SCHEER'S UNIVERSAL  TAX CREDIT. WE'RE ALSO MOVING FORWARD  INCREASING THE CHILD BENEFIT  WHICH LIFTED HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OUT OF POVERTY. BY 15% FOR IT'S OVER ONE. OLD AGE SECURITY FOR SENIOR OVER 75. WE'RE MAKING SURE STUDENTS HAVE  AN EASIER TIME BACK THEIR  STUDENT DEBT. WE'RE INVESTING IN CANADIANS. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT IS  IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A  DISCUSSION WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR CANADIANS. WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT WILL  BALANCE THE BUDGET IN TWO YEARS. ALL THE OTHER PARTIES ON THIS  STAGE WILL SPEND AND SPEND AND  SPEND. THAT IS NOT A SOLUTION. WE WILL DO THAT WITHOUT CUTTING  SERVICES. WE WILL CUT CORPORATE WELFARE. ALL THE CORPORATE WELFARE. $5 BILLION THAT WE CAN SAVE  THERE. ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE  ONLY PROMISE THEY DO, THEY DO  EVERYTHING TO GET YOUR VOTE AND  PROMISE YOU TO DO NOTHING EXCEPT BALANCING THE BUDGET. AFTER THAT, LOWER YOUR TAXES. THAT'S THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE  POLICY. >> Dawna: MR. SINGH? >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  WANT TO THANK SCOTT FOR THE  QUESTION. INCOME INEQUALITY IS MASSIVE. THERE IS MASSIVE WEALTH  INQUALITY. WHEN 87 FAMILIES IN CANADA HAVE  THE COMBINED WEALTH OF THREE  PROVINCES, IT HURTS FAMILIES. IT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE FUNDS TO  INVEST IN HEALTH CARE, TO INVEST IN DENTAL CARE. WHILE MR. TRUDEAU LIKES TO TALK  A NICE GAME, HE SAYS NICE WORDS, BUT WHAT HE'S DONE IS GIVEN $14  BILLION TO THE RICHEST  CORPORATIONS TO BUY PRIVATE JETS AND LIMOUSINES. WE WOULD, INSTEAD, INVEST IN  PEOPLE, ASK THE SUPER WEALTHY TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND INVEST  IN PROGRAMMES TO RELIEVE THE  COST ON FAMILIES. >> Dawna: MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MR. TRUDEAU HAS HIS FACTS WRONG  AGAIN. OUR UNIVERSAL TAX CUT  DRASTICALLY IS MUCH BETTER FOR  MIDDLE INCOME CANADIANS THAN HIS PROPOSAL. AND HE THINKS THAT SOMEONE  EARNING $47,000 A YEAR IS  SOMEHOW TOO RICH FOR A TAX CUT. I DISAGREE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO TEAR PEOPLE DOWN TO LIFT  OTHERS UP. JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S ATTACK ON SMALL BUSINESSES, THREATENING THEM,  MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO  GROW AND EXPAND AND OFFER THE  TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT LEAD TO THE JOBS THAT HAVE MUCH  HIGHER INCOME EARNINGS WAS  PRECISELY PART OF THE PROBLEM  OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, ALL  THE WHILE PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO  INHERITED TRUST FUNDS. WE'LL TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. WE'LL ENSURE THAT ENTREPRENEURS  HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO  GROW AND SUCCEED. >> Dawna: WE'RE GOING TO MOVE  ON. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE BLOC  QUEBECOIS LEADER, YVES-FRANCOIS  BLANCHET. AFTER WHICH, EACH ONE OF THE  LEADERS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO  DEBATE HIM. QUÉBEC IS ONE OF FIVE PROVINCES  TO RECEIVE EQUALIZATION  PAYMENTS. IT RECEIVED $13.1 BILLION, THE  HIGHEST OF ANY PROVINCE. THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF A FEDERAL  SYSTEM WHERE WEALTH IS SHARED. YOU REFERRED TO THE MONEY AS  ASSISTANCE CHEQUE. PREMIER LEGAULT SAID HE WANTS TO WEAN QUÉBEC OFF EQUALIZATION  PAYMENTS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? AND HOW WOULD THAT MAKE LIFE  MORE AFFORDABLE FOR CANADIANS? >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): THANK YOU FOR THE  QUESTION. FIRST, THE SYSTEM CALLED  EQUALIZATION IS BASED ON SOME  FLAWED REASONINGS. WAYS TOENLIZE THINGS. AND -- ANALYZE THINGS. THIS IS WHY WE PROPOSE SOMETHING ELSE THAT WOULD REPLACE IT. OIL PROVINCES ARE VERY WEALTHY  AND THOSE RESOURCES WITH MONEY  FROM ALL ACROSS CANADA,  INCLUDING QUÉBEC. AND TODAY, WE ARE USING IT AS A  THREAT OVER QUÉBEC, WHICH  CITIZENS DO NOT WANT TO BE A  PASSAGE FOR THIS OIL THROUGH  THEIR TERRITORY, BECAUSE THEY  RELY ON CLEAN ENERGY AND BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE WAY TO DO THINGS. WE PROPOSE A KIND OF  EQUALIZATION THAT WOULD BE BASED WITHOUT ANY CONSTITUTION CHANGE  ON HOW PROVINCES ARE FORMED IN  FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. THOSE WHO ARE OVER AVERAGE PAY  THOSE UNDER THE AVERAGE, RECEIVE THE MONEY, GIVING A STRONG  ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EVERYBODY TO  REDUCE THE GHG EMISSIONS. >> Dawna: THANK YOU. THE LEADERS WILL HAVE A CHANCE  TO DEBATE THIS ONE ON ONE. BEGINNING WITH YOU, MR. TRUDEAU. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THANK YOU. EQUALIZATION EXISTS SO EVERY  CANADIAN ACROSS THE COUNTRY,  REGARDLESS OF PROVINCE, ACCESSES THE SAME QUALITY OF SERVICES  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM, BUT  A SYSTEM THAT ENSURES EQUALITY  OF OPPORTUNITY ACROSS CANADA. WE'VE CONTINUED TO ENGAGE WITH  PROVINCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON  UPDATING THE EQUALIZATION  FORMULA IN WAYS THAT ARE FAIR. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT  CONTINUES TO BIND THIS COUNTRY  TOGETHER. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU, MR.  BLANCHET, AS A SOVEREIGNTIST,  LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE FIGHTS BETWEEN QUÉBEC AND THE  REST OF CANADA TO ADVANCE  YOURSELF. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): WE HAVE ALL OF  WESTERN CANADA AND YOU MAKE US  PAY AGAIN WITH THE IDEA OF  BUYING A PIPELINE OVER THERE. AND TELL ME SOMETHING, WHAT CAN  CANADIANS DO THAT A QUÉBECER  CANNOT DO? WHY WOULD WE NEED --  >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): BY DEFINITION, A  QUÉBECER CAN DO ANYTHING A  CANADIAN CAN DO, BECAUSE A  QUÉBECER IS A CANADIAN AND WILL  REMAIN A CANADIAN UNDER MY  WATCH. >> Dawna: MR. BERNIER. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  SPEAKING ABOUT THE EQUALIZATION  AND THE ONLY LEADER WHO IS READY TO LOOK AT THE EQUALIZATION  FORMULA FOR BEING SURE THAT THE  FORMULA WILL BE LESS GENEROUS  AND FAIR FOR EVERY PROVINCE. LET ME EXPLAIN. IT IS NOT FAIR TO TAX THE PEOPLE OUT WITH AND ALSO IN QUÉBEC,  BECAUSE QUÉBECERS, YOU KNOW, ARE PROUD. THEY WANT TO LIVE IN A RICHER  PROVINCE. SO WHAT WE MUST DO IS GIVE THE  RIGHT INCENTIVE TO PROVINCES TO  THEIR OWN RESOURCES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A  DISCUSSION ABOUT EQUALIZATION. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE  DISCUSSION. LET'S BE FAIR FOR EVERYBODY. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU SHARE THIS  IDEA --  >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): IT  IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU HAVE  PEOPLE IN ALBERTA, 20% OF PEOPLE IN ALBERTA WANT TO HAVE THE  DISCUSSION. AND THEN --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): QUÉBECERS RECEIVE  LESS MONEY FOR EQUALIZATION PER  CAPITA THAN ANYBODY ELSE  RECEIVES IT IN CANADA. DO YOU MIND ABOUT STOPPING THOSE LINES. >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO  MAKE LIFE MORE AFFORDABLE. THIS IS WHERE WE CAN DO A LOT IF WE WORK TOGETHER. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS, WE  CAN BUILD A BETTER CANADA IF WE  TACKLE CHALLENGES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT  IN QUÉBEC IS THE COST OF HEALTH  CARE THAT IS NOT THERE WHEN THEY NEED IT. THE UNIVERSAL PHARMACARE PLAN WE USE THE BUYING POWER OF ALL  CANADIANS, IT'S DELIVERED  PROVINCIALLY, WE CAN BUY  MEDICATION FOR -- >> IT IS DELIVERED PROVINCIALLY. AND DENTAL CARE WOULD BE, IF WE  WANTED TO PROVINCIAL  JURISDICTION. YOU HAVE GOOD IDEAS, BUT YOUR  IDEAS ALWAYS INTERFERE AND  INFRINGE INTO JURISDICTIONS  WHICH ARE THOSE -- IF YOU WANT  TO DO THAT, DO IT FOR CANADA. TAKE PART OF THE MONEY AS THE  CONSTITUTION ALLOWS. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): WE  CAN DO THAT AND WORK TOGETHER. THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO DO IS TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF HOUSING. HOUSING IS CONCERNING PEOPLE. FEDERAL MONEY USED TO BE  INVESTED IN BUILDING AND  PARTNERSHIPS WITH PROVINCES TO  BUILD HOUSING. WE WANT DO THAT AGAIN. >> Dawna: MR. SCHEER. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE KEEP  GETTING US MIXED UP. I'M WEARING AN ORANGE SHIRT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I'M SLIGHTLY TALLER THAN YOU. ON SO MANY ISSUES, YVES-FRANCOIS BLANCHET AGREES WITH JUSTIN  TRUDEAU. HE WILL SUPPORT JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S HIGHER TAXES, MASSIVE DEFICITS  THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUT  PRESSURE ON CANADIAN TAXPAYERS. MANY MORE OF THEIR DOLLAR TO PAY THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT. AND  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): WITHOUT RAISING  TAXES, SO YOU DIDN'T LISTEN OR  UNDERSTAND. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE KNOW THAT MR. BLANCHET'S  PRIORITY IS WORKING WITH THE  BLOC QUEBECOIS ON SOVEREIGNTY. WE KNOW IF VOTES FOR THE BLOC  QUEBECOIS M.P.s MEAN THAT JUSTIN TRUDEAU STAYS PRIME MINISTER,  THE [Speaking French] --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): REMEMBER THAT ALL  THOSE THAT YOU SAY THAT YOU DID  FOR QUÉBECERS WAS DONE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): HIS OIL AND GAS FROM THE UNITED  STATES. YOU PREFER SPENDING MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THAT ECONOMY. I PREFER CANADIAN ENERGY. >> Dawna: YOU TALKED OVER EACH  OTHER AND YOU'RE BOTH OUT OF  TIME. MS. MAY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  FORGIVE ME, BUT I SEE YOU,  CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING ELECTED M.L.A. WE NEED EQUALIZATION IN CANADA. WE'RE A COUNTRY, WE'RE A FAMILY. YOUR PROPOSAL MR. BLANCHET WOULD BE TO PUT EXTRA BURDEN ON THOSE  PARTS OF CANADA, LIKE ALBERTA  THAT, HAVE THE TOUGHEST  CHALLENGE TO MEET THE CLIMATE  CRISIS. WE'RE CONCERNED AS GREENS THAT  WE WORK TOGETHER. THAT WE NOT ALIENATE ALBERTA. >> I NOTICE YOU HAVE TO STRONG  SENSE WITH ALBERTA SINCE YOUR  PREVIOUS POSITIONS ON OIL IS  NICE TO THEM. >> THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN THE  OILSANDS BY 2030. >> A FAMILY DOESN'T AGREE WITH  OTHERS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE  FORCED DO WHAT OTHERS SAY. >> WE'RE FACING A CLIMATE  EMERGENCY -- >> THIS IS A WORLD, AND COUNTRY, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, PROVINCES DON'T. >> Dawna: ALL RIGHT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WE HAVE TO PULL OUR WEIGHT AS  PROVINCES AND NATIONS AND WE DO  IT TOGETHER. >> Dawna: WE WILL END THE  SEGMENT. YVES-FRANCOIS BLANCHET, YOU CAN  ASK ANY OTHER LEADER ON A TOPIC  OF YOUR CHOICE. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): HMM. MR. SCHEER, YOU SAID IN ENGLISH  A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT YOU WERE  STRONGLY AGAINST THE IDEA OF  BILL 21. THEN YOU SAID IN FRENCH IN  EFFECT THAT YOU WOULD DO NOTHING AGAINST THAT -- IN FRENCH THAT  YOU WOULD DO NOTHING. BUT YOUR CLOSE DELIBERATER,  SAID, THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY  THAT YOU WOULD PROTECT THE BILL  21. YOU SAID THAT IN FRENCH. I ADMIT, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE  THAT WOULD PROTECT THE BILL --  >> Dawna: CAN YOU GET TO THE  QUESTION. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): HOW WILL YOU DO  THAT? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE. I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ON THE  ISSUE. WE WILL NOT INTERVENE IN THE  COURT CASE THAT IS CURRENTLY  BEFORE THE COURTS. THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OF QUÉBEC  HAVE TAKEN THE DECISION AND IT'S BEFORE --  >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): I ACCEPT THAT. THAT IS PROTECTING --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I ALWAYS SAID IN ENGLISH AND  FRENCH, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT A  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPECTS AND  PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES  AND INDIVIDUAL HUMAN RIGHTS. WE WILL NOT PURSUE THIS COURT OF ACTION AT A FEDERAL LEVEL. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOUR JURISDICTION -- >> Dawna: MR. SCHEER HAS THE  LAW. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): IT'S SIMPLE. IT'S THE SAME THING IN FRENCH. WE WILL NOT INTERVENE IN THE  COURT CASE. THE COURT CASE WILL DECIDE THIS  >> IT'S THE SAME POSITION, MR.  BLANCHET. YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE  CONFUSION WHERE IT DOESN'T  EXIST. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): DOES NOT MEAN YOU  WILL PROTECT IT. I WILL PROTECT IT. >> Dawna: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OPEN DEBATE. THAT WAS MR. SCHEER'S TIME TO  ANSWER. WE WILL NOW HAVE THE OPEN  DEBATE. MR. BLANCHET, YOU MAY BEGIN. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): OKAY. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): CAN I SPEAK NOW BECAUSE YOU  SPOKE DURING MINE? THE ISSUE ON THIS HAS BEEN  EXACTLY THE SAME FROM THE  BEGINNING. YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE  CONFUSION WHERE IT DOESN'T  EXIST. I'VE BEEN CLEAR IN ENGLISH AND  FRENCH, THE ANSWERS HAVE BEEN  THE SAME. THIS IS SOMETHING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE WILL NOT PURSUE. THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS  ALWAYS STOOD FOR INDIVIDUAL  LIBERTY, FUNDAMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS. IT WAS CONSERVATIVE PRIME  MINISTER THAT BROUGHT FORWARD  THE BILL OF RIGHTS.   THE LAST TESTIMONY FROM  SASKATCHEWAN, DIEFENBAKER. >> YOU WON'T DEFEND A WOMAN'S  RIGHT TO CHOOSE. LGBTQ PROTECTION. YOU HAVEN'T APOLOGIZED FOR YOUR  WORDS AGAINST LGBT CANADIANS  YEARS AGO. WILL YOU RECOGNIZE AND  APOLOGIZE? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): MILLIONS OF CANADIANS HAVE A  DIFFERENT ON THIS ISSUE. LIKE MANY CANADIANS I'M  PRO-LIFE. IT'S OKAY IN THIS COUNTRY TO  HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. SOMETHING YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): CANADIANS NEED TO  KNOW THAT THEIR PRIME MINISTER  --  >> Dawna: ONE AT A TIME, PLEASE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): HAVE NOT CHANGED FOR 30 YEARS,  UNDER LIBERAL PRIME MINISTERS,  CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTERS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE KNOW THEIR PRIME  MINISTER WILL BE THERE TO DEFEND THEM. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU JUST ANSWERED THE QUESTION. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): UNEQUIVOCAL, YOU'RE  NOT ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS. YOU'RE SIGNING PAPERS OF PEOPLE  WHO WANT TO TALK AWAY -- >> YOUR MISOGYNIST CANDIDATE IN  NOVA SCOTIA? >> Dawna: NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT  YOU'RE SAYING ANYMORE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE WILL BE SIGNING  THE NOMINATION --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): NO WAY -- >> THE RIGHT. >> Dawna: I KNOW. YOU'RE HAVING A MINI DEBATE OVER HERE. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): NO  POSITION ON A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO  CHOOSE. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ON THAT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  IT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING FOR THE CAMPAIGN TO HEAR A LOT OF  MEN ARGUING ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT SHOULD BE, BUT HAVING ALL  OF YOU, EXCEPT MAX, PARTICIPATE  IN THE TVA DEBATE WHERE YOU WERE HAPPY TO KEEP WOMEN OFF THE  STAGE, YOU PARTICIPATED IN A  DEBATE THAT DID NOT LET OUR  LITTLE GIRLS SEE THERE IS A  CHANCE FOR A WOMAN IN THE  COUNTRY TO BE A PRIME MINISTER,  TO RUN AS A LEADER OF A PARTY. WE MUST BE CLEAR AS ALL LEADERS, AND YOU'RE NOT CLEAR, ANDREW,  THAT WE WILL NEVER ALLOW A  SINGLE INCH OF RETREAT FROM THE  HARD-EARNED RELATES OF WOMEN  IN -- RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THIS  COUNTRY, NOT ONE INCH. >> MEANS YOU'RE OPEN TO WORKING  WITH MR. SCHEER AND -- >> YOUR OWN M.P.s COULD COME UP  WITH A LAW AGAINST ABORTION AND  YOU SAID YOU WOULD TOLERATE IT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I SAID I DON'T ALLOW ANYONE TO  RUN IN THE PARTY THAT -- >> THEY ARE ENDANGERING THE  DECISION. >> Dawna: THIS NEEDS MORE TIME. I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE MORE  TIME. MS. MAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE ON. THANK YOU. THAT CONCLUDES OUR SEGMENT. [ ♪♪ ] >> Rosemary: HI, EVERYONE. I'M ROSEMARY BARTON FROM CBC  NEWS. OUR NEXT SCENE, WE'VE TALKED  ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT, THE  THEME, ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY. WE WILL START WITH A QUESTION  FROM ANOTHER CANADIAN. A GATHERING OF PEOPLE WATCHING  THE DEBATE AT THE HALIFAX  CENTRAL LIBRARY. WE'LL TALK TO BRITTAIN BANCROFT  OF MINTO, NEW BRUNSWICK AND HAS  THIS QUESTION. >> HI, I'M FROM MINTO NEW  BRUNSWICK. I BELIEVE WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF  CLIMATE CRISIS. THIS IS THE LAST ELECTION WE  HAVE BEFORE NO POINT OF RETURN. I BELIEVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF  FINES AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED  WITH POLLUTING IS JUST THE COST  OF DOING BUSINESS. WHAT CONCRETE PLANS DOES EACH  LEADER HAVE TO ADDRESS BIG  BUSINESS POLLUTING? >> Rosemary: THANK YOU. THE FIRST ANSWER TO  YVES-FRANCOIS BLANCHET. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): THAT IS VERY  INTERESTING. WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE SO FAR,  IS THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN  CALIFORNIA AND QUÉBEC. THIS TRADE EXCHANGE SYSTEM THAT  FORCES BUSINESSES TO LOWER THEIR EMISSION THROUGH TIME. AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. I WAS -- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF  COMPLETING THE NEGOTIATIONS OF  SUCH A SYSTEM. AND SIGNING IT. AND IT SHOULD BE USED ELSEWHERE. SIMPLE TAXES THAT RETURN INTO  THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT  ANY CHANGE. INCENTIVE ARE NOT THE SOLUTION. DOING NOTHING, HOPING THAT SOME  SPIRIT WILL COME AND SOLVE THE  PROBLEM. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): AS MR. BLANCHET SAID, QUÉBEC AND OTHER PROVINCES B.C.  HAVE MOVED FORWARD PUTTING A  PRICE ON POLLUTION. WE ENSURED THAT PRICE IS PUT IN  ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT IS A MECHANISM THAT WILL BOTH LOWER EMISSIONS AND ENSURE THAT  CANADIANS CAN AFFORD THIS  TRANSITION. THE CHOICE TONIGHT IS VERY CLEAR BETWEEN TWO PARTIES THAT HAVE  VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON CLIMATE  CHANGE. MR. SCHEER WANTS TO RIP UP THE  ONLY SERIOUS PLAN ON CLIMATE  CHANGE CANADA HAS EVER HAD. THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO MORE. WE RECOGNIZE, WE NEED TO DO MORE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SURPASSING OUR  TARGETS AND GETTING TO NET ZERO  BY 2050. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): WE  ARE THE ONLY REAL  ENVIRONMENTALIST PARTY. WHY? BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO THINGS  THAT ARE POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH, OUR ENVIRONMENT, OUR  WATER. ALL THE OTHER LEADERS CLAIM TO  SAVE THE WORLD AND SO SAVE  THE -- TO SAVE THE CLIMATE. THEY CANNOT. CANADA ONLY REPRESENTS 1.6% OF  THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THEY CLAIM ALSO TO BE ABLE TO  ACHIEVE THE PARIS ACCORD TARGET. THEY CANNOT. THEY HAVE TO IMPOSE A CARBON TAX OF $300 A TONNE TO DO THAT. AND THEY WON'T DO IT. THEY DON'T DO IT. THEY'RE HYPOCRITE. WE WON'T HAVE A TAX ON CARBON. >> Rosemary: TIME IS UP. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, BRIT, FOR THE  QUESTION. WE'RE FACED WITH A CLIMATE  CRISIS, THERE IS NO QUESTION  ABOUT IT. MASSIVE FOREST FIRES WHICH MAKE  IT HARD TO BREATHE IN PARTS OF  CANADA. IN THE WEST. WE'VE GOT MASSIVE FLOODING,  MEANING PEOPLE ARE LOSING HOMES  IN THE EAST. THIS IS A SERIOUS CRISIS. WHILE MR. TRUDEAU HAS SAID A LOT OF NICE THINGS, LOOK AT WHAT  HE'S DONE. HE SAID HE'S FOR THE  ENVIRONMENT, BUT HE CONTINUES TO EXEMPT THE BIGGEST POLLUTERS  FROM PRICE ON POLLUTION. HE WANTS TO FIGHTS THE CLIMATE  CRISIS? HE SUBSIDIZES OIL AND GAS AND  MASSIVELY. HE BUYS A PIPELINE. THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN WHAT  MR. TRUDEAU SAYS AND WHAT HE  DOES. >> Rosemary: AND MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I FIND MYSELF AGREEING WITH YOU  AGAIN, MR. SINGH, ON THE  ENVIRONMENT LIKE SO MANY ISSUES, JUSTIN TRUDEAU SAYS ONE THING  AND THEN DOES SOMETHING  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HE'S TALKING ABOUT HITTING 2050  TARGETS. HE CAN'T EVEN MEET 2030 TARGETS. HE TALKS ABOUT RIPPING UP A REAL PLAN. HIS PLAN HAS BEEN PROVEN TO  FAIL. HE HAS GIVEN A MASSIVE EXEMPTION TO THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST  POLLUTERS. THEY WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE  THEMSELVES UP TO A 90% EXEMPTION FROM HIS CARBON TAX. MEANWHILE, HARD-WORKING,  COMMUTERS, MOMS AND DADS TAKING  THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL OR DRIVING  WORK, THEY HAVE TO PAY THE FULL  BRUNT OF THAT. OUR PLAN IS A REAL PLAN THAT  TAKES THE CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT  GLOBAL. RECOGNIZING THAT WE COULD  SHUT --  >> Rosemary: THAT'S IT, DROPPING THE HAMMER. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  BRIT, THANK YOU FOR THE  QUESTION. YOU, UNLIKE EVERYONE ELSE ON THE STAGE, CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WE'RE  UP AGAINST A REAL CLIMATE  EMERGENCY. THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON  CLIMATE CHANGE HAS GIVEN US HARD TIME LINES, CHALLENGING TARGETS. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT IS  REQUIRED, IT ISN'T EASY. WE DON'T GRADE ON A CURVE AND  SAY BECAUSE A PLAN IS LESS AM  BISHOPS, IT'S -- AMBITIOUS, IT'S MORE DOABLE. IF IT FAILS TO MEET THE GOAL OF  HOLDING THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE  TO 1.5°, WE FAIL TO GIVE OUR  KIDS A LIVABLE WORLD. GRETA THUNBERG IS RIGHT. THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE. KIDS GET TO SAFETY. WE'VE GOT THIS. >> Rosemary: MY TURN FOR A  QUESTION. THIS ONE TO MR. TRUDEAU. LAST FALL THE UNITED NATIONS  INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON CLIMATE  CHANGE STRESSED THE NEED TO ACT  QUICKLY TO LIMIT FURTHER GLOBAL  WARMING. A REPORT FROM ENVIRONMENT CANADA SAYS THIS COUNTRY IS WARMING  TWICE AS FAST AS THE GLOBAL  AVERAGE. YOU SAY YOU ARE COMMITTED TO  COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT YOUR GOVERNMENT STILL  PROCEEDED WITH THE PURCHASE AND  APPROVAL OF A NEW PIPELINE TO  THE WEST COAST. GIVEN THE TIME LINE, AND GIVEN  WHAT IS AT STAKE, SHOULD CANADA  NOT BE MOVING MORE QUICKLY AWAY  FROM FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OF THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR AND TO THAT  END, SHOULD THE TRANS MOUNTAIN  EXPANSION BE CANADA'S LAST  PIPELINE? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO MOVE FAST AND DO MORE. THAT'S WHY WE PURPORT AN  AMBITIOUS PLAN TO CONTINUE THAT  IS REASONABLE, THAT IS DOABLE  AND IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT  WE GET TO NOT JUST SURPASS OUR  2030 TARGETS, BUT GO BEYOND IT. WE'RE BANNING SINGLE-USE  PLASTICS. PUT A PRICE ON CARBON. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TRANSITION TO  CLEAN ENERGY WILL NOT HAPPEN  OVERNIGHT. WHILE WE DO, WE SHOULD HAVE LESS OIL BY RAIL AND WE NEED TO GET  TO NEW MARKETS SO WE CAN INVEST  ALL THE RESOURCES, ALL THE MONEY COMING IN FROM THIS PIPELINE. INTO THAT GREEN ENERGY  TRANSITION, INTO FIGHTING  CLIMATE CHANGE. I KNOW THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF THE WAY WE MOVE FORWARD. HOW WE INVEST IN THE NEW  ECONOMY, IN THAT TRANSITION. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. THE CHOICE TONIGHT IS DO WE PICK A GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T  BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE? OR IN FIGHTING IT? OR DO WE CONTINUE ON THE TRACK  WE ARE? >> Rosemary: GOT TO END THERE. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE LAST PART  OF THE QUESTION, WHETHER WE'RE  ON THE LAST PIPELINE. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): WE  AGREE WE DON'T AGREE ON CLIMATE  CHANGE, MR. TRUDEAU. I BELIEVE THERE IS NO CLIMATE  EMERGENCY. YOU BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE. BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE PARIS ACCORD TARGET. I'M NOT SAYING THAT. THAT IS THE U.N. THAT SAID THAT. YOU NEED TO IMPOSE CARBON TAX OF $300 A TONNE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): IN FOUR YEARS, WE  GOT --  >> Rosemary: MR. TRUDEAU, LET  MR. BERNIER. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.):  YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE HAS A RADICAL  PLAN TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, IT WILL DESTROY THE ECONOMY, BUT  WHAT ABOUT YOU? >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY TO REACHING THE 2030  TARGETS, BY PLANTING 2 BILLION  TREES, WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, WHAT  MR. SCHEER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND,  YOU CANNOT BUILD A PLAN FOR THE  FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY IN YOU ARE NOT BUILDING A PLAN THAT  PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND  FIGHTS CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT'S WHERE BOTH OF YOU ARE  COMPLETELY LONG. >> Rosemary: MR. SCHEER, NOT  YOUR TURN. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): I  KNOW YOU SAY A LOT OF NICE  THINGS, A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ON THE STAGE. BUT YOU SAID A LOT OF THESE  THINGS IN 2015. YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE YOU WERE  GOING TO MAKE CLIMATE A BIG  PRIORITY. BUT YOU DID ALL THESE THINGS. YOU BOUGHT A PIPELINE. YOU CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE OIL  AND GAS. WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE NOW SO  THAT CANADIANS CAN BELIEVE IN  YOUR PROMISES? YOUR WORDS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE HAVE REACHED THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY OF ACHIEVING OUR 2030 TARGETS. CANADIANS MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO  DISCOVER THAT YOUR PLAN IS TO  BUILD A MASSIVE REFINERY IN  ALBERTA. AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS  WITH FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BECAUSE  THERE IS NO PRIVATE BUSINESS  CASE FOR IT. YOUR PLAN TO BUILD A REFINERY IN ALBERTA IS WORSE --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THAT  IS NOT OUR PLAN. THAT IS NOWHERE IN OUR  COMMITMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THAT  FROM. WE WOULD END FOSSIL FUEL  SUBSIDIES. >> Rosemary: THAT'S TIME. MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WHEN JUSTIN TRUDEAU TOOK OFFICE, THERE WERE THREE MAJOR PIPELINE  PROJECTS READY TO GO. UNDER HIS WATCH, ALL OF THEM  HAVE FAILED. HE HAD TO TAKE $4.5 BILLION OF  CANADIAN TAX MONEY TO PUT THE  TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE ON LIFE  SUPPORT. AND HE DID THAT BY SENDING $4.5  BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO  ANOTHER COUNTRY, TO THE UNITED  STATES, TO BE INVESTED IN THE  OIL AND GAS SECTOR THERE INSTEAD OF HERE IN CANADA. HIS ANSWER, OR HIS RATIONALE FOR HAVING TWO CAMPAIGN PLANES, HE  BOUGHT CARBON OFFSETS. WHICH IS JUST A THING THAT  PRIVILEGED PEOPLE CAN DO. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): NO. >> Rosemary: MR. SCHEER, IT IS  MR. TRUDEAU'S CHANCE TO RESPOND. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): YOU DID NOT BUY  CARBON OFFSETS, BECAUSE YOU  DON'T BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE --  AND YOUR PLAN IS TO RIP UP THE  ONLY SERIOUS PLAN TO FIGHT  CLIMATE CHANGE THAT CANADA HAS  EVER HAD. >> Rosemary: MS. MAY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC LEVELS OF  GLOBAL WARMING, WE MUST DOUBLE  OUR CURRENT TARGET. WE MUST LISTEN TO SCIENCE. WE MUST NOT BUILD THE TRANS  MOUNTAIN PIPELINE. IT'S NOT THE LAST BECAUSE IT  GETS CANCELLED. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH  PHYSICS. AS PRIME MINISTER, YOU CAN'T AS  LIBERAL LEADER OF THE PARTY. THERE IS A CARBON BUDGET. IT DOESN'T BUDGE. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING TO LOOK AT YOU TODAY AND KNOW  YOU COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH  MORE. PLEASE, GOD, YOU DON'T GET A  MAJORITY, BECAUSE YOU WON'T KEEP YOUR PROMISE. >> FROM THE ROCKIES TO THE BAY  OF FUNDY, THEY'VE GOTTEN ELECTED ON DOING NOTHING ABOUT CLIMATE  CHANGE AND WE NEED TO FIGHT THEM ON MOVING FORWARD PROTECTING THE FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM THE  CLIMATE CHANGE. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  YOU'RE A TARGET FOR FAILURE. WHEN YOU HANG ON THE HARPER  TARGET -- YOU NEVER GET TO  CARBON NEUTRALITY. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU CLAIM TO HAVE  DONE A LOT, BUT CANADA IS THE  WORST EMITTER OF GHG IN THE G20  PER CAPITA. SO THAT'S NOT MUCH OF SUCCESS. BUT I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FROM  QUÉBEC. FIRST, WE AGREE WITH THE DEMAND  OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF QUÉBEC, LEGAULT, QUÉBEC REVIEW OF THE  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL HAVE  CANADA REVIEW. SECOND QUESTION, DO YOU PROMISE  AFTER THIS JUDGMENT IN BRITISH  COLUMBIA, TO NOT EVER TRY TO  HAVE A PIPELINE TRUST QUÉBEC,  EVER? >> AFTER 10 YEARS OF MR. HARP'S  FAILURE TO GET THINGS BUILT,  BECAUSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND  YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH LOCAL  COMMUNITIES, INDIGENOUS  COMMUNITIES, WE WORK WITH THE  PROVINCES ON ENSURING THERE IS  NOT DUPLICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL OVERSIGHT. WE KNOW THAT THE WAY WE MOVE  FORWARD IS RESPONSIBLE AND WILL  BE DONE. >> Rosemary: THAT'S TIME. MR. TRUDEAU, YOUR CHANCE TO ASK  A QUESTION OF ANY OTHER LEADER. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE CUT TAXES FOR  SMALL BUSINESSES TO 9%. WE CUT TAXES FOR CANADIANS. WE KNOW THAT TAX BREAKS FOR  WEALTHY DO NOT WORK TO GROW THE  ECONOMY. TEN YEARS OF MR. HARPER'S  FAILURE HAS DONE THAT. YET, MR. SCHEER'S PLATFORM, WHAT WE'VE SEEN OF IT, BECAUSE MOST  OF IT IS STILL SECRET AND WILL  REMAIN SECRET, LIKE DOUG FORD,  THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR  ONTARIANS, IS TO REDUCE TAXES  FOR THE WEALTHIEST CANADIANS BY  $50,000, WHICH IS MORE MONEY --  >> Rosemary: WRAP IT UP. MR. SCHEER, ONE MINUTE TO  RESPOND. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE ODDLY  OBSESSED WITH PROVINCIAL  POLITICS. THERE IS A VACANCY FOR THE  ONTARIO LIBERAL LEADERSHIP. IF YOU'RE SO FOCUSED ON  PROVINCIAL POLITICS, GO AND RUN  FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT  PARTY, MR. TRUDEAU. SECONDLY, YOUR TAX POLICY HAS  MEANT THAT 80% OF CANADIAN  FAMILIES PAY HIGHER TAXES TODAY  THAN WHEN YOU FIRST TOOK OFFICE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THAT IS NOT TRUE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT WAS A CONSERVATIVE  PRINCIPLE THAT LIBERALS FOUGHT  AGAINST, THAT YOU FOUGHT AGAIN. YOUR SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT WAS  TAKING A CONSERVATIVE IDEA. I VOTED AGAINST YOUR TAX HIKES  ON CANADIANS. >> YOU VOTED AGAINST THE CHILD  BENEFIT. >> Rosemary: ONE AT A TIME. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING  THAT BENEFIT BECAUSE IT'S BASED  ON A CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLE. >> Rosemary: WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO OPEN DEBATE. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK THE  FITNESS TAX. >> Rosemary: THAT'S IT. OPEN DEBATE. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): MR. SCHEER, YOU DID  PLOT ANSWER THE QUESTION -- NOT  ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY YOU'RE  LOWERING TAXES $50,000 FOR  MULTIMILLIONAIRES. MAYBE YOU'LL ANSWER TOMORROW IN  THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT YOU  HAVEN'T ANSWERED TONIGHT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED YOUR  QUESTION YOUR ENTIRE TIME AS  PRIME MINISTER. I SAT ACROSS FROM YOU. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): THE HOUSE OF  COMMONS --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I AM ROLLING BACK YOUR TAX HIKES ON ENTREPRENEURS, ON SMALL  BUSINESSES. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): YOU CALLED THEM TAX  CHEATS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE  COMMUNITY. THEY'RE SAVING UP MONEY TO  OPEN --  >> Rosemary: GENTLEMEN, NO ONE  CAN UNDERSTAND. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU'RE BOTH EXPERTS, HOWEVER, I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR YOU. HOW ABOUT THIS IDEA WHICH HAS  BEEN ASKED UNANIMOUSLY BY  QUÉBEC, A SINGLE TAX REFUND. THAT WOULD SAVE ABOUT $400  MILLION TO OUR COMBINED, IS THAT NOT A GREAT WAY TO SAVE MONEY,  MAKE THINGS SIMPLER FOR PEOPLE,  COMPANIES, BUSINESSES? AND EVEN GOVERNMENT? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THE SINGLE INCOME TAX RETURN FOR QUÉBECERS? >> YES. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I AM THE ONLY FEDERAL PARTY  LEADER THAT CAN DELIVER ON THAT. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): YOU MIGHT NEED ME TO DO THAT. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I SIMPLIFY THE LIVES OF QUÉBECER BY FILLING OUT ONE --  >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): YOU  TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS, MR. SCHEER, BUT THIS IS THE REALITY. CANADIANS CAN LOOK ACROSS THE  COUNTRY AND SEE THE IMPACTS OF A CONSERVATIVE TAX CUT MEANS. TRANSLATION. CUTS TO EDUCATION, CUTS TO  HEALTH CARE, VICIOUS CUTS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN  SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. THE THING IS, MR. TRUDEAU, YOU  SOUND A LOT BETTER, YOU'VE DONE  MUCH OF THE SAME. YOU'VE GIVEN MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): 300,000 IS NOT  NOTHING --  >> Rosemary: MR. TRUDEAU. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): CANADIANS ARE WORKING HARDER AND HARDER BUT ARE BARELY GETTING  BY. OUR POLICY WILL LEAVE MONEY IN  THEIR POCKETS AND WE'LL DO THAT  BY PROTECTING HEALTH CARE AND  EDUCATION. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY BY  CUTTING CORPORATE WELFARE AND  FOREIGN AID BY 25%. THAT'S FOR THE TAX CUTS FOR ALL  CANADIANS TO LEAVE MONEY IN  THEIR POCKETS. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): MR.  SCHEER AND MR. TRUDEAU, IT'S ALL THE SAME. IT'S ALL TAX CREDIT. THEY WON'T CUT TAX FOR EVERY  CANADIAN. WE HAVE TWO TAX RATES THAT WILL  BE FAIR FOR EVERYBODY, SO  EVERYBODY WILL SAY THE COST OF  OUR TAX REFORM WILL BE $35  BILLION. BUT WE ILL DO THAT ONLY -- WE  WILL DO THAT AFTER ONLY  BALANCING THE BUDGET. IT'S THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE WAY TO GIVE MORE MONEY --  >> Rosemary: MS. MAY. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT, MR. SCHEER, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PRIME MINISTER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I'LL PUT A BET ON THAT. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  VOTING FOR GREEN M.P.s IS YOUR  BEST GUARANTEE, CANADA, YOU  DON'T GET THE GOVERNMENT --  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): I'M GOING TO PROVE YOU WRONG. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  I'LL LAY YOU BETS  >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): UNDER JUSTIN TRUDEAU WE WILL SEE ENDLESS DEFICITS, TAX DOLLARS GO TO PAYING THE DEBT. >> Rosemary: TIME IS UP. MAXIME BERNIER'S CHANCE. YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTION. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YES. ANDREW, YOU ARE CALLING YOURSELF A CONSERVATIVE, BUT YOU DON'T  WANT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN  TWO YEARS. YOU WILL HAVE $70 BILLION IN OUR DEBT. YOU SUPPORT THE DAIRY AND  POULTRY, KNOWING THAT A CANADIAN FAMILY IS PLAYING $400 A YEAR  FOR THAT. ARE YOU A REAL CONSERVATIVE? NO, I THINK YOU ARE A LIBERAL. WHY ARE YOU YOU PRETENDING TO B  SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT? >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT  PRETENDING SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT. I'M NOT SURE WHICH MAXIME  BERNIER. MAXIME BERNIER THE SEPARATIST. THE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR  HANDING OUT CORPORATE WELFARE. THE MAXIME BERNIER WHO DEFENDED  SUPPLY MANAGEMENT WHEN IT SUITED HIM. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS --  IT'S MY TIME TO RESPOND TO THE  QUESTION, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE IS A CLEAR CONTRAST IN THE ELECTION. JUSTIN TRUDEAU'S ENDLESS  DEFICITS AND TAX HIKES TO PAY  FOR IT OR A CONSERVATIVE PLAN  THAT WILL LEAVE MORE MONEY IN  YOUR POCKET. WE WILL LOWER TAXES FOR ALL  CANADIANS. WE'LL BRING BACK THE KIDS SPORT  AND FITNESS CREDIT. WE'LL RAISE THE AGE CREDIT FOR  SENIORS AND WE'LL BRING IN A  GREEN HOME RENOVATION TAX  CREDIT. THAT ALL THE WHILE, CUTTING  CORPORATE WELFARE TO BRING THAT  MONEY BACK HOME SO CANADIANS CAN GET AHEAD. >> Rosemary: OPEN DEBATE. OFF YOU GO. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): I AM THE MAXIME BERNIER WHO IS THERE  FOR CANADIANS. I'M THE MAXIME BERNIER WHO DOES  NOT CARE ABOUT HAVING REAL  DEBATE ON REAL ISSUES THAT ARE  IMPORTANT -- >> YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE  DEBATES TO HELP EVERY CANADIAN  IN ABOLISHING THE CARTEL IN  SUPPLY MANAGEMENT. YOU DON'T WANT TO CUT FOREIGN  AID. >> Rosemary: MR. SCHEER. >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I'VE SAID THAT WE WILL CUT  CANADA'S FOREIGN AID BUDGET TO  PAY FOR THE TAX CUTS. >> Maxime Bernier (P.P.C.): YOU  CAN SAVE $5 BILLION THERE  BALANCING THE BUDGET. >> Jagmeet Singh (N.D.P.): THIS  ELECTION IS ABOUT WHO IS GOING  TO FIGHT FOR YOU AND STAND UP  FOR YOU. WE'VE SEEN WITH MR. TRUDEAU, HE  SAYS NICE WORDS, BUT GAVE $6  BILLION IN CORPORATE LOAN  WRITE-OFFS LAST YEAR, $14  BILLION TO THE RICHEST  CORPORATIONS. HE TEACHES LOOPHOLE -- KEEPS  LOOPHOLES OPEN. WE'RE IN IT FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE NOT IN THE RICH. WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER  PHARMACARE, DENTACARE PROGRAMME, INVEST IN HOUSING. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WITH NEW  DEMOCRATS. I ASK PEOPLE TO --  >> Rosemary: MR. TRUDEAU CAN  RESPOND. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): WE HAVE INVESTED IN  CANADIANS. WE MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE THAN  STEPHEN HARPER DID. VERY DIFFERENT CHOICE THAN  ANDREW SCHEER IS PROPOSING. WE'VE LIFTED 900,000 PEOPLE OUT  OF POVERTY. WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY IN INTO THE POCKETS OF STUDENTS. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO DO. AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED ON, BECAUSE THE FIGHT  AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS  AND THAT'S --  >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  WE HAVE MISCHARACTERIZED OUR  PONCE RESPONSE TO THE CLIMATE  EMERGENCY AS SOMETHING THAT  DOESN'T HELP THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST GLOBAL  ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND MOVING OFF FOSSIL FUELS. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): I AGREE. >> Elizabeth May (Green Party):  BUT YOU'RE KEEPING FOSSIL FUELS  GOING BECAUSE IT'S HALF OF WHAT  IS REQUIRED. IF THE ELECTION IS ANYTHING,  IT'S ABOUT TRUST AND ETHICS AND  WE'RE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. WE NEED GROWNUPS IN THE ROOM TO  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. >> Yves-Francois Blanchet (Bloc  Quebecois): MR. SINGH SAID HE  WANTS TO FIGHT FOR CANADIANS. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. WHO DO WE WANT TO FIGHT FOR? I WANT TO FIGHT FOR QUÉBECERS  AND WITH QUÉBECERS ONLY. IF WE AGREE WITH THE CANADIAN  GOVERNMENT, THEN LET IT BE. IF WE DON'T AGREE, WE'RE GOING  TO FIGHT. THIS IS WHAT BLOC QUEBECOIS HAS  ALWAYS DONE. [Speaking French] >> Andrew Scheer (Conservative): FACT OF THE MATTER, UNDER JUSTIN TRUDEAU LIFE WILL CONTINUE TO  GET MORE EXPENSIVE. HE'LL CONTINUE TO RAISE TAXES. HIS CARBON TAX WILL GO UP. HE'S AFRAID TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT WILL GO UP BY. UNDER THE CONSERVATIVE PLAN,  WE'LL BALANCE THE BUDGET. >> Rosemary: MR. TRUDEAU. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau  (Liberal): OUR PRICE ON  POLLUTION HELPS CANADIANS MORE  THAN REMOVING IT DOES. >> Rosemary: OKAY, THAT'S IT. THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE SEGMENT AND THE END OF THE  DEBATE. WE WANT TO THANK YOU OF COURSE  FOR TAKING THE TIME, THE  QUESTIONERS TONIGHT AND ALL OF  YOU WATCHING LIVE IN PERSON AND  ON THE VARIOUS SCREENS. AS A REMINDER, THAT FRENCH  LANGUAGE DEBATE IS LATER ON THIS THURSDAY, 8:00 P.M. EASTERN. ON BEHALF OF THE MODERATORS AND  EVERYONE HERE, HAVE A GOOD  NIGHT. [APPLAUSE]
