hey guys welcome back to the channel if you've watched recently you can see that I've been dropping a little hints life-changing things are happening well our lives are changed meat tripper so tripper is a Dutch Shepherd I've always wanted a Dutch Shepherd I think they're the coolest dogs going look at him doesn't he look like a hyena he's all Brendel he's got a black face Dutch shepherds can come in a bunch of different varieties but I knew that I wanted to bring go I've always wanted a brindle Dutch Shepherd hey careful to kitty be nice be nice even the kitty are friends now we've had tripper for one week one week today I picked him up in SU st. Marie a big cookie Suze hey Marie Michigan at 11:30 at night one week ago come here buddy tripper come Oh buddy good calm good so I got tripper for many different reasons it had been about a month month and a half since Scott went when we got tripper but we had been thinking of a a dog for a long time it's just we knew that Scott wasn't the kind of dog that one would happy with a puppy around so we waited and it might have been a bit too soon to be honest with you when I first got Ripper I was uh he wasn't like Scott was when we got scouted at 7 weeks of age we've got tripper at 9:00 sharp a common good and tripper is he's a little uh well Hellion he likes to get into trouble he likes to chase the cat he was very very scared when he got in he flew in from Oklahoma so anyways a couple reasons I got a dog wanna do my canoe trip and partner hence the name tripper and another reason I got it was because I wanted a dog around the house which leads me into my sponsor for today simply C for sponsoring this video tripper come so a little bit of info on tripper and why I got him Scout was an amazing dog and I'm not trying to replace him and there will never be replacing him this guy is a jerk compared to what Scott was when we got Scout let's see we gotta kill like he's got frickin lockjaw but uh I got we Scout at 9 weeks of age and we got tripper at 7 weeks other way around we got Scout at 7 weeks of age and got tripper at 9 and Scout was much bigger than tripper is yeah and he was nicer scope didn't chew up anything he didn't bite he thing over the bathroom in the house this dog was it from a host he was a con pup he was such a good dog but troopers don't go boy - he just needs a little bit more training and he's already way better than he was like he listens a lot better to me he could sit he can come he can stop chewing if I little put a little bit of force into my voice but I really wanted a dog that I could canoe trip with I couldn't ever do that with skill he was too big he was too old by the time I tried to start tripping with him and whenever he was in the canoe he would cry but just constantly cry which is it fun you know what I mean and he was so big that whatever he moved in the boat it would it would rock the boat all around and a little bit like it's not fun so for me for this dog I really wanted a dog to go in my pack but with me and that pack vote is way smaller than a normal canoe so there's no way I could get scope max there were like 95 pounds when he was in his prime near the end of it he is about like 60 65 but tripper is going to be a smaller Dutch Shepherd as Dutch shepherds go I believe that the typical weight is 60 to 85 pounds but I asked for the small guy asked for the runt I believe there was one female smaller than him and I really had to debate in my mind whether or not I was going to get a female or male like if you look around there's a lot of girls you know cat as well who's up honestly the best cat going still a girl I got these two in an Emmy and I'm by myself I'm surrounded also so I didn't want to get a girl dog you know I mean just for that reason alone I feel like I want a buddy I want to be able to say buddy and it'd be kind of weird with the girl also I really really liked the name tripper and I had the name tripper picked out before we had a dog yeah and it doesn't really transfer over to a female dog that well female dog might be more loyal it all depends I've never had one but anyway so I got lucky with with Trevor because his litter mates were like double the size of him but he what he makes up what he relaxed in size he makes up for in ferocity he the growl that being barked at me when I picked him up from the airport I had to go across to sue Saint Marie Michigan to pick him up and it was like 11:30 at night one week ago one week ago today he was a scrawny little runt in that thing terrified like I said he flew in from Oklahoma he had been gone all day I think he left early in the morning I picked them up 11:30 at night like I said took him awake taken away from his littermates his mother putting a crate and shipped on a cold plane to Canada where it's snow not Oklahoma where it's not snow but he was scared it was very scared we have right behind there the camera we have an entertainment center with some blacked out like mirror type shelves sorry cupboard doors and he can see his reflection and he losing today like absolutely losing it for him to in the morning when we when I finally got him home terrified terrified of emerald terrified of everyone he's very very very connected to me now if I get up to go to the other room he'll get up and come with me come tripper come see anyway we're learning we're learning again listen we didn't have a puppy for 11 and a half years and when we did have that puppy best puppy going Scout did not give me any kind of trouble but it's good it's it's it's a new venture it's a new ass that's a new journey in our lives has changed our lives has changed my life already I'm Way more like all I have in my head is training this dog like I want to train this dog to be the perfect dog to be a perfect outdoor woods companion perfect canoe trip and companion I want to be able to take this guy not only on like short little overnight canoe trips but like a week long actual canoe trip where I'm moving all the time and then even like a wilderness living thing where were posted up in the woods and I'm fishing for my dinner and he's eating the the entrails or half of the fish with me chasing off bears you know what I mean and to me that's the epitome of having a dog I never got to do that stuff with scout and I really regret it and I really wanted to now we're in the place for it I have the right kind of mentality of the right kind of dog for it small enough still crazy already cook easy he I couldn't do that before with him he would bite my face he would bite my face now we can put him right in a kid's face he's okay oh no we're learning we're still learning but he's a good boy doesn't he look like a hyena like bonzi from The Lion King not shanssey not Edie but Banzai so his real name is tripper Banzai the most hip hipster dog may have going but he's a good boy and we have the area for him you know the lake right behind us we have all the forest here it it would be a waste to not have a dog here hey hey good boy good oh yes good dog tripper God dog come boy so his ears will go straight up if you see right now the kind of hyena do't they'll go right up sadly dished all a good hit when the cat get along they he was very scared of her at first but they play so much now and it's very cute and him and me were getting a little bit better together she's a little standoffish because he does bark as you can see he's pretty wild okay but I'll leave the kilo now she's not happy Hey what are you doing it's enough that's enough okay he does bark at her it does bark when you want something and we're trying to not know we're trying to not encourage that by not replying to him but emerald is a kid and she jumps back or you know I mean she does react to it so he does bark at her a bit but we're getting all over that Oh kiss kiss good kiss see he's smart he's a really smart dog he's a working dog he's a herding dog he's a good bloodline and I'm hoping he's gonna be a life long companion at least for the next 12 years or so good boy so when we first got him it was very hectic and I was uh I was a little bummed out to be honest totally honest with you he was not what I was expecting I was expecting a skeleton and I didn't get that but he's a different dog and that's good to hit appeal all set at different challenges it's gonna add like some some things about him that I didn't like and I yes I didn't know how to train so I'm going to be getting a little bit of help from dog trainer out in California named Robert Cabral akka bro you guys should look him up on YouTube I'll put his link in the description he's a very smart dog trainer and uses a bunch of different methods that I like with Scott I only ever used the prom collar and and I used it properly it wasn't inhumane and he wasn't scared of it at all and he didn't run and I when he saw it Hey ouch good good good ouch good good yeah so I used the prong collar properly and it wasn't he was not scared of it he didn't run the other way he sat down a leg but there are situations where that's not the right kind of training and I understand that and I don't think if anyone tells you one type of training is the right type of training I'm not gonna listen to them because there's different situations for different dogs and also different situations for the same dog in different situations as it were right now I'm using positive reinforcement treats levy I'm using positive reinforcement such as treats and praise when he listens to me and I'm using negative with just really verbal right now I'm not going to put a prong collar on a nine week old puppy this it's not gonna happen for me but I do have another martingale collar that kind of cinches down when you pull on it and that will help a little bit it's all webbing that'll help a little bit with controlling him his nipping at emerald and and maybe when he starts to jump up on the coach I'll be just correcting and with that down off leave it take the thing in just a little correction but yeah I'll be looking towards Robert Keller for some help with this guy because I got to get him in the canoe soon there's no water is all I still so I gotta get him in the canoe very soon with lots of treats lots of praise lots of have a good time in it to let him know that this is a fun spot not somewhere where I need to be walking around and nervous and crying the whole time because that's not going to fly but yeah I couldn't even fish with skill because you'd go after the lure or he would think I was like throwing something for him I hooked scope with one time in the chest because I'm a real girl yeah but this dog will be oh sure today kiss you go kiss my dad this dog will be my canoe tripping partner tripper Banzai so be on the lookout for more stuff with him let me know would you guys like to see a training a dog for a life in the wilderness to take video or type series let me know I think that that might be a cool thing and I can get that Robert guy to help me with it just so like when I tell you things you're not wondering where I got that information from pulling all my blood type thing it's actually backed up and and he has videos of it all working and his dogs are amazing so Scout will never be forgotten he will never be replaced he's missed every day but it was time it was time for us to get another dog I see people walking down the street with their dog and I just get crushed I need a dog to to motivate me I need a dog for me to take care of someone Will's got the kids you know he has that on under control they don't even care about me being home it doesn't matter but I don't want to go camping by myself all the time ah you son of a gun near the end scope couldn't come with me because it was so cold and the snow is so deep and stuff this guy hopefully soon he'll be out with me he's terrified of going outside right now we have a neighbor German Shepherd yes need cash and he kind of went after him a bit so I you got to keep a distance for a while are we gonna let him know the outside is a nice place but he's already so he's ten weeks now actually can be true enough he's grown since he's be bad oh is that so leave it leave it oh you can be long-winded yeah he's gonna be a good boy I think he's gonna top out at about sixty five pounds I would be really really really happy if he was like 60 55 but it just doesn't seem feasible but I don't want a 80 pound or a 90 pound dog it's just too heavy the front of my boat at front of my canoe like I was saying earlier would plow leave it more it would plow into the graph into the water so I need to be able to like my backpack for canoeing for a canoe trip would be 30 pounds and this guy say when I first pick him up might be 30 pounds 50 pounds that'll be fine but when he gets full-grown I might have to switch the gear around so that it's evenly keeled and he might have to go in the back with some of the gear or something you might have to go in the front I'm gonna get him a lifejacket I'm gonna get him a vest a tough backpack vest because his fur is not as long as Scouts was at all you can see it's very short so I don't want this guy getting too cold when I take him up to the bus stop with everything the more he shivers and I have to put him inside my coat but anyways this is our new dog tripper he will be a face of my youtube channel just like skillet was everyone will love the tripper and watch the tripper grow up and have fun exploits and watch it become an awesome dog because I'm sure he will be oh oh you son of a garden okay I got it what I do ouch now that was hard I walk away now they walk away and I pet the cat and they make Ben Jealous it's actually a really good technique just to ignore him if he does something he doesn't you don't like but I have to go to get the kiddo from the bus stop because she'll be there in less than five minutes but I hope you guys enjoyed this little update video I hope you're interested in mr. tripper he's been a life-changing thing for us already it's very rejuvenating to have a puppy around and it's it's hectic but it's fun thanks for watching guys we'll see you next one soon no bye now hi
