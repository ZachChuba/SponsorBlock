welcome back to related to do the show where we talk about what it takes to online store make it with Squarespace so recently I sat down with the creator of the hit video game move or Die to talk about his success and journey thus far if you're interested in game design if you're a creator looking to find motivation or if you just happen to have a thing for interviews you won't want to miss this enjoy how do you actually pronounce how do you pronounce your name so my name is Nicole I a better betcha it's easier to call me barbecue I guess I thought about barbecue the rolling are like better betcha barrel a is that good okay so tell us about tell us about move or die explain the game to those who might be unfamiliar to it right before that I think I should say like hi I'm Nicole I betcha and I'm a self-proclaimed game designer I've been doing this for about 10 years now and I made a little game called move or die and move or Die is a four-player friendship ruining party game that came out around two years ago and it started off as a completely different game but because I'm such a good designer even it ended up being a party game and it ended up being quite successful and I still don't know why and that's pretty scary because I have to reproduce that for my next game tell us about the design process was how close is the finished game to what you had originally conceived I don't think it could be further away from it the way the game was originally designed it was like a single-player narration narration based puzzle platformer where you played this little guy and you walked around and there was some narration like portal like a guy talking to you telling you what to do and you would solve puzzles and it was quite slow-paced and all that and then one day I was like what happens if we had three more players so we did that and he turned out to be so much fun that it kind of steered the game into a completely different direction and we kept going in that direction and here we are today we have overtime how long did the development process take from when you started to when it shipped from the very first idea I think around four years or so because I did this we made a lot of bad decisions first of all we made our own engine never ever do that it's a horrible thing to do if you want to make a commercial game and then we worked around one year on the level editor we had the most advanced level editor ever and I was super proud of it and friends kept asking me hey you've been working on this game for a year now when can we play it and I would be like there is no game but we have this really cool level editor so after one year of working on the level later we start working on the actual content and around four years later the game came out what was your first game like how many games did you made up till mover died so it's weird because it's not like a a very abrupt transition right like you don't become a game developer overnight it's a very smooth transition and then you find yourself in the middle of game development and you can't pinpoint when that started but I remember starting with stupid things like PowerPoint and weird Chinese ripoffs of Adobe Flash making pointing click games where I would make like drawings in ms paint and then put invisible buttons on top of them to make xscape to make kind of escape the room kind of games and then gradually I would team up with programmers and make more advanced things because contrary to popular belief I'm not a programmer and everyone assumes I am one I don't know why but I work with people that are infinitely more talented than I am when it comes to making things happen and I just handle the design aspect of things so I can't I wouldn't be able to tell you what my first game was like I don't think it exists anymore but it was like a very crappy mspaint escape the room kind of game right so this was like your first you know commercial release of a video game oh boy not Sam I'm not sure definitely that because it's weird I didn't work in a soap going back a little bit yes tell us the story yeah so I was born in oh I'm from Romania and in Romania game the game development scene is still kind of young and for example if you want to go and learn game development you don't really have options especially not when I started there are no universities that teach game development or game design in any way so most Romanian game developers are self-taught from the internet from other developers and so on and so forth so what I did was I went to the architecture high school because I figured hey I want to be an artist and I also want to be a designer and architecture is kind of like art and math I was super wrong and that didn't work out and then after I finished high school I just started going full-time in game development and trying to teach myself game development so I did that and I made progressively more complex games getting a little bit of pocket money for every single one of them and investing those amounts of money in my next projects so I made flash games for a long while for like five six years I was like back in the day when Newgrounds was a thing is basically where I grew up miniclip congregate some of them are still with us today right they made a lot of flash games and then move or Die was my first real game the kind of game that ends in a dot exe which was like my dream the kind of game that runs in full-screen and not in a browser so yeah my first real game would be move or die but before that I made around 14 or 15 other small flash games that some people not consider real games sure so your development team for move or Die was I assume handful of people maybe a little bit less it was it was me and a friend right it was weird because we started out as two guys and there was a friend of mine the programmer and then there was me and I would have to handle art animation sound design level design sending emails and making the trailer and a bunch of hats that I had to wear and it was tricky because I didn't have any money to pay people to work on mophir dime so I had to work with friends on favors and that's annoying because it's very slow and whenever I would need something like hey we have to push an update friends would be like oh yeah but I'm going out with my friends so that was tricky but then after making a bunch of flash games I got some pocket money and I could afford to pay people to work for me and that was amazing like I can afford to do this now and that changed the dynamic a little bit and development started slowly speeding up I I assume that your creation process is a little bit similar to mine in that for the first like year two you're kind of just you're not sure if it's actually going to happen or not and then for the final two years or maybe just the final year leading up to it you realize okay if I actually invest some time in this it'll actually be a you know this can be something really big so ya get most of the development done in that last year so to give you an idea most gaming developers when they want to make a game they create this thing called a gdb a game design document and that document is like 20-plus pages and it has everything that you need to know about the game though the name how it plays the character the spells the soundtrack art sell everything and I worked on move or Die for four years and it came out on PC and they did quite well and after it came out on PC I wanted to put it on consoles so I got in contact with Sony for the PlayStation I talked to them and it turns out if you want to put a game on the PlayStation you have to send them a GD D so what I did was I created the game design document form over died after it came out because I didn't need one while developing it because it was all in my head but I'm the kind of guy that believes in figuring things out as you go and not laying everything down on paper from the very beginning all right so I mean you know since then it's been released it's been wonderfully successful you've had you know no idea why but yeah what's that I have no idea why but yeah right so what so that's kind of my main question which is like what did you not anticipate about the afterlife of the game because for me when I produce a film or a movie I make it I put it out there and then it's it's pretty much just out there and that's it what a game it has its own you know it has a support life that you have to take care of their updates that you do incrementally over time so what you know did you anticipate that after releasing it you would have several more years of having to take care of it in this wide audience I mean what surprised you most about having this game just immediately well I don't know if immediately but blow up on you right so first of all the first surprise was people actually bought the game which is still mind-blowing as always I created something right people are paying money for that something it's crazy and well it was either the game would work out and I would make a bunch of money and then I figure out what to do or the game wouldn't work out and I would become homeless and try to figure out what to do with my life both of those options were equally scary and exciting but it ended up working out so because it worked out I told myself that I'm gonna keep the game updated because it depends from game to game you might make the kind of game that doesn't need any updates because it might be like very narration heavy and it's like a story based game it has an ending move or die doesn't have that move or die is the kind of game that you would play over and over again and it's kind of a platform on which I can add new stuff for me there's no reason to make a move or die to because any idea I have for the game I can just throw it and move or die right right so I decided to make these big thematic content updates that I um I'm a fan of and make them completely free mmm Part B because I had a lot of ideas and things that I want to put in the game and also because I wasn't happy with how the game was when it came out and I wanted to bring it to a point where I'm happy with it so I just kept adding more and more things and even now two years later after the game came out we're still working on some updates and I still get stupid ideas and we get to throw them in the game every now and then right I mean there's it's gotta kind of have a sort of snowballing effect to where you put out the original game and then the more people to play it the more feedback that you get it develops its own community and that community you know calls for a certain mechanic and so you the more feedback that you get the more improvement you can make on the game and it just continually kind of feeds in and of itself I mean I one thing that I've liked about move or die like you said is that it has that long shelf life in that it basically becomes its own you know mover to I can look completely different two years from now then it looks today and so you can you know you can continually you can continually improve upon it is that something that you find a little limiting I guess for me because I come from a filmmaking background if I had to continually work on like improvements in one film already released I would drive me crazy but I mean surely you must have like you know other game ideas that you want to do I know you've got monster prom that's coming up but that's not something that you'd necessarily design but is there sort of a long-term goal for continuing support on move or die while at the same time pursuing other projects or are you content with just working on move or die for now no absolutely I want to I we have already started working on some other projects but I don't find it limiting at all because it's I specifically designed move or die as a whole with the community in mind so the whole game is very modular I can add a lot of content in it very quickly and also it's very model so players can make their own content on their own and I want to encourage that because I can keep the game updated for so long and the community can do that forever and I want to make sure both in even how we designed the online structure so even though steam burns up and disappears the game would still work online because I want to make sure everything works like 20 years from now when I won't worry about move or die at all and I don't find that limiting because I always try to make a new experience for example if I wanted to make money I would just make a sequel and that would be kind of easy right just like make it look a bit different throwing any ideas that's it luckily now I'm at the point where move or die did well and it brought me about a bunch of money and some resources and I can use those resources to make weird experimental stuff without worrying about the commercial viable aspect of it right so you know you're in this good spot right now you've got the successful game and it seems kind of like the sky's the limit so what does 2018 look like for you specifically in the word future so first of all it's I'm not super happy with where I am because before mover that came out I had no money and I had to like every single thing I was doing from overed I was super important and I was super motivated but now move or Die came out and I have a bunch of money and to some degree that kind of sucks because I don't feel pressured anymore and I know I'm in a position where I can make failed projects for like several years and I'll be good and I don't like that feeling because it doesn't it there's nothing to push me anymore and I have to fix that but for 2018 we went into the publisher realm and now not only we're developing our own stuff but we're also helping other developers publish their games because while developing move or die I figured out that it turns out aside from making the game there's this huge other thing called marketing that you have to worry about and actually yell about your game and put it out there and that's kind of a full-time job that you have to go to events and like have interviews and meetings and I figured I could apply that to other games and that's pretty much what I'm doing and I have no idea if it's gonna work out or that we're doing that with our first game right now called monster prom and based on how well that turns out we might continue down this publisher path and work with multiple developers in the future while also worrying about our own experimental games cool so what let's say you say we've got somebody watching this video who wants to get into game design they have no practical experience at all what advice would you give to them do something tonight like after you close the tab with this video Google how to make a game download something like unity or a game maker and start making something because making something is so easy and accessible nowadays that you can just get into it and the biggest and most important thing to keep in mind is don't aim for your dream project as your first project because a lot of aspiring game developers think that oh man I wish I could do like the next World of Warcraft with some League of Legends and cancer strike makes it mixed in don't do that start super small think of the smallest game you can think of and then go even smaller like a black box on a white background should be good enough for your first project make that show it to people I encourage people not to show it to their friends because friends are horrible at giving feedback everyone will tell you that that's the best game ever it's not show it to strangers who are not afraid to rip you apart and tell you how bad it sucks and then take what you learned from that experience and apply it to your next project which should be incrementally bigger than the previous one so yeah start small and start right now I was at a.m. I was at a con I think it was a couple weeks ago now and there were there was a group of guys there who were playtesting I'm a card game that they were trying to make and right it was their first they were just kind of alpha testing it and they were they set up this booth and they were having people you know come play test the game and so I said all right I'll be back later today and I'll check it out and I was back later that day and I sat down and one of the guys kind of admitted to me he's like so you're the first person not in the development team that's actually played this game so everyone was kind of nervous oh and maybe it's because of what I do you know I know that when they're out there play testing what they want is good effective feedback they don't want oh this game is so great just keep going you know kind of thing they want somebody to basically tear it apart to find that find the game and find the bugs and so I was there with my wife and about halfway into it I realized a completely game breaking bug or not not a bug since the tabletop game but a completely exploit you know a way to exploit the mechanic that renders the game completely broken and so I kind of kept that in the back of my mind and played through the rest of the game and at the end of it I was like okay so what if I did this and there was then to her like they were there was that silence where they realized oh that breaks the game and they said well why would you want to do that and which is kind of there you know joking way of saying which is like yeah you've got to figure out where the game falls apart and that process is not nearly as glamorous as the finished product is just play testing or play yeah if I if someone tells me that move or Die is great that's lovely makes my heart grow and it's cute but it doesn't help me that's right it doesn't tell me how to improve the game and that sucks because I don't encourage people to yell at me and be like hey do this and maybe do that but at the same time like constructive criticism holds so much more value than a cool game you're right I think there's that kind of I don't want to call it camaraderie but there's that sort of Understanding between developers like they were doing a board game and I just work in in video but there's that kind of understanding where we're both creators and when a creator is looking at another creators product and it's not out in the open it's just an alpha what they're looking for is you know they're not looking for hey you did a good job which is kind of why my my wife is like wow you you don't be so mean-spirited but there's this understanding between creators like that's what you're looking for you're wanting to know have the holes exposed because you're you're giving your game to someone who has an eye for finding those game breaking things on the flip side of that let's say we've got somebody who's watching who has been doing that and has been designing you little flash games or kind of self-contained projects and all of that maybe they've even made one complete game but for some reason they just can't quite get over that hump and find success in the stuff that they make how could somebody who has been game designing for a while but hasn't found success what could they do to kind of reassess their process and maybe find success like what are some of the common mistakes you see people who are actually actively developing make that keep them from being able to reach you know what you've reached right so I'm gonna give a very boring answer but I think it's true that's good I guess the boring it I guess the secret to this is be consistent when I was working on move or die like I was I mentioned this in a talk of mine and I it's a very interesting thing that I didn't see mentioned anywhere else when I was working on move or die at the beginning it was only me and my friends right like I would make an update post and only my friends would see it on Facebook and they would comment on that post and they would say oh man that's cool you should maybe change this or maybe you should do this and then after doing that for a while the community following overt I kind of grew and those comments changed from you should do this too they should do this so I kind of became this weird developer entity where I'm not one guy I'm is the developer and that's like a very cool threshold to pass and that was because I was consistent I was trying to post every single week in the exact same day because people get to expect things and you build things slowly it doesn't happen overnight not even if pewdiepie plays your game sure there will be a tiny spike but that doesn't mean overnight success so be consistent and a common mistake is people that yell about their games enough like having a really good game is great but if no one knows about it that's useless like no one will play it so put your game out there everywhere go to events meet people and get your game out there right so moving back to some of your creations what was the hardest part about designing mover die like if you could pick one thing that you were like that was the hardest thing to climb what what is it so if I if I say self-motivation does that count oh yeah absolutely because a lot of developers work with friends in the same room and that's cool but in my case I did the exact opposite I would work with people online and almost no one from my own country from Romania so my team was composed of people from all over the world and that's kind of tricky because when you do that and especially when you're the guy in charge of the project you don't really have people to easily bounce ideas off of and you start questioning yourself and every now and then while working on a project that's not out and you've been working on it for like 3 plus years you start asking yourself questions like why am i doing this like is it worth doing what I'm doing should I continue and it's very hard to keep yourself motivated and to keep pushing and put your game out there when you know you worked on this thing for four years and it's gonna come out in the same day with like 30 other games and it's just gonna get buried into this sea of mediocre games it's scary and the way I kept myself motivated was by going to events and showing my game to people and seeing that they're enjoying it and that gave me this amazing feeling of I should keep doing this because people are enjoying my game so maybe there's a future in this so that's what kept me going so beyond beyond just self motivation which I completely you know I completely understand you know especially doing what I do it's it's one of those things where there's no you know since you are your own boss you set your own deadlines and you know and I've thrown it's kind of it's jet right the deadlines are the big thing for me but you know you if you don't motivate you know but nobody else will because nobody will care about a game more than you do but in specific terms of design I know you say you're not a programmer but was that was that a hard thing like not being able to you know only only working on the design thing having to wait on write on programming was that was that you know frustrating or I would kind of easily yeah like kind of practically speaking was there like one aspect of design that you just was just miserable to slog through and get through so I wouldn't say program like working with the programmer was tricky because depending on the people you work with it could be very cool in my case I know how to read code but I don't know how to write it from scratch so I still change variables here and there to not bother the programmer but I don't like add new features on my own in terms of in terms of design it's I guess is being constantly surrounded by the imposter syndrome and thinking that what you do isn't good enough in the case of move or die I can't say that move or die is this super original thing mover that is just all my favorite party games tossed together in a blender and move or die came out so it's a collection of various small design parts from various games that I cherry picked and I put into this one thing and while you do that you can't help but think that what I'm doing is not good enough it turns out it is and most people do that and most like all of your favorite games had other games that inspired those titles and the designers behind them so that's perfectly fine and I had to constantly tell myself that what I'm doing is OK and I shouldn't strive to be what I project other developers are right that's you know that's always interesting to me which and I we went through this with YouTube as well before that I kind of blew up like I did it was one of those things where you have in your mind what a you you have you have in your mind the goal of you know this is what I want to do and then the entire time that you actually reach that level and you start doing that you feel either like a complete fraud the entire time or you feel like you're doing it wrong and yeah what's your favorite part about game design like what gets you up in the morning is it is it the community aspect of it is it the creation of the thing is it having the finished product is it a coalition of all of that more or less it's more of the first two and less of the last one of having the finished product because in terms of you know how when you work on a on a video you render it and then you post it and that's it with the game it's never like that you always have something to add and it's never good enough and you always have something to improve and you can easily do that in video games but it takes time so it's yeah it's the excitement of having a community that's excited to experience what I've created and the idea of making this world that someone could live in and living in breathing characters with stories behind them it's not the case we'd move or die maybe in a future title but the idea of creating a universe that works on its own and seeing others enter this universe and playing around with it and see how that goes especially when I design something and then players use that in a completely different way that I didn't envision in the first place that's mind blowing that's why I love speedrunning so much it's so so so cool we are just creating this thing that I can pass on to someone else and express my my ideas and my feelings in this weird interactive form is there that tendency where the more you work on something the more you would think how great it would be to do something else I can't think you kind of hinted on that a little bit which is that you've got this successful multiplayer game but you're still like well it would be cool if I had like a narrative kind of given so is there is there's this tendency that you no matter what you're actually making you get to the point where you kind of start to daydream about doing the polar opposite of it I guess it's always like that and not only that but like getting a million other game ideas while working on one and writing to convince yourself to not get sidetracked especially when you work on a bigger title but yeah that's what I liked about flash games so flash games were the super little projects that focused on one mechanic that was creative and like one weird thing and that's why I love game gems for those of you who don't know a game jam is an event that where you make a game in a very short time like 24 or 48 hours which is an insanely short time and you do it based on a theme and it's usually an event that's organized globally and you go in a dedicated space where you're surrounded by other developers and you start from scratch on Friday and Sunday you have a finished project that you get to show to other people and it's a really cool experience so when I do that it's really cool because when you make a design choice and you change something you can see that change immediately and it changes the outcome of the game almost completely while with move or die I've been working on it for four plus years and it doesn't feel like I'm working on a game anymore it feels like I'm working on this huge infinitely complex machine where I change one little thing somewhere and it something else might break somewhere else and it's it's like a huge ship that I can barely steer anymore because it got so big so yes part of me wishes that I would and I will be working on something smaller that have more like immediate changes and and it's a smaller scope kind of thing right I see that a lot with creators of pretty much every discipline I mean I think I remember watching an interview with George Lucas one time when he was just like at the height of Star Wars mania and they asked him what he wanted to do and he was like I want to go into obscurity and just work on something small that no big budget attached to it and no you know all these strings attached to it is do you find that that because this game is so successful and it's kind of grown so huge and now you have you know budget and money to invest in game design and you can take it very very very seriously hiring people and you know all the logistics of that do you find that restrictive like when you're first starting out you think if I had all this money if I had all these resources and ability I had money and then you get it and now you're just you just kind of even feel more restricted do you go through that so I would say yeah but it's a thing to say because everyone watching this will be all watch my stuff just make it into a podcast yeah just like into a podcast that's the worst worst case scenario it's cool to some degree is cool but at on the other hand you have to manage all those resources and it kind of puts this weird sterile feel on the projects you make and now you have to worry about things that it's never worried about before so part of me just wants to forget about all that and go in a garage with one of my friends and like promise each other a 50/50 split and just start working on a weird game without like budgeting things upfront and considering how much we're gonna spend on ads and marketing and I don't know I don't want to worry about that I just want to make weird games so yes it is a little bit more restrictive but at the same time I can afford to pay people to work so yeah it's nice but not nice at the same time confusing it's really confusing right no I mean I go through that with with my channel as well which was that when I started out I was just making videos that interested me and if I had inspiration in one month I would make a video and if I didn't I didn't and that was it but then you get into that point where you're like signing contracts and stuff and there's like there's this assumption of inspiration like oh yeah will you know with sponsorships especially it's like will sponsor the next videos you make for the next three months there's that assumption that I'm gonna have in my had good videos for the next three months and you start to realize now I'm expected there's like a base level expectation of creativity that you have to consistently hit from that point forward and so it is it is kind of restricting it's always interesting when you first start out you have this picture in your head of what it is when you realize this benchmark of once I start doing this I'll be successful and then the second you hit that you're like man I wish I could go back and just use yeah no strings attached are there is there a drew like it's sort of a dream project that you've always wanted to do that you haven't done or did you have a dream project that has changed over time now that you can kind of start doing dream projects so I don't have a dream project I just want to keep working on small experimental games that push the medium for example lately I am a huge fan of games that where the gameplay happens outside the screen like a game that's based on audio or like movement where like some motion controls and things do you find that when you're in the midst of development if you if you need to clear your head or just get outside of yourself and focus on a temporary different project it does it kind of give you a spark when you're in the middle of this long support process of something like blue Verdi yeah absolutely i while they're incredibly exhausting and you start seeing floating dots by the end of a game jam I consider them to be some sort of a break from this huge mammoth project that I'm working on and I'm taking like a week weekend off to make this new thing and it's exciting because I know I'm going to start from scratch and in 48 hours I'll have something to send my friends to send my friends to play so yes while also what you're saying about filmmaking applies here as well but on top of that there's that layer of people thinking that making games is like playing games which could not be more false especially because game development is this incredibly complex thing it's one of the most complex things I've ever done in my life because it's just everything put together it's all your experiences its art its programming its music all put together in this one thing that has to work coherently I have noticed that even in film discipline which is that you know for instance with you you said you know people don't realize the game design and playing games are two completely different things I kind of think that a lot of people say they want to make games but what they really want to do is play test games and a lot of people want to they say they want to be a filmmaker but what they want to do is be a film critic because the actual creation process is not glamorous and it involves lots of obnoxious clerical stuff that is not very it's not very flashy and you spend more time trying to fix broken things than exactly oh and especially in games like when you see me work on move or Die you see how move or Die looks right now and you're thinking I'm and working on that it couldn't be that bad right but it wasn't like that all the time it started off as blocky characters with no backgrounds and nothing was working and everything was catching on fire and I had to play the same level over and over and over again and it's exhausting when you look at this for like four years you start to lose like the the path that you were on right because if I were to if the game started and looked how it looks today sure that would have been infinitely better but I have been playing over die for four years not for fun and it's horrible and I don't want to see it anymore and I hate my own game right I guess that's the price you pay in the process and on top of that when you start working in development and you make games you lose the ability to enjoy games right horrible thing because you start understanding how things work right James for me went from this magical thing that just works to Oh code and textures and budgets and yeah yeah I definitely there is that tendency to once you've learned the disciplines start to Deakin start to deconstruct other people's projects like I remember I went out and watched a movie with my then girlfriend and a friend of mine who you know does visual effects and all of us watched this movie and then we got out of the theater and it's like what do you think of the movie and she's like oh I love the plot I love the characters and I just looked over at him and he looks over at min he goes you know that one scene with the monster texturing could have been better it's like yeah yeah I noticed that and it's just lighting you just noticed the bells and the whistles and it kind of yeah it's kind of depressing in a way but but but at the same time when you find something that you really enjoy it's so much more powerful right because you basically raised the the quality bar for yourself right there's this thing where and that's one thing that's one of the things that's been so intimidating with me and why I haven't done more game design stuff like I'm working on sort of a tabletop game right now with with a few friends but it's kind of very slowly coming along but one of the things that's so intimidating about game design especially in comparison with film is that as long as I get it okay within the frame it's you know it's fine but right it's held up by duct tape outside of the frame and with a lot of games you have to be very comprehensive because you you make the game knowing that it has to it can't it can't be easily broken and so you have to you have to really kind of make sure all the bells and the whistles work behind the scenes and you know even then you miss stuff and there's so much stuff there's so much duct tape going on behind the scenes that people are never aware of that and I would drive myself crazy having to do that 24/7 so outside of outside of game design is there anything you know else that you've always kind of wanted or experiment in I know the game design you have to take from all different you know all different areas of life to put the game together there anything outside the video game design that interests you however so there are a lot of small things that I enjoy doing and I want to learn more about and I can bring them back in game development for example before I started making games I would skate and I was a skateboarder and I was thought that I would be a professional skateboarder my entire life and I would get sponsored and I would win contests that didn't happen and after that I started going to like local Film School film classes and I learned about editing and directing and I thought I would be a film director for the rest of my life even though I didn't fully understand what that means but that didn't happen either however because I did those things I get to understand the concepts behind them and get to apply those concepts in game development so because I made because I doubled in film editing I can make my own trailers now and that's immensely helpful because I know my game the best opposed to outsourcing that to some random company because I skated I understood the concepts of trying the same thing over and over again and not giving up or like even the physics of weight and how objects work in gravity but yeah now I'm I'm playing around with video editing more and more both from a creative point of view but also from an efficiency point of view like trying to make something really effective and make more videos of the same quality because making a great thing is cool but if it takes you four years maybe you try to shorten that time frame down right so I try to get better and faster at what I'm doing and also playing with some sound effects and music overall because I like everything that has to do with audio and I recorded my own sound effects form over died and I find that fascinating to know like the sources of sound effects where they come from and what sounds good and what doesn't and I want to play more with that and maybe use it game development I don't know if I'm gonna be a game developer for the rest of my life but right now I'm doing that and it's fine I'll see where where I'll be in the future sure do you find it difficult to especially with the start of move or die it was you and another guy and so as the available options expand do you find it difficult to be hands-off and hire people to do certain things are you more of that just kind of you want to have creative control is it hard to kind of let that go for certain things so I do want to have creative creative control and luckily we don't work with publishers so I'm in charge of my own project but at the same time I'm a control freak and I micromanage everything and that's horrible because it's it's good to make sure that the project turns out exactly how I how I want it to but at the same time is very tiresome and I can't do this for the rest of my life so right now I'm in the process of finding people to work with that I trust enough to be able to go hands-off because it's my dream to be able to just you guys handle things and I just walk away and do something else but it's very hard to get to that point because you have to trust a lot of people and and find the right people to work with and make compromises in the end yeah you see that a lot there's there's this tendency especially for I think for like guys like you and me who just started with us and maybe a friend it's really hard to seed you know work or jobs or certain things to other people and it's not that you're you know we call ourselves control freaks and and we micromanage everything and it's not necessarily that you want to do it all because you want all the credit it's just that you want it done right and you've only had success with stuff that you personally have done and it's hard to trust it's hard to reach that point where you trust other people to you know cover various aspects so tell us about Monster prom and where you're gonna what you're working on right now what you're gonna be working on in the near future and we'll call it a day right so overnight came out and we're still working on updates and we're still doing that but in the meantime we became publishers and we've signed with this game called monster prom and monster prom is a multiplayer monster dating simulator where you play a monster in high school trying to romance your way to another monsters heart and ask he or she out to prom and it's very very unusual and the writing is amazing and the art is really really good and it's made by a small indie team from Spain called beautiful glitch and it's gonna come out in April 27th and I'm really excited about that not because I really like the game but also because it's the first game were publishing so I hope I'm doing a good enough job with making the game look good like if you've seen the trailer that was all me and it's an insane amount of pressure because now I'm not working with my own thing anymore I'm working with someone else's ideas and that's scary but yeah I really like the game like I genuinely like the game aside from doing my job of trying to make it sell well and be successful monster problem April 27th more info on the website monster prom dot pizza because high school right so it's coming out on on Steam for PC Mac and Linux and maybe sometime in the future on consoles cool so I guess that's that's my plug all right very cool so one last question in a single sentence what do you think it takes to make stuff education I know blood sweat and tears and duct tape a lot of duct tape fair enough Nick thanks so much for being here and having this interview with me I
