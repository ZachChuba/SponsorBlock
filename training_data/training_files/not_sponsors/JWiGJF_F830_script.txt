hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with the blueberry dutch baby that's right i've been seeing a ton of
Dutch baby photos on the internet and I'm not exactly sure why but I'm
guessing it's because people are stuck at home looking for things to do but
anyway it did inspire me to make this blueberry studded version and if you're
not familiar with this beautiful big pancake are in for a huge treat
since not only is this gorgeous and delicious it's also as fine and simple
to make as a real baby so with that let's go ahead and get
started with this very basic batter which will begin by tossing some
all-purpose flour into a blender along with a pinch of salt as well as a little
touch of vanilla extract the real and the pure and then we'll go ahead and
finish this up with three large room-temperature eggs and some equally
room temperature milk and if you're wondering why room temperature eggs and
milk work better than cold I'm not exactly sure but it probably has
something to do with science and that's it we'll just go ahead and blend this on
high speed for about a minute or until completely and utterly smooth and by the
way if don't have the super duper fancy blender like I do might have
to go a couple minutes but don't worry it will still work and that's it once
blended our batter is ready to use and I know it does seem very thin but that's
how it's supposed to be and then what we'll do once our batter is done is move
to the stove where we have a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet set over high
heat into which we're gonna pour three tablespoons of clarified butter and once
that's in there I like to take a pastry brush and kind of grease the sides and
all clarified butter is as butter that we've melted and then skimmed off the
milk solids from the top which leaves us with just a pure butter fat and then
what we're gonna do here is wait until we just see that butter start to smoke
okay see that just a few small wisps and once that happens we're gonna
quickly but carefully pour our batter in right in the center followed by a
handful of the sweetest freshest blueberries we can find and yes of
course if you're not into blueberries any other fresh berry will work okay so
use what want I mean are after all the dwight
schroot of this baby's fruit and that's it as soon as our batter has been buried
we'll turn off the heat and quickly pop this into the center of a 425 degree
oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until it's
beautifully browned and provocatively puffed which like a souffle does not
stay that way so be sure to get your pictures quickly and also make sure you
leave that towel on that still very very hot handle and then what we want to do
as soon as this comes out is brush the top with some more melted butter and if
you're thinking we already put three tablespoons into the pan
isn't that enough no it's not brush more on and then after the butter this is
traditionally squeezed with a little bit of fresh lemon okay some nice sweet
Meyer lemon if can find it and above and beyond doing this for the flavor it
just sounds super cool and as can see that really helps finish off the
deflation shoot I should have worked in a Tom Brady reference oh well and that's
it we will finish this off with a nice dusting of powdered sugar which I'm
generally not a huge fan of for breakfast items but here it does make a
lot of sense alright remember there is no sugar in that batter and the only
sweetness is coming from those blueberries so I think this does need a
definite dusting plus it looks nice on the pan and that's it our Dutch baby is
done and ready to enjoy which I'll be doing right now I have this hot pan and
once I get this piece cut let me get a closer shot so can get a better
look and that my friends is just a gorgeous bite of food and while it is
rich and satisfying whoops appearances to the contrary it is
surprisingly light and the true magic of the Dutch baby is that contrast in
texture between that crispy crusty outside and that soft custard a fruity
center it is just simply amazing with the emphasis on simply and I really
could have easily did that entire thing out of the pan but I didn't think we
shall would appreciate that plus I'm contractually obligated to take a few
pictures of it plated so I cut a nice piece and placed it on a plate and fresh
ended up with a little more powdered sugar and since like I said this really
isn't sweet at all especially with that little touch of lemon I finished this
one with a little drizzle of maple syrup which is how I would enjoy regular
blueberry pancakes and that works just as well with this big variety
oh and in case you're keeping score at home this Dutch baby has nothing to do
with the Netherlands all right the name comes from the word Deutsche as in
German and for more details on that just ask any of your friends from
Pennsylvania and they will explain it to in fact they might even be able to
tell why this is called a baby but slightly confusing names aside I really
do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the
