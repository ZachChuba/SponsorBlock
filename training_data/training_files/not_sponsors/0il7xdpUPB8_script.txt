Xeon W Xeon scalable You know They're both called Xeon But these things are really different One of them is basically a Core i9 with ECC memory support And the other one is a server CPU that I fangirl all over Because I love super high-end expensive tech toys Now, in the past You needed multiple CPU's in one multi socketed motherboard in order to handle intensive multi-threaded workloads But, is that still the case today? Do you still need 2 of these, given that a single Xeon Platinum 8180 is 28 cores and 56 threads on a single chip. I don't know What is the purpose today of A dual socket machine like this one and how much have single high core count CPUs? Eroded the market that they used to enjoy Let's find out. Shall we? Alright there's a lot more room down here and we are gonna need it for this honking, not to mention heavy test bench. On this test bench, You will find the Asus C621E Sage This is a dual socket motherboard, rocking 2 LGA 3647 sockets for Intel's Xeon scalable lineup of CPU's And setups like this have actually been around as far back as the 486 in 1989 With the resulting second-hand hardware giving enthusiasts the ability to get multiple physical cores in their homes over the years with the peak being somewhere in the mid 2000s or so But, that was then and this is now Now you can get multiple processing cores in a single chip To see how far things have come what we're gonna do is pit this machine against the fastest Single CPU that we've tested to date We're gonna try to keep the number of variables to a minimum in order to gauge the impact That these extra CPU cores will have on our setup Though it should be noted that there aren't many options when it comes to aftermarket LGA 3647 coolers because most of the folks selling these kinds of systems would figure out their own solution So that means that our dual socket workstation will run a little bit toasty But we didn't observe any thermal throttling so it shouldn't affect our performance Let's start off then with good old-fashioned Cinebench I mean, we've seen this run before but it's always fun to see it finish that quickly So, in a surprise to no one the dual socket machine is faster but considering it's 56 processing cores not all of our workloads scale in the way that we might expect 7-zip for example, shows a smaller than expected gain over our Core i9 Extreme Edition Y-Cruncher even finds itself losing ground Asus real bench demonstrates this though with that said the encoding benchmark eats out a lead over our Core i9 7980XE and then Blender, well here we actually get a victory for our dual CPU system again Showing this platform's potential for expanding render farms but What is really going on here Well, something you guys have to realize is that there is more to a dual socket configuration than just more cores Do you remember when AMD managed a three percent improvement in IPC with 2nd Gen Ryzen just by improving cache latency? So on this motherboard, we've got two separate CPU's with two separate sets of cache and memory See, these 6 banks go to this one and these 6 banks are wired into this one and that means a lot of latency for compute tasks that require the same data sets This latency is a necessary evil in the design of multiprocessor systems because of the need for Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) for short That allows these two processors to efficiently share resources or as efficiently as they can So the short version of this is that it works by transparently allocating devices and memory to each CPU which means they can more easily avoid interrupting each other while accessing those resources This in turn reduces the amount of waiting around that they have to do for those resources to become available So, that's what we're seeing during our testing like in Y-Cruncher for example... Where both CPU's are working on the same data, but... *babbling* What if we could use different data sets Then we should be able to find this kind of setups true calling and how better to do that Than to effectively turn this system into two independent computing machines using virtualization So let's fire up unRAID, which uses Red Hat KVM as a hypervisor to see what kind of results we get splitting these resources into multiple independent machines Immediately, we see worse results from our VM's than our original 56 Core testing But, look closely[er] at how much lower it is It's not a whole lot In every test, it's basically the same story here and we are still Wwwaay out ahead of the Core i9 Extreme Edition, particularly when it comes to Blender Now if we consider the fact that we are getting simultaneous work done That gives us a good look at what an optimized workload might look like I mean or heck Virtualization itself is a legitimate task to, I mean this thing Could be so many gamers in one PC ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but I digress I mean nobody is gonna buy something like this for their personal rig anytime soon given the $10,000 per CPU price tag which puts it squarely in the territory of "big the size of the check doesn't matter" business What they care about is density The more processing power, a single computer can manage, the more processing power that can be physically fit into a building and this is perhaps most important for data centers and render farms in particular The less those guys have to spend on setting up the electricity and cooling management for a data center Versus the amount of performance they can get the better soooooo Will multiple sockets make a comeback in the prosumer space? Outside of you know oil and gas exploration where there are still workloads that can benefit from this kind of thing the chances look pretty slim if you ask me But I don't necessarily think that it's Intel's intent to sell these chips in the prosumer space and for that matter Even in the enterprise space. I don't think they knew a ton of them For me, I look at a product like this as more of like a future crafting exercise where it is available today, but it's more of a representation of what actually might be attainable a generation or two from now Just like the 22 core processors that we were playing around with a couple of years ago Nowadays, those are much more affordable and businesses are using them to power your cloud computing services It's making of services Dollar Shave Club is the service that has all of your grooming needs taken care of So thanks for watching guys.
