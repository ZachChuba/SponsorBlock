Guys, I don't know about you, but I think we could all use a little kindness this week, okay? Maybe a hug? What do you think? And as much as I want other people to be nice to ME, I'm reminded of the words of a very wise man, maybe you've heard of him before, HIS NAME IS JESUS! "Do unto others as you would have them..." "...do unto you," I think that's my line... If I want people to be nice to ME, I need to be nice to other people! But admittedly, sometimes that's easier said than done. Because some people are... *clears throat* "v mean" Hey, uh... what are you guys talking about over here? That overrated movie "La La Land"? It was SO derivative, two thumbs way down! Uh, I actually... really enjoyed that movie. Heh heh. Oh my gosh! What a sheep! You're way out of touch, bro! I just thought it was a good movie. So, let's try to make the world a more friendly place. Here we go, here are a few easy ways to make someone's day. Number 1: compliment someone. And I don't mean, like, say someone nice when someone's fishing for it. Oh my gosh, I look like such a mess today. Uh, no you don't, y-y-you look great! Really? Thanks! You're so sweet! I mean, say something nice, when they least expect it. You look a-MAZING today! Maybe, perhaps, just a LITTLE more tactful? Well, hey is that a new shirt? I-It looks great! Oh. Thanks! Perfect! Okay, next up: be a good listener. This is critical. So you know how humans have this funny thing where... *clears throat* *evil voice* ...we just have to have our say. ...and that's how I feel about Donald Trump. What if, instead- we just heard people out? Without feeling the need to speak OUR truth? Wow, Kelly that was, uh, heheh... really enlightening... your opinion, right there... ahh... Thank you for sharing! Heh. Got any other hot takes? Well, I could explain how Brexit made me feel. I know it's so hard... but I believe in us. The world would be okay if for a few minutes, I don't say anything! As I proved a couple of weeks ago! You were all very confused. Half didn't get the joke. Aheheh... Okay, next up: shoot someone a text. And by shoot someone a text, I just mean, you know- let them know you're thinking about them? But- heheh- without being creepy. Thinking of you and only you. Oh.... thanks. Every second of every day! Okay... Kissy face emoji. *pops lips* Please stop. Oh, why didn't it autocorrect?! Now I look like a bumbling idiot! No, no, just a genuine- purely platonic- thinking-about-you text. Hey Josh, I was just thinking about you, man... I hope you're having a great week so far! Let's get together soon. Wow! Thanks! I really appreciate that! Precisely! Okay, next up: encourage someone. You know, we all have things about... which we could use some encouragement. Maybe a hobby, or an interest, just- I don't know, something that maybe you feel kinda dumb about. BUT- if someone were to encourage you: Josh, I noticed that your dog is really well-behaved. Obviously you've spent a ton of time training her. I just wanted to tell you that I think that's really cool. Wow... well, thanks! Did you hear that, Mia? He likes us! Great setup! Now: hit it out of the park! Honestly Josh, I think that you could maybe start some kind of business or something, you know, like, training other peoples' dogs? I think you could make a lot of money on it. This is the best day of my life. Okay, last one, and this is for when nothing else has worked. You have tried EVERYTHING to make someone's day, and you have straight up failed, you admit it. Here's the solution, it's gonna sound weird: Buy them food. Specifically, buy them their favorite food. Hey, Kelly, ah, I saw over there that you looked like you're having a pretty rough day. I'm having the worst day ever! Well, uh, ah, I bought you some chips! I'm having... the best day ever! Nailed it. Sometimes you just have to get out of the way, and let the food do the talking. Whew, wow! Well, heh, I mean, what is there to say? You now have what it takes to make any day, for anyone, at any time, anywhere, for any reason, forever and ever, amen! So much power, yet... ...so much hope. Wow! This video was... really uplifting today. Wasn't it? Next week on Messy Mondays, Big Head Kid scares Kelly, in real life! *whispers*
-She's going to know something's up.
-Here she comes! -She's coming!
-I want teh food. Oh. HI! Ahuhuhuh, well, heheh... -Oh! Do you want me to get help you?
-Thank you. Thank you. *calling* Heavy. Heavy... look over there. Why are you sittin' like that? "Gimme a hug!" "Gimme... come here, gimme a hug."
