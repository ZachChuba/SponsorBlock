month hey what's going on youtube will here from all electric back again with another curvy country road test this is test number 18 running software version 2020.24.6.4 that is the latest software version that is out for the tesla model 3. now as you can see here i'm trying to engage autopilot but they just repave the road and haven't painted any lines on it yet so yes your initial thought is oh well he's not going to be able to test autopilot on this road and if that is your initial thought you are wrong so while i can't test it on the majority of the road i'm going to fast forward here past this super hard curve too bad we don't get to test that today but right up here where you can see they milled the road and there is a bump i'm going to slow it down here now take a look at the painted lines on the center of the road now for a split second we are going to get that gray steering wheel meaning that we can engage autopilot right here so wow able to engage autopilot with just about 10 feet of double yellow line showing so autopilot is now turned on we have that blue steering wheel and those two blue lines now take note here there are no painted lines on this road and yes autopilot is still working and it's still working flawlessly just past the truck there on coming really impressive there is no lines on this road and the autopilot is smart enough to stay on the right hand side of this road so awesome now there was a little curve there and it did remain on the right-hand side the correct side of the road and we are on a straightaway now one of the harder curves in this test is coming up i'm a little bit worried because there is no lines on this road so let's see what it does here it's slowing down to 24 22 21 down to 21 miles an hour to successfully make that hard left hand curve while passing another oncoming truck so impressive i'm blown away simply because this autopilot system is smart enough to maintain its proper lane position without any sort of lane markings this is huge this is again the latest software update and this is really impressive just passing another car there with no lane markings whatsoever as you can see from the center display we are approaching a stop sign and this new software version and this car is enabled with fsd so it is going to stop at the stop sign now when i do press the gear stock to confirm it will say take over immediately now that's because the autopilot systems smart enough to identify that particular intersection and know that it's not supported just like this one here this yield to the right is also not supported so i do have to disengage and then re-engage autopilot you see the two blue lines are back and the blue steering wheel is back as well so going through a town here we are limited to 25 miles an hour through this little town we have a curve and a railroad crossing comes coming up and it actually shows you the railroad crossing on the center display that painted markings on the road but take a look here we are going to see on the center display that it is identifying that that is a traffic signal and i have to confirm to go through it you saw it had a red line right there and then once i confirm it turns to a green line identifying that it is going to pass through and then almost immediately it then slows down by three miles an hour to let that pedestrian walk past really really impressive all the many things that the autopilot is seeing and then we yet again have another thing a delivery truck on the wrong side of the road facing the incorrect direction so the autopilot system will not go past it i do tap the accelerator pedal here and it does end up kind of i guess overriding that safety switch like that truck is in the wrong position and it will go past the truck there but a lot of unique situations that we're getting here another stop sign coming up and we're going to make a left-hand turn here i'm going to re-engage autopilot this is a really challenging curve if you take a look at the double yo line we do have a really big gap in the middle and sure enough we get that take over immediately it is just for whatever reason not able to see when that break in that double yellow right there so i kind of want to get out there with some spray paint of course i'm not going to do that i'm just kidding oh what do we have here double hand frantic wave another model 3 hopefully they were also testing this road out with the full self-driving or autopilot enabled so i'm going to speed up the test here and we are going to slow it back down right here because this is one of the coolest curves where autopilot always performs perfectly goes from 35 down to 25 and then accelerates after the turn is over i mean it to me is just incredible how perfectly it is able to do this curve every time if you go back and look at all 17 other tests almost all those it performed beautifully on that curve which is really impressive for the autopilot system now this next curve coming up does not the same we failed many times so let's see what happens in here in test number 18. we're heading right for the embankment before i do have to take over pretty quickly there still 35 miles an hour until i get that take over immediately that particular curve is definitely still tricky for the autopilot system a lot of things going on there so i'm going to slow it down once we approach this next blind right hand curve which let's see what happens so it's maintaining proper lane position we have a lot of shadows which is also challenging to the autopilot system maintaining 35 now drops down to 34 back up to 35 miles an hour so able to handle that beautifully let's sew it down here for this left hand bend slowing down a 34 just dropping one mile per hour before it goes back up after the curve back to 35 miles an hour now let's slow it down for this blind left hand curve where it kind of goes up and then down again and let's see what happens it goes a little bit to that right hand side but is able to pass great job autopilot let's slow it down for this blind right hand turn and it slows down to 32 so three now four miles per hour slow down before it goes back up to that 35 mile an hour speed limit our last curve in the forward direction and then we are going to turn around and go in reverse so here it is slowing down to 30 29 miles per hour and able to beautifully take that even though it drifted a little bit to the right hand side beautiful job by that autopilot now let's head in the reverse direction so we are going to go in the reverse direction starting off hugging that left hand side no time for a double hand frantic wave but i hope they were using autopilot and the first curve is a success in reverse in this software update so now let's speed up until we get to our next curve this is a left hand curve now and it is saying in the center lane slowing down a couple miles per hour and does a beautiful job now we have that blind up and down curve so let's slow down the video here and going down all the way to 29 miles per hour but it has failed there in the past so really happy to see that it was successful there so now we have a left-hand right-hand curve and a huge truck coming so slowing down at 34 miles an hour before it does straighten back out and speed up to 35 really fantastic job so here's our blind curve again a long bend and it is maintaining that speed of 35 miles an hour because it is a very wide bend it's not a very sharp curve and it does do a beautiful job there no disengagement required so we're going to speed up the video now until we get to our next more challenging curve now if you remember this is the curve that we had to take over immediately on and this where the autopilot did disengage so we're approaching that curve right after this little bend that we have here so i'm going to slow down the video and this bend is tricky because we have another intersecting street now the autopilot did a great job it's so good to see that so good to see this new software update performing beautifully so here is our tricky intersection here and the autopilot hugs that left hand side a little bit but no disengagement required by me the driver so we're going to speed up the video here to our next curve heading back into that small town that you guys saw in the first part of that video video let's slow it down here where we have a curve going to the left hand side where it slows down about one mile per hour not anything significant there but no disengagement required now we're going downhill here so the regenerative braking is kicking in and we're slowing all the way down to 25 miles per hour on that sharper right hand bend no disengagement required again really really great job from this software update during test number 18 of the curvy country road test so we are going to speed up the video here until we get to a very significant very challenging curve where in the other direction did require disengagement so blind right hand curve here before we i'm going to manually slow down the car here so you're gonna see me twist down on that scroll wheel so we can get the best out of this test so let's see what happens here there's our split and we're getting a red line like the car is gonna stop and then it just has no idea what to do and it just says take over immediately so definitely something that the autopilot team needs to work on with that particular curve or that type of curve with an intersection all right let's go through this town here we're gonna re-engage autopilot you see the railroad crossing is coming up i would like to see autopilot identify speed bumps hopefully that's something coming in a future update so we're following a car here so let's see what happens with the railroad crossing and as you can see on the center display the line is green identifying that it's following a vehicle through a traffic signal so you get the same thing when you're going through a traffic light so really cool that it was identifying that as a traffic light because it i guess technically is with that railroad but it was following a vehicle so it did not require any confirmation for me as a driver now this first part of the kirby country road test that you all know and love is very easy for the autopilot not that many very sharp curves and i've never had to disengage out of all 18 tests also it's rather annoying that the autopilot system will not let you go five miles per hour over anymore so like you see here i did disengage autopilot manually and share this video with a friend i'll see you guys in the next one you
