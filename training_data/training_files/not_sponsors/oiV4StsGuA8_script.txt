in today's episode we're gonna build a massive c-130 15 foot wingspan hopefully it's wise alright guys welcome back and that's right we got a very special one today I'm super excited today our good buddy John Overstreet the Jedi Master sensei scratch builder in my opinion of the world when it comes to foam board and he brought all kinds of cool toys including a huge project possibly one of the biggest projects we've ever done and he partially finished some of it at home and he brought it prepped so we're gonna be finishing it today oh look at this thing this is amazing so what the chopper we got here so this is a c-130 net John huh come on ladies start this project maybe three weeks ago three weeks in the yankin what all have you completed so far okay so we've got the fuselage here you can see running along the sides here we've got carbon fiber rods I don't want this thing to get up the air and then fall apart you guys have never had me build anything and that's some serious zip-tie action I like that and so beyond the fuselage what else has completed we've got the two wings done we still have to run a little bit of wiring for each of the engines but for the most part the wings are done I got to say the prize some of the goofiest wings I've ever seen they are they are beefy to say the leadership what monster motors on them yeah for monster motors and 15 foot wingspan so this is three feet bigger than cabie to give you guys perspective but it has twice as many motors each motor pushes out about 12 and a half pounds so there's 50 pounds of thrust I still don't think this is gonna weigh 50 pounds so it should have a pretty pretty good the the wings are pretty alarmingly heavy they're easily probably I'm guessing 10 pounds each I'd say so yeah so I part of me doesn't want to even like wham-o but when we put them on the aluminum does its job so you did a really good job with that so nice so I have to say just from my first initial impression this is like a different breed of scratch built from anything else that I've ever seen I mean look at this we have carbon fiber reinforcements going through foam formers it's like a combination of like the mass for series with modern technology and don't ever ask for this to be kidded because it's just the cost and zip ties alone yeah we're gonna be skinning the whole thing and we're gonna be building the vertical stabilizers put electronics in hopefully by end of day today this will be ready to fly tomorrow all right I'm going to get to work beat we have a lot of work ahead in a see if I can just stay out of the way and hopefully lend a hand if I can all right so before we get any further with the c-130 Hercules I wanted to take the time to thank our sponsor for this video and that is our friends over at Dollar Shave Club now if you guys aren't familiar with Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave Club is like a one-stop shop for your hairy face it's got everything you need to keep this thing groomed so specifically our friends over our Dollar Shave Club hooked us up with this Dollar Shave Club starter kit which comes with everything you need to keep you perfectly groomed starting with this heavy-duty razor blade which if you can just feel it which I know you can't feel it right now it's just girthy it just feels good in the hand and not only that but it has one two three four five six blades for superior shaving performance but beyond that it not only comes with replacement blades but it comes with a slew of different shape products coming from our man dr. Carver now you're probably wondering who dr. Carver is and so did I but it doesn't really matter I do know that he makes some legitimate facial products now the first thing that we have from the doc is the prep scrub now this stuff is essential because it's going to help exfoliate your skin and prevent ingrown hairs which who likes ingrown hairs nobody now the second thing that we heard from the doc is the shave butter you're gonna put this on there the first thing you're gonna notice is it's transparent what that's gonna allow you to do is get a precise shave it also helps eliminate razor bumps and then lastly but not least you also get the shave do from the doc appreciate it this is gonna help hydrate your skin and keep that skin nice and healthy after you get all that hair off there so another thing that the doc sent is in our box was the post shave cream and this is another thing that's gonna help soothe and moisturize your skin after the abrasive act of shaving all right so here's the cool thing right here right now you can check the link in the description of this video that you're watching right now and you're going to find it it is dollarshaveclub.com slash flight-test and when you go there you're gonna be able to get this same exact starter kit for five dollars which is really really cool but the cooler thing on top of that is by doing that and supporting these awesome companies like Dollar Shave Club they are in turn able to support us allowing us to do what we do and make these videos for you so it is a symbiotic circle of life here on YouTube and we could not be more thankful to be a part of it so thank you guys so much thank you to Dollar Shave Club and we have a gigantic plan to go fly so let's go do it I love this those curves yeah right there those shoulders what do you think about this giant c-130 Hercules first of all it's it's definitely giant I'm looking forward to seeing when they get the wings on and how are we gonna get out of building yeah my main point of interest is the fact that there's four monster motors out here it's four monster mo since we developed these monster motors isn't the first time we've put four of them is for sure and four slot quad monsters I'm gonna go to the moon which is appropriate because it's a Hercules I have a prediction I know that some people have their reservations about this thing but I'm pretty confident that this thing is gonna fly not just like a real Hercules but specifically like Fat Albert the Blue Angels Hercules that takes off you know that is you know I've seen oh I'm talking about yet I've seen it so it takes it goes down the runway right when it rotates boom jato rockets straight in there yeah I don't think we're gonna need rocket so I think with the four monsters yeah I'd have the same amount of power to just do that crazy clock look at this guy I am up for breakfast I'm 5 foot 8 inches on a good day so this is probably six-and-a-half feet maybe 7 feet seven and seven eight okay I can't see is not too short no six feet and it's yeah actually another fundamentally Billa reach yet that's seven a half days for sure and speaking of feet while we're talking about dimensions the cool thing look at this the inside of this thing is a what is it one foot by one foot yeah inside it is six feet long by six feet deep so the interior of this thing is gonna be just like a real Hercules can carry a ton of payload and go all the way back into the back and there's gonna be nothing in there cuz all the motors are on the wings that's six feet of cargo space yeah that's pretty cool this is the wiring harness one half of the way inside out and that's the longest water sometimes need ice where there's less wiring some houses I think you mean it so if you go all the way to the nose in case we need to hang it off the front of the nose we could do that as well you just never know so that's insane so we got two of these and that's gonna hook up to our es C's and then I think we just run two batteries chefs well you're gonna get to work on the wire in this bad boy I'm not working on wire I think you're gonna do some folding yeah I'm gonna mold some foam to finish up some of these engine cowlings and little finer details these guys are Jedi Masters when it comes to the master series I am the master series newb so I'm making the new cells the little engine pods on the wings and so kind of my first experience is kind of molding foam so John what's your typical technique when you're taking pieces like this and then fold it into this compound curve 3.51 looks like you already did the forming and that looks really good so now we're gonna get everything glued together and so what I like to do so I'll get three pieces of tape I'll take one and fold it back to fold it back and then a third one here and fold it back and then I'll run a bead of glue and I'll go about half way once I do that the piece that does not have glue I'll shingle it over the top of the piece that does have glue and then I just fold that over move over a bit fold that one over move over a bit do that and just with this extra piece of tape I always like to take it and wrap it around because if anything is going to come loose it's right there on the edges and so I'll let that cool down and then we'll flip it over and you can see there's a gap there we'll come in and fill that with glue later on nice alright so we've got these pieces finished up here and as you can see it's just a pretty simple shape a little bit of complex curve between the three pieces but it actually went together pretty simple and it if you guys are a lot like me you know you know that I'm a traditionally more of a PNP and a ready-to-fly guy so when I see complex shapes like this historically I probably would have been like it's not for me I couldn't do it but after actually putting it together the way John instructed just like he does in his build videos it's actually pretty straightforward as you can see the results are pretty good now probably wondering what this piece is even for this thing has for engine the cells this is gonna place right over here kind of make it streamline just like the real c-130 you know that nice streamlined look mine are definitely not perfect you can definitely tell which ones I made and which ones Josh and John made but it'll work and I think it's gonna look really really nice so this has kind of got me fired up I think I might need to pick a master series plan and build my first one just full transparency I've never built a master series plaintiff so want to change that meanwhile check out what we have going on over here oh you don't want to show this is it the big ugly gap this don't look right there it's actually a big reason why we don't build like former structures and then try to cheat it afterwards because it's dope to take your son it's hideous don't look at me Josh I know typically as any project is coming together you normally especially a scratch building there's always concern points yeah do you have any initial concern points as you're building this the biggest thing I think we've back to and I think I'm the one obsessing over it is we got to make this elevator not do this yes it's like a it's like a little bit whale tail right now yeah even with the carbon fiber spar yeah it's it's not gonna get rid of the flapping dude or the back yeah so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make like almost like an airfoil just like what we did on cabby and that's gonna give us rigidity that's also gonna kind of make it more like almost a triangle and very rigid I think that's gonna fix it so like a symmetrical airfoil yeah you got to be careful because if you put too high of a lift airfoil the faster you go the more down you have because this is lifting cause actually we learned that way back in the day with our friend Peter on the microwave plane yeah he had all these lifting services to huge biplane to carry the microwave and the tail had a big air foil on it as well cause he lifts well if you lift the tail up guess what the nose goes down in the microwave wind to the ground well I'll pull up [Music] it's something also you could do as a symmetrical tail on the back or you could even do in some cases a tail where it's reversed so it's actually driving those down and that's really handy if you have a plane that's apparently nose heavy because you keep your elevator Authority this is working for you but besides that the only other thing I'm kind of wondering and as this is a getting skin that's getting so rigid I'm wondering just boom is gonna be enough or if we're gonna need to like have a triangle of foam coming back I'm like an angle like this but I've been lifting on it so I just probably this oh I'm so sorry just just registers why we can't have nice things that's it it's still straight but we'll see if that strong but we can fix that after we skinned it yep cool well it's coming along good just from watching the background of some of Josh's monster builds one of my points of concern is that like a lot of times those weight from the motors will make the the wings sag a little bit so John you came with the wings pre-built and I trust you when you say these things are strong but are you pretty confident that the the main wings are gonna be strong enough to hold the weight of those big monster bad boys no I'm not confident I don't know what's gonna happen well you have two aluminum box tubes here right what are you having the wings over there well we've actually got three channel pieces per wing so two of them are gonna go into these box shaped ones and then there's gonna be a third one that goes to the middle and we're gonna have a little short piece of aluminum right in the middle and we're gonna use that to keep everything coupled together so you know what this reminds me of remember that time you did that thing with the tail section you made a tubby plane out of the tail section stretch plane no oh yeah subscribe that's right that's me Alex and I went and went up the graveyard in the old shop and we took this huge tale from the Red Bull Flugtag plane and made a bunch of trash put it together and tried to fly it here the trash plane was phenomenal it didn't fly low it was a fun video it was not a fun project so tail sections tail section so we actually have a symmetrical like tail section in here for the carbon fiber boom and then we got the thin wall foam here and then we made the rudder thick and then we actually sandwich it and it's just ridiculously strong that's pretty cool pretty close they're gonna have a fixed rudder extract which is differential thrust I think I think two motors on each side like moving it back yet so he has the trucks on here on the back we got to put the nose gear on but what we don't want is we don't want to be a negative angle attack because the tail has to work really hard to try to pick up the nose we want to be slightly positive without looking like it's a tail dragger it's time to fly you guys feeling pretty good about it you know I feel better than I did yesterday but I have picked out a tree if it crashes you're gonna see me in a fetal position crying we're gonna take it we're gonna put it together outside and then we'll pick it up and we'll March it all the way through ready mate our skier Emily this is a great example of why the big projects are just a different level of commitment than your standard park flyer side plans is just because you get it built and you get it ready and then you have to take it all apart take it out to the field to put it back together again but we're getting close this is getting super exciting it's go time we're gonna get cameras ready we're gonna cameras on the plane we're gonna get chase quad ready we're gonna get the guys and we are going to fly this thing all right so so again thank you to all of our subscribers and we got a plane to fly so we are out here and it is cold oh man calm and we're like that so that's dead calm so I guess that's more a plus yes so how you guys feeling feeling pretty good this is where we do all of our sketchy big projects where we did the battleship loved it tank this is called ready-made RC runway big changes are gonna happen here this spring thanks to ready-made we're gonna send the circulates off the cell alright ready yep all right start out the engines all right good luck man guys you ready yeah why was that sketchy was that sketchier very sketchy well I wasn't ready for the power dude you know what's crazy is there's real c-130s then fly by here and they've looked they're not exactly like they're gonna be so confused today oh my gosh the press at least air Wow Maddy how's it look up in there it's humungous man like I can't get it all in one frame  laughs oh you're not over though that is my spotter yeah why the Navy it looks so good nice work yeah I'd want to go right it's got a decent speed to it was that just like a glide there that was kind of like a glide yeah I'm just gonna use this space over here now this goes and hit someone's house we're in trouble so be responsible human and play on our playground but what's it feel like what's the experience it's awesome it's awesome I just wanted trimming out a little bit it's loose a little bit to the left and I'm trying to fix that a little bit of trim it's quick so this is a true maiden flight so a lot of times when you first fly a plane the control services even if they're centered it takes a little bit of trimming to get the plane to fly straight to the tune yeah and every plane is a little bit different doesn't matter how perfect you make everything always a little trim love adrenaline it terrified I'm like I want us they get here the shot she goes oh oh yes almost vertical and it was straight up like help with power guys oh my goodness is that full throttle just about yeah that did look like Fat Albert with the J toes oh good so John is this the biggest plane you've ever made oh yeah yeah anything anywhere close to this so if you guys saw a p38 videos John was the mastermind behind those planes and also the entire master series but this is a this is on a different level not only in size but just in the scale I'd say the scale appearance of it is unlike any big project we've ever done in the detail he did I mean the trucks I keep pulling back to the trucks but like we just usually put wheels on it cuz it's not going on the ground long hopefully and in just the scale detail this takes it to a whole nother level both from size and scale how do you think your battery is because I got to come switch here I don't know I think I'm gonna bring her in for a landing okay I can follow you should we do a flatland towards us maybe are you sure you don't want to like a wing over or something I can I mean he's a he only flies like three minutes so your battery should be good yeah yeah let's do that now since our battery looks alright I'm gonna go ahead and do a traveling over over our playground here says over the house here big old I'm gonna do it look how well it handles she flies just like I almost like a four-engine guinea pig ready yeah we have a twenty two thousand million six out those wings fly she's feeling either tired hot or bull oh yeah I want to come in and okay coming in alright you're coming at us so no you can't leave me warm and flat right now guys alright here we go guys so that so this is like a trip Palmer uphill a bush style landing with the old c-130 I got faith in you that Josh set her up here just don't get your son yeah I always trying to fly close to my kid with big airplanes there we go looking good looking good [Music] what a journey specially for you John thanks for coming all the way up we're gonna need you guys help we want to do some crazy fun things we've dropped pumpkins we've dropped watermelons maybe we fly something out the back of this early launch up let us know in the comments down below and as always make sure you subscribe if you haven't yet and until next time we'll see you in the next one what apply it again no oh yeah
