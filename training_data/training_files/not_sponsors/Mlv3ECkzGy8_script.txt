twenty twenty point twenty four point six point four first time on this version we get the full-size driving computer we've got MCU to get a lot of tall corn on the left and hopefully we can make this turn we've never made it before let's slow it down give it a chance it up no I'm not gonna do it oh excuse me let's just speed up get down the road to the next part of this curve on big woods there's too many potholes I just wanted to try to drive it myself and of course this crazy house over here all right back on let's see if we can make it here without going over the double yellow because that's we've been able to make this turn no problem except going in with a double yellow after the turns over so let's try to see what we can do yeah we went over there you can see that unfortunately well give notifications we'll see in the next video I don't know unless we've got to figure this out I get the full self-driving computer hardware too so I don't know how we're gonna do full self-driving with turns like this figure it out
