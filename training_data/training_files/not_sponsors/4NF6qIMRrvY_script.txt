hello everyone this is Evan Abrams and in this video we're gonna get down to business the business of how to price motion design now I've been freelancing for a while and I often get messages like I would like a one-minute video done how much does it cost question mark the short answer is it depends and the long answer is the rest of this video so if you're just jumping into freelancing exciting world of direct to client work or maybe you're struggling with selling your creative talents or maybe you're a producer who's actually commissioning some things in which case thank you so much for watching I hope this video can give everyone a little bit of clarity on the pricing of motion design services and how you might as a freelancer negotiate that stuff I've been freelancing for over 10 years now and I'll say the process has not always been easy so I really wish a video like this was out when I started so hopefully you can spare some of your billable hours to hang it with me on this channel and learn about the pricing of motion design this video is brought to you by skill Skillshare membership and explore your creativity now there are many ways to approach pricing motion design the simplest way is to conceive of it simply as a surface we're gonna perform labor over time and get paid for that labor the only two things we need to figure out are 1 how long that thing will take to do and then 2 how much do we value our time but inside each of those parts we need to unpack quite a lot of stuff how do we figure out the value of your time the simplest minimal calculation is to first figure out how much income you expect or want to get for an entire year and then you divide that by the amount of labor the number of billable hours you're willing to put in to make that happen so when we're talking about total income we mean not just the profit that you're taking but also all the expenses such as your heat and your electricity and your internet and a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud all of these things go into your total income you're gonna need to draw down for the whole year and once we have that total we divide it by the total number of hours that you intend to be billing in order to bring that money in and remember we're only talking about billable hours so while it's tempting to think well a regular workweek is 40 hours and it's gonna be 52 of them in the year that isn't really the number of hours that you'll be billing for throughout the year so plan accordingly but once we have these two highly subjective numbers we plop them into the formula divide one by the other and suddenly you've got your hourly rate multiply that by however many hours you intend to work in a regular day and that's your day rate but it's best not to just end our journey here while this might give us kind of a minimum number we don't really know how this would respond in a market place things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them if I valued my time at $500 an hour because I intend to make 100 grand over the year and I'm only gonna work 200 hours to get it that doesn't really make sense if no one is ever willing to pay that rate it's for this reason that I really recommend you reaching out and networking with peers around you it's really important that you get with your local motion design community and figure out what rates actually may cents for other people who are currently living and working in the creative field it's a great opportunity to meet with other people who are in the same position and figure out where these numbers make sense and a lot of pricing is subjective because everyone's situation is different so if when speaking candidly with your peers you're ending up with even more subjective data don't worry there are actually a lot of surveys that have gone around to figure out what average incomes average rates are but again this might be highly subjective to your locality hopefully with these calculations to sort of figure out where your floor is kicking it around with your peers and then doing a little bit of research you should be able to arrive at a pretty reasonable rate but we now need the second half of this formula we know how much your time is worth how much of it are we gonna use estimating how long something will take you to reasonably complete is another set of highly subjective and kind of difficult things to deal with but we're really just trying to figure out what can reasonably be accomplished in the time that we have placed this value on many freelancers start out not knowing how long it would take for them personally to do a thing I actually get asked a lot how long would it take me to do a certain project and ultimately whatever answer I give is unhelpful I don't work at the same speed as other people I don't bill it the same rate as other people you need to learn and understand your own capacities this can get even more complex when you're dealing with teams of people if you're going to give a quote for a project you have three people working on it you need to understand intimately their capacity to do that job this is why if you are the one producer watching this video well thank you for coming out you really need to understand the people who are doing the labor if you're gonna give a quote on a job most of this insight comes from experience if you've never made an explainer video before then you might not know how long it will take you to personally do an explainer video however I can maybe help speed this along even if you're doing student projects or personal projects just time yourself figure out how many billable hours it would have taken you to do those projects and you'll start to have some actual data to base your quotes on so even if you're just starting out and you have no idea how long something will take the best thing to do is to break it discreet smaller chunks into recognizable categories of labor and then start to compile those all together and it'll be easier to communicate to yourself and to others where all that time and where all that cost is going and of course it stands to reason that if you are more effective and you can do more tasks in a certain amount of time your hourly rate should be higher than someone who does the same number of tasks slower so in assessing your capacities you may find you need to adjust that hourly rate up and down depending on what you're actually doing it's also worth understanding that some things are far more specialized and therefore more valuable as they're a more niche skill set so those kinds of billable hours are likely going to need to be higher than or generalized skills so once we understand your capacities we need to figure out what this potential client is actually asking you to do what is the scope of work they're actually trying to Commission the only way to figure that out is to engage in a meaningful dialogue with them if we go back to the original example where we're talking about a one-minute video the complexity of that can vary widely a one-minute animated piece that's all text animation and hard cuts between scenes there's gonna be a lot easier than something that's say a blending of 2d and 3d character work with a lot of liquid morphs between things these can both last a minute they can take an incredibly different amount of time to create so we need to make sure we're engaging with the client and understanding their goals and direction that way we're both not talking about a totally different one-minute video and honestly sometimes potential clients don't really know what they want they know they require this for some marketing directive most likely they've never commissioned something before in their life and this may be the only one they ever do so there's a big education component in here as well sometimes that means having to show examples back and forth do you want yours to be like a B or C okay well if we want to be like a it's gonna cost this much and be a little bit more so you want to be able to present sort of ranges or tiers such that people can make a reasonable estimation of where they want to be if they don't have a very clear idea and it's really vital to narrow in on how much of the labor you'll be doing will the client be providing you with as music voiceover I have they already written a script have their Eddie made an AV script and with storyboards who's doing those so figuring out who is doing what phases is really vital you can't reasonably quote on the production of something if you don't have a good understanding of all of the phases that are gonna come up to it how much of this you're expected to be doing and is it within your capacity you might even need to subcontract or outsource elements of this like sound design music but once you have a firm concept of what this thing will be that you can reasonably understand how many hours you're gonna put into it it's a lot easier to then look at your day rate estimate based on your capacity and figure it a number for this thing but wait there's more and of course that's the phrase you know is gonna come with some kind of value proposition it's important to remember that even though we're calculating based on the amount of labor and the value of that labor a motion design piece or pieces can have value beyond simply the hours it takes to make them if for example you're generating some kind of unique IP or characters for some kind of a thing that has a value beyond itself you need to consider that when making the evaluation of how much something costs then we're getting into issues of Licensing and different forms of creative services so that would probably need a whole other video on its own for now it's worth just considering what is the true value of this thing I'm putting out there ideally all business entities would be commissioning something to gain more value from it we produce advertisements so that people will buy more of the product and we will make back more than it cost to generate the advertisement we would hope so that's something to always be considering when you're creating something that has value is it worth more than the time and materials it takes to generate but once you have arrived at a price it is time to communicate it and likely negotiate it with your potential clients now I've been saying potential client this whole time because clients are people who you do labour for and exchange for money so in this initial phase quit your client yet the more of a lead or a prospect and it's important to remember that not all prospects not all leads are gonna be the right fit for you when you present a price there might be a big gap you think this project would reasonably be worth eight thousand dollars and they say no it's probably only worth like five thousand or they have some budgetary restriction or they have some subjective information that they've already cobbled together and they have an assumption about what this should be worth by having solid pricing systems that you can itemize and demonstrate why something would cost what you've said it costs it's a lot easier to say all right well we'll just spend less in this area or remove these items or do a cheaper version of this if there are all of these items to actually talk about if we're just putting one lump number on a project that's very subjective and nebulous it becomes a matter of opinion rather than an itemized list of things that we can actually move around and manipulate and ultimately not everyone is going to be able to afford the price of wonderful things you are a talented and unique individual and motion design is highly specialized labor so not everyone has the marketing budget to afford these things so while a potential client may think your value is down here but you know that it's up here that's just not gonna work out and there's no harm there not everyone can afford highly specialized labor given their limited marketing budgets that's just how it is the onus is not on you to conform to the lowest available budget certainly there is wiggle room but if you go back to your initial calculations remember at the core of your rates is an income level that needs to be satisfied so never devalue your labor costs below that threshold but the short end of it is if you're able to demonstrate how you arrived at a certain pricing structure people are more likely to agree to it because it's less unknown less nebulous and less of just a shot in the dark now this is just one take on pricing there are other forms there's other methods other systems some firms productize what they do into a menu and people can pick a B or C at whatever durations they can put a rubric together that makes it very simple but perhaps less bespoke and all of this is subject to change so as your year goes on as your career in freelance changes the way you price things may also change and you should likely revisit this stuff every year your value as a designer will only increase so it makes sense that your rates would also increase and for what it's worth the cost of living and inflation are pretty much always going up too but hopefully you have found some value here in this video if you have any questions about this kind of thing please hit me up in the comments and I'll try to get to you or hit me up on Twitter I'm a TC Abrams on there I love to chat about the business end of motion design when I'm able I've been doing this for 10 years and some people are tired of hearing me talk about it if you've enjoyed watching listening and learning here on the EC Abrams channel then please subscribe we get up new tutorials about once a week usually we're talking about technical aspects of motion design and After Effects visual effects but sometimes we get down to business - we also have a weekly live show that's coming back every Friday so stay tuned for that and there's gonna be a whole host of other series throughout the year so make sure you subscribe and turn on notifications and if you do I will see you around the internet thanks again
