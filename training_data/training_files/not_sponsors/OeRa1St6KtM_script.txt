no that's mine all right welcome to the Wynn show ladies and gentlemen's we've got a bit of an unusual show for you today James is out Luke is out everyone else wants to go home early because we were actually only in the office one day this week so the only person that I could wrangle to join me on the LAN show was the one who couldn't leave without me because I'm her carpool my wife Yvonne so guys we've got a great show for you guys today Tesla competitor riffian raises another 1.3 billion in funding meaning Tesla might actually end up with a a worthy competitor the Intel XE DG one or the creatively named dedicated graphics one graphics card has a new round of rumors Western Digital has started shipping 20 terabyte hard drives so there's definitely some room for discussion there and the iPhone 10 are remains the best-selling phone of 2019 did you have anything that you in particular wanted to talk about today I am just sitting down to look at this dock for the very first time so I think we're just gonna wing it sweet let's go ahead and roll that intro oh boy just so you know they can hear you right now oh okay now I'm just making sure you know the entire time we're live that the entire internet can hear everything you say so if you're gonna talk about you know the ball body part and just make sure sponsored by displayed honey and Squarespace all right so why don't we jump right into our first and most important topic of the day the Intel XE DG 1 so eec filings have leaked information about Intel's new dedicated graphics card so for those of you who are sort of just getting up to speed with this Intel has actually been a major supplier of computer graphics hardware for many many many years it's just that it hasn't really been computer graphics hardware that is that anyone especially wants to use now way back in the day Intel's onboard graphics were terrible and basically every meaningful way I mean you remember computers with onboard graphics yeah they're bad right yeah ok but the thing is they were bad for reasons that they aren't really bad for anymore so back in the old days when you're in your targeted graphics was on your Northbridge was where you'd usually find it so that was on your chipset separate from your CPU it would actually suck up some of your system memory I mean it's a integrated graphics still usually does that now anyway that's not the point that's not the point so it would suck up your system memory oftentimes a significant chunk of it and back when system memory was really expensive it was slow and in some cases it was not very efficient so that Northbridge would end up with like a noisy fan on it so there were other solutions Nvidia back in the end forced chipset days used to ship integrated graphics versions of their chipsets and these didn't necessarily solve the efficiency problem but they solved one of the other big problems and that's that integrated graphics used to have horrible compatibility for games let alone enough performance to run them sorry what does that sound that's the heater up there oh god someone cranked it no I think it's ok baby see it was bad for keys but I could play dangerous deep back then I can't do that anymore yeah but that's different okay that's like Dass competitive that's that's windows switching from like using a DOS kernel to the NT kernel that's not like okay okay you actually can play that game I believe that game is on good old games if you go to gog.com I bet you can find dangerous dates so you go you go on that fetch quest well I run people through what was wrong with integrated graphics gog.com okay so yeah we can talk about that a little bit I don't know what I'm gonna say about it our our Apple Pro display XDR is here so anyway the main problem was not necessarily even the performance it was just outright compatibility so either it would lack the features you know like hardware transform and lighting or whatever else or the or the most up-to-date DirectX feature set or it would just have such broken terrible drivers that even if the game should run it wouldn't it would just it would just crash all the time and so intel over the last ten years or so has come a long way so they're on board graphics are now so power efficient that they can bake them right onto the cpu themselves and still hit sub 100 watt TDP s their drivers and feature set are now basically up to date i think there's still a lot of work they could do in terms of you know catching up to what AMD and NVIDIA are doing with respect to things like sharpening filters and all these like cool features that you can enable in your games like 3d you know screenshots and all that kind of cool stuff they're a long way away from that but in terms of just basically functioning in games they are worlds ahead of where they used to be so if you've got good efficiency and you've got you know decent compatibility and you've got the feature set started down then why not scale it up now unfortunately it's not really that simple and man what do they call it gen I think is what they call their their onboard graphics that are built into their CPUs these little little tiny tiny graphics chips was never really designed to go ultra wide not not like the monitors but it was never designed to be like a wider design so they've had to reaaargh attack this basically from scratch as far as we can tell so DG one is to be a proper dedicated graphics card and initially my understanding is Intel wasn't making a ton of noise about it from like a consumer or gaming perspective but then they ran out and they hired a bunch of you know gaming and enthusiast community people to handle the messaging around this they grabbed Chris hook from AMD they grabbed Kyle Bennett actually I don't know if Kyle Bennett was on the GPU team specifically anyway he's not there anymore so the grabbed Chris hook I'm trying to think of who else they grabbed but there was this like big push towards better messaging in a better relationship with the enthusiast community and so that's got people thinking okay maybe maybe it is gonna be like a gaming graphics card alright so here's the latest information that we've got the specs include 96 execution units which incidentally seems to be the same as what they're planning to use in their next generation 10 nanometer Tiger Lake CPUs so that would put its performance on par with onboard graphics and then there's three SKUs listed DG 1 external frd one accessory kit discrete graphics DV 1 8 plus 2 and discrete graphics DG 1 6 plus 2 the latter could be designation for designations 4 gigabytes of RAM but that's not really clear so wait yes they just made a new integrated graphics card right so what we what it looks like right now is that they're gonna ship what would be integrated graphics but on a discrete card with its own frame buffer built onto it there's supposed to be really cheap or something well we don't know there is some speculation that Intel is working on drivers for like multi GPU performance scaling and so then there's some speculation that maybe this could be intended as kind of like like like a nitrous boost card for your system that only has integrated graphics and the two of them will like work together or something how many systems actually have only integrated graphics now how many people actually use only integrated graphics well lots of people do but mostly at the low end of the market so the thing about dedicated graphics is it tends not to really make a ton of sense below about the hundred dollar 120 dollar price point because there's so much cost overhead in building a card getting an hdmi license like it's like two dollars per connector or something like that like that's nothing in the context of a thousand dollar graphics card but it's a big deal when you're trying to hit $99.99 you know you got to build a you got to put a cooler on it that's another you know seven dollars or whatever like there's there's all these things that are kind of fixed costs packaging shipping and logistics just time on the SMT line as they're as they're producing the damn thing because it takes up exactly as much space as something that you could solve for 200 or 300 or 500 dollars so there's all this there's overhead even if some of it is just in the form of opportunity costs you still have to QC it the same you can't just ship a dead one so you still have to you know put it in the in the hot box and run it for 24 hours or whatever make sure it works or maybe you don't whatever but the point is there's a lot of overhead that you're saying sorry I'm distracting you but I don't know I have I have no way of knowing floatplane is fine twitch is fine and people are saying F in YouTube so I I have no way of yeah I have no way of fixing that our preview looks good and this is why this is why we've been getting really really frustrated with with YouTube streaming lately okay they're going crazy all right anyway anyway so there's all this overhead involved in building a graphics card so low end discrete cards tend not to make any sense now AMD had this idea back in the Radeon like 4,000 3000 daeso's like you know seven eight nine years ago whenever it was that one of the ways that you could make low-end cards make more sense was if they worked together with the onboard graphics that are built into your APU as AMD calls them which is a cpu with built-in graphics running in crossfire then then at least you're not throwing away one or the other you're getting the combined performance of both of them and you could you could make that kind of make sense now as soon as you get into higher end cards the overhead of trying to communicate with those on board graphics course basically means that any positive contribution is pretty much wasted but but at the very low end maybe it could make sense so that's where some of the speculation is coming from I believe it was like someone found some Linux code that seemed to suggest that Intel was working on multi-gpu the specs for this thing 768 shader units 96 execution units seem to suggest that it's going to be similarly similarly SPECT to their upcoming integrated graphics for my part I don't know I don't know if I buy it because the amount of frame buffer here doesn't make a ton of sense to me like there's no way that you'd need eight gigs of VRAM for something that's competitive with like an RX 570 or 1050 - yeah I mean I actually I guess you can get you can get rx 570s with eight gigs of VRAM can't you so if the tiger lake graphics core is similar to ice lake iris plus that would put performance of DG one at roughly a 1.5 X improvement over the 64 execution unit iris plus now putting it in 1050 Ti in RX 570 territory I mean it's not the threat to Nvidia and AMD that are especially in video that everyone out there has been hoping for but I mean I guess it's a start the thing to me that's really baffling about all of this is that Intel has been sharing such like like rice tout like juiced up looking imagery of this card like let me see if I can find it sure Intel DG one render let's have a look Intel set sights on whatever you can tell just creepy you struggles yeah I'm just trying to I'm trying to find out which ones are the ones that intel has actually shared this might just be a cool render from someone I don't know maybe and maybe I've fallen for it guys if anyone has a link to any renders that Intel has actually directly shared for their upcoming graphics card product okay so that would be good so in what world would you consider this a good thing then that Intel has made this thing yes is it just if the price is really good and it works in combination like in addition to whatever you already have oh no I mean it's undoubtedly a good thing okay so then people are just upset because it's not as good as they thought okay so it's a good thing but only for a certain customer so if you're someone who plays nothing but dota League of Legends rocket League and you want to upgrade an older system and you want and I mean for all of Intel's faults the products are reliable for the most part they make mistakes I mean I think the the the speculative execution issues you know your meltdown your specter all that kind of stuff they definitely make mistakes but when it comes to hardware engineering if nothing else they build a reliable product whether it's an SSD or a CPU or whatever the case may be so you've got this reliable brand name I mean something that graphics card makers especially the the low-end ones are notorious for is terrible warranty support so they've got that they've got the the support infrastructure set up around the world so there this this trusted company that could bring this entry-level graphics card to market for people who have an older system that they're just looking to add just enough capability to in order to play eSports titles online with their friends okay and if you're in a market like a Brazil where you have literally hundreds of percent tariffs on anything that you buy you know every ten dollars cheaper for something that's in the same performance tier as like a hundred and fifty dollar card that makes a big difference to the affordability to you especially if your income isn't very high so having more options always fantastic for the market but I think that the enthusiasts community especially with some of the hires that Intel was making around the time that the graphics unit seemed to be spinning up and Rajat Kaduri moved over from AMD and all this stuff was happening the enthusiast community I think got the idea that we were going to be looking at something very very high performance and this speculation was fueled by rumors that Intel was really targeting the data center space where they wanted to go up against things like AMD's Radeon instinct and Nvidia's Tesla cards in like supercomputing applications now that may still be possible and that may actually be why we're seeing this Linux code around multi-gpu maybe it's not about you know Intel crossfire SLI or whatever you want to call it maybe it's not about putting this discrete card into an entry level system and getting a performance boost or maybe they'll do that too because they're already working on it anyway maybe what's more likely is that we're gonna see like some honkin giant card that's got like 16 of these things on it that's all powered by like a couple of 8-pin PCIe connectors because remember guys that's what Intel does well extraordinarily efficient GPUs that you can pack right on to a CPU with that said AMD also does that very well and actually in many cases better but the point is we're talking about we're speculating about what Intel might be doing here not AMD so maybe what we're looking at then is we're looking at many of these operating on a single card many of which you could slot into a server and maybe cumulatively it has a lot of performance but that ultimately probably won't be that meaningful for enthusiasts so I think this is just a matter of enthusiasts seeing like fan renders like this which as far as we can tell is not real at all this is just concept art done by let's see a student from Brazil so people are looking at stuff like this going okay you know finally someone to you know give Nvidia some humility but but no it looks like it's been AMD recently hmm - intel yes okay - nvidia not so much nvidia is running a process node behind them and still competitive if not better at almost every price point because nvidia really over the last I mean five - not 10 I'd say ever since CUDA so yeah almost over the last ten years NVIDIA has really tried to differentiate on software because Nvidia launched some and I guess it's been probably you could say accelerated ever since their dud of a 400 series so they've launched some bad hardware products but invidious whole argument over the last you know really especially five to seven years has been right so there's the performance we can talk about FPS per dollar until we're blue in the face but that just becomes like a who can slash their price the best who can get their cost the lowest you know that's that's a that's a fool's game is is their attitude about it so they've really been focused on trying to build software that differentiates their products such that if they're ten percent slower at the same price point or if they cost fifteen percent more they're like okay well if you want GeForce experience let's say which does have redeeming features or if you want you know our awesome built-in encoder or if you want this great you know screenshotting you know feature that's built into some games or whatever the case may be then you're just gonna have to run in video things like in-home streaming they were one of the pioneers in that space I mean now anyone can do it Nvidia or AMD G syncs another example which now you can run on AMD or Nvidia it's not quite the same solution so that's kind of their whole thing is like look we built it a little better so we're just gonna charge more and AMD has competitive products but really only in the several hundred dollar range as soon as you get up into kind of the $500 or so range AMD doesn't have anything compelling as far as we can tell Radeon seven was just a way to burn through some GPU inventory that they couldn't move to their data center clients and then it was forgotten about as soon as it appeared so yeah we really we and I'm using like we I'm speaking for the entire PC enthusiasts community we want a competitor to Nvidia a legitimate competitor in the high end and we were really hoping that if AMD couldn't get their act together Intel would step in motivated by chasing that business in the data center where you can sell you know tens of thousands of GPUs on a single Pio motivated by that they would come in they would compete in the gaming space which is less lucrative but certainly a high-volume market and something that is worthwhile to participate in it's just it might be baby steps we might be looking at something that's pretty much you know for running csgo at decent frame rates on a budget and then if we're lucky it'll scale from there okay well I feel like I got a really good history lesson just now yeah hopefully hopefully the audience was into it yeah it's funny I feel like I tend to explain things more thoroughly if I can't just take for granted but the person sitting next to me already knows what I'm talking about so that's that's interesting Thanks why don't we talk about Western Digital and their 20 terabyte hard drives here is and we can we can we can talk about sort of the the technical details a little bit later so it's as opposed to by andrey ours now our journey our journey andre our Janu on the forums and we'll go through this stuff later is anybody actually asking for a 20 terabyte hard drive you are aren't you Am I I don't know you just bought a bunch of hard drives recently oh wait no not hard drives SSDs are these hard drives or SSDs are hard drives oh is this more like no that can't be right do do data centers use hard drives or SSDs they use both okay so is this more for data centers and so again here's the thing um okay so you know what fine let's run through let's run let's let's run through this so they're sampling enterprise OEMs with 20 terabyte ultra star DC hc' 650 hard drives utilizing shingled magnetic recording and helium-filled enclosure so the helium is to improve the efficiency of the drive as the platter spins because there's more air resistance although it's helium resistance now it's not air and shingled magnetic recording takes the tracks that are laid out in circles on the drive platter and actually overlaps them a little bit we've done some really good content on this in the past basically what it means is that there's no penalty while you're reading it means you can squeeze them closer together there's no penalty while you're reading it but if you need to write it well here give me another single perfect thank you if I need to change this middle shingle now I need to also delete this one so that I can get at it change it and then put this back so there is a write performance penalty with shingled magnetic Drive so Seagate has used jingled magnetic recording in their archive Series in the past and I've actually used them I have found that the right penalty particularly if it is a write once read many application doesn't really matter that much but your mileage may vary if you're gonna try and write a ton of random data to it like sequential is okay if you're just archiving like a bunch of video footage which is the only thing I was using them for in the time we hadn't deployed hey no big deal but if you're gonna hit them with a bunch of random i/o you're really gonna suffer because every single one of those bits that you need to flip is gonna have a whole bunch of them that you need to then up and move somewhere else flip it and then rewrite it's it's a total mess and really it's actually kind of akin to the way that SSDs write which is part of why writing performance on SSDs is so much worse than shingled mega drives yes guys I understand that they are functionally very different on a hardware level I just mean conceptually they are similar in that you might need to change a very small thing but you actually have to erase and move and then change it and then put other stuff back once you're done the new drives utilize nine platters you familiar --the what a hard drive platter is it's like a little metal disk little metal disk so traditional hard drives used a single platter and you could have recording space on both sides yeah now imagine the having nine you've got nine of those packed until a no wonder they need to fill it with helium in order to keep the air resistance down low enough to make this thing even reasonably efficient so if one platter goes is your whole hard drive go No if one platter goes you can in some cases we actually did a great video about this where we toured drive savers so someone like drive savers might be able to go in replace the the read head so that's like this arm yeah that stick so overall the all the different parts they might be able to replace it and then put on a new one because usually it would be that that fails not like the platter itself that fails cuz it's just it's just magnetic ones and zeros on a metal disc there's not as much to fail unless the the read head were to fail spectacularly and crash it's called a head crash if that were to hit it well they might scratch a bunch of the data but you might still be able to get a bunch of it back assuming that you can get a new read head in so anyway where was I going with this right you've got nine of these monsters you've got this immensely complicated apparatus that's required to read off of them what's that so it has a two and a half million hour MTTF mean time between failure so that's really kind of where I was eventually gonna make my way to with this so they're advertising them for their sequential write use case because yep single thing they're writing is not fast enough for random writes so here's my problem the only way that we can make hard drives faster is either by shrinking the size of the bits on the platters or by spinning them faster really that's that's it because if you think about it like the way that a record player works yeah right the only way to make the song go faster is to put the notes closer together or to spin the record faster yeah that's all that you can really do now Seagate actually is working on a dual actuator technology that would allow two separate read and write operations to take place simultaneously that's kind of cool then not the nine that are on these 20 terabyte drives they would all move together so if you need something on like the top platter the bottom one can't go get something from somewhere else well I'm getting to that okay so on paper this is great 20 terabyte drives would mean that in something like a 60 drive store inator let's just do a quick calculate I don't I don't what why is PowerShell opening wow I hate you so much okay so 60 times 20 in something like a 60 drive store Nader in a single for you rack with just 60 drives you could put 1.2 petabytes of data even if you're giving up let's say one in every six drive as you might to something like you know raid z2 or you know some some kind of parity data protection you could put a petabyte of data in a single for you rack that's incredible the problem is that the only way to speed up the performance of these drives is complicated technology like dual actuators these tiny three and a half inch enclosures spinning it faster which adds more it adds more drag as the platters spin it adds more complexity because all of a sudden everything has to be done to within failure right that's exactly where we're going with this so hard drives their capacities keep getting bigger but their performance is stuck because we can't spin them faster and we can't really put the bits meaningfully any closer together all we can do is add more platters at this point and so what that means is that a 20 terabyte drive at what is pretty typical you know let's say like a yeah these are shingled so let's say it can write at 200 megabytes a second alright so let's do let's do some quick napkin math we can do what just happened hold on 200 megabytes a second times uh hold on a second 60 seconds okay so we've managed well what can I do for you [Music] okay yeah lots of shirts that LTTE store come do we even have stock of anything right now Oh black and gold water bottles are back in stock right Oh stealth water bottles okay all right yeah we had a great holiday season thank you guys so much by the way on LTT store okay so in a minute I can write 12,000 megabytes okay so let's do times 60 again in an hour I can write seven hundred and twenty thousand megabytes so times 24 so let's say in a day all right in a day I can finally write almost the entire surface of this drive so do you remember I think we actually talked about this back when we were in university although I think it was in the context of USB thumb drives okay okay yeah I doubt you're gonna remember but okay the point is guys when we were in like probably I'd say around grade 10 USB thumb drives were like the bays they were so cool remember that I don't know about grade 10 maybe and I know I'd say University for me okay well it was it was I remember when I got my first what was it it was I think it was 16 megabytes I got my first USB thumb drive so you can remember how many megabytes are in your very first thumb drive I can't remember my birthday I remember your birthday now I forgot her birthday the first year we were dating yep I have never I have never heard the end of it as you guys can see okay so anyway back to USB thumb drives my first USB thumb drive was 16 megabytes and I was jazzed because I didn't have to use floppy disks to carry my assignments to and from school anymore like wow and I could even put files that weren't just text like if I wanted to share a cool song that I definitely got totally legally on Napster with a friend I could bring that to school and give it to them and they could transfer to their thumb drive and it was like whoa I can take this to my computer at home and put it on my my mini disc player whatever the case may be but around the time that I met you we started to run into this problem so usb3 hadn't come along yet to fix it but USB to thumb drives we're getting to the point where the capacity was so large that there were still some kind of reliability issues with them especially when you were using them on older systems but you couldn't really count on them to not have some kind of a problem if you needed to get all the data off of it in an emergency or something like that like it wasn't really safe to store that much data on this tiny thing and I remember we had this conversation do you remember this at all no I knew you were listening it's fine I listened to lots of other things it's not this part yeah yeah that's fine so the point is the point that I'm getting to and we solve that problem with faster interfaces so now you can use USB 3 or Thunderbolt 3 to read and write off of these multi terabyte portable drives and we kind of fixed it by just going really really way faster but hard drives in that time hard drives have maybe doubled in speed except that when I met you 500 gig hard drive was pretty sweet and now we're talking drives that are literally what 40 times bad size is that right am i doing the math right can help me with the math here 20 terabytes you say 500 yes yeah yeah 40 times the size so here here's my here's my rough what is this why is this full screen here's my rough napkin not here guys ah let's just make sure there's not yet nothing in committee there's my rough document so in 24 hours I can write not quite that entire Drive so at what point our hard drives just not practical for this kind of storage even if they are cheap well we might be there unless they're really cheap unless you can literally buy two three of them for the price that you could store that data on something else and then you can just have it like duplicated and in the event that something fails while you're trying to recover it you just grab it from the other one copy it over time I'm like it starts to become this very complicated data management scheme so hard drive manufacturers are still pretty bullish on their future they think the hard drive is going to be around for a good long while but I think that for general consumers who can't afford these complicated data management schemes we might be getting close to the end because I don't know about you guys but I don't necessarily want even in my home Nass I don't necessarily want a drive that remember if I'm copying this over gigabit is now gonna take more than two days I don't necessarily want to drive that in the event that I'm dealing with some kind of data emergency it's gonna take two days for me to know if it's gonna be okay and the like especially crazy thing about this is if you talk to some datacenter clients some enterprise clients they're not even asking for this Backblaze famously uses I think it's shoot don't quote me on this it's either four or six terabyte drives Backblaze drives which ones do they use and the reason is that they've found that from a from a cost per terabyte total cost of ownership perspective the newer models actually have not had a great advantage for them and they have preferred the better reliability of these less complex drives even if it means that they ultimately have to deploy more servers over more cabinets in a larger area in the data set in the data center let me just have a look so drive counts so they are using up to 14 terabyte drives now but I can't remember which one was the bulk of their storage it looks like they're using 12 terabytes now so maybe I maybe I'm mistaken on that one they did have higher failure rates with those 12 terabyte drives than they did here guys I can pull up their latest reliability report they actually publish this back in it looks like March remember to though guys that c-drive days oh wow actually those Toshiba ones are looking pretty good single failure so what are drive days the number of times it was used or like number of days it was used I think that's the total day like it's how long it's been used times the number of drives would be mine would be my understanding here so yeah it might be that that was might be that that was outdated information so either way it's gonna come down to this complex relationship between how much the drive costs versus how much it costs for the thing that it needs to go in versus how often it fails and how complex and disastrous it is when it fails some people are like what about SSH deep so SSH D is basically a small SSD that's kind of like soldered on to a hard drive and I think you may be sort of misunderstanding the purpose of sshd if you think that it's applicable here so any hard drive whether it's got a small SSD cache on it or not is ultimately limited by how fast it spins and how close the bits are and sshd takes frequently accessed data and caches it on to an SSD so that in the event that there's like a game that you always play instead of grabbing it from the magnetic platters it can grab that off the SSD and you feel like it's super responsive now usually these these SSDs are so small that something like a game wouldn't end up being cached it's more like files that Windows frequently accesses stuff like that or maybe you know components of DirectX or your graphics driver that it would access as you're loading up the game so it can accelerate almost anything but it doesn't help if the data doesn't fit in the cache so when we're talking about writing to the entire surface of a drive it would do meaningfully nothing and when you're talking about reading from the entire surface of the drive it's negligible again so it wouldn't really help with that who rates to an entire 20 terabyte hard drive over one or two days though um well okay so here's an example we're rolling a new petabyte project so I understand what you're doing deployments okay I understand during deployment but that only happens theoretically once or twice like for day-to-day use isn't this okay this is a great way to like if you don't have a lot of space in your house and you are slow mo guys or whatever and you need lots of space so another scenario and this is the dangerous scenario and it might not matter today but it might matter five years from now here's the scenario you've got eight of these things spinning in a little enclosure like this sitting on your desk one of them dies all right so that's a total of eight times twenty is a hundred and sixty terabytes of data right right hundred eighty terabytes help me know 160 terabytes of data all of it is now at risk because what does of 20 terabytes of data that now needs to be restored to another Drive now during that restore operation I pull that failed drive as soon as I possibly can I put in a new one now I need to wait two days every one of those drives has to be read entirely and one of them has to be written to entirely a process that could take over a day long some are going and I can't sleep you can commute I've gone through this before you've seen me go through this before okay maybe I don't know maybe it's just the way I used hard drives or used to use hard drives like I would write to my C Drive and everything would be a my C Drive yes if I lose a drive might like my D Drive or II drive or whatever it's fine but that was back when a hard drive might be 80 gigs so what have you got on there you got to blu-ray so so that's fine 20 terabytes you can have your whole life on 20 terabytes okay and and there's that okay there's like a psychological component to this - when people see 20 terabytes let's fill it well think about it because we've got to remember that this is from not necessarily a techie person's perspective as well when you see a 20 terabyte storage drive in your computer you might go oh gee you know I can store everything on this and people don't practice safe backup that's true I don't either so well know I I take care of it I make sure actually our stuff could be safer right now it could be safer I'm just glad it's faster it was driving me crazy I would sit there and try to open a file and would take like 10 seconds load we've been through this that was a power saving measure dumb I had the disk about how like I had the disks parked when they were not being used which by the way means they're not sitting there spinning idly which I just made it so that I never used our server at home yes I saved everything I know okay so I told very safe I told the drives not yeah that's not safe at all well because I don't have your desktop backed up at all because why would I it's just windows it's utterly meaningless at this point it doesn't do anything well yes okay so I changed it so the drives don't go to sleep you're welcome my princess I actually considered just moving the store Nadeau to home that all SSD server that's probably worth like 30 grand but Dave got mad at me he was like you what mate and so I brought it back and display twin and what do you mean I can't use power tools I just redid your office that required power tools I made those Apple pencil holders yeah I saw that huh and I factored that into my statement didn't I that was the worst dremel job that I first time using a dremel the next time it'll be a lot better will it and Alex made me wear these really really big gloves so I couldn't hold it properly yeah anyway safety first all right Tesla competitor riffian raises another 1.3 billion in funding where's my 1.3 billion in funding miss CFO over here I don't know okay well you will at some point so the original article here is actually from everywhere everyone's reporting on this Bloomberg Ars Technica of The Verge Evy manufacturer riffian established way back in 2009 actually has been playing the long game keeping news and memes and smoking weed on the largest podcasts in the world to a minimum while quietly developing their core technology in the background like their batteries power train etc it's no wonder we haven't heard of them this year they have raised funding numerous times the first round in February led by Amazon yielded 700 million in April Ford invested 500 million and in September Cox Automotive invested 350 million this is one point five five billion then led by t rowe Price associates they raised another 1.3 billion bringing the total up to two point eight five so for comparison Tesla has raised more than twenty billion in equity and debt financing over the last decade with this new funding they hope to have vehicles rolling off there once mr. mitsubishi owned plant in 2020 I think ultimately I'm going to end up being right to wait on the electric vehicle bandwagon because there's already some really interesting stuff like on the one hand you could go okay yeah well the Model S still beats Porsches is is it Porsches Model S versus poor yeah port I can so you okay yeah maybe the Model S like still beats it or whatever so I could have just as easily bought myself a Model S you know a few years back and have been enjoying it all this time that's fair enough point but the flip side of that is that at least it's a competition that we're talking about so by the time I'm ready to move on from the Volt which I still need to do a video on by the time I'm ready to move on from the Volt there could be enough competition that you can get something really sweet for a lot less than what you're spending now with that said the model 3 is looking pretty sweet I just and I thought the Tesla's we're actually holding their value really well I have so many problems with the way that Tesla does things I don't know saying that I do or don't I'm just saying they're holding their value well if what you're saying is that you're not getting into it because of price and it'll get better well I don't know yeah that's that's fair I just there's things that I don't like about the way Tesla is going about this I so three things I don't like how Tesla is approaching the right to repair thing not allowing people and non authorized repair services to have access to the tools that they need to fix the car safely I'm not a fan of what so can I just ask first year is that so I know for a lot of things like the Apple stuff you guys are super against it and I get why not for the Tesla thing is that because they have proprietary software that no one else knows and so if they tinker with it wrong then Tesla's technically on the hook they can still build tools yeah they can still build tools that will make it so other people can interface with it without giving away their proprietary software thing I don't like number two is this whole hardware as a service thing that's kind of creeping up on us so Tesla has actually developed a very good reputation for keeping the software of their cars up to date and adding new features over time but what it seems like to me is that they've been playing a very careful very intentional long game here because a recent update for the model 3 is actually a paid update so you can pay for your model 3 assuming you have the correct hardware configuration to go a little bit faster now these are things that they used to either have you buy at the time of purchase or sorry where was I going with this well you were talking about how you have to pay for that son right upgrade right or they would actually provide free upgrades over time as they realize that oh you know the battery packs can actually output a little bit more juice we can we can handle this let's let's just go ahead and roll it out and that was really cool and then now we're finding that they're putting software locks at the time of purchase instead of actually changing out the hardware depending on the features you buy so software locks made their way in I think particularly with their their autopilot features and now with performance and then now software locks are coming after the fact so they're finding ways to monetize these cars on an ongoing basis I think this is a really dangerous path to go down but I also don't know what the right solution is because what the existing big car manufacturers have been doing obviously isn't right where they just put it out in the wild and go yeah you know if it's buggy then I don't know I guess that one has issues with the CD changer that's too bad I mean roll will fix it in the next model year I guess you can just get a new car fat so that's that's not right either and I also know that ongoing software development has to be funded by something I just am NOT a huge fan of you know having my description service to your car yeah exactly having my products be like how how do we know that we're not going down a slippery slope where I have to pay on a monthly basis to have that performance or maybe oh let's turn it into a micro transaction so every time I press the pedal like you know twice hard or something I get the extra boost and it cost me 50 cents well they're not unlocking or they're not locking anything that you already getting I hope no one from Tesla is watching this right now microtransactions no but okay when you buy the tesla vehicle you're not like they're not locking something that you were already entitled to before it's just locking future stuff right so yeah what you're getting for us technically as a hardware guy I find it offensive that I paid for something that you put in there or maybe I okay maybe I didn't pay for it whatever the point is you sold me this hardware that has capability X so clearly at the price I paid let's say $50,000 you were making a profit on it and then arbitrarily you've decided that that wasn't the right amount of profit and you want a little bit more for me to get everything that I I paid for it was all there well hardware wise yeah sorry was yeah no but yeah but yeah but they did all that software development they are just artificially segmenting it and now arguably they did do additional engineering an additional software development for something like a speed boost and somebody's got to pay for that so I get it I just think it is an extremely slippery slope the last thing I don't like is I don't like their marketing I don't like them calling it autopilot I think that is extremely misleading for what the capabilities of their autonomous driving features are are you sweet are you sure it's not autopilot because I read a newspaper article about these people in Richmond who were freaking out because this car in a parking lot was driving itself to its owner right so is that so I probably I don't know no that was the I believe it was the summoning or remote control feature and yes they have features that are deployed today that are effectively your car basically driving itself as long as you have your hands on the wheel every once in a while but there are documented cases of people being literally asleep at the wheel while their Tesla rips down the freeway and I think that Tesla's marketing and branding creates a false sense of security and I think it is extraordinarily dangerous I think we're gonna have a hard enough time moving into an autonomous vehicle future without someone going in and bugging it up right at the beginning causing legislators and Luddites and all the other people who are gonna hold up signs and yell about how bad this is and they took Park cars and whatever they're gonna just add fuel to that fire and make it take longer than it has to because I want a level five autonomous vehicle as soon as possible but it's not going to happen if someone screws up at level three and then it's just illegal for the longest time even though we had the technology and it was there if only we'd been patient and we had set expectations correctly those are my three problems with Tesla those are the three reasons that I have a hard time supporting them to be clear I'm not for or against aslha I don't actually care I just wanted a vehicle that was you know the back mirror wasn't teeny-tiny and I could actually shoulder check properly so that's my only issue with the volt 100 l4u says ah dangerous Dave my childhood memories you have a you have a kindred spirit out there I've also dated myself a little bit hey dating you ain't that bad mmm side hilarious thing Rivi ins vehicles now apparently have a feature called tank turn which looks amazing I mean if you're gonna have a motor on every wheel it might as well donuts will never be the same ladies and gentlemen I think their truck looks like less ridiculous - actually it looks more like a regular yeah but it still looks kind of futuristic your penis yeah but I mean when you compare it to the cyber truck no but yes it does on its own but you can't you know dock an ATV on the back of it I guess and you don't get that I don't know like if somebody if somebody were to see the cyber truck on the road they would know immediately oh yeah its iconic oh yeah a little bit and that's not really I feel like you're kind of paying for the status symbol oh yeah definitely I mean but that's the thing Tesla's done a great job of building that brand for themselves I mean maybe part of it is I'm just like I'm trying to be contrarian maybe that's maybe that's part of it I can I can admit that hey you know I don't care hi it doesn't matter honestly I get a little annoyed when I'm shopping for a car as I was a year ago and people are just like oh you're a tech guy got a Tesla it's like it's not the only car manufacturer on earth and there are reasons that it might not be optimal yeah actually like having our hybrid vehicle plug-in hybrid like a nuclear yeah not quite the same oh really yeah a hybrid doesn't necessarily have a large enough battery pack that you drive on purely electric mmm or doesn't not doesn't well anyway have you ever gone through the rationale of why you bought what you did or are you saving that for the review I was planning to talk about it in my review of my volt that is coming and I will do eventually pretty sure it was supposed to come out like a year ago it was it was um well I won't ruin it for everybody let's just see if there's anything else that we really want to talk through the iPhone 10 art continues to be the best selling phone of 2019 in spite of the iPhone 11s launch yeah okay this is considered globally their selling price was adjusted in China and other markets this year and the 10r became even more affordable after the 11 released 11 is also on the bestseller list along with three Samsung and three Oppo smartphones if you guys want to see the whole thing it's on 9 to 5 Mac Apple inside are also reported that Apple earned 66% of the entire smartphone industries profits in 2019 that's what happens when you differentiate based on software so yeah it seems to be working out well for NVIDIA it seems to be working out just fine for Tesla and seems to be working out pretty darn well for Apple because they don't have 66% of the hardware market share selling hardware a nearly as profitable as selling software um what else we got here now this is pretty cool color ink displays are now available I'm just gonna go ahead and bring up C times com dot TW so that's pretty sick yank if you guys aren't familiar is super efficient so like on our Kindle mmm so you know you you wouldn't watch a video using an e ink display or anything like that because the whole point of it is that it only refreshes as often as the as the on screen image needs to change so that's what gives it that stunning efficiency and you basically don't need to power it once it's once it's actually got the image on screen so this is for drawing and you believe you could draw but ya know it would be I would see it as something that you could use for reading so now you could read a children's book in color on your on your reader got it yeah so oh so was it only so is this cool just because it's colored oh yeah got it okay that is really cool actually yeah a paper displays have been single-digit color in the form of like dye capsules so this contains four pigments per micro capsule for a total gambit of 32,000 colors and it cost $800 for this 13.3 inch advanced color ePaper display now obviously we're hoping for prices to come down a little bit in the long term if we're gonna be buying you know kindle readers or whatever with this technology but every time we see an advancement like this it's a matter of time before it makes its way into a reasonable price product so I'm looking forward to anything to be really cool to you know reprint stain bears or whatever it would be but it's also the ink when you have like a kid in your lap and I know them to be able to feel and touch and play but here's the thing like you got to look at sort of like macro societal changes that are taking place in the world this is me being an old person where are you gonna store all your books I know I know I got it I mean we were we were driving down the street and I was I was just looking at this building off the side and I was like they're they're building something it's a giant construction project very expensive I was like it's another one of those bloody you store things these that popular cuz I've never had one and then the moment that the words were out of my mouth I was like oh right obviously like we got into the real estate market here in Vancouver at a time when I mean we were very lucky to be able to afford a detached home when we did it was a very long time ago it was before it kind of took off like crazy it's so this was almost ten years you know almost ten years ago we bought our home together and we were also very lucky in terms of our life stage at that time so we were only 22 yeah I think so we were 22 when we were shopping and and you know getting a mortgage and all that stuff and it just so happened that Yvonne finished her program with her pharmacy degree a lot of people think that she married me for my money actually the other way around yeah so Yvonne just graduated with her pharmacy degree and then she got a job almost immediately as a pharmacy manager clearly destined for business so she had the income she was making six figures basically right at a university which was sick and then I had flunked out like two and a half years prior something like that at least two and a half years prior and I had been working that whole time now I had accumulated zero student loan debt in the time that I was in school because of the summer painting program that I was doing I was able to make it was like the worst time of my life but I was able to make enough money to entirely pay for my school just in the with my summer job which was pretty sick and I had even helped pay for some of hers and her parents it helped pay for some of hers I still had massive student loans but I wouldn't call them massive in the context of that's true you had student loans but I was also like working like during the school year during the summers trying to pay it off so basically I graduated with very little student debt and so we were in this great position where our credit was good because I had had a credit card since I the day I turned 16 I guess yeah when my parents were able to cosign with me because they were like look you need to get your credit score up there's just yeah I had like a $500 or something like that like I had a super low limit but the idea was I just needed to use it for everything pay it off on time and build up my credit score so my credit was good her credit was good yeah she had income and then because I flunked out two-and-a-half years prior with no student debt at that time I had worked for two and a half years and I had a big chunk of down payment because I had no expenses I was living with your family super weird so we were extraordinarily lucky and sometimes it's easy to forget that and we look at something like I had another one of these you starts going in and go like what is everybody using these for and I went right of course because for the price of what we paid for a detached home ten years ago people are people are Conda are buying a townhouse or condo now and it's like right where they got I mean we already struggle with like where the devil are we gonna keep like snowboards and stuff when the kids all want snowboards they're not getting snowboards is not a study but but it doesn't matter whether I know dough boards or ice skates or surfboards or bicycles even yeah where do you store this stuff and I went oh that is a market that if I was like if I had a bunch of money and I wanted to get into a business like wow the the storage business cuz that there's no shortage of people wanting to acquire more stuff but there's definitely a shortage of places to put it so I forget where I forget how I got onto this subject we were talking about Oh kids book right we're gonna put your works yeah yeah I know we're gonna have to leave it behind so we need technology that allows us to just have one thing that you you know put on the coffee table and that's it that's the that's the whoops oh sorry sorry that's it that's the family book yeah so leaders do it this makes me sad we just bought one of our kids just booked for Christmas that's one of those like you lift up the flaps and you see what's under it there there is touchscreen touchscreen yeah that's just not the same but anyway I I know I'm being kind of an old pervy little lady I got it I got it I gotta move on times you're my old lady well I think that's pretty much it for the show we should probably get home speaking of our kids and yep maybe go go get them we will see you guys again next week same Oh are we so super chest for chats yes super chats part of the show that I always end up showing up for and being like we gotta go so I remember that we have to do them yeah that makes sense viewer activity or they are these them ok don't send in anymore cuz I'm not gonna look at them thanks ska chess video Luke looks much shorter and cooler ah Corey says good holiday with your family excited for new tech yeah we did have a good good holiday thanks bite hunter thanks Aryan tryout time is this related to the older Intel GPU prototype no that was Larrabee totally unrelated no way to get that working Joseph in gurashi says try pronouncing my last name I dare you I guess I already did Alejandro says here's me on Twitter look at the video please dang it it's probably gonna be spam and I'm not promising I'm doing this kind of stuff in the future okay I cannot I read the other ones while you look for it I cannot find this easily plus one Oh from Farouk ooh plus one for Yvonne on Wine Show do Jake times are Jake and Dennis next and Rob photograpy man I'm having a hard time reading from here I think I need to get my eyes checked hi from Europe why does ltte upload a list of info to Facebook for targeted ads and how did you get my info oh good night what what why does why does ltte upload a list of info to Facebook for targeted ads we didn't we didn't upload a list of info for you to Facebook I don't know what they're talking about I think Facebook looks at your data and gathers that info for themselves Arjun uh Luke's looking jacked today bipolar princess yeh Yvonne left seeing you in videos hashtag girl power and ELT X 20/20 news actually we picked a dates but I don't know if I'm allowed to tell anyone yet but I think we're gonna be sending out a save the date soon it sounds kind of like a wedding or something but yeah anyone notice that Linus has a blue I actually did I thought it was just the light but no I was a big pop okay uh what are you like five Jack Elliott says five that worked out well Thomas her friend says really cool idea best boss ever no idea what you're talking about anymore unfortunately ah Lego lad play well I know future-proofing is a bit of a mean but what components would use to future-proof 1080p high ultra 144 Hertz for the next couple generations I wouldn't like are you running at it now then run at it now and then when it doesn't do it anymore look for an upgrade that runs it that's the best way to handle it Levi says yo bro just wanted to say I get I better get tech lengths oh yeah Tech linked is coming out today don't worry Evo cat hi Linus was the video released on floatplane about upgrading your VR running at true 60 Hertz threw me off a bit was wondering true 60 Hertz I have no idea what you're talking about my VR headset runs at 120 or 140 4 Hertz if that's what you're asking Alexis says Baudin r-tx 2070 super in part thanks to your buyer's guide oh you're very welcome Ilia you were going to deploy a new intro this year what happened we we had people working on it yeah took a while it took a long time I don't know if I like it that much no but you know what we actually did one of those troll intros and the office makeover video and I actually really liked it oh really but we just slapped back together in like 30 minutes like why don't we use that we'll see well I think I was actually supposed to be kind of an mkbhd like intro executive happy holiday to you yours thank you very much Charles Martin thank you Zak's tube thank you very much PC P XE v 50s for 180 CAD no brainer I wouldn't say that's a no-brainer purchase you can get some really nice headphones on mass drop and then pair it with a microphone and that might end up being like a I don't want say better because an all-in-one is better for some people because it's convenient but a higher-quality solution Henry Cavill according I can't read your name I'm so sorry thank you for the rubles henry cavill said on interview that he wishes to build his own gaming pc oh I don't know how to get in touch with them yeah but I'm more than open to it if you guys want to hit him up and let him know I'm super easy to get in touch with just the email on the YouTube page is that it no no not no not Twitter oh I think other people monitor your Twitter no no not in like the mentions and stuff I missed Tom no no like a direct message Lucas says I've been following you since the ncx days here's some money from Google rewards Thank You Ben Nicholson asks where are the dates gonna be confirmed for LTX I don't know I can't I can't say that guy mr. steel are there any plans to stop streaming on YouTube if problems continue and we don't really have a choice like we have to yeah we have to stream on YouTube what else are we gonna do one API is amazing to compete with CUDA okay Thank You Sabbath I think you missed a couple all right thanks Tony and thank you very much trap boy thanks Windows XP I'm fine thanks Shawn oh wait Shawn rd phone - six hundred and thirty bucks is that USD oh man like at that price I just get a one to a but it has a headphone jack the camera sucks like it sucks and like it's functional yeah like you could get an image or whatever but like it's not competitive so if you use your camera and you care about it it's like precious memories have a lot of value to me and I'll use a crappy phone experience for a better camera for sure fire in the hole is the personal VPN video still in the works absolutely yes it is mr. Devin says Janice on tech Lincoln when when more Yvonne - cuz they would actually ask Janice if she wants to talk no I don't think so I can ask her next time she's in Highlander asks is it just me or does Yvonne look bored out of her mind no no I'm good thanks Sebastian grap I'm just busy absorbing all the information thanks Dustin peepee poo-poo peepee poopie that's uh that was worth five dollars robert LTTE minecraft go live when beta is getting tons of players but clearly we passed the server launch date of December 25th it'll be done when it's done Jake and team are working on it we don't want to launch something that's not good so or not at least decent so give us time give us time dog says who's prettier Luke or Yvonne hands down Luke Wow Robert says were you able to get the LG c9 to pass hi-def audio from your PC to your receiver or did the PC only see the TV is capable of stereo not quite sure what you're talking about so the issue that I had with the DisplayPort TV is that DisplayPort does carry audio and multi-channel audio no problem but what it doesn't carry is an audio return channel so you can't go straight from your PC to your DisplayPort TV and then have an HDMI connection out to your receiver so that let's say some other device that's connected via HDMI to your receiver can also take advantage of high def audio so that's the problem is that you need this audio return channel so that everything can use it even devices that are connected directly to the TV or to the receiver both of them can take advantage of that pass-through to the receiver so wait sorry you know the one connected to the receiver that's no problem it's the one that's going through the TV that's where you run into trouble because you have to pass it through with a TV I wouldn't think that would be a problem I haven't actually checked it made sure that my center channel is running but I'm pretty sure that it is because it does have arc and you just have to if you're having trouble with it you do have to set the audio output on the TV to arc otherwise it'll use its onboard speakers so I'm not sure if that's what you're asking thanks Matt Taylor delivery date for the beta squadron shirts honestly I don't know but it should be reasonably soon given that you ordered it two weeks ago so we had the shirts in stock but they weren't printed yet but we knew we were gonna be printing them pretty soon so I believe they are printed now so it shouldn't be long but guys remember even after the holiday season the couriers are running a little behind the backlog so you can expect things to take a little longer this time of year all right Ben any plans for a non video editing workstation machine I'd love to see benchmarks for compiling Linux and Firefox mechanical engineering simulations machine learning frameworks for common applications that's the kind of thing that we would love to do more of but we really need the expertise in-house in order to make it make sense now we did do one that was focused on CAD a little while back most of those principles are still true and you could build a system around that video today but we haven't really looked at things like simulation or machine learning Payton says visiting Calgary soon places you suggest visiting I have no idea I've never been there we mean we just went to Banff that's not in Calgary oh okay sorry Alberta okay well it's like two hours I don't know if you have time to visit BAM I would it's gorgeous there ah ahahah mr. Lai OCE says Linus the only nerd who looks attractive with an earring haha thanks citrus fluke a sex I tell people LT T is great now I send the money I guess I'm a shill time to expose myself hashtag feluccas shill for ltte alright can do just a couple more here guys thanks Augusto appreciate it thanks Sergei pickles has Happy New Year to you and your crew and your beautiful family here's to another year by the way Yvan try and keep them from working too hard oh man that's a failed thing failed experiment alright um Austin would love for a shout-out for my latest dev vlog alright well there you go Austin Cameron alright that's it guys thank you very much for tuning in we will see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel next year right yeah Happy New Year everybody different that year yeah
