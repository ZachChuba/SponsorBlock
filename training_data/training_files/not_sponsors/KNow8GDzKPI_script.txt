[Music] hey guys welcome back to foundation I know it's been it's been a few weeks since I posted foundation but some of you know I am very very busy with some planet coaster projects which I'm trying to finish off so that's basically where my time went the last weeks here but we're back we're back and then we're gonna try some new stuff today guys hopefully and we have trying to evolve a lot these last few weeks here and we got a good amount of people in our town now and I see our happiness kind of went down a bit so I think what we need to do today is getting lots of these stuff built here and we need the monastery so we need to unlock we need to do is we need to get citizens so that's basically what we're just gonna gonna try to do here 82 we have there's no any people needing anything what about our job situation we have four unemployed I feel like we maybe could start building some stuff over here we have some people and so what if we actually build let us see here that's what what should we get over here we could get a sheep farm maybe we should get instead maybe a lot more cheese produce cheese in exchange for milk so if we build a few things of this over here you don't even have : on it let's fast forward here a bit let's try get some more stuff build over here so we can start a ball a bit let's fill not here like that and then next to it afterwards we build the cheese maker so get a little production chain going on over here our soldiers were victorious that's great to know so we're gonna get some more money to when they get back question is isn't it doesn't seem like that people needs housing one needs housing has to be Residential's so we already build residential Co to them they're not building anything yet I mean they still got lots of space and stuff to build on but hopefully we will get there this guy's definitely getting built now and our warriors are coming back now which is great gonna get some more resources so let's just talk at this we'll eventually do what we say monuments Church Tavern wouldn't key where we get all the good stuff down rustic Church and I guess we could try built I wish you'd do that afterwards when we build this guy so not only got some money we should build one more dairy farm actually I want to have like a date-date from Cheney and then we build the cheese maker on the side here I mean we might as well get a lot of wooden bridges just crossing over everywhere so they can go back and forth so might build one here or over here at some point I'll be pretty neat and we'll just take this guy again at some point guys I am gonna check out the mods and all that stuff they're all in here in this game but for right now I just want them to do as I say actually just get all this done first oh can I just promote all these guys boom okay so let's see here we there's not a lot of stuff going on here I wonder if they actually would build here this I bility low so she here they really want so let's just try and build a house here and see if they want to do that and I was right in the weed thing but we will remove that I jump on just curious to see how it will evolve here okay so we've got this guy almost done now our wood is going on again and now I'm in Plains we've got lots of mill - let's try see if we can get all this put together today where we build a little bridge but a little cross bridge again over here let's check this out so I really hope that at some point I knew that our villages is probably gonna leave us because it feels like we're kind of stuck right now to what we can and spawn some cows and let's get a guy over here and then let's just do like this again dance boom I wonder if we can maybe make a stone bridge but not right now now we just need to get all these guys done and then afterwards here we can build the granary so they can deliver all their stuff here somewhat like this one decided to join your village alright so if we get some people going over here now - I hope that will make our town involve a bit what is this guy standing outside in the water for yeah oh that's apparently how they fish okay well I am NOT gonna say anything so we get this done we already got a new thing going on over here right house complete how nice it got upgraded we also have a lot of military missions let some wounded wounded lots of them are and new missions I'll prepare my troops okay there's only one left right well let's just send all our high levels away maybe and then just one one level you can get trained to become something okay geez mega two and then spawn cow and one more there from there perfect okay so after we got this chain going on over here we might be able to focus on some more stuff here how much bread do we have or flour I mean how much do we help that we got plenty wine I really really want that monastery decorations stonebridge eight citizens we need that still what do we have of people hmm wouldn't keep so we build one more keep why should we build up there are three over here we got two there what if it builds him on the corner here poppy on the top I would be nice in the corner somewhat like this I hope this dot here will register I hope they can walk in here otherwise I'm just gonna somewhat try to place it somewhat like this no it's gonna be in all the wheat thing but we're gonna remove that come on someone like this yeah that works then we'll get this top on and and and a flag on the top here come on there we go then we need some banners really like the Edit these banners here a really cool just on each side here and then [Music] kind of like make a little corner to them here where they can walk in banner somewhat like this put weapons stand off and a dummy like that and then let's press the start construction I want this guy to get extended of it oh there we go an invoice let's see what he says to us I shall assist the king still like that keep my troops with me yeah let's hope they can is the high levels one so how's this going now we have we need one guy here let's get four and then cheese and milk where's the milk milk cheese there you go this should give us a lot more what's happening but not fun with working you're not fun whew that bra it's plenty of wood or is it over here maybe there's plenty of wood over here too what are you guys complaining about maybe I could build a reforestation and guy build him here like someone on the side just all themselves here chilling out let me see can we in some way or another just place him so he's not floating please come on dude like that okay new military mission is available I'm not sure we can them concerns bartender two unemployed only okay and to decided to join awesome um so this guys getting building out to so we will get some more than this guys getting built as well I am curious to why I really don't want to build anything here it would be so cool if we actually can get some houses down here you sure has promote this while we got a lot damn okay extraction I wanna something I want to do here this is obviously where they can get wood so I'm curious if we're actually so I know it says slow here but what if we just make it doable for them so they can actually just built here I really want them to build houses all the way work Tori is difficulty no let's get him home assign me as your a tree type Oak Pine sit come on yeah there we go just all of it and then let's let's just try see if it helps to get some more wood here there we go mmm and this is getting better this is gonna look nice now when we get like this little guy on the top here too and we have this guy over here milk milk cheese it feels like we really need some more cheese going on here so let's make one more cheese cheese maker let's make this in the back of it so this is just gonna be like a big cheese and milk and everything here might even make a little form as well now our soldiers is returning as well so that's good might not get so much stuff done today guys we might I will just you know make it look pretty and all again cuz oh oh we're getting new houses guys see this is what I like to see let's get some more houses built and we need food we should make a little market place over here on this side and let's take a food stall it's the perfect spot for a food stall this one is gonna sell so much I am pretty sure let's get some fencing going on here all the way to the granary this get some benches and you can sit and enjoy their food food stalls I might go here get some bells on the side and then I think we're there boom a house comfy so nice they're building up here now that's what I want you guys to do and he split over they're building houses here now - okay okay looks like it's going somewhere now guys which is nice that's what I like to see house complete house complete now they're upgrading to wouldn't keep whoa why does it always does that well look at that view now when we got that extra keep on the right side there ah love it but I feel like you guys I need to move you guys down here you guys need to move location so if we get a little farm over here as well like somewhat like here let's do that I guess we can build a keep somewhere on the on the below here to the upgrading one more house there well it's nice that they're upgrading their houses at least mmm this is not really selling anything is it it's kind of useless oh well it's over with the you can figure something over 25 people are legging food we have a lot of people who are roaming around here so let's hope this will change anything there's still plenty of milk here though hmm and also houses nice love it we should totally get that wooden bridge like here I think that will be the perfect spot cheesemaker there we go they're from the plenty of of cows here maybe we should build one more for the cows we might as well just put your here right there there's gonna be like a big farm area but I don't mind that at all alright let's see what should you sell let's sell them let's sell cheese and sign got here I mean it should work now with all this cheese we're gonna get made now 88 this guy didn't I wonder if now when they built houses up here we have a little bit but maybe maybe we should get a market down here too maybe that will get people to maybe he didn't build down here so if we just build a little tiny shop here some fencing somewhat like this oh that one was way off go stall sign and start construction boom okay well well this will definitely be way better when it's done I'm pretty sure you should should go way faster though oh we got some got some berries over here spilled to gathering huts that we've got so much florists and sing everybody should build one more granary maybe there's a lot of stuff going on over here maybe we can build him here some somewhat here and go wait for completed awsome tane crop field just make it as much as we can here we buy this - no choice thank you let's make this a huge as one there we go because then we can we have a request we didn't because then I am gonna delete you guys up here and delete this because you guys are gonna come down here and work your ass off instead how's this going well we got it up again that's good but it's not like that is making a lot of cheese though I wonder why the production is so low on the cheese I mean we got plenty of stuff going all around it right hmm four decided to come around nice so let's do that distraction that boom there for our market great oh my god what is happening look how good this city look now from a far away though okay market over here you should sell it's just selling let's let you man the berries we should get we should have a new some new people no okay are you done now you're our spawn count okay we should have got some more people now and you should get berries Bret flow and berries again there you go and then let's go over to the marketplace here and hire one guy - okay 52 villagers are lacking food damn why did that all of a sudden happen we're getting lots of people now - so I want is it because we don't have any village selling cheese you sells this guy sells their means and so anything yet what did I sell up here nothing huh interesting oh wow what is going on now we need to solve this let's build one more market that can sell some more food to these poor poor guys put him here they're gonna stand like that one more tin their food stall sign as well like here and some fencing somewhat like this you do like that and then a few benches on the side here I actually don't know I hope that one day are gonna use these pinches there we go start construction and so this will help us out a bit to maybe she will warm more like cheese maker really I guess I guess we can it's gonna be like cheese maker land I guess we can put you I'm just gonna have very ate them a little bit so they look a little bit different from each side like that but one more guys and I guess we can build a windmill in the back here I need a windmill of course we do it might be here let's get one there and then maybe we can finish it off with a wooden bridge crossing over maybe that would be cool like that boom okay let's get this built guys what about fishies do we need more fish huts I guess we can build more fish shots just build two more there you go let's build two there we go it's this guy selling he's selling now - the food went off nice that's so nice okay so we're getting like a pretty big town here now especially with this countryside over here as well so I wonder if the wooden bridge will do any good for us let's try see if it plays it like this and then have it like somewhat like this right it's a pretty nice bridge like this crossing over 210 plains we got that boom okay it's probably gonna take some time but then if we don't finish it today we'll finish it next time how's it going over here berries bread flour just get four guys over here why do I have bread when we don't have any Baker here let's take flour again for maybe it would do wonder if we actually build a baker if you want people to get down here I mean we could build a bake here around it's gonna be a little bit I want him to a little bit closer to where we have some people living so the place I'm like a little bit angled like this this should give us some some stuff while they're working fast on this bridge damn an invoice what do you have for us deliver 20 fish okay I mean we still got him still got a whole row of them like just and this right here right um so if we're just like maybe just follow still more on this side instead still this guy here the house is upgrading oh we got this don't wait I didn't manage to do it damn it Fisher how he's done great the sign guy and a sign guy oh we don't have any fair enough I mean there might be quite fast today I'm actually getting this guy built for once that's neat I hope that will give a little bit more like people walking around and stuff we need a baker over here to this little side here we'll get there who get there Oh live with 20 fish there we go but why did they make the bridge like that though it's not how I wanted the bridge they should walk over it oh well house complete upgraded that one too do you sell any fish madhu well let's get some fish in here then come on guys and we don't we don't get so many people right now one villager is like in space for housing see now every now all the troubles are coming I think still got bread we got cheese berries it should hold up though it should we do like that can you cross it so you can cross it you can yes ah this is awesome it is perfect so now we got that out of the way to guys so we got a little bridge over here got a little canal going all the way across yeah I'm pretty happy about that now we just need to get them to to take this road here back and forth we have lots of stuff to to focus on and next time guys so what are these guys my workplace is full it's full are you saying so you need a one more warehouse huh I can give you away a house let's give you a warehouse right here I know it's like in the weed and stuff but we'll change that we will change that two people here we got there what jobs do we need Baker cheese maker okay got a few people have still to get jobs let's give out those last ones and then I think we got it one day with a big happy to live here no no it's very high here where do they want to live know what I mean there is room for you guys to build there so it's not really my fault bakery let's give this guy going to and then we'll we'll cut it off guys my happiness kind of like variates a bit cheese tin milk we need one more cheese maker there you go boom alright guys I think I think that's enough for for today we managed a lot of stuff today pretty happy about that Oh our warehouse is so complete okay I'm gonna stop now guys I just need the stones to stack here and I think we took this guy's space we did so just remove all this here and then we'll give them a little bit more here maybe we can give him what's funny bit here too there you go boom alright alright guys that's enough for today we got the the stone bridge built and yeah I'm pretty pretty happy how how this looks now look at this view from here it's awesome I really really like this alright guys hope you enjoyed the video give it a like if you did and let me know your comments and thoughts down below and yeah take care guys stay safe and awesome and catch you in the next one bye
