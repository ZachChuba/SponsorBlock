foodwishes.com with chicken mushroom and rice soup that's right they say chicken soup is good for the soul but when you factor in the disease preventing qualities of mushrooms onions and garlic as well as the always comforting effects of rice this soup is good for a lot more things than just your soul like your wallet for example especially if you're cooking your own chicken and making your own broth which is why we're going to go ahead and get started by boiling a chicken so into a large soup pot i'm going to place one whole chicken along with some mirepoix which is just a fancy culinary term for celery carrots and onions and we'll also toss in a bay leaf as well and then we'll fill the pot with some nice cold fresh water and then you know the drill we will bring this up to a simmer over high heat at which point we'll back our heat down to low and simmer this gently for about an hour and a half and in the spirit of full disclosure i got pulled away in the middle of this operation so the chicken you see here simmered for about two and a half hours but in a recipe like this is still going to be just fine but anyway do as i say not as i did and then what we'll do after about an hour and a half is go ahead and pull the chicken out of the pot into a bowl where we will let it sit until it's cool enough to handle and by handle i mean separate the meat from the bones and skin oh and i should mention after you remove the chicken just leave this pot on low since we're going to need this nice hot broth later and in case you're wondering what we call this in the business is picking chicken and while you're picking your chicken you can go ahead and break this into whatever size pieces you want right i like to leave them fairly large although generally speaking i think it's a good idea that most of the pieces will fit on a spoon and once we've completed this step we will have a bowl of chicken meat that will add to our soup later as well as a bowl of skin bones and pieces that we're just too small to deal with and what we'll do is reserve that chicken meat in the fridge until we need it and of course we won't discard those scraps we can go ahead and just add those back into our broth in the soup pot which we will keep on low heat since we're going to need that shortly and that's it now that we have chicken meat and chicken broth we can move on to the mushrooms which we're going to saute in a clean pot into which we've melted a half a stick of butter on medium-high heat and just as soon as that butter turns golden brown but before it burns we will toss in our mushrooms which as you can see i've thickly sliced and then as is customary we will also add some salt and we will cook these stirring occasionally until they brown up nicely and as you well know when we saute mushrooms they start out dry but then they get wet sometimes very wet which is the heat and the salt pulling moisture out of the mushroom but if we just keep sauteing those will eventually dry out and the mushrooms will start sizzling in that butter which never evaporates by the way and if everything goes according to plan a few minutes later they should look like this and yes you could go a little longer and caramelize them even better but to be honest i was in a little bit of a hurry and determine these to be good enough and then once our mushrooms have been sauteed we'll go ahead and add some garlic as well as some diced onion in my case red onion but any onion will work and we'll go ahead and give that a stir and we'll saute our onions and garlic for about two to three minutes oh and regarding the red onions one thing i like to do is reserve a few tablespoons of those and just cover those with a little bit of red wine vinegar and then pop them in the fridge for a few hours or even overnight and what that vinegar is going to do besides giving the onions a quick pickling it's also going to turn them in even more beautiful more consistent color and then we will use those to garnish the top of our soup later and yes technically this was a flashback but anyway we'll saute those onions and garlic for a few minutes before straining in some of our beautiful and freshly made chicken stock sorry i mean chicken broth which is generally what we call things that's made with bones and meats whereas culinarily speaking stock is just made with bones having said that nobody cares and i'm going to start with four cups at this point but i'll definitely be adding some more later and while we wait for that to come back to the simmer we can go ahead and spice this up with some freshly ground black pepper as well as a few shakes of cayenne and then some fresh thyme sprigs which i'm going to add in whole here since time is by far the world's most annoying herb to pick all right true story if you start interning at a restaurant i guarantee you one of your first jobs will be picking time leaves so to avoid that unpleasant task we'll add these whole and as it cooks the leaves will fall off and we can just pull those stems out later so a little tip dedicated to the prep cooks of the world and then what we'll do once our mixture starts to simmer again is reduce our heat to medium and we'll let that cook for about 10 minutes before we add our rice which in my case is going to be a medium grain rice and i'm using a variety called kelrose which if you can find it you should definitely try but having said that any kind of rice is going to work here whether it's a long grain rice or a short grain like arborio they all will work although they'll produce different textures and require different amounts of liquid so you decide which one to dump in i mean you are after all the andrew dice clay of your chicken mushroom rice play and regardless of what you're using once we've stirred that in we are going to let that cook for about 20 minutes before we evaluate it and then eventually add our chicken and one thing we're looking for is if we have to add more liquid which we almost always do and as i stirred this i could see how much liquid the rice was absorbing and i could tell i definitely needed a couple more cups which i went ahead and tossed in oh and this would also be a great time to pull out those time stems since by now those leaves should have fallen off and that's it once we've thinned our soup out a little bit as well as de-stemmed it we will go ahead and stir in our cooked chicken meats and then all we have to do to finish this is simply let it cook for about 10 or 15 more minutes or until our chicken is thoroughly heated through and has had time to absorb all these beautiful flavors as well as our rice is fully cooked and then some okay personally i want some nice fat swelled up soft rice right this isn't the kind of recipe where we're trying to nail a perfect doneness on the rice in fact if that's what you're after you should just cook your rice separately in some of the broth and then just put that in a bowl and ladle your soup over the top but i'm not into that i want a big old pot of soft tender comforting goodness so i continued to cook mine until i was happy with how it looked and felt at which point we have to we must give it a taste since it always needs more salt and of course besides checking the taste you're also checking the doneness of your rice and for whatever reason if you wanted a thinner soup you could just use half the amount of rice or if you get to this stage and change your mind just add more broth in right that is just you cooking and there are only two ways to do something like this your way and the wrong way so please adjust this until your heart's content at which point we can go ahead and ladle that up into a warm bowl okay only a psychopath serves hot soup in a cold bowl and then as far as our finishing touches go i'm going to do a big old spoon of sour cream which by the way is why i didn't add any acidic ingredients into my soup since this is going to provide the acidity to balance the other flavors and then i also did a pinch of fresh thyme leaves as well as my quick pickled diced red onions which as you can see are now the most beautiful color of i don't know is that maroon magenta scarlet i'm not sure but i do know it's prettier than raw red onions and that's it our chicken mushroom and rice soup is ready to enjoy and i love pretty much any variation of chicken and rice soup but i really love this one because it's almost like we're doing two different kinds of meat here right we have our chunks of chicken of course but then we also have those beautifully meaty nuggets of mushroom so that really does make for a great one-two punch of savoriness and not only do i think the flavors are balanced beautifully by that sour cream and pickled onion we also get a nice textural contrast as well so to summarize i love this soup my only real regret here is not being able to eat this with my face right over the bowl since so as not to block the camera i'm sort of reaching across the counter and i'm dripping it all over and besides that the only thing i think that would have made this better is if it had been cold and wet outside when i ate it which i hope is the case for you and now that i basically wish bad weather upon you i'll just finish up by saying i really do hope you give this a try soon so please follow the links
