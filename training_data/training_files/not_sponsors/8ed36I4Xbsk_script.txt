foodwishes.com with blue cheese pop-overs that's right i am very excited to be sharing this new and possibly slightly improved pop-over recipe and while we may have tweaked the ingredient proportions a little bit we are still going to be using our foolproof cold oven method for making these and why this technique is so fun to use is that it's literally the opposite of everything every popover expert tells you you should do so basically we're going to produce something very good by culinarily speaking being very very bad so with that let's go ahead and get started by mixing up our batter which is going to start with some whole large eggs to which we will add some salt plus if you're feeling frisky a shake a cayenne and if possible try to use room temperature eggs since those tend to work out a little better we're also going to pour in some milk which ideally is not ice cold so what i like to do is zap it in the microwave for a few seconds just to sort of take the chill off and that's it we're going to finish this up with a little bit of vegetable oil plus last but not least a couple cups of all-purpose flour and once everything's in there we can go ahead and take our whisk and mix this until it's just combined and a great tip here since we're going to have to pour this stuff into muffin tins or maybe popover pans is to actually mix it up in something we can pour out of like this large measuring cup for example okay unless you're a fan of drips this really is the way to go and yes this would have been way easier to mix in a larger container but you know what i knew it would fit and i'm nothing if not stubborn so i just went slow then eventually after many many minutes of mixing it finally all came together but anyway no matter what you're using we'll go ahead and whisk this up until it's virtually smooth and that's it once we've battered our batter ingredients into a batter we will cover that in plastic and let it rest all right anywhere from an hour on the countertop to several hours or overnight in the fridge but the point is we do have to let this batter rest a little bit and while it does at some point we'll go ahead and prep our pan and by prep i mean generously greased with butter plus for a little bit of insurance we will also apply some non-stick vegetable oil spray since a very important part of popover production is being able to get them out of the pan to eat them and that's it once our pan is lubricated we'll go ahead and start filling up these cups but only like 80 of the way which if you're into fractions is four fifths and by the way one annoying thing about this recipe is that it makes enough batter for about 14 of these but i love the formula and don't want to change it so what i should be doing here is using two pans with like seven in each but for filming purposes i'm just gonna do one pan and then what we'll do once our batter's in is go ahead and top these with a little bit of blue cheese or i guess a lot if you want but when we cook with it a little bit of blue cheese goes a long way so for me a teaspoon or two is plenty but you go ahead and put it in as much as you want i mean you guys are after all the less mccanns of how to fill these pans but you should be aware of a couple things all right the more stuff you put in a popover batter the less it's going to puff up and you'll generally get a little bit of a cavity in the center which i think looks amazing but be careful we don't want to weigh these down too much and that's it once these have been cheesed we can move on to the part of the recipe that really drives the popover experts crazy since we are actually going to place this in a cold oven okay normally these cups are greased and then preheated in a really hot oven and then we have to quickly pull the pan out and add our batter which can be kind of stressful and maybe even dangerous but we're not doing it we're simply going to transfer this pan into the center of a cold oven and yes i put a drip pan underneath just in case and then once we close the door and then look at our pants reflected in the glass we will set our heat to 450 whoops there we go and then we will set our timer to 30 minutes after which if everything's gone according to plan they should look like this oh yeah that my friends is one big old batch of beautiful and by the way i said 30 minutes but it might be 35 so if after 30 minutes yours are not as big and brown and beautiful as these go ahead and give them another few minutes and yes the bottom should be golden brown as well and then what we're supposed to do here is go ahead and poke these with a knife and that's so steam can escape and a vacuum isn't formed which makes these shrink up now having said that because of our blue cheese edition these sort of form their own natural vent holes but hey poking things is fun so i went ahead and did it anyway and that's it we can go ahead and serve these immediately right out of the pan or we could transfer them to a rack like this to take some pictures and despite breaking all the rules about how these are supposed to get baked as you can see as i break one open here we have the perfect texture with that crispy flaky well-browned outside and that soft supple hollow center and i didn't bother grabbing a fork but i will rub them together so you can hear the outside oh yeah friction don't lie and as far as the taste goes i very much enjoy a plane pop-over but when you add a little bit of that slightly salty irresistibly funky blue cheese it really does take these up to a whole other level plus blue cheese is also a great pairing with any kind of roast beef which traditionally is what these would be served next to ideally with some gravy to ladle into the holes oh and speaking of roast beef once you enjoy these freshly baked and warm alongside that what we can do with the leftover cold roast beef is combine that with a split open pop over maybe swipe a little bit of mayonnaise to create one of the simplest and best sandwiches ever and we'll finish that with a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and yes you can if you want to reheat your pop-overs in a hot oven for a few minutes before you cut them open if you are going to make one of these sandwiches the next day which you really should before i sign off here i want to show you a little extra bonus footage of a test i did with these using a pop-over pan but instead of using our patented cold oven method i actually tried these in a hot oven using just a little bit of vegetable oil to grease them because i thought this pop-over pan was non-stick and while they did puff up magnificently the pen was not non-stick it was actually stick and i could not get these out and as i mentioned earlier one of the keys to popovers is being able to get them out of the pan so you can eat them so that was unfortunate but lesson learned but anyway i thought you'd enjoy seeing a few scenes of this tragic event and as you saw my actual nonstick muffin pan worked out just fine but anyway that's it how to make blue cheese popovers using the easiest most foolproof method ever invented which is why whether you're making these for a fancy roast beef dinner or just something warm to eat next to a weeknight salad i really do hope you give these a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient
