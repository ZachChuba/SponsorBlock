[Music] I may talk about this more specifically one day but for me photography is more than just a technical exercise for me it's also a spiritual practice I mean I find that if if my life is getting on top for me it's still my habit to go and pick up a camera and take a long walk because I know that walking around being present in the space that I'm in being visually aware the stuff that's going on around me recognizing good light and capturing it has a way of allowing the part of my mind that loves to worry it sort of helps it to disconnect and just to process things a bit better and just walking around I will find that it brings perspective even if I'm not specifically thinking of the things that I'm worrying about I'll give you a practical example those of you who free lights will know how easy it is to get cabin fever if you're sitting in the same space every day the place where you live and the place where you work on your iron so what I've done is I've forced myself to take a commute I mean when I had a desk job it was an hour into work everyday on a bus or a train so all I've done is said that I have to have a commute even if it's not to go anywhere I just need to go for an hour-long walk either in the morning or the evening with camera in hand just to decompress to stop obsessing about the things that could go wrong and worrying about whether or not this will work and I find just that act is super helpful to my mental state while I'm walking around and doing this kind of mental decompressing I find it amazing how often a technical truth about photography also holds a truth about the way I want to live my life in general let me give an example [Music] there's a principle which I've really started to take on board over the last few years and strictly speaking it comes more from the world of cinematography but it's changed the way I shoot across the board whether it's videos or stills and that principle is protect your highlights you might not have internalized this yet I mean it took me an embarrassingly long time to work this out for myself but think about every movie that you've ever watched that you've said to yourself that is beautifully shot it has beautiful cinematography and you'll notice one common theme through them all is they always protect their highlights that every sky you see has all the tones present even the white clouds aren't ever blown to pure white that you can see every detail and that to us signals quality because it feels more like the way we see in our daily lives with our human eye and don't get me saying that if you ever blow out highlights you've messed up and it's a bad image that's not true at all and and instills I often blow out backgrounds if I'm backlighting a subject for a portrait but it's a creative choice in general our human eye can see details and all those highlights and so when we see that in images it feels like quality to us this is why we're so obsessed with the dynamic range in our cameras because we want the widest possible gamut to take in as much of the dynamic range as possible but the thinking is so that we could start by first protecting our highlights and then keep as much information as deep into the shadows as we possibly can let me see if I can explain this so let's talk about dynamic range I know a lot of you will know about this but it's when I get us all on the same page so I want you to imagine a spectrum and on this side of the spectrum here are our darkest darks and on this side our brightest highlights and this is a we're just for argument's sake talking about the visible spectrum what we can see with the eye because we're talking photography and filmmaking now our human eye can see around 20 stops of dynamic range so we can see most things at the same time in the same moment sometimes there are limitations like if we're standing in a city in a very bright square with the Sun in our face we're not necessarily going to be able to see into the darkest alleys all that detail as well eyes might adjust for that bright sunlight we wouldn't be able to see the dark his but we can see most things most of the time and when this gets compressed because the lights quite even we can often see everything at the same time like a beautiful sunset you can see when the light softens like that and this dynamic range compresses we can see the beautiful high light tones and we can see the foreground detail but if you've ever tried to take a photograph with a camera like my Canon a TD for example of a sunset you will have found it quite frustrating because it only has about 12 stops of dynamic range so if you've got it in Auto it will just stick it right in the middle here that's where it thinks you want those 12 stops right down the middle bang and you will lose lots of that sky detail as the sunset won't look as beautiful as it looked to your eye and you'll lose a lot of the foreground information as well and then you start to get a bit clever and you work out how to shoot manual you go well I want that sky detail that's what's beautiful so you expose for the highlights you you drop your exposure down and hold the highlight details in those clouds and it looks beautiful but your foreground just goes totally black and you lose all that information because your camera can't see as much as your eye can and you have to choose somewhere along that scale a camera like the re Alexa is a fancy cinema camera that has about 15 stops of dynamic range which is closer to our human eye still not as good but it holds a lot more of those tones in place but when you're shooting for cinema and you'll see this all over the place they'll talk about exposing to the right which means they'll push this 15 stops right up to the edge here to hold the very last highlight right on the edge and then they will bring lighting onto set if they want to fill these shadows so they'll throw a light in there to fill this out or they'll allow this to fall to black which is why crunchy blacks and cinema and that contrasting look has become so popular over the years because they're holding the highlights first and the better cameras get the more they can hold the range all the way down but always they're starting right at the top here withhold these highlights I use the ATD for filming all the time and I've I've got it hacked with some flat picture profiles to just extend this a little bit and sort of cheat a little bit and and I still have to watch though because I'm trying to expose for those highlights how much of this shadow detail losing and how much is sort of turning grainy because I'm trying to bring it back but it doesn't change my mind that I always need to be wherever possible holding the highlights first and foremost because that feels most like what we see with our human eye I'll just give you a few examples to show you this from a few shows I've been watching recently this is still from mine hunter on Netflix and you can see how they're starting with these highlights in the whites and like the cuff here and they're using that as their exposure point to the right and they're letting everything else fall doc so his face is exposed well even the the sky the whites the clouds is all exposed well it's all good it means that the suits are falling very dark in places they don't care they're because they're starting with those whites making sure they're protecting their highlights and letting everything else forward in May this is from mr. robot on Amazon and this is a nut shot to me because they're exposing and they're they're protecting the highlight just out of the window that you can actually see the detail and the bricks out the window they haven't let that blow to white which a lot of shows would allow but they're even protecting that and lookout dark the whole scene Falls I mean you can't really see much detail in the left-hand side of this character and even the right-hand side is still exposed quite darkly but it creates an amazing mood this characters obviously exposed by the light from the from the laptop and then you've got a shot like this same show mr. robot again looking outside of the windows you've got everything exposed correctly outside they're making sure they're not losing any detail on those buildings outside of the window and look how dark it leaves the characters falling in the frame and you might think we shouldn't do that but they're doing it and to our eye this looks like quality cinematography by the way if you wanted to see great cinematography take a look at mr. robot they've really got some fantastic work in there and some very very interesting framing this is another show Ozark which I watch on Netflix again look they're using the the the ballast trades outside here these balconies and the Sun hitting it and this sunlight directly hitting this white wall which is going to be very bright in real life that's their starting point that everything else gets exposed left of that which means that the characters are falling quite dark and the rest of the frame is falling quite dark as well but they're okay with that because they're protecting their highlights again here same shot different angle and got this here is one of the brightest parts of the image they're protecting that highlight on his shoulder protecting these little highlights outside which means that his face is falling reasonably dark the character here is falling quite dark but they want that because this exposing making sure these highlights are correctly exposed and letting things fall slightly darker and then using it to create interesting composition is red as quality in our eyes this is from the crown on Netflix season two you can see you've got like a little highlight here coming in through the minute a little highlight here on the side of the face little highlight from the window and a very very dim highlight and then you've got these two lights those are their starting exposure points and everything else gets expose left which means so much of the frame is dark and we can't really see what's going on in it but they're using it as part of their composition and it creates such an interesting mood and all this stuff is changing the way that I'm shooting photograph some of the time I don't use this all of the time but this for example here I'm using this area here I'm exposing for the highlights in this area because it's what I want people to focus on and then I'm letting the rest of the frame for very dark most of that frame you can't see any detail but I'm using the shadows in the frame to actually create interesting shapes in the frame and to give me a frame for my subjects so you can expose for highlights and then use what falls dark in that frame is interesting compositional elements here's a very straightforward example you can see how much of this frame I have exposed so that there's very very little if any information in it at all and I'm using this as kind of a sub frames that create negative space and to draw your attention to what I am exposing for which is this guy sitting in the window and I'm exposing for the highlights on him and then letting this full dark and as a bonus it means that I've got all this nice sky detail as well which will reduce quality here's another example I took this in Madrid last year you can see this is the area that I'm exposing for these highlights and these guys coming out of that shadowy alley and because I'm exposing for the highlights here it gives me options in terms of how I can compose to create negative space with the shadows that have fallen very dark in the frame now they're easy to see example here this is what I want you to be looking at this whole area and these highlights were exposed everything else it falls to dark in the frame especially because I'm shooting JPEG on a lot of these but I'm using that limited dynamic range to create all this interesting negative space and just one more this is one I took in Rome last year again you can see the example how much of this frame is just totally dark and we can't really see what's going on I mean it's just all of this here which is creating that negative space because on some photographs now and this is sort of becoming a stylistic thing for me that I've borrowed from cinema is if I'm exposing for my highlights and protecting them it means that the shadows are gonna fall darker because of the limited dynamic range but it's giving me these really interesting compositional options in the way that I frame and expose and compose my photographs [Music] the other day I was walking around in one of these morning walk commute things I do and I've been mulling over some things that hadn't gone my way recently there'd been some setbacks and I was starting to worry is this freelance thing going to work and those of you who freelance will know how easy it is to get down about little things that happen and how you can start to obsess about the setbacks and feel like everything is going to go badly from this point on so this was kind of going on the back of my mind and at the same time I'm walking around my camera and taking shots and looking and and that little photography mantra is going through my head you know protect your highlights protect your highlights let the shadows fall where they may use them as compositional elements protect your highlights and at some point it moved from being a lesson about photography into being a lesson about life for me in that moment protect your highlights I read an article recently where psychologists were saying that our human brains have a negativity bias that over centuries of evolution just to survive we've needed to be much better at identifying dangers and seeing the negative before it gets to us then we were at identifying the positives or planning for a good future and so even though our circumstances have changed in the modern world we've still got this hardwiring in our brains that tells us that we need to see the negative and to pay close attention to it and the positive is almost a luxury in fact psychologist Rick Hanson says that our brains are like velcro for negative thoughts and they're like Teflon for positive thoughts they just slide right off on paper things aren't actually going that badly at the moment there's a lot on the horizon that looks quite hopeful that might work out in the long term but I noticed that my brain was just stacking the negatives and any positive that popped up just slipped away as fast as it occurred to me so I decided to change that and psychologists talk about the 10 second rule which is just that because we know about this mental bias we have when we have those positive thoughts we need to hold them in our conscious mind for 10 seconds which feels like a long time to give them the same opportunity to imprint on our brains as the negative thoughts and that just creates some balance in us by being conscious and being deliberate about it and it doesn't mean that you have to fake being a positive person I mean I for one am a fierce realist so any positive thought I put in there has to be fact but just by using this practice it gives those positive thoughts the same opportunity to imprint as the negative ones I know that if I'm gonna make it as a freelancer I have to put this into practice in fact I think any kind of solar pursuit requires this kind of mental discipline so you can preserve your motivation and stave off despair so whether it's your photography or your filmmaking or just your life in general protect your highlights thanks again to Sean Tucker to get 10% of your first purchase
