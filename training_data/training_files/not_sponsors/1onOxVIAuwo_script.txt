[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel and today sweetie I'm going to show you how to DIY organization things so you can use in many spaces of your home I will also share with you how you can declutter things and make some extra cash along the way it's important to declutter things you don't need or aren't using so you can get organized to bring in the new year ahead and get into the DIYs for the first DIY I'm making a marble board to place on top of the closet shelf here I use two foam boards for square mirror coasters bling round from Hobby Lobby a tape measure pen scissors and marble contact paper from Lowe's the quantity of supplies you'll need depends on the size of your shelf these are the shelves in the guestroom closet that I wanted to glam up I'm starting off by measuring this shelf so I can cut out the foam boards to fit [Music] [Music] to make sure the foam boards fit on the shelf I added both pieces on now that I see that it fits I'm going to go ahead and connect them using tape [Music] after I take them I'm going to start adding the marbled contact paper on top and use them mirror to remove the air bubbles you can use a credit card but I just use this because I already has on hand [Music] I folded the leftover contact paper at the bottom of the foam boards and placed it on top of the shelf this step is optional you can hot glue the mirrors on each side to add more glamour you can leave it without both look beautiful so it's up to you I definitely wanted to add the thick bling wrap from Hobby Lobby because the gems on here are so stunning it's already sticky so I laid it at the front of the board here's how the glam marble shelf turned out you guys it's so pretty and it was super easy to make if you don't know what to do to your closet to give it a little upgrade on a budget I highly recommend this DIY [Music] if you ever get tired of the marbled contact paper you can go ahead and change it up because it's removable let me know what you think of this first DIY I'm so excited with the outcome [Music] I showed you guys in the beginning of the video that I listed these heels in my Poshmark closet there's Steve Madden rhinestone and glitter pumps that are absolutely gorgeous I never wore them they were an impulse buy because you know I love my glam they sat in the closet looking pretty so it's definitely time to let them go I know someone will enjoy them and actually wear them so I wanted to give you a good view of them if you're interested [Music] another item I wanted to show you in video is this mini bag I have listed as well it comes with a silver chain so you can wear on your shoulder use as a crossbody bag [Music] for the second DIY you will need a small cardboard box store it can even be a shoe box you will need marble contact paper tape thin blank strips from Hobby Lobby and a box cutter and didn't need the pen after all I removed all the folding sides from the top of the box on the bottom the only part left is the bottom long folding sides to hold things in I taped the bottom and cut out contact paper and wrapped it like a present I lost footage of me wrapping and adding the bling strips around but it's pretty much self-explanatory here's how the glam storage box turned out you guys you can add wallet socks slippers magazines pictures or whatever you have in mind and I know it would make the most beautiful storage unit I'm going to show you a couple of ways you can use the storage box in different spaces for organization [Music] if you decide to recreate any of these DIYs please share them with me on instagram it's LG queen home decor I would love to see how yours turned out for the third DIY you will need contact paper foam board and scissors I'm going to be making the organization drawer for this DIY I just measured the cabinet cut out the foam board and wrapped it with contact paper I measured the little pieces I wanted T's as dividers I didn't need hot glue or anything I just made sure they fit snug to the drawer and they stayed in place these are very convenient to separate items near Dora to create a more organized space I really like how this one was really easy and affordable to make to create an expensive glam look [Music] for the last DIY you will need little gems seasoning container or an empty sawn pepper set you can find at the Dollar Tree and a hot glue gun I put some glue in the middle of the season in container and I added the gems and instead of about 30 different seasoning spices and herbs I wasn't using all of them so I emptied the ones I didn't use and turned them into my picture hanging containers you can use this idea for anything small you want to keep organized like hair clips hair bows paper clips or sewing needles I would love to know which DIY is your favorite out of all the 4 showed you in this video have some more DIYs planned out with my husband and I can't wait to share them with you guys I don't want to say
