this what they meant by play to get your license okay start the adventure late spring the lake town docks Troy Alexis Julian and Mia meet for a day of boating at the SSW edge of the ever more room in base in a large freshwater lake the lake is large covering some shutup pidgin the lake is large covering some 22,000 square miles navigating it is a task for an experienced safety conscious boater these friends boat experience ranges from high to low Mia is newest to boating as the group travels down the dock where the boat is moored Mia quiz the others on the experience okay let's go Troy Troy's the most experienced you don't need to worry I grew up on the shores of straw lake my brother Vincent I spend as much time on the water as we could I know what I'm doing Mia laughs at Troy's defensive tone Julian has some boating experience I started the boat education course but it finished it still I'm sure I know what I'm doing I've been out on the water hundreds of times should Mia believe Julian that he has been on the lake hundreds of times no you are sharp tens of times max Julian Julian does tend to exaggerate this guy I wouldn't trust a single thing coming out of that guy's mouth and Troy knows this he turns to Julian and raises his eyebrows in mock skepticism okay okay sis Julian so I've been boating just a handful times but I'm a quick learner stop exaggerating how many times you've been out on the water raising my about some mutton mock skepticism to you Troy leads the way down the dock and stops in front of an impressive boat here she is this is a lake song our ticket to paradise Julian is impressed unlocked you've unlocked your the boat achievement finally dude I finally got my the boat achievement I've been waiting at least 10 minutes for this she's fantastic Alexis eyes the vessel from bow to stern this is one of the longest boats see what's so sexual where do i [ __ ] the boat I learned to boat calm where do I where do I insert my shaft body of a vessel that's a home got it red and green lights all round light those are the side lights upper edge of a vessel that's clearly a gun way that's a gun whale that's why they're always saying in the [ __ ] boat movies have you checked the gunwale how's the gunwale they say it like three times it's too many gunwales they say I'm not I'm not fully sure that I wouldn't kill somebody getting this license that I'm about to get in under three hours the four friends climb aboard wow it feels larger than it looks to see how many people bow can hold Julian continues smugly you just have to look at the capacity plate don't tell me you didn't know but the capacity plate you know I would love to read all this information here you know they got even a math equation yeah I would like to learn that maximum number of people equals boat lengths in feet times boat length width and feet over 15 but actually I think what I'll do is I'll just just keep clicking the the I'll just keep clicking stuff yeah I think I think that'll work too great job big progress I'm really learning I think I could take it out in fact can I just go right now so what happened with the captain of the rock candy ass Alexis Troy winces and Julian looks sick the rock candy was a vessel about the same size as the lake song last Independence Day your captain took his family and some friends out on the lake to watch the fireworks sounds like it should have been fun says Mia it should have been fun but the captain was inexperienced problem was they were overloaded 27 passengers if I recall the boat was unstable the rock candy hit the wake of another vessel the capsize was anyone hurt me asked for people including the captain's wife and twin daughters they actually found claw marks in the on the underside of the cabin has it been even Julian seems affected okay that the heartless bastard that he is instead of cracking a joke like he normally would he turns to Mia you okay what a story right frustrated what kind of response is that hey this man's wife and it's twins drowned in a watery grave frustrated speaking of safety I'll go ahead and get started on our pre-departure checklist well none of the buttons don't worry it's 3:00 departure checklist Troy you seem like a nice guy but you're a bit tone-deaf now there's something bout police what is this a [ __ ] but it is like a scooby-doo murder mystery enter the store greeted by the owner mr. Willard I swear to god they're gonna be pulling the werewolf mask off this guy later then we go to mr. Willard it was you all along you were the werewolf yes and I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your about safety and your dog if you do you have a dog I just haven't I have a strong feeling this [ __ ] should have been a dog with you I hope whoever I rent the boat from doesn't see this might get a little bit awkward I'm sorry I just saw Cletus scowls oh don't start up that malarkey again Cletus Cletus [ __ ] its guide scowl two of you mr. Willard talked to me like that there were some scientists who did research on calcio me I'll darn right there were says Cletus they researched pollination of the islands rather unique flora genic research is what I heard Letus explains they first took a falcon for its size and I a bat for its sonar a tiger Hornet for his relentless hunt and kill instinct a wind go up to calcio me i'll Cades us you want to meet a mutant by the way which side of the boat is the starboard side effects of alcohol choose the ability that is most likely to be affected by alcohol in the situation Ian sees the US Navy vessel ahead and decides to move in for a closer look you're having a couple Coronas with the buddies the US Navy vessel appears in your line of sight do you a go what's up guys if a US Navy vessel is part of the training don't you think maybe I need a little more training than asked you new mystery a new grounds flash game judgment correct alcohol can cause you to make poor decisions visibility is limited but ian is in a hurry increases his speed I'm gonna go 3 action time wrong it was judgment again cuz really alcohol would impair your judgment and in any any situation doesn't have to be a navy vessel there for that to happen can just be open water as far as I can see its judgments all the way down dude its judgments all the way down even a slow to respond to another person's horn toot what was that was that a horn toot twins drowned wives the head is that that's gonna agree action time that time was reaction time Ian forgets there's a vest lowest port excite that judgment this judgment Ian's boat has a capacity for four people it takes six people out on his boat that's judgment alcohol can cause you to make poor decisions if you need judgment don't get on a boat and drink because you're gonna be all out of judgment and a little bit of reaction time troy finds a worn down sign laying on the sand and picks it up what's it say asks mia looks like part of a logo and the words genetics and field study so is that come before after i drop the anchor line as you can see here on my achievements board the boat I've got three points of progress trip planning and prep two points of progress emergency prep three points down here in mystery that's in progress the mystery bow Stern put the guy in reverse drop the anchor what happened to those genetic mutants on calcio me I'll put it in revert turn it up wind check it out for landmarks the path winds deeper okay now I'm really captivated here just wanna do something nice for my wife's birthday that's it now I'm on the island with the genetic experiments Mia stops and cups are here listening she points to the woods off the side the path it's a buzzing from up there that's the tiger Hornet that's the genetics of the tiger Hornet that they put into the bear he should run you should run the fighter gunboat save you well late afternoon is an active time for bee shut the [ __ ] up Mia how about that please don't forget to drop anchor while turning away from the shore this is for real guys if we don't disturb them they won't bother us this Troy come on let's see what's on the other side this hill this is how you die Troy I was just thinking about how I signed up to go boating and not nature hiking says Julian yeah me too Julian yeah me too suddenly the last of the fog clears away revealing a bright blue afternoon sky in the lush beauty Island the boat is nowhere to be found what do you do if you're stranded on an island with a mutant tiny Hornets that's not in the manual there they are part Thal can part bat puck Hornet just like Cletus described you should have listened to cleanness cleanness was like dude my note I know my famous Cletus and that's like a stereotypical hick name therefore you'll be less likely to listen to me or dismiss me but genuinely there's a there are bat Falcon wasps on that Island and a failed genetic experiment go at your own peril I'm speaking standard English they're coming this way and fast how the [ __ ] did this pass FDA restrictions are whoever the photo who the [ __ ] deals with both NAMM blam blah well how the [ __ ] did this pass standards that they find the paddleboards just as they left them and quickly paddle to lake song how are they gonna get me back to boat safety questions that's what I want to know that's actually what I want to know great job I made progress on the safe boat operation achievement but I'd not on mystery I made no progress on mystery like I saw like mutant Falcon bat Hornets and that's no progress on mystery but progress on boat safety got it got it no it's just so we're [ __ ] clear all their [ __ ] they're there in pursuit you guys didn't get away this is where the boat knowledge really comes in handy so I can see that the swarm is slowly gaining on him and he estimates they'll catch up to the boat very soon you reconsider the speed options aside to maintain current speeding speed up slightly or go to full speed [ __ ] that's a kick Newton state to guts just as Troy's about to pull the throttle full power he remembers the radio is broken what's ready to have to do with this I don't know it's really useless on the situation just go forward if they can think about the radio I mean you want listen to Celine Dion fine but do it later don't anyway nobody care tried your hands the throttle forward and the engine responds with a pleasing growl the lake songs bow rises into ploughing mode so Troy continues adding power until he brings the bone to a faster planning mode read more about how holes operate hmm hole displacement is limited to lower speeds moves through the water by pushing the water so we can't [ __ ] read the stupid [ __ ] newbies chasing it mate I just paid I roma stare I've almost got my boating license we have completed the boat boating equipment trip planning and prepped safe boat operation emergency prep other water activities she's got to get one more tick on the mystery that I get mine as blow approved card and get out in the open water so let's have a look here what it did happen the arrest of mr. Willard is surprising as none of the friends had suspected him I called that I didn't even know that was gonna happen if it wasn't for you or your meddling boat safety and your dog which I I just have a feeling there there could be a dog when you should be a dog with you they wonder if more arrests will come because it seems unlikely that mr. Willard was working alone I gotta be honest Lee I clicked most of this I'm not sure why resting I've been working out of cover for nearly a year now to try to solve this case and thanks to you we did it Julien is a fifth fist bump Matt grins we found the hidden stream that you reported and followed it to cave there we found the most recent stolen boat and a chop shop operation what about the mutant bee bat Falcons I want to know about that Willard clammed up says Mac but based on your hunch about Cletus well one thing left to another we found out of evidence the point to clean this as well rested they're all criminals the friends are overjoyed with the news and celebrate with a series of hoots high fives and a couple of horn toots courtesy of Julian ah as they as they celebrate to men's incarceration onward they never came back to the mutant Falcon bad bees [Music] now don't forget to check out breakout today by clicking the custom link in my description each month the ranks reset so get in there to rank up and collect some epic cosmetics [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
