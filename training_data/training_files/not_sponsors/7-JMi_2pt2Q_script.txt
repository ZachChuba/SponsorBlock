link in the description hello and welcome to up and Adam tours my name is Jade and I'll be your personal tour guide for today so you've booked in for the VIP private tour of the multiverse is that right great that's our most popular tour so take a seat get comfortable before we take off I'll just remind you of today's itinerary so today in today's tour we'll be traveling through the four layers of the multiverse as proposed by world-renowned physicist max tegmark in his book our mathematical universe they go from smallest to largest and also least controversial to most controversial these are by no means the only proposed theories about the state of our universe but today's tour will be focusing explicitly on them so are you all settled in great don't forget to fasten your seat belt and with that I think we're ready for takeoff [Music] how is that takeoff for you some of our first-time customers get a little bit startled but you seem to have handled it really well before we arrived at our first destination can I get you a beverage or anything a beer of course there you go oh look we've just arrived at our first destination the level 1 multiverse regions beyond our cosmic horizon this kind of multiverse is based on three facts that we have pretty good reason to believe one light and information travels at a finite speed to the universe as we know it had a beginning the Big Bang and 3-space goes on infinitely far in all directions putting these three facts together means that light from very far away or any kind of information for that matter takes time to get to us now since there's only been a limited amount of time for light to travel since the Big Bang then that means around us is a sphere that represents the entirety of space that we could have interacted with since the Big Bang however since we have good reason to think that space extends infinitely far there are presumably stars galaxies planets and other stuff beyond this sphere but by virtue of been beyond this sphere of influence there's no way for us to contact or gaining information about that region of space it's causally disconnected we can never interact with it all accessing this bubble is called the particle horizon now if space goes on forever then that means that there are more particle horizons spheres which are causally disconnected from the rest of the universe in fact if space is infinite then there are an infinite amount of particle horizon not only that but since there's only a finite way to arrange a given set of atoms physicists have calculated that an identical you exist about 10 to the 10 to the 29 meters away on top of that because the universe is infinite there would exist infinitely many copies of you on average every 10 to the 10 to the 29 meters away yeah things got a bit weird when we start talking about infinity this multiverse is currently the leading theory of cosmology today assuming only three facts we're pretty sure of that space is infinite that light has a finite speed and that the universe had a beginning so do you have any questions so far no great let's move on to our next destination then the level two multiverse universes with different physics as far as we can tell the story that the Big Bang model tells us about the state of a universe works incredibly well it matches experimental data to amazing precision an aspect of the Big Bang Theory is something called inflation what inflation describes is a moment just after the Big Bang where the universe expanded incredibly fast it increased the size of the universe by a factor of 10 to the power of 26 in less than 10 to the power of negative 32 seconds the context in the following 13.8 billion years since then it's increased by about the same amount before the moment where inflation began the universe was so hot and dense that the constants of nature the mass of the electron the strength of gravity and even the number of spatial dimensions were malleable and subject to change even though this expansion lasted only a fraction of a second it had the effect of freezing the values of the constants of nature in place to those we measure today but the thing is they could have been different in fact a certain branch of inflationary theory called chaotic inflation which partially takes into account quantum fluctuations posits that inflation is still going on today in other regions of space infinitely far away imagine the universe as a loaf of rising bread as the bread expands little gas pockets form where the expansion seems to stop or at least go on much slower but the rest of the loaf is still expanding it's hypothesized that each of these gas bubbles is a level one multiverse just like else except due to slightly different quantum fluctuations the physical constants are frozen at different values in each multiverse in other words each gas pocket is an infinite level one multiverse with different physics this makes up a level two multiverse you might now be seeing the meaning of the word levels each higher level multiverse contains the previous one there are an infinite number of level one multiverses contained within the level two multiverse this will become even clearer as we approach our next destination though the previous two multiverse levels have roots in cosmology the study of the very big the level 3 multiverse has roots in quantum mechanics the study of the very small it has to do with a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics called the many-worlds interpretation first proposed by Hugh Everett in 1957 oh and with that we're entering the level 3 multiverse we're experiencing a little bit of turbulence but don't worry that's totally normal as we transition between multiple in quantum theory the state of the universe is not given in classical terms such as the positions and velocities of all particles but by a mathematical object called a wavefunction superposition is the idea that a system described by a quantum wave function can be in more than one state at the same time think Schrodinger's cat being both alive and dead Hugh Everett was really concerned about what happens when we measured this wavefunction some conventional interpretations of quantum mechanics tell us that the wavefunction simply collapses probabilistically into one of the allowed outcomes that is when you open the box given some probability either the cat is alive or it's dead but Everett thought no no no there is no collapse instead you have to take the superposition seriously and consider yourself as a quantum object whatever it meant by this is that all of the different states of the wavefunction kept alive and cat dead are real before and after the measurement that by measuring the superposition we interact with it and become part of the wave function of the system that means after the measurement the total wave function is now cat alive and I saw it alive and cat dead and I saw it dead all of these outcomes exist it's just that we only perceive one of them but where did the other states go well ever it's answer is that all of the state existence separated branched universes you might have landed in the state where the cat is alive and you see it alive but there's also another almost identical universe where another you landed in the state where the cat is dead and you saw it dead so every time a quantum superposition is measured the universe splits into identical copies where the only difference is the outcome of the measured superposition although more debated and controversial than the level one and level two multiverses the level three multiverse actually adds no new types of universes whereas level one parallel universes were far away in space those of level three up right here with quantum events causing classical reality to split and diverge two parallel storylines and now it's time to move on to our final destination you might need another drink for this one there you go we're now heading to the level four multiverse and this is the most controversial one we've talked about so far it's the idea that there may be other universes out there with different mathematics this is a lot to wrap your head around but luckily for us we have quite a bit of time before we reach the next destination first we need to get familiar with the idea that our universe may be nothing more than a mathematical structure again a controversial idea so to understand this it would be pretty useful to know exactly what a mathematical structure is so let's draw an analogy with chess you're probably most familiar with this representation of chess a chessboard and pieces but chess can be represented in many different ways when newspapers print chess games they use algorithmic chess notation and when computers play chess even though it appears as a 2d board that information is expressed in lines of code yet all of these are still chess even though there are multiple representations they all describe the same game so there's a sense in which the representations themselves don't matter as tegmark says in his book it's the relations between the entities that make up the game rather than the actual entities themselves now let's take a look at this cube we're used to seeing this geometric representation but this set of numbers also describes the exact same object just in a different representation both of these representations describe the exact same object but there is only one object they both describe that is the mathematical structure the immortal thing itself stripped away of any baggage there are a lot of mathematical structures ranging from very simple to very complex now for the totally radical idea our physical universe may be at the most fundamental level nothing more than a mathematical structure it's no secret that math is exceptional at describing our universe but a very deep question is why Stephen Hawking once famously asked what is it that brings fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe I would be very interested to know your thoughts about this if you'd be so kind as to share them in the comments but tegmark proposes that at the very deepest most fundamental level of reality there is only mathematics obeying the rules of the infamous theory of everything which we have not yet found now if this is the case and we do live in a mathematical structure that abides by the equations of the theory of everything a very important question remains why these equations and not others there are many other mathematical structures besides the theory of everything so why should that be the one the universe is made of well here tegmark proposes that all mathematical structures exist as their own universes oh and look we're coming up to the level 4 multiverse right now this is the biggest multiverse level we've talked about so far with all of the previous levels contained within just our mathematical structure let's take a moment to soak in the beautiful view [Music] as we head back to earth let's reminisce about the fantastic adventures we had today our first destination was the level 1 multiverse where we found that there may be parallel the universes just like else which are contained within our universe but beyond our reach there may even be another you or an infinite number of other yous next we travel to the level two multiverse which may contain an infinite number of level 1 multiverses with different physics then we journey to the level 3 multiverse the many worlds of quantum physics we discovered that every time a wavefunction collapses a new parallel universe may be born where that story is lived out and finally the biggest multiverse of all level 4 where if we can believe that our universe may be nothing more than a mathematical structure this implies the existence of other universes with different mathematics if you were particularly link in the description of this video and that concludes our tour for today thank you for flying with up and atom tours I hope you had a wonderful time if you'd be so kind as to leave a review in the comment section that would be wonderful with love hearing from you and are always open to improvements and suggestions and with that we can put our feet up and enjoy the journey back to earth
