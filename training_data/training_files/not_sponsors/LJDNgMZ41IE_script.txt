fifteen years in the NFL have you ever seen an offense with this many weapons like the Kansas City Chiefs have right now not really not at all I mean they they operate on so many different levels I mean it's a high octane offense and once they figure you out I've been around or competed against Annie Reed coach teens often and once he gets his thumb on you it's it's you might might be night-night I've been to plenty of many times when I played against him up in feeling when I was at the Redskins and they put a 50 spot on us so that's probably the only other time I've seen a team kind of made up like this when they had to shine they had Vic they had shady they had a lot of weapons off it something you just can't double one guy because anybody could beat you at any time what the the Titans have and what have the Titans done with their team now I you guys played them earlier in the Sierra they have evolved since then right I mean Ryan Tannehill has become this special I wouldn't say they have evolved I think they figured out how to win and execute at a high level and they're in a much very similar to Baltimore and they beat Baltimore at their own game they're gonna grounded pound you play great defense try to get up on you you know maybe one or two scores and then turn into a 4-minute offensive hand the ball off to Derek Henry over and over and over again until you get tired of tackling him and then the fourth quarter he comes up being with another score and then on defense they play good sound great defense and create turnovers and get the ball back to their offense and so they're not gonna while you but they're gonna play sound football you know kind of throw back a little bit when you play them you know kind of back to them earlier in my career in the NFL so they're a little bit of a throwback style team do they have what it takes to to stop this Chiefs team that is a complete buzzsaw well hello there seeking now back to the magic defensively they gonna have to create some turnovers you know if he gets into a you know a shootout in the sense where they have to try to score 21 24 28 points they lose the game but if they can keep it low scoring create some turnovers make them kick field goals when they get into the red zone they'll have a shot definitely because nobody wants to tackle deck Henry one is when the game is tight in the fourth fourth that's what I about to say everybody talks about having to tackle Derek Henry I don't think I've heard this many elite players talk about having to tell human yeah I mean you you have to make up your mind you know and how I've competed against even last two or three years a couple of times and you he's beat me I beat him and we've had some drugs but you have to physically bring it to him all day long and as a DB I can't be mad at the DB who may be 175 190 and you got this guy that's 250 that's coming again and they cracked and you got to replace most guys don't make that business decision or even hold on and wait for the carry to come up by that time you see the stiff arms you a major mess and he's you know out the gate what is that is that like a boxer preparing for a fight on its own my hand I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to run into this I'm a hit right but but the issue is that most guys you even saw like Earl beast make a statement last week like they don't have a mindset to come out and tackle him but you do that in the first second quarter and then that third Pete pops you one time and in that third fourth quarter you like imma go in there but natura after you try to keep tackling a big man like that who's relentless
