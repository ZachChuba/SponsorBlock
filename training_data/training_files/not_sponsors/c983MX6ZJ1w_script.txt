- [Host] What do two electric long boards, a Craigslist recliner, and the Waterjet channel
all have in common? - I don't know. - [Host] So the plan here is to connect these two
boards together like this, and then mount the chair
on top of the boards, so you can ride the recliner around. So step one, cut the frame out. (hip hop music) Fun fact, these pieces were designed on emachineshop.com, all right? - For free. - [Host] Not everybody has a Waterjet, and or a machine shop really, but there are websites out there that let you design stuff and make stuff, and then they ship it to you, we just did the design part there. - Yeah we designed for free. - [Host] We designed for free and then cut for almost free. (laughing) (hip hop music) - [Man] I'm not driving straight, can we do that? Mitchell? - Stronger than weld. (hip hop music) It's just set on there right now, so ... It's gonna throw you back. (laughing) (crash) Okay, what about turning? It can kind of turn. This works too perfectly. in the merch store. - [Host] Okay so now, we need to go test this out in the wild. - You got a helmet?
