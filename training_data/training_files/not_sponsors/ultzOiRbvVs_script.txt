thanks to dashlane for sponsoring this video yo Johnny you guys script yeah toss me one you want anything specific yeah just something spooky whatcha need it for we just got a budget approve so wait if you had a budget approve that means you already have a specific title and story planned out right why do you need this random script listen Johnny I didn't hire you to ask questions can you just hand me a super and hire me at all Tim did Johnny give me a damn script or I will march right in the Tim's office right now and tell them that you grabbed my ass here thank you hey what's the movie called it's called the curse of life your own your own some periodic table [ __ ] like that I don't know Mexicans gonna love it so I just saw the curse of La Llorona that's the way they pronounce it in the movie I don't know what you want me to do I watched it last night in theaters and where do I start this movie was not what I expected going into it I thought it was gonna be a shitty jump scare fest pandering to foreign audiences like a three out of ten and even though it definitely was that like a lot it was also the worst horror movie I've ever paid to watch and I watched sinister - when it came out sinister had a part - yes it did not a good time there is so much to unpack here I was yelling the entire ride home because I was amazed at how little they cared about this story PS during this review I will be spoiling this movie and I know some people don't like spoilers I get it people don't like something being 30 days to live a better easier and safer online life thank you guys how're you guys doing and welcome back to badly viewed I got my two contestants right here by my side you guys know the drill by now the first one I hit the buzzer gets a chance to answer the question now contestants we surveyed 100 moviegoers named 5 reasons why the curse of La Llorona sucked because it's basically just a nun with a smaller budget survey says the trailer for this movie was released in October and I tweeted about it after watching it sane this honestly just gives me vibes of the nun and that's a bad thing and my oh my was i accurate my assumption I already reviewed the nun so this frustrates me to hell him back I complained that the nun was barely an important character in her own movie she wants to round a bit yelled a bit that died now we get to La Llorona who was given the same stepchild treatment she wants to round a bit yelled a bit then died I mean for [ __ ] sake - creepy women with a similar gown in Vail who have unlimited power but are still outmaneuvered by a woman working with a priest these scripts write themselves but I'll get to that in a bit are you guys gonna pass it play we're gonna play they're gonna play hey done name 5 reasons why the curse of La Llorona sucked I'm gonna say because like I don't I could have been replaced with any other villain survey says you took this potential goldmine for something genuinely creepy and just made it another movie of girls trying to break into a family song the [ __ ] disrespect I want you to look at the cover art for this movie that sure is creepy that sure gives me a vibe that I never felt during the movie for those of you unfamiliar with what Laird onna is well one you probably aren't watching this video but I'll bring you up to speed it's real quick Laird onna is an old Mexican folk tale about a woman who was charmed by a wealthy man they had two kids she figured out he was cheating so not knowing what to do with herself she drowned her two kids in the river and immediately after was overwhelmed with guilt and drowned herself and she is said to still wander the grounds constantly we've been looking for her two children and parents would tell this story to their kids to behave it's kind of [ __ ] up when I say it out loud but and although were filled in on this back story twenty minutes into the film and you know we also get a small snippet of the woman drowning her kids in the beginning of the film and she cries and speak Spanish her story doesn't matter Maya I could have been replaced with the nun Bloody Mary the boogeyman Casper back in October same tweet the first thing I said was that this should have been a foreign film set it somewhere in Mexico with Mexican actors speaking Spanish don't brush over her backstory show parents warning their kids of her of her story the way it happens in real life because when it hits close to home it's scarier but no let's just make her a spicy Valek name five reasons why the curse of Lana sucked because it's part of the conjuring universe survey says why why is this part of the conjuring universe zip wise if you haven't seen the movie the priest from Annabelle makes an appearance and is a priest again [ __ ] knowing everything about everything he even brings a banner bow for like six seconds in Boise golly that's gnarly reveal but why is that why it sucks cuz he limited this movie to this universe this could be a good enough story to be on its own why did you make it a conjuring side [ __ ] you didn't even give her flowers and dress her up nice to make her feel like the main chick she's a side [ __ ] project with side [ __ ] quality and if I'm being honest really just an advertisement for the next Annabelle movie let's be real and you know what the most fucked-up part is name five reasons why the curse of light or not because they took advantage of Hispanic audiences survey this movie was clearly made for people familiar with the story of La Llorona that's part of the reason why I wanted to see it how would they treat this material how would they treat the culture behind it and before I say anything Latin audiences were pissed from the jump when they saw the main character was played by an Italian woman and I'm not one to really get into racial politics or whatever the [ __ ] you guys call it because I'm not personally angered by that decision hire the best person for the job of course but at the same time it just seems like it would have been a smart decision to hire a Latin actress for this source material the retired priests who ends up helping the main character is played by Raymond Cruz who I'm sure Breaking Bad fans will recognize but I don't give a [ __ ] because to me he'll always be the guy from training day who says there was obviously Spanish spoken during the movie but there was never subtitles and funny enough their way of avoiding subtitles was to just have the characters translate themselves so for example you have Patricia Velasquez yelling do my dice tell me see hosts you killed my kids she'll just translate herself in real time to avoid a subtitle break and for every other one offline in Spanish it's just like if you know you know if you don't 49% of Latin audiences showed up opening weekend to see this movie and I'm assuming that was the goal you dipped your toe on the Latin pool hiring damn young B cheat as you know one of the main characters in the nun and then you just decided to go balls deep with this movie and let me just clarify before you smart asses jump in the comments yes I'm Mexican no it obviously does not seem like it I'm pale I don't get a lot of Sun because I don't move from here I'm not ashamed of my culture in any way but I'm also not gonna pretend like I'm out there fighting the fight but I still want to support these projects because I want them to be good I would love to see people like me and multiple members of my family represented on the big screen but not like this it's a prideful thing when you watch a film like this cuz you're like yo that's that's my team it's like watching the sports seem like [ __ ] yeah we out here but instead it's your race it's your culture and you're watching them and you're like [ __ ] yeah do that [ __ ] it's what we tried to represent that culture but sadly watching you rub eggs around the house to detect something wrong won't sell me it look they're doing the egg thing where they tried to find the bad with the eggs is crazy my grandma does that representation is important and this movie is doing a stellar job of it I don't know [ __ ] what anybody says you took this Mexican folk tale and made a mockery of it maybe not intentionally I've heard the director talk about this movie he does sound passionate about it but someone or multiple people or somewhere or multiple departments [ __ ] this movie up look at you guys no strikes and this close to clearing the board now then what are five reasons why the curse of lying or not sucked because it was just a bunch of jump-scares survey says this movie for the majority was just seen setting up jump scares it was so repetitive it's not even funny here's the formula start a scene with a character have them in complete silence play an unknown noise from the other room initiate suspenseful music waste a minute of the character just browsing their location cut the music have the character stared something for too long or slowly reach for an object no jump-scare character gathers themselves jump-scare you can just call out these scenes when they first start I jump easily even in bad horror movies they usually get like at least one or two over on me right la Llorona did not get me once how is your crutch not even effective [ __ ] embarrassing now it's time for fast money Mista GG up here now each of you are gonna have a separate timer to run down this movie Mista you're gonna have 30 seconds GG you're gonna have 45 and if you are able to run down the entire movie in that time period you would what $30,000 $30,000 with taxes 30 seconds on the clock the main character Anna works with child protection services and she checks on some kids who haven't shown up to school the mom seems crazy the kids are locked in the closet but it's because she was actually protecting them from La Llorona these kids get questioned and decide to use the most cryptic language possible when explaining everything and they later die because of it nice job asshats this movie checks off all the cliches random pre scene interrogation scene addict scene dumb kids who won't tell you what they've seen scene seriously nobody brings up the [ __ ] they're going through until the moms like oh we all have the same burn marks on our skin did you guys try to make eggs too Gigi get on up here come on mr. rain down probably like the whole movie already but you're still gonna get a shot your family needs you to come in clutch 45 seconds on the clock timer starts now everything brought up / shown will be called back - it's annoying this movie just gave up at the end because the last scene just becomes a trailer with long fade to black sand random shots of the family in the house this is so out of place like I don't know it looks like Quentin Tarantino's vampire self from dust Oh dawn so that's cool you know what was the scariest part of this movie for me some guy was walking down the stairs of the theater and I turned over and got spooked a little because he had an all-white jumpsuit and I thought they went all out with an IR oh you know not to make us [ __ ] our pants not the case guy with white jumpsuit also the guy sitting next to me wreaked of booze but I guess I'd break my sobriety too if I paid money to watch Velma from scooby-doo suck dick at solving mysteries jinkies she wants her children I want my money back one out of ten [ __ ] this heap of herpes I don't get ways so angry they won you guys I want to collect your prize money or
