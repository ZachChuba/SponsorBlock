this video is brought to you by escape the invasion hey brother Ben as perhaps you have heard my wife Beth and I are expecting twins next spring which has been simultaneously the most exciting and also scariest thing that has ever happened to they're going to number us obviously it has been taking up a ton of my brain space lately and since most of that space is usually just filled with extremely useful Harry Potter trivia it is no surprise that the clown princes of Hogwarts Fred and George have been on my mind and before you ask no we are 100% not naming them Fred and George if they are boys but yes they are identical anyway since I've been dwelling on the subject so much lately I thought it would be fun to celebrate the twins and count down the top 10 Fred and George moments in Harry [Music] below hope you check it out Fred and George are two of the most popular characters across all of Harry Potter and while they may seem like just the hilarious comic relief who pop up every now and then I think they serve a much larger role in terms of the overall themes of the entire story like honestly combined they might be the most pure representation of wizard culture of any other character because at its best The Wizarding World is inherently kind of silly we don't personally get to spend a lot of time there when it's like that because Harry's story gets dark pretty quickly but no matter how bad things get the twins always stay positive they break the tension and remind everyone what they're fighting for that this darkness is not normal and with that said let's just jump right in number 10 he's no Fred I am honestly woman you yes of course you knew this had to be on here I mean the twins introduction to the entire story as they board platform 9 and 3/4 is one of the most memorable it perfectly introduces the characters and more importantly it is one of Harry's very first solo experiences in the Wizarding World and it's one of humor something I'm sure that eleven-year-old Harry desperately needed in that moment as he was facing down missing the Train it's also his first real encounter with just the Weasley family at all and you know they go on to be pretty important I need jokin I am Fred number 9 next-door neighbors they seem tragically left out of the movies this happens just after mrs. Weasley finds out ron has become a prefect and goes as follows his but Ron you're not Ron held up his badge mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione's next-door neighbors said George and dignity says mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son for whatever reason following the rules at Hogwarts is just like on blast throughout the entire series the more you follow the rules the less likeable you are person and yet of course this is something mrs. Weasley would want of her son's I just love that this should be such a great moment for Ron and yet it is also just completely undercut by the attitude of literally everyone around it number 8 we are identical this takes place just before the flight of these seven Potter's everyone has taken their apologies potion and upon transforming into Harry Fred and George look at each other and exclaim wow this might sound like just a little throwaway joke but given its place in the story and be very very dangerous flight they are all about to embark on I really thought it deserved a spot on this list because it really just demonstrates why the twins are so great because in that moment everyone should rightfully be terrified of the flight to come even before they know that the Death Eaters are up there and yet as ever they are able to light a little spark of laughter and make it all just a little bit more bearable yeah oh really friends this color number seven bread and forge again I don't know why they left us out of the movie but allow me why aren't you wearing yours Ron George demanded come on get it on that lovely and warm I hate maroon Ron moan half-heartedly as he pulled it over his head hmm you're having a letter on yours George observed I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name but we're not stupid we know we're called gredin Forge yes okay maybe these steaks on year one Christmas they are not quite as high as the Battle of the seven potters but I still remember the very first time I read this line and just burst out laughing what really makes it stand out though is the way they lean into the sweaters from their mothers because by all accounts Ron and Percy have the expected reaction you'd have to getting the same sweater from your mother every year instead however even though it would appear they're making fun of the F and G on their sweaters they forced their brothers to wear them and insist that Percy yes Percy have breakfast with them because it's Christmas and family is first number six holy holy as in how George feels after losing one of his ears just one hour earlier his first words after permanently losing a body part are a joke so his twin won't be so worried about it yes it's a joke but it's also an incredibly selfless act of kindness to put the emotional needs of his brother above his own personal physical pain which has got to be really high because again he just lost his ear Fred to his credit does not miss a beat and immediately picks up on the joke and even acts insulted that the joke was a little too low-hanging fruit they relate to humor and you go for I'm holy number five not letting Harry pay after the Triwizard Tournament Harry does the very hairy thing and donates all of his 1,000 gallon prize winnings to the Weasley twins so that they can start a joke shop something they accomplished in just two years first of all I just love that area invests in this at all like of all the things he could have done with his money he decides that laughter in the face of Voldemort is the number one thing people are going to need and honestly who else could he possibly trust with such a task but this is just representative of how much Harry understands Valda Mort and what it takes to beat him because in the midst of a Baltimore rising to power Weasley wizard wheezes opens and is successful while every other shop is going out of business Frederick as people need a lot these days I reckon he's right that alone is already pretty impressive but the Weasleys go one step further when Harry finally comes to visit the shop where they refuse to let him pay for anything this is probably a fairly common practice to just like give your investors a free ride but Harry fully intends to pay and they just will not take his money which I just love although maybe they know they're just gonna make it back on wrong how much for me galleons I'm your brother ten galleons also just real quick honorable mention to you know Pooh the constipation sensation that's gripping the nation number four busting Harry out of the Dursleys okay here's what Ron and the twins know about the situation harry has not responded to some of Ron's letters that's it okay also they know he was caught doing magic once either way their solution to this problem is to steal a flying car fly it all the way across the country to a house I've never been to and rescue Harry from his bedroom now as it turns out this was the exact right move to make but what do you think about it their information wasn't even accurate they thought the Dursleys were to blame for everything but actually it was Dobby either way the massive overreaction to simple bad news and the use of muggle tricks to get through some of those locks that is mischief enough for number 4 which brings us to a number three shutting down Zacharias Smith yes I won't blame you if you've forgotten this tiny particular moment as it is a bit fleeting and not particularly hilarious but I do think it is a very powerful moment at the first meeting of Dumbledore's Army at the hogshead before they even have that name yet Harry is struggling to explain to the crowd how difficult it is to fight the dark arts and largely they just seem interested in hearing more about how Cedric died not gonna talk about Cedric so that's why you hate you might as well clear out now Harry and his humility refuses to take very much responsibility at all for most of his very heroic actions across the first few books nonetheless however the crowd is bolstering him until Zacharias Smith speaks up the exchange goes like this no said Harry no okay I know I did a bits of it without help but the point I'm trying to make is are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff said Zacharias man and although Harry has many defenders it is Fred and George who speak up that's not what he said snarled Fred Weasley would you like us to clean out your ears for you inquired George pulling out long and lethal looking metal instrument from inside one of the zanko's bags or any part of your body really we're not fussy where we stick this first of all what do you really think that metal instrument was and second of all yes at this point a bunch of people have sort of yelled at Zacharias Smith for countering Harry but Fred and George to me stick out for a few reasons first of all their support of Harry in this situation carries a lot of weight because in all likelihood I think Fred and George are probably the most popular kids in school they are beaters on the Gryffindor Quidditch team they are very talented wizards who love showing off all of their new inventions they are known class clowns and perhaps most importantly are among the oldest students at the bar now I'm sure I don't need to explain to you how seniority in high school works but basically the higher your year the more seniority you have and threaded George with all of their social status would typically be the natural leaders in this situation instead they talented upperclassmen who are good at magic choose to support Harry as their leader which speaks not just volumes about them but volumes to the room about Harry and quickly after everyone signs up for Dumbledore's Army number two giving Harry the marauders map I mean what did you expect if there's one plot point involving the twins that has the greatest effect on the rest of the story this is it not only does this act affect so much of the rest of the story but it is also insanely generous of them there are only 50 years at the time and even though sure they've a memorized route the secret passages are they can still use them after like see where everyone else is at any given moment they could still use it for another two and a half years and instead they give it to Harry of course the fact that they had the bat the whole time always brings up the question how did they not see Pettigrew sharing a bed with Ron a question our good buddy Seamus Gorman did an excellent job of answering but the short answer to which I subscribe to is that only the Marauders could see the Marauders on the map this scene right here where Harry can see Pettigrew doesn't happen to the books doesn't count which leaves us with just number one The Great Escape seriously what else could it even meet I mean there's not even much more to say about it as it largely speaks for itself but Fernand George's exit from the castle in order of the Phoenix is legendary not only do this out of a ton of fireworks for the school which serves as advertising for their future shop but they also basically incite a rebellion in everyone from peeves who would never listen to anybody to the students and even the staff personally I really love these swamp they set up in the corner and extra extra love that when Flitwick finally removes it he leaves a small corner of it as a tribute to the talented wizards who set it up and there you go guys the top 10 Fred and George moments in Harry Potter I would also like to give one last final honorable mention to a near one when they enchant the snow balls to hit Quirrell on the back of the head because inadvertently they're heading Voldemort in the face with snowballs and I love that but Ben my question for you and everyone else is what are you are a favorite Fred and George moments did I leave any
