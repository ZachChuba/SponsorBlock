see psychic the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video during games come 2019 I was just meeting up with gigabyte randomly to have dinner we had a discussion about what's just going on in the hardware industry talking obviously about Rison 3000 also world x5 70 and what makes the most sense when you're pairing memory sticks with Rison 3000 and I was under the impression that thirty six hundred and thirty eight hundred megahertz would be the most ideal or the highest memory speed you should run with Rison three thousand keeping in mind that the Infinity fabric clock should run in synchronous mode with the memory speeds and then gigabyte said hey we have something internally that we didn't release yet but we can send it to you and you can test it because we have something that has a much higher memory speed and typically can beat 3600 to 3800 and it was like now that sounds interesting and that's what we're going to test today after Gamescom I received a package from gigabyte including an x5 70 arrows elite motherboard and for memory dims two sticks were rated with a 49 33 megahertz SEL 18 and the other two sticks were rated with 5000 megahertz CL 18 and that's extremely much I've seen memory modules before with such speeds but never in retail only like special bins for overclockers but nothing like this where you really have them like printed like that on a module and seems to be rock stable and when I saw those modules I was like ok maybe those modules support those speeds but then what about the CPU and what about the mainboard how much tweaking is necessary to get this to run that's typically what we had with let's say C 3 90 and 99 hundred K we saw a lot of like theoretical values and benchmarks at like 4600 4800 benchmarks from vendors but to reproduce it was really really difficult and my approach was to simply go into BIOS and loader XMP profile and it worked those are the settings I'm currently using so running for G on the CPU just to have a stable CPU clock under under all conditions when you do benchmarks it's or it can be difficult if you have a boost or you don't know what kind of boost condition your ends or it could in could have an impact when your benchmark values that's why I fixed all the CPU cores to 4G for my testing yeah loaded to the XMP profile you can see 5 gigahertz on the memory CL 18:27 2738 it's showing 1.2 volts here which is obviously not correct if you just look at the modules themselves the 49:33 are rated with 1.5 volt and the 5 gigahertz modules are rated with 1.5 5 volts which sounds much I also applied this voltage you can see I'm using one point five seven right now because I tried to push those modules even higher but we can just lower that back to one point five five four now that was running rock stable and talking about the voltage or just the general settings I was wondering what kind of ICS are on those memory sticks because if you take a look at the memory C memory timings we have CL 18 and then it's TR CD 27 and that's I would say unusually high if we're just working with Samsung VI for example let's take a look at those g.skill tradency neo sticks which are the new Trident C sticks from G scale they're rated at 3600 CL 16 16 16 36 and that's what's what people are usually used to so TR C T the second value is pretty much the same value as CL that's very common if you use for example the samsung be die memory memories and then we're seeing like 18 27 27 I decided to just take off the memory hits better of the 4933 modules and take a look what's underneath underneath we can see a pretty simple memory module there is no RGB on there because I heard in the past that sometimes RGB can have a negative impact or influence on a signal quality maybe that's one reason why there is no RGB on those modules and if we take a closer look at the memory ICS themselves we can see there is a small M on there which is an indicator that those ICS are from micron those are not Samsung ICS and if we read the marking on the IC itself it says d9 WF l using Google I just checked what those ICS are rated at I did some more research and requested some data sheets from some friends because those data sheets are not publicly available at least from what I could see and those memory ICS are rated at 3200 1.2 volts so you can run a 3200 out-of-the-box with those memory ICS with all of them because typically let's say even the tried and z RGB memory modules all of them are built so all of them are tested if they can pass those speeds but if you take one of those d9 WFL memory ICS all of them are capable of 3200 at 1.2 volts which means if you're all the vaulting them let's say 2 1.35 1.4 volt which is extremely common you should be able to run a 3600 or 4G across all of those memory sticks I don't think that there is much meaning required to hit like 3600 up to 4G and those memory ICS are called micron edye and they're quite famous right now already because micron managed or I think it was ballistics managed to set some world records with those ICS I think they reached about about 6g so six thousand eggs and that's I think extremely impressive and you can judge most likely by just looking at a TR CD value when there is like 1827 that's a good indicator to have micron especially if you're aiming to get like ballistics modules most of them or all of them should be micron I'm not sure how you can be sure to get the d9 WFL ICS that are on those extremely high bins sticks now a lot of people might be wondering is it a problem if you're running 1.5 to 1.5 v vedyam on your memory modules is that a problem for the memory controller from what I've heard it's not I personally ran some tests above two volt for multiple times and it was never an issue I talked to most of the main board vendors and they also confirmed to me that they are not aware of any problems with high medium and the CPU imc seems to be no problem whatsoever and those micro noises are rated at maximum operating voltage of 1.5 volts so I see wise that should be no problem at all I mean if they're rated at 1.5 volt and you're pushing them to 1.5 v that's just small over voltage and I think that should be safe it's the same what we're doing every single day when we're overclocking CPUs we're always running them outside spec and you know how how rare it is to really encounter problems if you're increasing it only by such a very small margin most of you are already aware about this but I will just repeat it once again so for example on the 3900 X rise in three thousands of views we have three chips in total we have one bigger chip in the middle that contains for example the memory controller we have two smaller chips on the bottom those are containing the CPU cores and the memory controller and the CPU cores those are connected with the fabric clock and in the ideal condition the fabric clock is half of the memory clock so for example we're running those tried NC neo memory modules with 3600 CL 16 and in this condition your fabric clock ideally should be 1800 megahertz and then your fabric and memory clock are running in synchronous mode which leads to the best latency and typically to the best performance but we can also run for example the 5g that we are just doing right now you can see in cpu-z I'm running 20 500 megahertz on the memory which is then with double data rate 5 gigahertz and if we switch over to the rise in master you can see fabric clock it's German but this is the fabric clock with 1800 megahertz don't be confused with what shows the Northbridge frequency in cpu-z some people are confused or I was also confused because I thought for this board it would reach the fabric clock but it's not it's reading a different one so just to be sure if you're checking your fabric clock maybe with rising master and check for fabric clock right here in this condition we are not running the synchronous mode we're running the asynchronous mode and the synchronous mode it's nothing bad but it's adding a latency penalty because the data has to be synchronized again once in the memory controller and that is typically adding a penalty of 8 to 12 nanoseconds from my experience and yeah that leads to a performance penalty as well depending on what kind of benchmark what kind of condition you're running you're encountering a penalty in performance but we can just simply run aida64 cache and memory bench might just to show you that this system is really running I performed a ton of tests over the last three days all the configurations I tested even this is mem tests tables prime95 stable tested multiple multiple applications like 7-zip or Adobe Premiere so this is rock stable you can see the read performance is 5,600 while the write performance is almost also 5655 900 right now copy is even higher that is extremely impressive on this configuration we are above 60 hundred mega megabyte per second in copy yeah you can see 60 466 obviously currently I'm also running CPU Z and rise master in background typically from performing benchmarks I'm closing all applications in the background which I didn't do right now so this is a little bit different from my benchmark values which I took over the last three days but you can see 75 points 7 nanoseconds right here on latency which is a little bit higher than what you would see you if you're running let's say 3,600 in synchronous mode in with 1800 infinity fabric so that's obviously the negative aspect but this is running rock stable but let's just take a look at some benchmarks so we can really see if there's a benefit running this configuration or not before we start off with the benchmarks a quick comparison with a CPU speed because I was running all benchmarks at 4 gigahertz and I was not sure if this is enough or if there is a limitation to the CPU and that's why it the second quick test with 4.3 gigahertz on the CPU you can see the top line is 5 gigahertz on the memory CL 18 with 4 gigahertz on the CPU bottom row is 5 gigahertz again a memory CL 18 but 4.3 eager Hertz on the CPU read write copy values are basically the same those are the average out of 3 runs but I would say that's kind of measurement tolerance what we see the fluctuation between those runs so I would say there is no limitation by running the CPU just at 4 gigahertz starting off with aida64 read tests and just a quick explanation you can see the green lines are the 5 gigahertz modules from gigabyte everything that is marked blue is running in synchronous mode and everything that is Mike yellow is running in a synchronous mode the line in between with this blue pattern the 3800 C 16 and 1900 on the fabric clock is not stable this one did not pass mmmm tests or prime95 I still kept it in there because it was stable enough to pass the ADA 64 test just for you as comparison values but this is not 24/7 stable that's why gave it a special marking going back to the chart itself you can see that the chart is led by the 5 gigabyte C 18 with 1867 obviously not every CPU can run 1867 so that you should be kind of careful with those values same goes with the one that's underneath with 37 33 megahertz C 16 running in synchronous mode those are the G scale sticks with 1867 on the fabric with 57 gigabyte per second but the values underneath are more values that you would be able with most of the CPUs so 5 gigahertz on the memory modules CL 18 with 1800 resulting in 56 400 megabyte per second followed by the 3600 1800 which is the most common I would say high-end configuration on Rison 3000 so 3600 CL 16 running in synchronous mode resulting in 55 megabyte per second and everything underneath or you can straight see the penalty if you compare the 3600 1800 to 3600 1867 you can see even though the fabric clock is higher with 1867 the resulting speed is lower and that's due to the latency penalty right here that shows why you should stay typically with the synchronous mode and everything underneath like 2666 or 2133 those are really memory speeds I would personally try to avoid because you lose so much performance using those kind of memory modules aida64 right test is led by the five gigahertz modules from gigabyte followed by the 37 33 megahertz C 16 with 1867 megahertz on the fabric followed by the 3800 as is 16 1900 and you can see probably because it's not entirely stable that's why we lost a little bit of performance you're not sure but it was reproducible that's why I also marked this as yeah kind of take it with a little bit of salt with aida64 copy test it's even more obvious that those modules perform just when you're looking at plain readwrite copy test the 5 gigahertz modules from gigabyte are performing extremely well so they're leading the charge with a good margin followed by the 37:33 with high fabric clock and the 3600 typical configuration since 16 1858 is with 50 4 6 4 4 megabyte per second and that's about 10,000 megabyte per second less then the gigabyte 5e 2 Hertz modules the aida64 latency test is really showing the penalty of not running the synchronous mode you can see this is clearly led by the synchronous mode 37:33 with 1867 with 60 8.3 nano seconds followed by 3600 C 16 1800 fabric clock and this is about 5 to 6 nanoseconds faster than the 5 gigahertz modules from gigabyte and probably even if you're running 6 gigahertz on those modules you would not be able to catch up with the low latency due to the effects and that the data has to be synchronized once again in the memory controller but yeah you can see we have a penalty in the latency but the readwrite copy values were still better than in the synchronous mode in Cinebench r15 multi I think most of those runs are within measurement tolerance at least starting from the 3733 on top down to the 5 gigahertz c18 with 1867 fabric all those with like 31 13 points up to 30 120 points those are the average across multiple runs but even then there is a decent variety during the runs so I think all of those are pretty much equal and should be treated as measurement tolerance just with 3200 and below you can see we're losing performance pretty much the same in the single threaded test most of the high-end configurations have 189 points so 5ge down to 3600 with 1800 synchronized fabric clock they all perform pretty much the same one point less for the a synchronous mode with 3600 with 1867 and everything below we lose a little bit performance with like 3200 or 21:33 aida64 values are certainly nice to look at but the question is how much does this really help us if we're doing in real-world performance that's why I performed some rendering benchmarks with Adobe Premiere simply rendering in one of my 4k YouTube we use you can see the chart again on top 37 33 megahertz synchronous mode the Trident sea neo sticks with 1867 megahertz the gigabyte modules with 5 gigahertz are a little bit slower with about 8 seconds penalty and if we go lower in the chart for example 30 200 megahertz we're losing already 1 minute and 20 666 were already losing 3 minutes and 21 33 we're losing six minutes of rendering time and this just shows how important memory speed at least 30 200 megahertz is for isin 3000 last test is 7-zip compressing time to one of my 4k YouTube videos with all the files that are included like screenshots and music files and everything's on total 170 files with 41 gigabyte total and surprisingly the 5 gigahertz modules from gigabyte are the fastest option in this case with about 10 seconds faster compared to the g.skill modules running in synchronous mode also here if you take a look at the bottom of the chart like 2666 or even 2133 2133 is almost double the time for compressing and that's ridiculous I didn't think that this has such a massive impact before we get to the conclusion one more thing I would like to highlight or point out is that you really have to be careful with the temperature of those modules obviously 1.5 1.5 volt are resulting in a high power consumption or fairly high power consumption for memory modules that's why you should always have a good airflow across your memory modules when I was testing with zero airflow prime95 or mem test those sticks were getting unstable at like 65 or 70 degrees Celsius and if you just have a fan on them it's totally fine you're not encountering problems but if you're using them in a closed case make sure that you have some good good airflow across your modules ok so what's the conclusion of everything that we just talked about is it really worth getting 5 gigahertz memory memory modules and to answer this question I would need to know the availability of those sticks and I don't even know if they will ever be available in retail and I don't even know if they are or if they're going to be available what the price will be in general I can say in most cases they are beating the Samsung B die or are at least on par for example 7-zip they're beating 8 at 64 they're beating everything and in Adobe Premiere they're basically the same performance as running a high synchronous bida kit and for example if you're one of the HW BOTS guys and aiming for the highest possible memory clocks that you want to put into the database then you should probably get some micron based sticks like those or rose based kids because they will be very easy for you to achieve extremely high memory speeds speeds you would not be able to get with Samsung VI otherwise if you're asking what a kind of memory configuration you should get for normal and gaming PC I think still 3600 with synchronous mode is a very good choice and a very good kit to get otherwise I'm extremely impressed that five gigahertz out of the box are just working you just pluck its below the XMP profile and it works I never expected that so if you have no budget if you want to have the highest memory speeds ever you should probably get one of those kids if they were ever be available thanks for joining in see you next time bye [Music] [Music] you
