hey what some pretty mark here I'm in the car Tesla today the model three and we got into update the brand new one that actually comes in last night you probably saw the sneak peak of me talking about the dash cam but we're gonna do the whole video today so this is ten point two and it's the 20 20 24 6.1 it's fully installed so we're gonna look at it right here the release notes basically some improvements to the previous one that doesn't require to do a lot of the stuff that you did before so we're gonna go that so traffic light and stop sign control beta is in here that's listed in here but what's different about this is they actually have when you're going up to a traffic light here and there's a car in front of you you no longer have to tap the stock to in order to get the car to proceed through that so if there's a lead vehicle in front of you that's going to that's gonna work in your benefit there you're gonna be able to just follow through the traffic like like that so one of the things I noticed is when it hits yellow the car will actually slow down or stop at the red light it's actually responding to them a lot better than it was so that's one of those things right there it's telling you to you know obviously take a media action pay attention all that stuff like there it may not stop for all traffic control right now it's really good so I drove it home from Tampa last night and the autopilot was like smooth all the way from i-4 we had a GPS update and a navigation update on the previous one and I finally got to ride on i-4 and it was phenomenal so that's one of those things there and as you guys had seen previously in the dash camera provements the backup camera yeah I should say the backup camera has some improvements there you not only have the single rear that does I'm gonna say like a hundred and seventy degrees in the rear but you also have two side cameras here on the side markers or the where your your turn signals are as well in the side there that give an extra like I'm gonna say ten degrees it's a full 180 degrees on that view now you get to see the entire thing like there so the dash cam improvements is phenomenal there's some improvements in there before it was like it was daunting to go in there you want to go in and find a piece of footage and get that it was a task because you had to look through ten minutes of footage sliding through and figured out what caused this thing to go off by the time that you found that you were exhausted because you already had looked probably through two or three of those footage there let's jump into the viewer and what we're gonna do here is we're gonna look at the way the dashcam works now when you have some type of an event and what it does for you so as you can see here I'm driving along this road right here but down here there's this little red dot and that little red dot is essentially where I triggered the dashcam to come on whether it be honking the horn or coming up here in tapping that so it looks like I just did it right when I got home and no matter which one you jump into even your old footage like some old footage that's from April before this is here you can come right there and tap to that and you can see over here on the right-hand side that it was triggered apparently by that and then someone walking in front as well so that's gonna help out tremendously when you're having to filter through and siphon through videos you're gonna make it so much easier you don't have to have that task of going in and constantly looking for stuff right there and as you can see right here some reason I was driving down this road and I triggered the dash cam on it so let's see exactly what it was going into Walmart who knows what it was this one here oh yeah this car almost hit me over here on the right hand side coming out like that so I triggered it right there and saved that footage but it showed exactly why I triggered it and it brings it right to it and that's pretty much nice right there so that's that's smart that's no-brainer I think a lot of security camera footages already have that like our nest or our rings whatever we use and they have that search so tuned improvements I haven't really used tuned in if some of you have just leave a little comment than and below because I don't know what it was before to what it is now but what they're saying here is with this update improve the usability discovery of the tuning stations and podcasts make it easier to browse content we've also had the ability to just play back that's pretty good so 2x I had I used to listening to podcast into X so we'd have to listen old thing you cut it down really short but still absorb a lot of the information there the walkway and lock improvements I haven't had any issues with it thankfully but now it says you have the option to disable walk away door lock when your vehicle is parked at home tab controls locks and select exclude homes so some more exclusions there because maybe in your garage you don't want it to law because you're in there or in your front driveway because no one's near you so that's what they're doing that for it seems like right there and then you just basically if you want to set your home you go to navigate set home and that that's something we all have done I believe already I know I did so some new language support easy enough Portuguese as your language there that's good and cabin camera we talked about this the other day and if you haven't heard already not that I'm paranoid or anything like that however I just don't want someone watching me if it's willy-nilly and there might be something in there or teslic attacked or anything the sorts the camera up in the - up here you might not be able to see it any will be able see it it's right up in here I don't know what the the field of view is but I imagine it's gotta be the whole entire car probably another one of those like 90 to 100 degrees field of view looking into the car well I don't really want that so what I've done is I've created a little tiny tab that goes over it it goes on with actually this right here this 3m tape that I got cut it out and you stick it right up there and there's a little slider on really simple and easy i've shipping those out five bucks and you can cover it up well the GP gps update in the previous one that one helped out really good other than that we're gonna take a drive if you guys are ready autopilot yesterday was very smooth but let's go we're gonna get a ride in auto pods on just nice cruise down my neighborhood so as always we're seeing the cones we're seeing everything that you normally would see nothing too fancy trash cans but the major improvements are the dash cam and the traffic light from that previous release right there so I think it's gonna be good all right we're slowing down this is a bit earlier than it had been before we're coming up to these railroad tracks right here slowing through traffic control device stopping slowing and it goes all the way down to 10 miles an hour uh-oh stops on the railroad track so we don't want to do that we're gonna become up to another railroad track set up here and that's going to ultimately give us another idea what we see on the roadway there now I have such a habit of driving and not really paying attention here and seeing what's on this screen and I believe the railroad crossing signs on the roadway are new if you guys won't leave that in the comment they're like right there see how it has the X and the are ours that seems pretty good got a green bar across there we're going right through the intersection here for that traffic control device and you know what let's put on the rear camera while we're at it let's talk about that look at that and that cool there we go now we can see in the blind spots this camera on the left hand side and right hand side that's showing those two pillars or their side cameras are I'm talking out phenomenal you can see 100% more than you can with not having them does that make sense oh we gotta hit it there's no one in front of us we do have a bicyclists on the road it picked it up look how far it picked it up well if you guys saw that or not but way back there I'm gonna have to take over because it is not moving over for him there but it's the car did start to slow down and process that that bicycle was way down the road compared to lead what it was before because sometimes will be you know like 50 feet or hundred feet in front of it and then you'll see the bicyclist right there so I was bringing up the speed to Cole's those are accurate and if you do see some cones that are knocked over on the screen down here that has been happening for the last update some of the cones are when they're on the road tilted over you can see them on the screen up here tilt it over as well but back to these cameras here so these cameras I mean look at them that's look at much view you have right here I can look in my mirrors I can look in this one here and I'm absolutely not having any trouble seeing what's around me you know literally 306 degrees I got Ford I got my two mirrors on the sides which show an okay view and then I've got the ones for this one in the back and then these two right here as we mentioned here I can see this I can see this car to my left over here out the b-pillar here I can see the back of the car but these cameras pick it up a little bit further now this car right here I can barely see it in my mirror over here I just see the tail end of it and just the tail light and a little bit of a wheel that particular car right there so there you go now I hope Tesla does something here and gives us the ability to move this around and slide those three together and maybe make even a really nice panoramic view here because that would really set it in right here a lot of people have been asking for the bird's-eye view well if you can have this bird's-eye view not necessary bird's-eye view but this panoramic view of that rear almost like a rear of your digital rear view mirror all you got to do is combine those three images to lit together and kind of blend them I think it would be a pretty easy process then we have a digital rear view mirror right here that would see 180 degrees behind us when this light turns green I'm gonna have to actually either tap on the accelerator or use the stock to start it because we have been at this traffic light the lights been red and we're not actively proceeding through it so that's gonna be the trouble on this here if you're at a traffic light like that which is good if you sitting here for a while you need to double check and pay attention what's going on like this siren that is going on around here somewhere you don't want the car just to take off on you all right so we got a green light it's showing green up there oh I didn't do that I didn't touch the accelerant or that so if you're about two or three car lanes back I think it actually works that works pretty well that's pretty good that is super awesome I'm going to change lane see how it does jumped over now you might have noticed on the screen here that the all far inside lay in the fast lane the cars disappeared in it in this one here I noticed that a lot either it's the processing power that they're trying to reduce or if it's just something that they do here that the cameras can't see it but those cars disappear when you get into a far outside lane which this is called here that the slow lane the automatic wipers just kicked on a little tiny sprinkle there wasn't much up there there's some little tiny droplets with that kicked on pretty good all right I'm gonna move over so we can go right through this traffic light with this car here we are over up that did it on its own we were following through it and we got a yellow light and the yellow light triggered the car to actually slow down but that was a pretty good example of how this traffic light is adapting before you know you either go all the way through it or it would just automatically stop and that was pretty good I like that right there I'm happy about that that's pretty nice so being here at the traffic light ourselves we're gonna have to actually do something here with this by either hitting the gear stock or hitting the accelerator on here because the car is not gonna go on its own when the light turns green there it's green like that and we had to use the stock there bar turns green clear the intersection we're good to go perfect example this car over in my blind spot right there I cannot see it I can barely see it right there helpful really helpful now one of the other things that they talked about when this was here there's some range issues that were come up they the car is better calculating the range while I charge my car up this is a standard range plus I charge my car up to the 90% and that appeared to be 196 miles of range I know the percentages if it if it showed an actual 90 percent range but it was the it was 196 miles which I would imagine that it used to be 215 but with how I Drive and whatnot maybe that's exactly what it is everybody that tells me that it's your driving habits it calculates it like that but I've been driving slower and I can continuously see it ticking up just the tiniest bit right there so all right so we got another green light here it's gonna make us do the stock again look at this one navigate through the intersections got a lot of gap between the intersection and then the next lines right there and it picked up pretty good so we'll bring up the speed to 55 I think it speeds 50 up here oh it's actually that's weird normally we won't let you go over the speed limit when you have the the red light detection and stop sign detection on but for some reason is here all right we got a green light it's actually slowing down I gotta get over change lanes pretty well right there that cars plant for me I think it's gonna hit the brakes a little bit yep hit the brakes and what we're going to do is we're going to navigate on to the interstate right here I'm just going to punch in we're gonna put in we're gonna put something in what is this let's see if it'll take it around this turn it's pretty it's coming here pretty aggressive yeah it's pretty aggressive thinks this yield sign is a traffic control device we're clear we're gonna go up and we're going to navigate on autopilot alright I had to do a reboot on the on the the unit here because I was having some issue with the touchscreen and I cleaned my touchscreen before this so hopefully it'll clear it up but I'm not too sure and while you're doing a reboot while you're driving I can't access any of the autopilot or anything like that so we're gonna manually drive well Chuck will talk about the car a little bit this cars been phenomenal I've been enjoying it so much with with driving it and going places I got twenty five thousand miles on the car just bought some new tires they were in the backseat the other day I got a video coming out about that and how I got the tires for very cheap we'll get that up here in just a little bit all right the cars booting and I'm hoping that the touchscreen issue said I clean it because last time I did a video for you guys you're like man your screens dirty and it was it was really dirty all right so we got everything back on booted up ready to go and I'm gonna put on navigate on autopilot we're gonna increase our speed a little bit just to be kind of aggressive on here I want to see how the lane passing and all that stuff works all right so now ghetto it's probably gonna tell us to get over in the lane over here there it goes we're gonna move it over and it looks clear everywhere yeah it looks pretty good like that so the traffic flow right there as you can see I'm going faster than the cars are next to me so it is actually will start slowing the car down a little bit and that's been a few updates if you haven't seen that in the ones you can check out the previous updates where I reviewed that there and went over it so yeah that's pretty good slow down the speed a little bit that 55 is not accurate it's like it's 70 through here so we're gonna go right at 70 75 so we've got to exit here let's see how it works that's pretty good literally no troubles unlike that handling that right there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna punch in home see where it gets me there and how fast I can get it to square where I think I need to go this way yeah I'm gonna have to manually drive it alright so that was pretty good the interstate there the Navigator how's the same the autopilots the same nice and smooth the GPS update is great because this this is all new Road and Google or whatever map system they use has made it to where that actually is able to be is able to be adapted to that roadway there alright we're back on navigate will actually uh navigate on autopilot well ahead of the interstate here now it wants to get over for some reason I don't know why this is where that weird area is right here so I've got to take over this is a brand new paved road different wits and everything like that oh that's tight that's tight Oh slow down for it 35 came in there kind of hot nice merge lane those merge arrows are showing up some reason it's slowing down to 55 right here I'm gonna put the foot on the accelerator here because it's 70 through here and then it picks back up right here so that's good now we got a car right here I'm gonna do to see what it does right want to run next to it to put that signal over because we do have to get over otherwise this thing's in a slam on the brakes right there for that car which is amazing so it just slammed on the brakes for that tractor-trailer it was on the side of the road right there because it was in our lane it was encroaching in our lane and that's awesome to be able to see that happen now you might have seen that video where the Tesla ran right into the back of that other vehicle you know unfortunately I I that stinks that that happens but that I believe the driver walked away pretty pretty well off and just you know damage the car there but in the video you can actually see where the car starts to hit the brakes and slam on the brakes and lock it up either that or the the owner did it and there we go we're off the interstate Navigon all pilots off that was pretty good we'll see how it handles here it's still pushing at 70 dropped us to 45 wants me to touch the steering wheel there it's got three lanes to pick from and I don't know what its gonna do it guided right to the middle and that was pretty good you saw that little that movement there it actually guided right to the middle we got our traffic following us and it's gonna slow down it doesn't want to make it through this one here will it go around it on this one let me see will it will it whoa that was pretty cool I didn't do I was my hands were there but that's the first time I've seen it go around a turn like that with the you know minimal markings on the road kicked me out of ippolit which is fine it's a take over immediately I didn't didn't do the disabled me from Pato pilot but it just kicked me out that was pretty cool it made it around that turn there pretty good I don't know if that was just a fluke but hey I'll take it all right so we're coming up to more traffic up here we got a red light and I'm gonna move over to this outside lane I'm gonna move over to this outside lane over here if I can let's go the inside there we go as an aggressive lane change alright here we go we're uh looks like three car lengths back we got a green light we got a green bar as you can see right there which tells us that we are gonna proceed through without any warning and that's awesome that's pretty good because it was frustrating before I'll tell you that right now going through these traffic lights and if you live in a city that has traffic light after traveling you're constantly just tapping this thing and I would turn it off periodically because there's enough traffic to stop and slow on its own here so it kind of took a step forward but then it kind of took a step back and was doing what it was before now it's just proceeding through and if it turns yellow it will stop for you so right here it's saying that it's got a green bar or clear through it it did slow down good a little bit of a wobble right there so I haven't seen any other markings except for the railroad tracks and and I might be wrong and saying that those are new if you've seen any in here let me know because I have not seen any in a while that we're new I didn't see anything like yield signs or anything other than the stop signs well I want to subscribing I appreciate you guys ride along with me here on the feedback on the last one there I did get the camera up in the front so you guys could see the traffic lights I feel bad for that last time cuz it literally was this camera and it was blocking everything you couldn't see anything but now you can see the traffic lights you can see what they're doing and you can see me proceed through them or the car proceed I'm not driving alone talk about so anyway I'll see you guys again soon thanks for watching
