oh good morning everyone you know Tesla Tom thanks for joining us I'm Ludacris feed you're gonna go for a little Drive today on the northern beaches of Sydney using our Tesla Model 3 performance stealth on software update twenty twenty point twelve point 11.1 it's the one with the full self-driving visualizations finally on the Waker spark we're going northbound very shortly I'm gonna engage autopilot and they're going to drive all the way to Palm Beach and I'll point out anything interesting to you guys all right enjoy [Music] all right just have to stop here because I'm just on basically autopilot and in Australia the car doesn't react to traffic lights just yet if you're the first color if you're the second or subsequent cars it'll stop because it's a car in front of you but if you're coming to a red light you just go to disengage autopilot or you're gonna run the red or worse get another car other car hit you [Music] just a quick word about the makers Parkway it's kind of a shortcut between the frenches forest area and I guess there have been on the north side and it's notoriously a dangerous road had many accidents and fatalities on this road just cuz there's a lot of blind corners and it's not very well bit at night either so always very careful with this road so just a quick difference between basic autopilot and navigate and autopilot so basically what a pilot that's essentially glorified cruise control it follows the speed for year keeps the lane for you prices truck tries to drive in the middle of the road or mill of the lane and it's got traffic aware cruise control so it's following the car ahead of you as well whereas navigate on autopilot which is the more advanced feature it's only available in certain roads currently in Australia usually highways and freeways it's basically the car taking you where you want to go so it'll make decisions for you with regards to lane changes and exits theoretically and I'm just currently on basic autopilot as you can see there's two tram tracks to blue tram tracks on the screen there whereas if navigated it would be one blue line on the screen here [Music] [Music] so there's a lot of glare on the road and the windscreen currently is disengaged for a second so always hands on the wheel very vigilant because I'm just very wary at the glare and the shadows that seems to be Koki clipping reasonably well so far see that auto steer speed restricted to 70 that normally doesn't happen if the speed limit drops like that but in this situation I did I would have pressed 70 anyway to match the speed but the car did it for me automatically okay the lane change it's nice the card to that for me nicely okay we are going to go left because I'm not the first car the traffic light I will let autopilot go for now [Music] you'll see that the car took off by itself from zero which I always find very impressive it's gonna hang out the wheel cuz it's very confused plane change now I'm gonna stop there I just took off what a pilot it was very confused I was gonna hit that car if I didn't take control the wheel there again another reason why you have to be vigilant okay but now that we're back on this Lane once I get into the lane fully I will engage autopilot again and it's really helpful for city traffic as you'll see follow the cars ahead of you in stop-start traffic [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I just disengaged on a pilot there myself is that car beat the red so I would have been the first car at the light and that's quite dangerous as I said it doesn't react to traffic lights just yet so here I am there's car well since up some time I'll give you some some insight into this update so full self-driving visualizations it's exactly that you can see traffic lights are there again this one's not showing up this may be because I can't read it yeah I'm just looking up ahead of me on the sunglass roof there that traffic light is not visible from here so I can't tell what color it is but the other lights you can see it's it's all red and it doesn't match real life I've said this a few times in other video videos but these lights a single row whereas the ones I had a double row so it's something that's got to be taken care of for future updates when it's double row like that because there's two there's two instructions there which need to be sorted out and this intersection line here is I guess that's what the car will use in future to work out whether to where to stop I guess basically [Music] [Music] had a feeling it will do that it's always a bit tricky around there OD sections just loses sight of the lane markings so kind of quite predicted where it should go which is why never trust autopilot just yet our area high traffic high pedestrian traffic a lot of shadow a lot of glare just coming through I think this is a new point here so put my hands on the wheel is even I have trouble seeing through all the shadow glare just coming up to a red light now there's a car at the front so should be okay in terms of stopping all right so we're coming up to form one lane oh yeah that was really weird the cards just accelerated a little bit there again a lot of shadow a lot of glare from the early morning Sun so I'm just always very careful okay so we're just coming up to the mine finishing now so I'm just going through change lanes yeah just disengage they're way too tricky that's an educator out there that Lane ended quite sharply and the car was tailing behind didn't give me much opportunity to merge automatically with lane change so I just took it off not keen to meet an accident okay back in autopilot all right so this we could test for it lots of winding around let me shine a little glare that was weird that turn off okay see and cyclist aboot all right should be fun perhaps very much on the wheel what's got you is that it's not careening here at 60 it's driving appropriately it has slowed down by itself all around these tight bends see whether it does the same here so coming at sixty okay it's telling us to go 35 Wow okay slow down by itself by itself not happy doesn't like the bends yes somebody must have reported it maybe more it knows not to go on a pilot for these bits it is quite twisty roundabouts coming up and we know that autopilot doesn't do well on roundabouts probably going to be very hesitant to use it there are very low tolerance taking it off as we approach the roundabout roundabout yeah okay so it's stretched up by itself anyway so even though cruise control is going to speed ahead there's no way I would have made this roundabout it's just going too quick let's engage it again very shortly [Music] which lane will it choose I choose this one switch-up myself okay [Music] change lanes just gonna stop here again first car the traffic light have to stop [Music] [Music] [Music] okay speed limits now 40 so I'll just bring it down myself it's going through the speed not too bad I think that's cuz the car hit him he was also very slow [Music] alright guys well here we are Palm Beach let you enjoy that take care of yourselves and as always happy charger
