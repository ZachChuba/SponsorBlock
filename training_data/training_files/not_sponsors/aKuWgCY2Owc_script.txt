hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with stuffed pork chops that's right i'm gonna show my favorite
technique for stuffing pork chops as well as showing one of my favourite
stuffie is for pork and above-and-beyond producing something that's visually
impressive we are also with this method flavouring
our pork chops from the inside and by the way keep in mind this is just a
techniques video and this is gonna work no matter what stuffing decide to
use although the peach stuffing you're about to see was really really good so
feel free to do this as shown and to get started the first thing we'll do is
crisp up a few strips of bacon in a non-stick pan which as usual we will do
over medium heat and once we have most of that fat rendered out and our bits of
bacon are browning up beautifully we'll go ahead and use that rendered fat to
saute some diced onion as well as some diced green poblano chili which I really
wanted to be jalapeno but inexplicably this door was out but anyway what we'll
do is cook that stirring for about five or six minutes or until our onions start
to soften up and turn translucent and once that happens we can go ahead and
throw in our cubed up peach which because we're big fans of multitasking
we should probably prep while our bacon onions and peppers are cooking and to do
that we will take a knife and cut into the peach right in the middle into the
crease if we can find it all right this didn't really have a
pronounced one but whatever the closest to cleavage can find and we'll slice
it and cut all the way around and then we'll simply twist the two halves which
should separate just like this if you're using their freestone peach okay if
you're using a clingstone it won't and at that point just our peeling and
slicing but if it does come apart like this and your peach is nice and ripe
that snow should pull out very very easily if it's ripe if it's still firm
and under ripe like this one it will be very hard to pull out which most times
would be upsetting but actually first stuff like this being a little bit
firm is okay and then what we'll do is peel off the skin before cutting these
into like quarter-inch cubes and for that I like to give it one slice like
this oh and please be careful a peeled peach is a slippery peach so keep your
fingertips out of the way and then we'll cut those two pieces into strips after
which we can turn it and simply slice across into cubes and the good news here
even this was still fairly firm it was
actually still nice and sweet and has feel free to substitute any other fresh
fruit like I mean are after all the HR Pufnstuf
of your stuffing stuff and once we have that stuff done we'll go ahead and check
our onions and once those onions have softened up and turned translucent we
can go ahead and add our peach and we will stir all that together and what
we'll want to do here still on medium heat let's cook these stirring until
they just start to soften up and get tender which is gonna depend on how ripe
they were all right this might only take like a minute or two or if they were
really firm like mine maybe it takes five or six minutes and one clue you're
gonna have is you're gonna see some moisture coming out and bubbling but an
even bigger clue as you'll test them with a fork and as soon as they are
tender we'll go ahead and pull that off the heat and transfer it into a mixing
bowl where we will add the rest of our stuffing stuff and man did that smell
good but anyway once that's been bowled we'll go ahead and add some freshly
picked timely use or the chopped pork friendly you're above your choice we
will also do some freshly ground black pepper some salt of course as well as
the customary shake of cayenne and then as far as our binder goes I'm going with
some crushed up crackers or ice lt''s to be exact but of course if wanted you
could use some crunch top bread cubes or some bread crumbs or even some corn
bread would be nice and we'll go ahead and give that a mix and then decide if
it needs any more liquid which depending on how juicy your fruit is and other
ingredients may not need but after a little bit of stirring I decided I did
so I snuck in a couple tablespoons of chicken stock and then continued mixing
and then what actually just we do here after this is mixed we should probably
refrigerate it since the cold stuffing is always easier to stuff something with
then a warm or room temperature stuffing so we'll go ahead and pop that in the
fridge while we proceed to prep our pork and what I have here are two extra thick
center-cut boneless pork chops which yes is one of the ultimate culinary
oxymorons since by definition a chop is a piece of meat that has a rib attached
and then the key to cutting a perfect pocket inside these is visualization so
before we stick the knife in we're gonna place the knife on top and just watch
the movements of what's going to happen inside the pork so we're gonna stick
that in the center and slice one way and then turn and slice
the other all right going as close as we can without poking through the edge and
by visualizing that first I think it's gonna be a lot easier when we actually
stick the knife in which we want to make sure we do into the fat side exactly
halfway down and one of the keys here is we're using the tip of the knife to cut
the pocket inside but please note where the knife goes into the meat we are not
moving all right that is our fulcrum and we kind of want to leave the knife fix
there and just use the tips in both directions to make that pocket nice and
big inside and by doing it that way you're going to ensure that your
incision is not too large and we won't have too much of that stuffing spilling
out and of course have said that once the pocket is made we do want to
make sure we have at least two inches to get the stuffing in so once we're happy
with our pockets we can do a little bit of fine-tuning to that part and that's
it once that's been accomplished we can go ahead and fill these with our
stuffing and know there is no graceful way to do this all right just go ahead
and grab that stuff and shove it in like no one's watching
which reminds me ideally no one's watching and of course we really want to
make sure we're pushing that stuff in all the way to the edges of our pockets
and that's it as long as visualized and got a pretty decent pocket cut this
really is not a very hard procedure and then once those are set before we head
to the stove we'll go ahead and season those generously on both sides with some
salt and then what we'll do is roast these in a nice hot oven but first we
want to sear those in a little bit of oil set over high heat and we'll place
those down and let them go for about three or four minutes or until that's I
get some beautiful browning on it and because we're gonna pan roast these we
really only need to get a good sear on one side so we'll just leave those alone
for about three minutes or so and then we'll go ahead and flip those over and
that's it for the stovetop step these pork chops are not ready to transfer
into the center of a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes or so or until cooked
to your liking which for me was an internal temp of about 145 to 150 or as
I like to say until they look like this and then what we'll do is carefully
remove those two plates which I did all wrong
right grab them on the side so don't crush that stuffy interruption but it's
fine it's still gonna look amazing anyway we'll remove those and cover them
with a little bit of foil while we make our sauce
and we can remove the stuffing that spilled out and just serve it on the
plate or if want just leave it in the pan while we make the sauce it
really doesn't matter and what we're gonna do here is add a splash of chicken
broth as well as a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and we're gonna turn
our heat on a medium-high and then give this a stir to deglaze the bottom while
we wait for it to come up to a boil oh and just like can use any
stuffing on this we could have used any other kind of liquid in vinegar we
wanted in our sauce all right whether use fruit juice or
white wine or red wine vinegar or white vinegar or sherry vinegar the procedure
is exactly the same and by the way if don't place a towel on that hot
handle there is a 100% chance burn yourself so always always keep a towel
on the handle and then to finish this super simple sauce what we'll do as soon
as that starts to boil is turn off the heat and then stir in a chunk of cold
butter and as long as we keep that moving it's gonna emulsify into that
warm acidic liquid and it's gonna thicken it up and make it nice and shiny
and that my friends is how make every pan sauce in the world and that's
it as soon as that butter disappears it is ready to spoon over our now plated
pork chop which even though I wreck the appearance of the stuffing that was
poking out with my tongs still looks pretty good but anyway I went ahead and
spooned that over and decided it did not need any garnishing there was just
nothing that was going to make this look any better so I grabbed a fork and knife
and went in for a taste and we'll get to the taste in a minute but as far as the
appearance goes I really think this came out amazingly well can see here that
perfectly positioned pocket of stuffing which does take a few minutes of effort
but really does produce quite an impressive presentation which of course
wouldn't matter if this didn't taste good but that wasn't a problem as this
really was spectacular all right thanks to that nice hot oven
and relatively short cooking time plus having our nice moist stuffing inside
this pork was wonderfully tender and juicy and literally flavored from the
inside out and while so many different kinds of stuffing could work here when
have the sweetness of peach and the savoriness of those onions and peppers
and that little bit of smoky meaty goodness from the bacon just oh so
subtly scented with that time are talking about a world-class pairing with
pork and even though there's not a lot of it having that buttery sweet and sour
pan sauce go with it really puts it over the top
so I just absolutely loved how this came out and yes in case you're wondering
can absolutely grill these instead of doing them in the oven although in
that case will have to make a sauce separately which is really not that hard
but anyway whether do these on a nice smoky grill outside or inside in
your oven like I did these either way I really do hope give these a try soon
