Jokke I'm so sorry right okay Uganda oh wow oh wow one mile away how'd you like that I'm excited for this no don't say it yeah they've given me an impossible one to start with or have they they probably have Sedat WC hmm but does that mean hanky-panky in a toilet ring this number I don't know ank-ooo tan meringue it sounds Indonesian or Malaysia if my memory serves that looks like a kind of religious building doesn't it looks nice so I'm gonna go I'm gonna go in this in this island Sumatra and how about Padang let's go near Padang because it sounds a bit like the places we've looked at this could be an awful score this could be a chance for you to get a head start oh my god oh my word a kilometer away in Padang that's insane mate ah I mean yeah what was my thinking right that was always just that pure luck well that is France isn't it I don't think it's Paris I don't think it's nice I'm gonna go Leone because that's where I think it is on a back street in Leon oh I don't know oh my god thank you right next one do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do I was thinking Australia then because of this sign been on the left but no we're driving on the right USA let's go feels like California it feels like where we drove through verity Sierra Nevada something like that let's go that Oh mate oh wow it was this area Sierra Nevada to be fair oh my god it's this one do we drive on this road we can't we slept out here and we were a bit scared of bears right here we go we're doing it we're getting we're getting 15 when we got here straightaway EU plates a hotel Sullivan Sullivan a sort of a no hotel so could this be then nice old mini there she's quite strange could it be Malta if we've got a name like Sullivan hmm sent Barbara busty and strictly no parking yeah it's all English let's get into Valletta Malta and see if we can find some Barbara busty and shouldn't take us too long if it is there let's see guessing it would be over here somewhere but I don't know if it would be over here Ponsonby nice okay I can't see Barbara but I'm gonna go for it anyway bloody hell oh my god we've only got the full points for houses okay laughs is carry-on feels like sort of Hungary this this I reckon see we can get a street name here there is but it's blurred you know bed tomato I'll go hungry there oh oh oh that's not bad last round here Oh oh I'm going to Switzerland here let's have an insane guest come on how about there we're just south of a lake so what's it gonna be oh oh it's brilliant it's not the right Lake but it's not far off it's one like over and it's 18 miles over brilliant stuff next one oh this is this isn't very urban [ __ ] oh how to sign that can we read it no we can't oh credit I think ah I'm going here but I think it might be asked oh no oh ma nah my nah that's ridiculous I thought it was Tasmania by the end Wow not even 5000 boo okay last one let's see what we can do here come on Poland PL mmm what's that says in let's get in see how close we can get this yeah that'll do now I've excelled myself there I mean it was a big Junction it's the biggest Junction I could see it's the obvious place to click but still I mean that is that's the kind of stuff I see Grannis do on a regular basis it's not pre-recorded psycho I'm right here right now answering your stupid claim Tech miss something surely the place isn't tetanus that that's that's not going to be the case Tech just means technology in some form or another I'm not going to go Romania I'm gonna go Slovakia and if where I go is really of no real consequence I'll go I mean is there anything we can take from that yeah k begins with K I think possibly possibly begins with K so we could chance upon this we could get lucky let's see could it be Poland I'll go here crow marries imagine if we found the Technic whatever imagine now I'm not going to go into that let's just hit the button wow wow wow wow no no way so okay so I went over from Slovakia which is where I would have guessed over to the Czech Republic because I couldn't find a decent enough sized place beginning with K so I hopped over to the Czech Republic which was my second choice and we won in the town that I clicked beginning with K crow marries we would down the road in khajit in I mean would you believe it and there it is tecna's khajit in that's bloody insane goodness I've gone Germany Wow I've gone Cologne I've gone Cologne wait okay here we go let's try again hmm Oh God okay this is another tricky one to say the least to start us off with what do we go for what do we go for where's the Sun Suns over there in the south we are in the northern hemisphere and could be Bhutan again could it not um I am gonna go for Butte an again can you believe it or could it be Japan now I'm going Butte an I honestly don't know I say I'm rusty oh my god five point six miles in Butte and this is shaping up to be one of the most insane videos I guess United Arab Emirates near Dubai I would say come on Wow nice 18 miles it's good that I went to the south that's given me a few extra points therefore 9 to 1 we've got a few Arabs here you're still gonna get sunstroke mate so I would be careful Wow Wow that is epic that is friggin epic that is what a valley another guy here what race do they look and it was taken by email' Wardak what race do these look like hmm do they look like Pakistanis because there are a lot of Pakistanis in the West Midlands so I see them a lot do they look like them or do these look like more I don't know Afghani Stanny or something like that I think this could be Pakistan quite easily but email Wardak I don't know that's not a surname I've heard Iraq is an option I guess I mean I guess even these places are an option oh man and Yemen I don't know I've never never been there but I'm thinking Afghanistan I'm thinking I'm gonna go for Afghanistan in the Nuristan National Reserve nearest an forest so Forester either way I'm gonna go here on the pan-pan shear river just there who knows why I'm going off email Wardak it's not a name of heard feel like if it was a Pakistani name I would have heard it but hey I don't know different regions different names I guess here we go oh my god 31 miles away and it was Afghanistan that is insane what a way to end it goodness gracious me if I'd have just thought about that there's no road there at all that's mental that's the correct River there we are if I'd have just maybe gone downstream a bit and seen these bends and looked at the compass a bit more that's insane that's going straight on insane guesses in fact I think I can make that soon
