Okay, look everyone, I know we make a lot of jokes on this show and we have a lot of fun, but I wanna get serious for a second, okay? Because there is something of the utmost importance that you need to do soon - because time is running out.
- (CLOCK TICKING) This thing is something that, well, it's probably honestly the most important contribution you will ever make to society. It's more important than how you treat the people around you. It's more important than the work you do. And it's definitely more important than your relationship with your family. This is ... the thing, okay? Like, as Americans, this is our sacrament. This is our spiritual rite of passage that gives us the privilege of being allowed to complain for the next four years. This thing is ... voting. Guys, as a very popular YouTuber here, I beg and implore you to please go out and register to vote. This is honestly the most important election that we have ever had. And our choice has never been more clear. If you have something to say, voting is the only way to ever make your voice heard. Boy, politicians in this country sure are evil. I just wish there was something we could do about it. But Josh, there is! We live in a country where we can legitimize their power by continually voting for the lesser of two evils! It's a binary choice! That'll show 'em. And it's not enough that just you vote, alright? You need to call your friends, text them, group message, Snapchat them, DM them, whatever you crazy millennials do these days. #GetOffYourButtAndVote What does it feel like? Well, when you step into that booth, it's the most incredible, spiritual, empowering feeling you will ever have in your entire life. Sounds amazing. So gather up all your friends and let's get them to the polls! We've got to make this election, like, how you say ... go viral! We've gotta get this voting thing trending on Twitter! We've gotta somehow draw these millennials into this election. So we've gotta make voting ... sexy. Hey guys, I, um, wanted to tell you about my, uh, first time. Voting. Okay, I'm—I'm so embarrassed. Okay, my first time was at a church, actually in the gym. There were a lot of old people watching. I was really nervous. But the old lady told me that I was doing everything just right and that I shouldn't be frightened. Honestly, I don't understand why anyone would not want to participate in our beautiful democracy. I mean, we're trying as hard as we can to just make it seem so cool! It's lit! It's turnt! It's off the chain! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Voting between two old people is really awesome! Look, I'm not admitting that our effort to get millennials out to vote isn't working, okay? But on the off chance you run into a lazy friend of yours who says they're not gonna go out and vote, here are some talking points to persuade them to do so. JOSH: How to Persuade Your Lazy Friends to Vote. Okay, so suppose your friend says to you, Eh, I'm too busy to go vote. JORDAN: Just politely remind them that (LAUGHS) this is a pretty important election, okay? Much more important than "Netflix and chill." Just think, we get to choose who is in charge for the next 4 years! Isn't that exciting? Isn't it worth making time for? I don't know. I don't really like the candidates. JORDAN: Ooh, oh ... this—this is a good one. This is where you get to appeal to their fear. See, most people aren't voting FOR one candidate. They're actually voting against the other one. So basically, just try and scare them into submission! I mean, I think we can both at least agree that one of the candidates is just not fit to be president. Don't you want to ensure that the worst-case scenario doesn't happen? I mean, yeah, I guess so. I just don't really think that my vote matters. JORDAN: Oh no, no, no, this one breaks my heart. Listen to me very closely, okay? Every vote matters. Every single one! Even if you don't live in a "swing state," okay? It's the principle of the thing! It's the fact that you're making your voice heard! Loud and proud. You will not be silent! Wow, you're right! I do have a voice! - Yes, you do!
- I will vote! - Yes, you will!
- I'm gonna make America great again! (LAUGHING) Wait ... you are voting for Clinton, right? Oh no, I hate her. But you like Trump? Oh, no, no, no, I don't like him either, but I hate her more. Anyways, thanks for informing me of how important it is that I go vote. (STAMMERING) Wait just a minute there, buddy. Maybe you shouldn't actually vote. - You just said it was my civic duty!
- Don't throw that in my face right now, okay? I think that there's exceptions. - I mean, maybe you're a little too stupid to vote is what I'm saying.
- Oh, you think I'm too stupid to vote? (LAUGHS) I mean, you, you ... - Look, look, Hillary Clinton's gonna keep the same policies that Barack Obama ...
- Oh my gosh, all you do is read Drudge Report, literally! - No, no, no, you read CNN. All you do is read CNN.
- Oh my gosh, I read the Wall Street Journal. - You read your Facebook page, and it's complete garbage. Absolutely—
- (CONTINUE ARGUING INDISTINCTLY) What does it feel like? Well, when you step into that booth, it's the most incredible, spiritual ... (ALL LAUGHING) That's funny. (CONTINUE LAUGHING) JOSH: That is so funny.
