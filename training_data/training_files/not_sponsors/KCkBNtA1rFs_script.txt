hello everyone and welcome back to another minecraft update video this is 1.16 release candidate 1 and it's been over 9 years since we've had a release candidate the last one was for 1.0 the adventure update 9 years ago but as it says here on the website out of the old and in with the new today we're introducing a new naming convention for minecraft.jar addition previously the last pre-release was in fact the release candidate but now we'll making that more clear by changing the name to be release canada this means that if there are no major issues following this release no further changes will be done before the full release and if you haven't heard the news this article was posted to minecraft.net recently the nether update has a day and that day is June the 23rd and the good news is this is for all platforms whatever platform you're playing minecraft on the update is gonna roll out for everything on the same day which is the 23rd that's a Tuesday just a couple of days away now now there may only be four bugs and I'm gonna tell you about each of these but in this video I'm also going to show you how to reset your nether and get prepared for an update to 1.16 and there's also a bunch of splash techs that have been changed and we're gonna go through all of those as well but first of all I'd like to share with you an observation I made just the other day by accident I don't know when in 1.16 this happened but here is the same resource pack unable to change the background on the main menu and can you see the difference here the color the saturation there's like a foggy effect here in 1.15 and that's totally changed or 1.16 I thought I'd point that out to you so the first bug is just related to terrain generation you know this can be a little bit funky in Minecraft and some things have been smoothed out related to floating lava and to know Liam in crimson forests and since minecraft 1.14 has actually been an issue of the stonecutter we're crafting up a stack of items could cause your game to crash which nobody wants that one's been fixed another game crashing bug that's been around since 1.15 having lots of a turtles and then lots of mobs going and standing on top of them could crash your game and when I say lots I really mean a ridiculous but this bug has also been patched and the fourth issue is related to not being able to open a world played in a previous snapshot that one being 20 W 18 a so now in release candidate one you should be able to open worlds from this update there is also two bugs that I'm aware of a ghast isn't gonna be able to see a player unless it shares the same eyeline so now that has come down to the same level as me it's now seen me and I'm getting shot at so here it is again that the gusts are right above me and they're not gonna see me until they come down to the same I level and yes I am in survival mode and there you go that one came down low enough the other bug I'm aware of is to do with minecarts and larva they no longer get destroyed by lava the other minecart there is just underneath it this includes flying carts with TNT you'd expect those to explode going into lava and they probably are a few other bugs as well and so we can expect to see a one point sixteen point of one at some time in the future I imagine and of course make sure you're subscribed if you want to find out what's going to be in those future updates and exchanges are to the splash text that appears here in yellow on the screen for a while now we've had splashes related to the Cove in nineteen pandemic those are now going to be the part of the normal rotation with all the other messages and some have been added for this update and some have been removed so the removed ones are undocumented down with OPP Luud with two dudes with food switches and alls huge tracts of land my personal favorite totally forgot about Dre popping tags getting ready to show getting ready to no getting ready to drop getting ready to shock getting ready to free kit getting ready to speak and along with those some new ones have been added this para is no more it ceased to be honey I grew the bees find your claw everybody do the leaf Heart Max and 99 and ducky bushy eyebrows edit is a name from free range developers music by Lana rain oh man hashtag minecraft far and my pickaxe envisioned create share fabulous graphics also try minecraft dungeons vanilla may contain traces of citrus azog Lin and Before we jump into how to reset the never on your screen you're seeing the old nether update logo it's been replaced with this new one it's pretty much the same but they've embraced the colors of the new types of fungus wood that we have in this update so that's the new logo for you so how about resetting v never dimension well first of all what I do want to say is you should always make backups when you're updating to a new update of the world this one was made in 1.15 point 2 if you want to make a backup the tools are now built in you've got a button right here called and make backup and then you can get to that backup if you have a problem in the future by opening your backups folder now we're gonna quickly jump into this world just so I can show you that we have an old never that's been it created here and what you should do if you want to reset your never is actually leave it don't leave your player in the nether because when you log back in you might be inside of some newly generated blocks so first thing is to make sure you and all the other players that play on that world are out of the nether now all we need to do is navigate to the world folder which we can open here and there are two folders that we need to get the right one dim one and dim - one dim one is the N dimension dim - one is the never so obviously you can delete this to reset it I'd also recommend maybe making a backup if you've got a zipping program to put it into an archive or you could copy it and put it somewhere else but essentially all you got to do is delete this folder so now when we're back in the world when we go through to the never it's gonna have to generate some fresh terrain again and you might notice that the terrain looks the same as it did before that's because of the way the new biomes have been added so if we go and explore for a second we'll find them before long and here it is I found a crimson forest so that's how you reset your nether and one thing to consider you might want to go into the nether and actually take out items or things of value that you've got in there so consider that before you delete your nether and reset and so my friends this each candidate was released on a first day I'm recording this on a Friday evening there is no second release candidate and if we get a second one it might be on the Monday but I think that's very unlikely it looks like this is it the 1.16 update is here and as you know it's coming out on Tuesday and so my friends it brings us to the end of this video if you've enjoyed it please learning how to reset they're never useful but anyway that's it from me thanks for watching and I'll see you soon with more 1.16 content bye bye
