hello everyone my name is andrew ajt and welcome to a new video today we're going to talk about something that is very interesting and this has actually been asked of me a lot and that is how do you rebuild in old school runeski so it's an unfortunate situation when you get hacked or when you get cleaned at the dual arena no matter how it happens it's a tough situation but there are many things you can do to rebuild and i actually want to talk about some of them today so here are my top five tips to rebuild in old school runescape because individual money making methods are so dependent on your levels in this video we're mainly going to focus on overall strategy to rebuild if you need to and keep in mind i recommend you do all of these things this is not like a list where i recommend you just do the best one and stick to it so without further ado let's get started number five is to prevent the situation from ever happening again so for example if you got hacked you need to figure out why you got hacked what went wrong and how to prevent it because you do not want to rebuild and get your bank back and then get hacked again and then lose all that progress again i know sometimes it could be easier said than done to figure out how you got hacked but definitely look into it i have an account security guide in the description which you can check out i recommend doing everything in there also you could get in touch with jagex support on twitter try to get some answers there if you lost your bank at the dual arena then you need to stop staking i've seen people rebuild a little bit then stake again and lose everything again and it's just a pointless cycle personally i would just avoid it entirely the math is not on your side you lose gp on average so definitely do not stake ever again those are just a few common examples the point is you want to figure out why it happened and how you can prevent it so you can just move on from there number four is to make good use of cheap gear because it's actually surprisingly effective this game is very well known for people liking the best gear possible we want the highest strength bonus the highest range bonus the most fancy gear ever but really the secret is the best gear ever doesn't actually help that much you can wear d-hide and an abyssal whip and a dragon defender and a helm of nate is not and actually be almost as effective as if you have the most expensive gear in the game yeah it's true in the long term that the better gear will actually save time and do more damage over time and the better gear might be necessary for some bosses depending on your skill level and stats but we're not talking about using cheap gear forever because the goal is to rebuild and buy the good gear back there's nothing wrong with using some cheap gear in the meantime even if it's a dragon scimitar or something and you also want to take advantage of untradeable gear so go get a fighter torso a fire keep a void set these are such good items that are literally free they just cost time to get also take advantage of some diary gear because you can get as many of these as you would like once you complete the diary so even if you have nothing else you could literally grab a will and a sword and kill green dragons for 10 minutes until you can afford a rune scimitar so really anything is possible there's nothing wrong with looking like a noob especially if you're rebuilding so i had a lot of ideas for the third entry on this list so i'm actually just going to combine them into some general tips here the first one is just to take your time falador wasn't built in a day so don't expect to be able to rebuild right away it's okay that your bank is not what it used to be and i would just suggest improving your account in the meantime and chances are when you're finished your account is going to be better than before you lost everything anyways also keep in mind that when you started runescape you probably had nothing as well so it's not like you've never been in this situation and now you actually have some massive advantages because you still have all your skills and more importantly your game knowledge so it should be much easier than before i also highly recommend doing pvm with friends because if you are doing a boss where the gear is somewhat important like for example at dk's it would be difficult to solo it with a d skimmy and a rune crossbow bringing someone with you could make it much easier dagonath kings is actually a perfect example of this because it's somewhat difficult to solo dks in very cheap gear but the duo is fairly easy with proper preparation and levels there's lots of other bosses like this actually and finally i definitely recommend going for a quest cape if you don't have one already there are some good money making methods which are locked behind quests for example rune dragons and thankfully most quests don't really require much gp to complete so it's a very good thing to go for the runner-up spot on our list is to go for pet drops i recommend doing this because you can very often earn a lot of gp and improve your account at the same time while going for a pet so for example the giant mole pet is a very good one to go for because the giant mole has very low requirements maybe at best you would want a derox set to fight it but you don't even need that you can use range and you can make some decent gp at the same time but it doesn't have to be a boss pet you could also go for skilling pets for example the chinchompa pet you could do red or black chinchompas or you could go for the runecrafting pet maybe afk some blood runes or maybe do some nature runes and you're making gp at the same time and rebuilding while going for that pet and if you actually did get the pet then arguably your account is starting to become better than it was before you lost everything because pets do not have a gp value in my opinion an account with lots of cool pet drops is much better than an account with no pet drops but just a bunch of gp the number one thing is to go for higher skills and diary completions i've been alluding to this one already because it is such a good thing to do and we are very fortunate in old school that stats and diaries are permanent so even if you got hacked again or something you would keep your skills they're permanent there's no negative xp lamps as far as i know and diaries as well they're very good to do because they give you all those great rewards and they just make your account much better and they will be there forever and there are some gp making methods which are dependent on diary completions to go back to the dagenham kings example if you complete the fremonic elite diary you get noted bones drops which is actually a very nice little bonus every trip from dagon off kings and will definitely help you if you're rebuilding more specifically i would say go for a 99 or two because those are really great goals for example 99 fire making is an incredibly easy one to do at wintertot it also gives you some pretty nice resources especially if you're an ironman slayer is also a really great one to train even if you don't get 99 you can get some very nice rewards from it you get clue scrolls which i recommend you do all of if you can and actually use the clue scrolls as an opportunity to train your skills and do quests if they're required it's also one of the best ways to train combat in the long run because it's a very good use of your time you're accomplishing a lot compared to doing something like nightmare zone where you're just getting combat xp and it's going to go to waste anyway when you get xp over 99. i also recommend training agility i think it's one of the more important skills in the game you get more free run energy which who doesn't like that and it's just another way that you can actually make your account better than it was before you lost everything so that is my advice for how to rebuild on old school keep in mind this is just my opinion and you're free to share some advice of your own in the comments of how to rebuild you could
