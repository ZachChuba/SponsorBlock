[Music] it's the most fun of that today we are going to be doing one of those fun pancake art challenges again you guys absolutely love the previous to achieve done so today we're going to be doing a little bit of a special edition and then also later on we've got a little now TV sponsored segment coming up - so today's special edition is going to be do pictures related to pregnancy is going to be a stalk because we all know that's where babies come from well that sounds great yes do you write in there you remember the film stalks that we watched before and done they they carry little babies in it and they deliver the babies for the mummies and daddies that when a baby super basic one bird carrying a baby out his beak Wow okay ready and go like I mean it's going for the pinky color this is pinky orange okay yeah no sorry is yellow that's the mingori color to my limited to view of colors do they need to be turned up wrong minimum at moments less let's go men to turn about to meet shall we store a store oh yeah it doesn't like something flying this case I checked shouldn't we show them a picture knowing they've just got use over time is making good progress there as well see this almost looks like a pink Swami yes oh it's at the beat yeah what do I know he stalks me like you need to get a move on Silla because I've watched you a middle bit it's gonna be cool maybe money is really yeah honestly the moment you said it I was just like wow welcome ok me is doing well though oh I like that come on see every right I'm gonna sit near you're doing really really well but I'm not going to say anymore because every time I say and Ciena stop doing my face head is trying to get some oh yes I'm gonna say that words Fiona said this bit is the cloth okay it's the baby and that's the beat developing no it's in a blanket yeah so most a bit bird baby as well isn't it so half-bird half-human modifications going on over here [Music] that's the thing when right you do something and you like okay it looks pretty good but maybe I can improve it a little bit and then you try and improve it and it goes wrong very generous I was going to call it pain but none of the rest of us actually tried no that's really good you thank them really well well we had to start with the beginning of the story didn't really you've kind of upped the Angela since last time so we've done some quite simple you know said the brain do it was quite hard yeah I was eager Sam Busan yeah me is ready to turn over this is a heart very close it's not just making at the pancake into like a pizza bar it's actually flipping it can you remember last time you borrowed each other's little would you have all these spatulas let's do a spatula [Music] no pressure no pressure [Music] [Applause] happiness you know when we've done them before sometimes when we flip them they look better on the side it's very modern art yeah very not enough all it needs is like you know a smashed-up shopping trolley taken at the top you make just these modern art pink yeah white with a big yellow beat I just wondered if you could get ready to flip tonight looking good it's so tempting to want to help her isn't it but I know that she's keen to do this so me and mum have got squat like yes I'm having too much adventure my back I should have fit straight to hell [Music] come on you can do it you can do you blame John the second one to lift it up flip side there we go yeah guys what do you think do you think the girl should be stoked about their stocks here is sin it's a very colorful clown like abstract spook holding the baby still alive very well done sienna and here is Mears which was almost looks like a flamingo what you think with the baby's still and TAS good well done Nia I might go easy yes too much adventure TV and all the passes but for now let's get back ones before I get a cartridge about you for gone about seven years yeah let's go back again to any of these you've got [Music] yeah [Music] well that's finished this it means your idea was good yes so the saying goes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery so what I'm feeling duck yeah yeah I think I know what me is doing now I think I know how to text me and I also think it's a clever technique because it probably means he's gonna end up wearing more pancake afterwards doesn't it she's gonna feel just like a picture but you're not copying [Music] hi purple see that purple it's nice knowing you I'm interested to see whether this is blue I'm not that much only a tiny tiny delay I thought it's the same color paint and then I've basically just been around the whole house and done everything that looks like a burger you know how people go like intimate and very modern armored games [Music] feel like a fire alarms gonna go off I think it's very smoky guys very smoky in here but still it's got one more little bit to do and then she's done well done until it's ready okay right you're definitely gonna burn again they're real like by it being bigger it might be harder to flip because you know you think they're in a fryer I could really see the sandwich like coming together and now my brain just looks for that on my voice going on okay guys we're now reversed go back 20 minutes yes to cook nice and careful you bad not ruin my gonna do this have you noticed something this time you're both making bigger ones and they're staying on there for longer and they're coming out burn I feel like the smaller smaller quicker ones Oh City that is your formula that is next buddies Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's a bit weird isn't it because we've actually turned a pancake into sandwich yeah Sienna's now is time for the bonus round where me and Danny pears compete against each other yes today we are going to be doing the pregnant lady emoji oh okay so you've got an unfair advantage because you already knew there's a pregnant lady maybe Danny Fitz let's go yeah but this thing is I'm Danny Fitz might not know what the mochi is probably should have seen that picture yeah Oh bump anyway let's just it's amazing there is no worms there it is kind of an arm across the table Cesare I didn't know
