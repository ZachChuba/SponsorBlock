I've never experienced something that fast in my life no like literally ever I feel like that is insane that was insane and I'm gonna look like an idiot for the rest of time on the internet because of this car [Music] all right so today we are reviewing a 20-18 Tesla Model S P 100 D the special edition of airy special edition and you know why it's very special JZ because it's real damn quick it's real quick I'm so excited ever since I we drove that Model 3 and I didn't want to give it back I've been looking forward to doing this car the Model S yeah or specifically if you want specifically the P 100 D but also any other Tesla or electric car because I thought I was going to hate the model 3 yeah I loved it just for reference the P 100 D is like the top-of-the-line performance Model S that Tesla makes it is lightning quick it has the besides of the dodge demon the fastest factory production zero to 60 time on record of any vehicle that's 2.5 cent to point five seconds zero to 60 time that is so in that most people think that that is a conservative estimate so I'm gonna hit it a little bit here let's see what you get that was just a 40 right goodbye I'm getting out that was so fast yeah oh my god I couldn't see straight we'll probably never drive something as fast as this honestly because even the dodge demon even though it's supposedly yeah zero to 60 time a 2.3 seconds and better the 2.5 on this the demon you can only achieve that if it's under like the right circumstance yes you have to have like the right gas you have to be at the right track you have to have like the right weather yeah the right weather this can run 2.5 seconds lake all day all day non-stop without any trouble that I mean I was I braced myself I knew it was gonna be quick but oh my goodness I Oh are you ready tasty yes so all right three two one oh I would I did my very best not to turn into a small turtle let's do a replay of that look at look how scared I am I was looking at the the speedometer I left with scars I like them I don't know if I like that my heart is yea really beating from that this it's one of those things where you know you're driving a fast car and it feels fast and you're having fun but it's not it doesn't feel like you're being pulled this feels like you're just being just being dragged faster than you can possibly keep up that was yeah it is incredible it's classy look yeah I think it looks very classy it's it's a good looking business sedan it's a good looking car that's not too flashy you know what it is you couldn't really tell the difference between this and any other Tesla Model S in my opinion yeah the only way you can really differentiate it is if you see the p100 deep badge on the back but even then play only subtle it's subtle and only car people or people who know it will know it yeah yeah everything about this car it's it's understated it's classy it's got a Dini tiny little ducktail spoiler little carbon a little goofy I like it it's not this they know what they're doing it's a little sporty touch but this is it stays true to its business sedan routes speaking of the carbon fibre I do like this is moving a little bit into the interior but there is carbon fiber all over ya this interior you've got some on the dash here you've got some on this little cup holder Heidi thing you can definitely feel more sporty in this than in a base-model ass now definitely yeah I think the biggest thing you notice right away is the gigantic that thing is enormous the gigantic tablet in the middle of the console yeah is nut I would say it's a goofy-looking but it fits right into this car it does it just it's cool cuz it just kind of like hovers yeah into the center and you can control so much we're almost in a video game driving this and having this giant map that's anonymous yeah it's like a RPG like I'm playing Skyrim it's like a Skyrim map yeah what else on the interior the heads-up display or like the dashboard is really really cool first off it shows you vehicles that are tracked by you and it's so damn smart it even showed when a motorcycle drove by me it showed a motorcycle that's great and that's such a small little touch but I thought it was so cool but that's so it's like it's important to know where motorcyclists are around yeah fact that it can even identify them that says a lot to what Tesla's done yeah and you were saying when you were parked earlier and there were three cars in front of you you showed you that was recall was at a red light and I was sitting behind three cars and it showed me three cars in front of me I don't know how is it detects that does it maybe estimate that the distance between you and the stop I know the style idea that's cool tip I really don't know how it's magic yeah it's just black magic that is so cool I don't know how they do it but they do it I'm very very impressed with how Tesla have integrated all this tech into their cars comfort wise on the interior very nice it's alright alright I think it's alright I think the interior of this is okay again you have to factor in how much this costs yeah this costs brand-new around one hundred and twenty thousand dollars that's expensive which is pricey and there are like I said with the model three Mercedes and Audi just do interiors better than Tesla yeah for the same price point or even less they are more luxurious they are made out of nicer materials but you don't get that accelerator you don't get the acceleration and you don't get the Tesla hype it's got some gimmicky features I'll say that I don't like what I don't like this thing this this is cup holder thing yeah we're struggling with that a ton of resistance pushing this cup holder thing back this cover and then to close it you have to just push it and it comes down by itself I kind of like that that's cool but yeah I don't know if I'm tired in the morning I just want to put like a cup of coffee there's like a good I don't want to struggle with rubbing it yeah I uh I like the the back seats are very spacious now you can definitely fit four people in this comfortably yeah I like that you have a USB plug in ports in the back so your rear passengers can charge phones or devices or whatever else should be standard in every car really it really should be you can also fit at least one human in the trunk we tested that possibly - possibly - I fit in there and it is a hatchback yeah it is a hatchback I love hatchbacks and that makes it a little bit more practical to you gets you get some more storage space you can fold the rear seats down you also have the from yeah that's trunk there's a pretty significant amount of cargo space yeah on this you can't fit a person in the front I mean a full-grown person you could fit a young person I couldn't fit in the front last time we we just did the acceleration where I just hit the pedal we didn't have it in launch control or anything like that this time we're actually going to put it into launch control there's a secret way to do that as a secret way well Joe you're driving I'm gonna do this for us so what you do you hold on ludacris on acceleration for five seconds and then scream goes warp speed here alright then it pops up a little little box here that says are you sure you want to push the limits this will cause accelerated wear if the motor gearbox and battery you got two options yes bring it on or no I want my mommy I really want to push no we're not pushing though yes bring it on excuse me a moment will embrace the missile alright so what you do is you put you put one pedal on the brake right oh yeah you push the brake all the way down push the accelerator all the way down and then it should say both pedals pressed are you pushing all the way down on the brake yes all the way down the accelerator there we go alright is it a change oh yeah alright when I let go of the brake it's gonna go off are you ready now let go of the like where the accelerator launched about an 8 there it is okay so you're wait for that to pop up so now I push on the gal you got a push on the gas again when I let go of the brake it's gonna go it's gonna go oh my god I'm gonna look here we go 3 2 1 Oh God sorry pedestrians don't mind us they're gonna call the cops that's the second time Sunday they're just like [Music] okay the question that I want to have answered by the end of this episode is is this too much acceleration no wow that was quick no it's not I will say if you are planning on taking this out on a track you would have a better time taking something that's more something that's gasoline-powered yeah because the problem the Tesla's have right now from my knowledge at least as they struggle on tracks because they overheat quickly yeah so if you take this even though it's fast and the handles well if you take it out on a track a lot it's gonna overheat quickly yeah there's the reason you don't really see Tesla's on tracks I remember this car is like science fiction in a lot of ways because I remember I forget what James Bond movie this is it was with Pierce Bronson Brosnan Brosnan Pierce Brosnan shows what I know yeah it was Pierce Brosnan you know his wife Rhoda was but like he has a car and he controls it with this cell phone that remote control feel calm tap twice roll your finger very slowly across the pad drive the car but you can do that with this now so great you can control so much with your phone this really is it's like a car out of Tron or something you have at least this model has a very nice sunroof that almost makes it feel like a convertible it's so big it's a giant so it's got two modes you've got vent which just cracks it up a little bit that's what we had okay and then you've got actually you've got a couple you've got 75% open and then you can put it back all the way let's put it back all the way so I light it yeah man this is lovely I know this is actually really pleasant with the sunroof yeah you don't get buffeted but you get the breeze so you get the smell to the open air outside you do get like an open-air cool breeze coming in so I'm playing with the modes right now I've got an acceleration in sport steering mode and standard standard you can definitely feel the steering wheels a little bit looser which is nice it does these these aren't just for show they do work I'm gonna put it in comfort mode now oh yeah that's nice you put that in comfort in the acceleration and chill yeah and this just becomes like a nice cruising yeah just becomes a nice Cruiser let's say that I yeah that acceleration is not reasonable it's reasonable it's quick it's not lightning no I just love how like this car can be so many different things and you just have to change the song Winningham you just have to program it to whatever you want that it's so easy to do you don't have to take it into a shop to like get it tweaked or anything you just change that yeah I'm sold yeah I'm totally totally sold on this I wonder if we're going to have a new highest rated car because you can you can take this and you can blast pass bicyclist when they're in your way or you can just enjoy a lovely afternoon cruising around we are ready to rate this car and the first thing we're gonna start with is performance tent which I would agree is that the acceleration is just so insane it is certainly alone I think gives it that 10 but the handling and the just secure yeah the capabilities of this whole car is phenomenal yeah and you can tweak it to you can get lower you can raise it you can adjust it how you like and it's it's just perfect yeah no complaints there yeah quality six and a half yeah I think I'd go with I think I'd go with that same to six and a half because it's good it's not stellar it's acceptable it's not stellar it's nothing like Mercedes or Audi we'd have to do like another episode of this car now so much we haven't touched there is there is autopilot which I forgot to even mention until right now when it came up yes there is auto pilot on this you can get it and it works yes and it's great everything about this car is great so yeah that that factory said that's gonna come into the cool factor coming up soon but first off before we get to there is about $120,000 $120,000 that's a lot of money yeah that's big money so and I think it's kind of debatable like it's definitely very fun very fast but you can get cars for less money than that that are still very fun that are still very fun and you can get cars for less than that that have nicer more luxurious cabins so the value is a little questionable for me despite that this accelerates faster than multi-million dollar hyper cars do you phrase this goes faster this accelerates to 60 faster so when you look at it that way when you compare it to the competition yeah that rooms about you that values high it's high but for the average person I mean I'll give it a 7 that's what I was thinking too actually exactly a 7 right on boy so coming up next is the cool factor which looks not I mean nothing super special it's a nice looking car but ya know one people don't turn their heads when they give me one line don't nobody this does not get a lot of attention which is arguably a good thing yeah so I don't know like it's cool for us and it's cool for car people or you know what it is but your everyday average person who looks at this one thing it's cool unless they sit in it yeah once they know what it is and feel it then it's cool yeah so I don't know I'd probably give this cool factor like not a super high score probably give it a 6 nice house to cure the same thing oh man all right and that takes us in a fun factor which is almost undeniable I have not got a smile on my face as big or lasting as long and anything I've ever driven I would not describe my facial expression as smiling but yeah it's a lot of fun despite it being really scary when you're in ludicrous mode so I think it's a 10 Wow 10 I think it's a 10 nothing has ever given me that much of a smile personally I think I would have to reserve 10s for four like properly manual cars because I think that's a part of the appearance for me it's more fun like to row your own gears as I guess but you'll never go as fast you won't go as fast no I'm fully aware that like their old school now they're not as technologically advanced and they can't go as fast it's like dual clutch automatic soar right and there you go hey you gave us a thumbs up for a Tesla I'm gonna give it a nine all right ramiz finally takes us to practicality which I also think is high it's an electric car yep and it gets over 300 miles back and it's a hatchback and you can fold the back seats down and you can dial them yeah and you have space on the front the only thing that I would maybe docket for is roadtrip ability play I'm taking it and stopping and charging but still generally quite practical I'd give it a 6 I think which sounds love will say that seems a little low okay at 6s 6.5 I'd give it a 6.5 I think on practicality yeah I'm gonna give it a 7 I think it I do think it deserves a pretty high score for practicality the only thing I wouldn't necessarily do right now is a road trip our average score together is for the Tesla Model S P 100 D 2018 is a thirty nine point seven five out of sixty thirty nine point seven five that's high about so roughly forty that's not the highest we have is it I believe it is is it yeah I'm pretty sure it is barely though I think it's I think we rated this barely higher than the I am Wow alright so we do have a new highest car yeah coming into it I don't know if I would have thought that but man after driving it this car is amazing well I don't think we're gonna have a car that can top this performance wise for quite a while probably not but hopefully we'll have something just as cool next week so if this is your first time watching thanks for tuning in and we will see you guys in the next episode yep Cheers heck is that a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
