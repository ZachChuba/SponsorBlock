[Music] I think we always want to get the most out of every game we play it's easy to play a game for a bit and discard it in favor of something more exciting but I've always had the mindset of wanting to arrive at a satisfying ending from every game I play sometimes this is impossible because depressingly downbeat games make up a fair chunk of my library but sometimes it's just really [ __ ] hard there's a lot of developers out there that make the normal ending very easy to get but hides significantly more intriguing and interesting optional endings behind some very hefty requirements it's like microtransactions but with time and efforts those devious bastards but what do you classify as an ending I mean it's not a hard word to understand but for example I wouldn't describe the crappy postcard you get from completing Super Mario Sunshine as any kind of ending this is all about optional conclusions that can only be accessed by running the gauntlet and being rewarded of a cutscene or two the only somewhat justifies the torturous pain you endure to get there for the record I generally don't consider endings that take a while to unlock as all that tricky to obtain since I'm under the impression that everyone has infinite free time to play a game for hours on end and definitely not watch my YouTube videos in the stairs don't worry I'd probably do the same I'm thinking that endings are the most valuable thing you can unlock in a game because potentially it can provide extra closure to a story that is lacking it without this optional ending and yeah there's the argument of why would you hide something so important this well but it might make it more satisfying that way just so long as you like endings with an extra dose of a big old sigh of relief any game with multiple endings can be pretty asinine to get on top of the push for player choice and having one hand on the wheel has increased replayability for a lot of friend choses out there but it's also increased the amount of time and effort required to see everything there is to see so it stands to reason that any game that has multiple endings and then one final true ending that unlocks once you've seen everything else is quite the undertaking and kind of agonizing if this scenario exists in a gang that isn't so great though maybe if you're willing to play through every path in Shadow the Hedgehog you care enough to look past this game's many many flaws greater men than me have failed to do that in the past it's very easy to forget with Shadow the Hedgehog the behind the fundamental issue of a Sonic game with edgy themes and guns there are multiple other problems like a broken physics engine and a hilariously convoluted story made up of player choice that gives you a whole bunch of endings that I kind of don't really care about this is an interesting idea in a fun game and a not so fun game though it is less so I think even a really good game having a system like Shadow the hedgehogs would start to great after a while in order to reach for true ending you have to play this game to completion ten times before one final ending becomes available to you by completing hero dark or normal missions in each level you can shift shadows alignment up and down and maybe reach an ending that gives you meaning in your life and answers the question of hey why am i playing this instead of literally any other game without a guide and a clear understanding of where you are in this ending shot and what you need to get next this is a hell of a lot of work for endings that yes ties things up in a nice neat little bow but does also flatten out some of the complexity that Sonic Team were trying to inject into shadows character he's less like an antihero in the true ending and more like a traditional protagonist doing a job that anyone else could have done is especially weird that such a bland ending comes after spending a long time exploring all the possible extremes two shadows alignment and potentially resenting the time you've spent on this game don't worry not every game on this list has a difficult optional ending that I kind of hate sometimes I like putting effort into video game speaking pledge so it's mass effect it's god damn obsessed of it and before even played these games I assumed they were shooters first an RPG second but honestly it's kind of the other way around and that's really interesting it's such a unique blend of story driven actions influenced by the player in a way that feels genuinely engaging and so naturally you'd expect the final moments of any game like this to really capitalize on this and yeah sort of for a star it does depend on which Mass Effect you're playing since I don't need to remind anyone watching this that the third game didn't really know what it was doing for the last half an hour of story and sort of tripped over itself and jazzed out a different-colored explosion depending on a button press that's quite sad but luckily Mass Effect 2 had the right way of approaching it by giving you one final mission to tackle in the game and a huge number of possibilities within that mission you have your motley crew of big personalities that you've grown to care for throughout your journey and now you're gonna watch on as you make poor decisions and they all start dying one after the other wait hold on I really like the suicide mission at the end of Mass Effect 2 for being this appropriately grand test of your abilities and competency for knowing which member of your team is best suited for which role the problem is that the margin for error is really small sometimes and characters will die very quickly for mistakes that don't necessarily feel like mistakes at the time typically there's a special ending available should you make it to the other side of the suicide mission with everyone still alive the problem is working out how to tiptoe your way through an hour of keeping multiple plates spinning and making sure no one dies from the multitude of threats and problems that are around every corner the awkward thing is that the true ending is simultaneously optional and also the standout canonical ending so if you want to experience Mass Effect 2 to the fullest you either need to pay attention to every minut detail or you know be a [ __ ] and user guide instead I always wouldn't blame you but I didn't just meant I got to listen to that sweet soundtrack a few dozen times I can think of worse ways to spend an often no one will ever truly know what's happening within the intricate workings of Yokote arrows mind the man's a genius and like every genius he's batshit insane and we're lucky he's making gains because otherwise I fear he might have ended up in prison for doing something really weird with robots having played Nier automata into the ground I would really like to pursue the dragon card games and the original near at some point since they seem to have similarly ambitious themes and striking visuals that make you pause and think wow someone thought this up and put this into a video game for me to play and Here I am eating onion rings in my underwear and yet the profound beauty has not been lost on me mr. taro I understand you but Nier automata was pretty wild it's even got 26 endings to tacko and most of them are [ __ ] stupid the joke endings typically exist as a reward for the enterprising player who attempts stupid things like self-destructing in the bunker or killing friendly robots but there's one ending that is far more complicated than that still kind of a joke ending but with extra stuff ending why also known as heady battle sees you run errands for a meal the weird head thing that you meet some way into the game which might be Yoko teros actual head there's there's no way of knowing for sure at some point you need to find and upgrade every single weapon in the game which is a fairly hefty undertaking on its own but not out of the wheelhouse of any dedicated player and actually this step is super important because a meal will become a giant super boss that you need to now defeat he is level 99 and if you're not close to that you're gonna have a hard time staying alive long enough to defeat a meal and use many ads it's an emotional fight really since it pays a large back to Emile's row in the first near but that's not what we're here for at some point a meal will initiate a self-destruct sequence which is exactly what you want since this is what destroys the entire planet killing all life but crucially triggers ending why and gives you the most complicated ending in the whole game problem is that you might not know this and might stop it and if you haven't saved beforehand you're a little [ __ ] ultimately you don't get ending wife beating a mill you get it for letting him explode and if you don't know that beforehand your your and your it's not gonna go well do you want to go through all that [ __ ] again and fight a difficult boss just for an extra letter to your collection of endings of course I do you don't know me hey it's this or trying to do ending a offline and just I'd rather fight giant heads all day that's not even a question come on what you might be working out at this point is that strategy guides can solve everything if an ending is difficult to obtain because of a need for a set of parameters to be in place you just look it up online and find numerous solutions that will spell the answer out for you as clear as day and that's fine I have I have no issue of that but all that does is make me want to look at endings that are difficult to reach even when you know what you need to do don't worry those exist and usually take the form of some kind of crazy endgame challenge that 1% of players will take on and even few will beat and see the fruits of their labors and be mildly disappointed that so much effort went into something so underwhelming Cave Story is the best part of 15 years old now and I have to remind myself with this fact on a regular basis because it was actually way ahead of its time in multiple really interesting ways like the [ __ ] optional final level of terror and sadness to reach for true ending that's my favorite one it seems like there's a lot of 2d platformers out there that like to focus on precision platforming and bouncing back instantly from a very quick death and continuing on regardless which is why perhaps there are so many bonus levels with a million spikes in them and burning any checkpoints Cave Story is the originator of a lot of this and naturally it's home to one of the craziest final levels you're ever likely to see there is so much death to be found in this level holy [ __ ] god damn so much death nowadays with games like Celestin hollow knight in the public consciousness cave story feels like it's from a different era of time entirely and yet the blood-stained sanctuary is a stark reminder that this game is more than capable of ruining your god damn lie supposedly this area came about because the original playtesters for cave story suggested that something should be added onto the very end of the game to give the player one final challenge to wrestle with I fear they may have gone too far because what awaits you is a large area full of very tricky platforming segments and a bunch of enemies throwing themselves at you with no end and then the ceiling is falling down and little angels are launching a hail of arrows at you and sometimes a youtuber will remind you to subscribe to his channel and hit bells for notifications and I'm like get the [ __ ] off the screen rabid Louie Jesus a billion ages in front of me our [ __ ] I died I blame you hey it's fine there's a creepy final boss at the end with four stages to his fight and no checkpoints in between here and the very start of the blood-stained sanctuary that's cool that's that's that's really really cool guys there's [ __ ] playtesters man giving everyone more work to do I've always been under the impression that anyone with enough time skill and patience can achieve anything in a video game you only have to look at the dedication of speedrunners out there to constantly push a game to its limits both natural and unnatural and repeatedly rewrite expectations for how fast a game can be beaten it honestly doesn't matter how many barriers you put up in front of an optional ending people will throw themselves at it until it comes down and they get what they want which is why I think the most difficult optional endings aren't to be found somewhere where you're relying on one person doing something really difficult they're to be found where you need lots of people doing something quite simple because damn we do not play nicely with others Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain was ambitious in a lot of different ways and in a lot of different areas often in ways that put series greater Hideo Kojima odds with Konami so much so that an entire chapter of content was maybe kinda sort of cut from the final game depends on who you ask it does mean that this game has a bit of an abrupt ending which I never really liked since I had too much shock value for me to really accept that this is how the phantom pain was always likely to end and that's very interesting because there is an extra hidden ending to this game that can be unlocked when all the nooks in the game are disarmed something that isn't very difficult to do on your own but you also have to rely on every other player on your regional server to disarm all of their nukes too which is likely hundreds if not thousands of nukes and that takes a hell of a lot of coordination I don't need to tell you what a tall order this is it's in fact such a tall order that it's only happened five times across all platforms since the game first came out in 2015 but even then it seems suspiciously glitchy you've got new counts dropping from three and a half thousand to zero in the space of one day and all platforms crash to the ground in an outbursts of peace and love on Christmas Day last year when all of the nukes magically and coincidentally disappeared at the same time I'm not saying there were shenanigans involved but I am saying that this is a bunch of [ __ ] and this cutscene has never been triggered in a legitimate way and that's a shame because it's a heartfelt plea from Kaz Miller and venom snake to take the finger off the nuke button and find a way to solve problems without blowing each other into a different time period why Kojima or Konami the need to hide such an interesting ending behind a set of circumstances that were virtually impossible to bring together is a mystery that we may never solve it's beautiful and yet virtually impossible to reach a pretty fitting allegory for this game in general sometimes this is about Luigi and the only question that remains is whether or not this ending is an actual ending or not and that really does depend on personal preference but to me it is because the finality of this cutscene acts as a conclusion to what a lot of these characters have been working towards in this game and in a way it's actually a happier ending than the one we get as official Canon it's almost an unrealistically optimistic ending like Hideo Kojima and Konami knew what they were doing by giving such a ridiculous set of rules to get this ending because disarming all the nukes is kind of crazy and unrealistic it's like art imitating reality in a way [Music] have you got a topic that you'd like me to talk about next week make sure you leave a comment about that down below because I'll be taking the most interesting suggestions and making a poll on the next video in fact here's one right now that I prepared from last week I'll be revealing the winner of the poll on Twitter and taking suggestions for games to talk about that are related to that topic so feel free to follow me over there so we can keep in touch thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music] [Music]
