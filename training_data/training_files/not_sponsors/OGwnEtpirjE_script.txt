using the link in the description late last year I upgraded the main camera I use for filming these videos to a Canon C 200 a cinema camera which means one built specifically for shooting video not a still camera that also happens to shoot video there were a bunch of reasons for this which I can get to in another video if you're interested but the biggest for me was the ability to run XLR mic straight into the camera instead of having to use an intermediary interface and recorder and the ability to get a picture that looks pretty close to an airy system but for like 1/10 the price at first I just stuck with my usual workflow I'm a big believer in first learn walk then learn fly so I recorded standard mp4 to an SD card color corrected it and that was pretty much it but one of the best things about the C 200 is that it can shoot in RAW which just like raw and photography captures a ton more information so you not only get a better quality recording you preserve a ton more options for color correction and grading so I talked to a bunch of experts I watched a bunch of videos and got ready to make the switch and start recording raw to see fast cards but a lot of the workflows I'd heard and found involved Adobe Premiere or even more frequently DaVinci Resolve and I just don't like either of their interfaces I use like and really want to stay inside Final Cut Pro 10 so I adapted I tested I tweaked I iterate it and I shared a lot of the work in progress on twitter' and insta-buck - give me your feedback and also ask a lot of questions about the workflow I was putting together questions I couldn't really answer until I had something I felt was at least a little consistent until now I'm Rene Richie and this is how I color grade vector now I'm still very new to raw and to this workflow so please take it more like a workflow in progress what I'm doing right now is a simplified hybrid of Tyler Stallman rubidium from the Crimson engine and Denver riddle from color grading central along with a lot of back-and-forth with Thomas Frank and Dave whiskas who picked up C 200 s and began grading raw about the same time I did and one more thing before I begin because Final Cut Pro 10 doesn't offer a native support for Canon raw light you have to first go and download the plug-in and install it from canons website which is annoying but at least only have to do it once now the C 200 records raw onto C fast cards which if you're not familiar with them are like SD cards on Hulk serum and the files get big like really big like one or a couple hundred gigabytes per recording big if I had one of those fancy new 8 terabyte SSD drives in my 16 inch MacBook Pro I just import it as is and get to work but I don't so I'm currently color grading right off the C fast card itself which actually isn't that uncommon so I create a new library I plug the card in spelunk down the directory structure to find the raw file click leave files in place and then click import then I make a new project fork a 16 by 9 and get to work now the recording is in C log which is a flat color profile and Final Cut Pro 10 knows that so it automatically applies the appropriate LUT a lookup table to map the C log to a standard color profile in this case rec 709 now I know high dynamic range is where everything is moving to but YouTube just doesn't support multiple dynamic ranges well enough yet for me to be able to use it without degrading the experience of like 90 plus percent of you but hopefully one day personally subjectively I find the Canon LUT a little warm from my tastes I could turn it off which would return me to the flat flat C log look and I could correct contrast and saturation and then grade from there but I do like the way the air youlet looks no surprise since I said from the beginning that was one of the main reasons I went with the C 200 so I'll typically apply the built-in version of the air II lot or the Crimson engine and mondo bytes version of the area let which increasingly looks even better to me at that point I switch Final Cut Pro 10 to the color workspace I've got it set up so I can see the luma waveform RGB overlay waveform and the vector scope also if you have an iPad with you you can totally sidecar your workspaces even if you're working on the road which is terrific or use an additional display at work or at home to keep things simple and capturable for this though I'm sticking to a single display I start with color Corrections because again I'm a firm believer in strong foundations and so I begin by adding a color wheels adjustment I like the wheels because you can adjust a lot of the things all at the same panel I'll typically adjust the shadows and highlights first so they sit at 0 and 100 on the luma waveform respectively then I'll tweak the mids and adjust from there until I get a range I like next I'll tweak the saturation starting with the mids because that's where most of the skin tone lies and I'll use the vector form there as a guide if I think there's anything wrong with the white balance I'll go find the x-ray color checker passport reference I include at the beginning of every shoot scale in and make sure the neutral gray is really neutral gray according to the RGB overlay before continuing once I think everything looks right and properly correct I'll switch to the grade the difference between a color correction and a color grade is that the correction is doing exactly that making sure that canvas is completely correct you're starting off with the picture as close to objectively natural as the camera could possibly capture the grade is the art you then paint onto that canvas the stylized subjective look you want to achieve think the neon green in matrix I'm currently working on the teal and orange look though because it's the simplest and best documented almost of the point of being a cliche and again again I'm a firm believer in mastering the basics before getting all experimental now the next part used to take me three or four separate steps and adjustment layers but I've managed to simplify it down a lot for the grade I now begin with the second color wheel adjustment add a color mask select the skin tones then invert the mask that lets me keep the skin tones as natural as possible as I push teal into the darker regions when you toggle it on and off you can see the difference it makes then I'll add a curves adjustment here I can tweak the contrast if I want to and push the skin tones more towards the orange if I need to or recover some of the teal out of the shadows if I need to do that I'm also experimenting with D crushing the blacks a little which is something I learned from my friend mark wim and more recently mando bites the skin tones are something I'm still struggling with obviously but I feel like I'm understanding the process more and more every time I do it maybe in a month or so what I'm more comfortable with their workflow I'll save it as a preset in Final Cut Pro 10 so I can just dry and drop it onto the footage and give myself an even bigger head start out of the gate I do wish Final Cut Pro 10 had an extra set of tools that worked more like aperture or Lightroom or photos with contrast and other traditional photo editing sliders because I'm super used to editing photos with those sliders but I'm learning my way around the tools they have for now maybe also a set of tools like word DaVinci Resolve so people who want to switch to you or stay in Final Cut Pro can feel even more at home once I get to the point where I'm happy with the grade I export it as a pro res for to to file and when that's done I import it back into a new Final Cut Pro 10 library and project this time onto my SSD and I begin to edit that's also where I switch from sixteen by nine to two by one and I've done a whole video explaining that workflow which I'll link in the description so going raw has added some extra time to my workflow but I think it makes for better video and it's letting me learn a new skill which is invaluable to me stream and thanks all of you for supporting the show like I said this is very much still a workflow in progress if you have any questions or tips of your own I'd love to hear them so hit like if you do subscribe if you haven't already and color great that Bell gizmo it's the only way YouTube will actually tell you when new videos go live and then hit up the comments and let me know thank you so much for watching see you next video
