Halloween has been and gone and you've all seen the build-up of Halloween and spooky themed videos and then of course on Halloween you can't escape them they're everywhere I'm guilty of contributing no you're welcome and just when you thought you got too much Halloween you when you do you think you've had enough and you're sick of it huh well guess what we're doing post Halloween you welcome again because I can't help but think yeah once a year your mouth on these horror Halloween movies where horrific things happen or spooky ethereal otherworldly events caused catastrophic violence and problems but what happens after all of that happens I mean what happens to the people who ended up - feeding the bad guy did they build a new life or do I become the bad guy or is there another completely different horror lurking around the corner these are the questions I am asking you and would encourage you to answer in illustration or art and creativity form in an art competition I'm entitling after the whole to participate all you have to do is create an artwork digital or traditional depicting horror movie or game characters in what you would deem appropriate aftermath circumstances or events you don't have to stick to critically to the law like if Freddy Krueger or Jason or some other classic characters end up getting defeated in their movies or whatever stuff it you can bring her back and just decide maybe they escaped or maybe they went off and did something else and I'd encourage you to put in as much effort as you can because there are some fantastic prizes in this art competition including but not limited to to digital display tablets in some of the top prizes but we'll get to all that in a moment let's start off with how to enter and getting started there are two different categories you can enter and they both have separate eyes pools and they're judged separately but in saying that please make sure that the beginning category is something you only enter if you're very young or very new to art if you've been creating art for a few months or a year but you are older don't enter if you've been creating art for a couple of years but you're let's say under 11 years old then of course you can enter the beginning category now first and foremost the deadline of this competition is Wednesday the 20th of November and to qualify you must upload your complete artwork on Newgrounds comm via the art portal and when you submit there make sure to tag your entry with one of the following depending on the category you're entering if you're entering the open category tag your artwork with the word after the horror comp or one word or if you want to enter the beginner category make sure to tag your piece with B - after the horror comp that is B - after the horror but in entering this competition you are only allowed to submit one final artwork which is tagged one of those official tags if you tagged any more artworks on your grounds with that tag you will be overall disqualified as qualified your piece must have no pornographic material or ultra violent content keep it pg-13 and make sure your final piece is tagged and submitted by that 20th of November deadline now there are two more rules that I want to put a little extra weight on this time because there was a first prize were in the last month who actually did not abide by them and was eventually disqualified and I have reshuffle the winnings amongst those who I deem then to deserve the prize but specifically these rules are who must not submit any artwork that was not created by you and also was not created specifically by you for this competition you cannot repurpose someone else's creation you cannot combine artworks from separate sources or submit old artworks this is a competition where you're meant to submit an original artwork based on this theme and to provide evidence in your description showing that so please link in the description of your entry on Newgrounds to a work-in-progress whether it be an image or time-lapse video creation or if it's a traditional artwork a picture selfie of you holding your creation when you're halfway through and you need to verify in the description that your creation is original and your own and also be aware that my community is very very very communicative and will watch everyone's entries and pick up when something is not right and then let's move onto something a little more positive let's get to the prizes and this is very exciting once again there are two categories beginner and open category the beginner category has a runner-up and winner the runner-up will receive an item of their choosing from the Jazz this year's Dom shop which is a place where I have created and carefully

still portable and really affordable so it's great so great in fact that the first prize winner is going to be very happy to receive it along with one year of premium Skillshare membership so this is a pretty big deal this is going to be a really fun competition and I love these sorts of things because you guys get to be really creative so make sure to get ambitious both with your technical execution and your artwork but also with your ideas most importantly have fun and learn a couple of things along the way even like some friends and memories to cherish for years to come what do I talk like that when I do my silly stuff but now to actually get serious it's a really terrible segue to me genuinely getting serious actually wanted to talk about the unfortunate situation that happened last night and that is partially on me should not have seen that but at the same time when I'm looking through thousands of entries there is an element of trust where I really put a lot of trust in you guys to be submitting things that are your own creations and 99% of the time that is the case but it really was very disappointing to me for someone who obviously is very talented enough to create something very convincing even to the point of having a work-in-progress entry that made me believe this was their entry but thanks to the help of people in this community on Twitter it was proven to not be the case not be entirely original there were some elements of the artwork that was their own but at least half of it was not and that is pretty disappointing a lot of people put a lot of time into this and I see that every time we do these competitions and it really is hurtful to me and those people in the competition who put their hard work in it don't enter this to win prizes and don't think you can trick the system into winning those prizes because even though this one came close it hasn't happened and even if it did happen it would just mean you will burn in hell and that's the truth anyways all that out of the way this really is an outlier situation and it hasn't really happened before in this sort of way because so many thousands tens of thousands of you have been respectful of the process and I just want to really take this moment to thank you for putting in the hard work those of you who enter these competitions who work hard who build your skills who don't have expectations of price grabbing or blaming judgment decisions who are in it for the positivity and growth and fun you are the reason that I'm even willing to come back and do this stuff and go through the difficulty of the judging and the prizes and all that stuff because you inspire me every time it happens and I am just blown away by your talent and I cannot wait to see what you come up with with this competition so thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video make sure to hit that like button subscribe for more fun with art and creativity occasional little events and competitions like this and of course there are more videos over there you might otherwise that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
