around till the end of the video you little button a Oh what up Pig famous me your boy sorry I've been gone a couple weeks I know I'm just getting over a sickness also I've been working on some music stuff see that's some look forward to but we're back with the hot and spicy and a little bit of a disturbing weird strange meme that has been happening gender reveals now I'm sure a lot of you guys know about gender reveals what they are what it's about me personally I've been through many gender reveals now I don't really think the whole idea of having a party to celebrate your first child and have a gender reveal within that party is really a bad thing you know having a party for celebrating baby cool whatever you know I've been through many of those parties but the aspect of the reveal of the gender has really up the ante lately like lately it seems like everyone's just like oh I saw this on the internet I want to take a step up and try and beat that person you know what I mean and one that has really been circling around that I think it's just straight killed it for everyone and I'm sure you guys have probably seen this video by how trending it has been and it's been all over my face everywhere and I don't like it it I don't like it at all the thumbnail of it just the first image you have to click it it's just a girl just laying on the ground she has got a shirt on but just her pants are off and it's just an awkward spot she's in her kitchen there's balloons behind her it's a very confusing shot so even if you know you're not a 12 year old horny boy and it was just hoping that there was gonna be some action in there you're just curious enough to just click just to see what happens but let me tell you what you or our thinking is going to happen or what you're hoping it's gonna happen it's not gonna happen [Applause] [Music] yeah you rethinking clicking on this video you re-evaluating your life decisions on watching my video you're gonna keep watching though you little [ __ ] now at first I was very confused cuz I didn't realize it was a gender-reveal I thought some girl just was laying on the ground and farted some smoke then the other girls are like cheering her on like good job good job farting that that puff the puff air that came out but no either she shoved some blue powder up her ass or someone just sprinkled some on it on her on her [ __ ] and then she just just a little poof was a little popped out but after I saw this video I gradually fell down a rabbit hole of many different gender reveals that are just I don't understand why people are doing this I honestly don't understand what finding out the type of genitalia that is going to be on your child is that important in people's eyes like I don't know even at my own gender reveal party I was just like I don't even I don't even care I don't care what gender my baby is like habes girl cool this is a boy cool like well I don't understand why it's a huge deal plane crashes during gender reveal mishap so basically what happened is I guess the crop-dusting type of plane that they said they're gonna dump 350 gallons of pink water over I don't know I guess over the people or something like that long story short and I quote from this article the airplane got too slow aerodynamically stalled impacted terrain and came to arrest inverted gender reveals are getting so important and so crazy that they actually cause death yeah of the dying variety it's gay long story short the family tried to make as some sort of device or like like an explosion of dust or our lino so basically what they did is accidentally made a makeshift pipe bomb for some reason thinking that gunpowder and gender-reveal go hand in hand you know they they know nothing about gunpowder or how to use it correctly apparently they put it in a metal tube and then a piece in the middle to went and instantly killed a 57 year old woman just Bob and hey it's a girl and on this article that I was looking at a belated dying from flying debris apparently a dude started a massive Arizona wildfire from doing a simple gender reveal i what what what even are people anymore I don't understand no if we look at this right here this is in the middle of a very dry area with a lot of very tall grass and very dry trees maybe it's not a good idea to shoot something that explodes in a ball of fire I don't know maybe they just didn't think that it would cause fire but normally when you shoot something that explodes a fire happens and this I I can't they're just dump their dumb freaking people that's all I could say start packing off no I love how these people run out there they're not trying to put out any fire they're not trying to do anything like they didn't even have precautions they didn't even have a bottle of water like nothing literally no safety precautions at all it is get out get out he started the fire just stuck running just act like we didn't do anything like you're not gonna call anyone like they could have prevented a massive literally a massive Arizona wildfire it literally took over 47,000 acres on fire they could have literally stopped that by just hurrying up and getting help and said nope grab your [ __ ] and go man hurry up go they don't give a [ __ ] and then we have this other trend of people feeding animals stuff and then when they bite into it the blue or pink come out and it's just I don't really get it because it's always dangerous animals like this for example it's a hippo literally one of the most deadly animals you can possibly mess with I mean I'm sure they had hopefully they had someone helping them but I think a hippo why choose a hippo I don't understand does that add just a little bit of extra excitement in your life is that really what you need do you really need to throw a watermelon full of blue or pink dye into a hippos a mouth what is wrong with you I also find it hilarious how the dad was like oh thank God thank God thank God it was a boy like feel as a girl well I'll do it myself God ought to raise a man and go hunting with the boys you know I raised a little girl I don't want to look like a gay dad a gay dad a gay dads only raise girls I don't get it you know normally the the mom it seems like the moms are always impartial like they're like happy the way but it's like the dad they always want the boy they always want the man I don't [ __ ] matter oh here we go we have another installment of feeding dangerous animal stuff that have color in it ah man that dog that dad's really disappointed a girl what am I gonna do with a girl teach you how to put a dress on like I don't want a freakin girl I don't want to look like one of those [ __ ] dads I don't want to be a [ __ ] dad but the bunch of girls that was like the most anticlimactic like you know hype of the gender I've ever seen like everyone was disappointed there was only a few people that were actually cheering like everyone's like freakin freakin grown man come on bro I want to know on a man I wanted to raise a boy so I could teach him how to how to kill deer in the woods ha ha I could teach him how to wait around for hours on end you just finally see a deer and then miss my shot and if you don't think feeding an alligator with the stick is dangerous enough here's a dude just just handing just like very calmly watching the video didn't think I'd check your vibe [ __ ] go on handing an alligator putting his hand in an alligator's mouth just to show the gender of the baby but regular [ __ ] [Applause] like bro straight up what if that al gears decided today he wasn't gonna play nice and every single person there was gonna get their their legs snapped that like it literally just takes one little click one little snap and the alligators chillin out in the open everybody just right next to it always to do is his turn his head and boom he's got a leg look I know he's probably trained I get I know the dude who's doing it might know what he's doing it doesn't make it any any less stupid this doesn't it's for a gender-reveal and we can add the list of this is not a big deal by looking at someone who almost started a fight over a gender-reveal apparently there are some people late-night at Applebee's I don't know if they were drinking I assume they probably were but for some reason they decided to all bring confetti cannons themselves and shoot him off in the store and out in the parking lot and so people were getting confetti everywhere like in their food and all this different stuff out in the parking lot on their cars and so you know the people came up and were like hey can you not do that can you leave because you know you're getting confetti everywhere long story short they ended up starting a fight with the staff telling the hostess they're gonna beat their ass all because they told him to clean up a mess that they made over a freakin gender-reveal also not to mention they just dined in - they didn't even pay the bill they just dip it actually reminds me of a gender-reveal party I was at like obviously you know like it wasn't like anybody got fight no one was aggressive but it's just just thinking about it in hindsight it's just like I don't understand why they did it they got a bunch of confetti cannons and stood outside houses are like right next to a bunch of different houses like it's in the suburb like everyone's really close and they just lit off these confetti and it was windy so it just flew down to everyone's yard covering everyone's yard everyone's houses like on their roofs everywhere and there is even a dude mowing in the next yard over while they're just shooting off a bunch of confetti and it's just like flying everywhere and I'm just sitting there just like why are you doing I don't understand like I don't care about the confetti cannons but you're literally just shooting it off and everybody else's yard like I don't know I I don't I don't understand gender reveals I don't get it Leslie I just think everybody needs to chill out with the gender reveals like you have a party and everything that but what what's up with all this extra [ __ ] man you know you're just finding out the gender of your child you know you don't need to start a forest fire you know what I mean you don't need to kill your grandma over tell them to use my coat as well by
