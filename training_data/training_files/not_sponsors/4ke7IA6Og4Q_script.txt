Solar’s New Challenge Hello~ Solarsi...Ddwoo! This is Solar I prepared a guess the tteokbokki
brand challenge today! Yeah~~ As a tteokbokki mania I’ve went around running my mouth
that I really like tteokbokki. Today’s challenge is a way to find out
if I really love tteokbokki. So, in front of me, there are 5 tteokbokki brands. I honestly don’t know them. I also came wearing tteokbokki makeup today,
(Refer to the last Solarsido episode) If I show you it a bit Tteokbokki makeup, tteok-ma. Since I’m also wearing tteokbokki makeup,
I will properly start tteokbokki makeup- I said tteokbokki makeup.. I will start guessing tteokbokki brands! Starting with number 1. (Anticipation) Tteokbokki number 1, looks like this. [Tteokbokki number 1 with only rice cake] First, the smell. Number 1. [Nyam] I know it! I know where number 1 is from. Because I knew after smelling it. (Eyes that are full of certainty) Wanna eat tteokbokki with me~?
(Tteokbokki CF, want you) Number 2! Tteokbokki number 2. [Tteokbokki number 2 with thin rice cake and fish cake] [As expected, smell first..] Oh?! Is this... (Unsure) I know this? I know number 2! Number 1 had a lot of a black pepper flavor. But number 2’s rice cakes are a bit thin. I know this brand with thin [rice cakes]. [Nyam]  [Tastes good] Okay This is enough, I think I know number 2. Number 3. Cheese tteokbokki~ [Tteokbokki number 3 with cheese on top] [Tteokbokki number 3 is quite spicy] [Spicy, but tasty~] But, number 3, too... Number 4. What is this, beef brisket?
[Tteokbokki number 4 that has beef brisket in it] Guess it wants to make it
interesting for my tongue a bit? Ah, this, I think I know it! This rice cake is... GOSH I thought it was a worm The rice cake, look at it, everyone! How am I supposed to eat this..? [Ah ah..] [Oh, this flavor is..?] I know this rice cake! But, I haven’t tried it a lot.
(Yongddon-sshi knows quite a lot of rice cakes in this world) Once? I think I’ve ordered it before. (Gotten a grasp on how to eat it) It slightly feels like I’m eating kimchi? I’m going to eat one more bite of this first~ Number 5. This is the last one. Number 5. [Tteokbokki number 5 with a quail egg in it] The visual is quite familiar. (Serious) Ah, I got it! I know it. This is a hint, so hot~ [Taste test over] I tried them all. I know them. (Confident) Wow, am I this much of a tteokbokki lover?
(She has not gotten them all correct yet) I know it right after eating one bite~ Number 1, first of all.. It’s strong! The color itself is really dark. And there’s a lot of a black pepper
flavor, like I said earlier. There’s a strong black pepper flavor.
(Almost like Sol (Dae) Jang Geum) It’s really spicy! But then you really crave it! You know that spicy flavor you crave? [Tteokbokki 1 that Solar thinks is?] I think this is Sin**** tteokbokki. Number 2 is~ A tteokbokki that I really like lately. It’s really sweet. It’s sweet and the rice cakes are really thin! It has those charms. [Tteokbokki 2 that Solar thinks is?] So I think this is Emergency **** Tteokbokki. (Song that it makes you suddenly think of) (t/n: izi’s ‘Emergency Room’) It makes me think of ‘Emergency Room’. I sang that song a lot. [*Hear more of it in the behind the scenes] Anyway, I think this is that tteokbokki. And, number 3! First, the cheese This cheese hardens! This has that con. It hardens, but, it has the strange charm
that makes you still eat it. It’s a tteokbokki that lots of people like. Yeopgi Tokki Tteokbokki is what I think it is.
(t/n: yeopgi tokki=mashimaro’s name in Korean) (Satisfied with her own witty naming) When I also have a schedule or am working I really eat Yeopgi Tokki Tteokbokki a lot. I ate it a lot, so I know it well and it’s a familiar taste. So I think it might be Yeopgi Tokki Tteokbokki. I think Number 4 and 5 are a bit difficult. By my standards. But, number 4.. It’s a tteokbokki that I have a sense of kinship(?) with. Why? The rice cake, first of all, was long 
like a rounded rice cake. And it as the beef brisket in it.
That’s a big merit. But, what I had was really long ago,
so I don’t remember it well. I’m Yong, right? [Tteokbokki 4 that Solar thinks is?] So this, there was something called YONG tteok. There’s something called Y.O.N.G. tteok. I think it’s that.. My assumption. (Slightly uneasy) And, lastly, number 5. This one, first, the color The color seems like it has a lot
of red pepper paste in it? But this is the only one with a quail egg in it. It’s a great merit. And the rice cake is really short! It’s short and fat! Short and thick. Like my hand. [Tteokbokki 5 that Solar thinks is?] So this, the way I see it, number 5 is Sangeo tteokbokki. Sangeo tteokbokki. [Solar’s assumptions]
[1. Sin**** tteokbokki, 2. Emergency **** tteokbokki, 3. Yeopgi tokki tteokbokki, 4. YONG tteokbokki, 5. Sangeo tteokbokki] My assumptions are like this.. First, from here Are there ones that I got right? There are? (There are) Are there ones that I didn’t get right? [Yes..]
There are ones I didn’t get? (Disappointed) (Quite shocked) No way.. I think it’s this. I feel like it might be this (number 4). This one is a bit, unfamiliar! This one is a stranger to me! [Number 4 tteokbokki is sad ;_;] I’m a tteokbokki lover,
but this is an unfamiliar tteokbokki.. Ah, I feel like it’s this one for some reason. [Answer reveal time] Number 1! Is it Sin**** tteokbokki? Number 2! Is it Emergency **** tteokbokki? (Happy like she won number 1 on a music show) Number 3! Is it what I think it is.. Yeopgi tokki tteokbokki, is it YeopToTteok? [3 consecutive correct answers!] Number 4! I am kind of unsure with this one. (Not confident) But, just like me, Y.O.N.G. Is this YONG tteok? [What is tteokbokki number 4....?!] Shi... [Quite disappointed...] Why isn’t that it..? What is this? This is unfamiliar to me, too!! (Yong-mumble)
I don’t know what this is.. Number 5! Last one. Is it the Sangeo tteokbokki that I think it is? It’s not..? (Both eyes wandering) Betrayed.. Ah! Oh my (Remembered it) Daddy and daughter tteokbokki. (Certain) Is it not Daddy and Daughter tteokbokki? It’s not? What is it? What in the world-? Is it.. That tteokbokki that makes you exclaim?
(Previously Daddy and Daughter?) It’s not? Ah, what is this, what tteok is it?
(Quite disappointed) I got it.. I’m sorry. Convenience store tteokbokki! It’s not? This is unfamiliar. What is this? Snack cart tteokbokki? Kkachisan Station tteokbokki! No? (Flustered tteokbokki mania) Tteokbokki from in front of my house! But this visual is kind of Sangeo [brand]? This is Sangeo. (Sangeo obsessed) It’s not? Witch tteokbokki! What is it? This is unfamiliar? This is one is a stranger, too! 
(Types that are really shy) They’re unfamiliar~ They’re tteokbokki that I don’t know. It has beef brisket in it. [Answer reveal]
[4. Child ㄷㅂ tteokbokki, 5. ㄱㅅㄱ tteokbokki] Ah, I haven’t tried this place yet.. I haven’t had it, so it was unfamiliar.
[4,5 were all tteokbokki that I didn’t know ;_;] Anyway, out of 5,
I guessed 3 correctly and got 2 wrong. It means that I got the majority right! It means that I love tteokbokki by about 60%.. You could say that I love it. It’s a shame.. Though it only shows that I love tteokbokki 60%,
I really do love tteokbokki. Next time, I will meet with you all
