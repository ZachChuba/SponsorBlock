so the general wisdom these days seems to be that if you want to save a buck and build a gaming rig AMD is the way to go but what does that mean exactly like aim DS for poor people who can't afford Intel well at a very high price point you could make that argument I mean remember we're talking about gaming here where Intel's top spec chips do outperform AMD's but most people aren't buying top-of-the-line computers and that doesn't mean that they're poor it just means they want a good value so we designed today's challenge to find out if AMD's performance deficit can be overcome by its advantages which include less expensive CPUs and motherboards and included overclocking support all the way up and down the rise in lineup and I think you guys are going to find our results really surprising no matter what you were expecting I certainly did [Music] challenge so head over to builds GG today for your chance to win so we're gonna start things off right with a head-to-head build off basically here's how it's gonna go down using PC part picker Anthony and I are each going to put together the best build we can one for each side with a budget of 750 US dollars before taxes and shipping and a big list of requirements we both want to be able to overclock if not now then later on we're both gonna need at least one terabyte of storage and 8 gigs of RAM and we both want at least a 500 watt power supply with 80 plus bronze certification so here we go then first order of business is going to be the CPU both of us know that we need something reasonably powerful but because of the overclocking stipulation Anthony's going to get a big discount by going with AMD because all desktop rising processors are unlocked thankfully the core i3 83 50k isn't too expensive also because AMD's mid-tier chipset enables overclocking I can save money by going with a B Series motherboard not the cheapest one mind you because overclocking is a consideration I'll want a board with decent VRMs of course my K Series chip also doesn't come with a cooler which means I need to drop you yet more of my precious budget on one of those wow this is starting to add up for really quickly knowing Anthony's going for higher speed memory I can claw back a bit of my budget by going with a less expensive kit unfortunately that does mean that the per thread performance gap is going to close between us which is something I can't really afford pardon the pun for storage this Hitachi 1 terabyte drive is a no brainer there are cheaper one terabyte drives but none are 7200 rpm I'm also gonna pick up this DIY PC case and a Roseville arc 650 watt power supply it's not the best quality unit but for $40.00 it's 80 plus bronze and has a three-year warranty onto the graphics card I really don't have much money left to spend here and this is probably where I'm gonna get killed I can only hope that Anthony isn't very good at putting together value builds okay you just about ready there Linus it's been a while yeah I think I'm done you good yep and with that our builds are complete so pencils down time to compare ooh yeah I think I win well okay it's not about whether you win or lose it's is it more about how you play the game oh okay well I think I played better gaming so we've got a lot in common we're both only spending 20 25 bucks on our cases yeah Rose will power supply you got the hard drive as well the graphics cards gonna kill me honestly I could almost afford an RT X except I couldn't write and I've only got a quad-core processor cause your CPU is only five bucks more even though I'm only a quad-core but like it's a faster quad-core than it is than the rising cores are so it's the $45 on the board and the cooler that are costing me that GPU upgrade yeah the RAM is cheaper too yeah I probably should have gone dual channel it didn't make that much of a difference so here's the thing requiring overclocking capability isn't really fair in the sense that Intel can deliver much better performance per dollar outside of their k-series overclockable chips even if those limitations are entirely their own doing so let's actually work together then and modify the blue team build to try and get a little bit closer to that bang for the buck shall we sure basically CPUs gotta go yeah and I think you can get like an 8400 out of that 8400 is such an underrated CPU sixty-four reviews is all it's got the value was entirely there yeah that's outstanding so that means I don't need a cooler any other you that I don't need as e-series board anymore yep you can go with a I would say P 360 so now you should be able to afford the 2060 okay so with the Intel build now running a more reasonable B Series chipset because we can't overclock anyway we're able to get both a more powerful CPU and GPU so that six cores now end in our TX 2060 so with this modification then our specs actually even out significantly but it's worth noting that any edge the Intel system gets in its stock performance in games may be offset at least partially by AMD's unlocked core multiplier and higher thread count depending on the workload so now what well why don't I throw a couple of benches together and see if I can't figure out what the performance difference is between these oh so we're not just gonna do this theoretical we're gonna build these rigs and see what happens yeah I like it after an afternoon of prep our performance results came out to be pretty interesting as you can see our first builds are really different but while our AMD machine is way out ahead thanks to its powerful RT X 2060 graphics card Intel does pull up close in some less GPU bound cases and in csgo even manages to pull ahead though it should be noted that this game is notorious for performing much better on Intel when we overclocked our first builds all those extra threads on AMD's processor added up to a lot of oomph and since our graphics card was a little bottlenecked at stock this translated to a nice increase in gaming performance so AMD beat out Intel by about 6% overall with that said our overclocked Intel machine on average beat our stock AMD systems our TX numbers not bad for a GTX 60 and 60 moving along we've got our adjusted builds so remember our AMD machine saved a few bucks on the motherboard and our Intel one jumps up to a core i5 8400 and our TX 2060 but loses its overclocking capability so here Intel is top dog for performance neither machine overclocked but then gets edged out by our overclocked AMD machine this is proving to be a much closer race than we could have possibly hoped and it gets even more interesting when we look at the value proposition for our original configurations despite very decent performance levels and a lower price tag the Intel build ends up delivering poorer performance per dollar than our AMD won both at stock speeds and when both of them are overclocked now our Intel build ended up a little bit cheaper though because we had some budget left over just not enough for anything that would impact performance like an RT X upgrade so if you were building this box at home and didn't have a hard and fast seven hundred and fifty dollar limit the story might be a little bit different but we're operating within the constraints that we set and amb came out ahead at this price point as for the adjusted builds this puts Intel's value at the closest to parity out of all of our comparisons but then when we compare it against our AMD builds overclocked numbers it again gets edged out and I guess it's that that word that keeps coming up edged that is kind of the most interesting takeaway here so as it turns out go figure neither AMD nor Intel's product management departments are staffed by sea sponges and every rig from both teams regardless of overclocking ended up being within about 5% in terms of the performance per dollar like it's almost like AMD's pricing structure is designed to maximize their profits while slightly undercutting Intel but not so much that they have to react and drop their pricing and like Intel's is designed to demand a small premium because of their more recognizable brand truly fascinating isn't it I actually I honestly did not expect it to be this close though like when we set out for this what was the what was your expectation I was expecting AMD does Capri Intel at the low end and then when we you know adjusted them I would expect Intel to cream AMD because it's roughly the same price and and you had six cores of more gaming optimized single threaded performs like it yeah so I don't know we we ended up with a result that wasn't what we were going for but we certainly had a lot of fun with it and let us know in the comments below if you'd like to see any other of these kinds of value analysis pieces in the future maybe at different price points or looking at different components of the system rather than just the CPU speaking of in ifixit.com forward slash
