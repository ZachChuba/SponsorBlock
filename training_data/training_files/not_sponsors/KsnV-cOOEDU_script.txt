epic moments in history jinke rise of the pirate queen this video was sponsored by joy city jingchou is one of the most accomplished pirates in history starting off as a destitute courtesan and working her way up the ranks she would eventually reign as Queen of a massive pirate fleet of over 70,000 men and 1,200 ships not only would she terrorized the South China Seas but she would ultimately live to tell the tale and retire with a huge hoard of treasure today will be retelling her story playing by using this link in the description below Jing Chi was originally born she young in the Guangdong province of Ching China little is known about her humble origins she seems to have made her living on the streets before finding employ as a courtesan aboard a floating call house in this capacity she found herself with access to many important clients Jing she was thus able to use her charm and wits to advance herself at the time it was very difficult for Chinese women to wield official power within the male-oriented Confucian society non elite or socially unconnected ladies would therefore have to develop their own alternative sources of legitimacy and authority the power of such women ultimately rested on the strength of their personal relationships Jing she proved extremely capable in these matters and is said to have developed a reputation for her shrewd business savvy and trade in secrets through the pillow-talk of her wealthy and political clientele her activities would surely have seen her cross paths with the most notorious pirates of the region southern China at the time was a particular hotbed for these naval bandits the area had always seen some level of piracy due to its large sea based communities and prosperous trade routes increasingly however land annexation was kicking more and more farmers off of their lands and into poverty where they would make easy pirate recruits this trend was made more severe by the frequent fighting taking place around the Vietnam China border both sides would ravage one another driving even more people into poverty these conflicts even saw military sponsor piracy aimed at their opponents or even hired them on as privateers or mercenaries in their own fleets all this action made the South China Sea one of the pirate capitals of the world in 1801 at the age of 26 Jim she would marry the notorious pirate Shing yut through their marriage she is said to have negotiated a 50% share in his business ventures for the time being they worked together to consolidate their holdings the couple adopted another Pyatt junco as their stepson I had two boys of their own soon however the time would come for some aggressive expansion in 1802 one of the major conflicts in Vietnam drew to a close the Pirates which had been operating in the theatres of war as mercenaries now begun to return home however as they did so they would find that government troops were too busy suppressing the White Lotus rebellion to keep them in check as a result these forces simply kept up arms rather than demobilized the vast numbers of pirates in operation would coalesce into six fleets each with their own leader Jing she and her husband had come to rule the red flag fleet which they now bolstered significantly with the new recruits from the conflict in Vietnam this move made them one of the most powerful fleets in operation these large pirate Confederations inevitably sparred with one another as tensions escalated however such turf wars could prove ruinous to all involved the crisis was averted thanks to the clever thinking of the Jin's who realized that their efforts were wasted fighting one another the husband-and-wife team went to work on a plan with jingyan acting as a unifier and patriarchy and Jing Chi acting as a consolidator and organizer the two masterfully managed to unite the various fleets this was orchestrated by establishing a complex series of personal and familial obligations between the various rulers and the Jing family in 1805 the fleet leaders finally sat down as one to make an agreement a pirate alliance was founded with the Jing's at their head however in 1807 Ginga would die unexpectedly this sudden turn of events threatened to set the whole house of cards toppling to the ground yet Jing she would not stand idly by she was a woman of extreme ambition and fortitude this would be her finest hour acting quickly Jing she made well calculated moves to keep the pirate Lords united and to secure her position at the top of the hierarchy she began first by solidifying control of her own fleet this was done by gaining the support of her most powerful chieftains and intensifying the personal bonds they held to her next she sought to find a new head of the red flag fleet Jing she elected her adopted son Junko as the leader he was both the competent and respected leader who most importantly held unshakeable loyalty to the Jing family thanks to owing his entire career to their support now with this valuable ally in place Jing she was able to leverage the strength of the red flag fleet to bring the others de heal by carefully balancing the factions and exercising tactful diplomacy she succeeded in persuading the pirate Lords that their interests were best served in collaboration coming from a woman these arguments would likely have fallen on deaf ears in the male-oriented Confucian government of Qing China however out here at the fringes of traditional society Jing she found a more receptive audience that was used to women playing a more prominent role when it came to helping families scratch a living out of poverty after all it was Jing she who was a 50/50 partner in her husband's affairs and who was the true mastermind behind much of the financial business operations that were making the pirates so much money lately in the end they bowed to her rule jinke then further united the fleets by issuing a code of strictly enforced laws meant to establish a general organizational framework these are typically recorded as follows one anyone giving their own orders or disobeying those of a superior was to be beheaded on the spot - no one was to steal from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates three all goods taken as booty had to be presented for group inspection the booty was registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader the original caesar received 20% and the rest was placed into the fleet wide public fund forthe actual money was turned over to the squadron leader who only gave a small amount back to the caesar so the rest could be used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships these codifications helped establish new military and financial frameworks for the fleet by pooling resources and acting as one their power grew immensely no longer would one bad haul or a damaging battle be enough to defeat the Pirates now they had a massive war chest to weather any storm and could make strategic large-scale investments where they needed them the motley pirate startup was becoming a massive organised company and at the head of it all was Jing she having a woman leading such a powerful organization was unheard of at the time what makes a story even more amazing is that she used her power to implement new rules aimed at protecting female captives swept up in her operations rape was forbidden and even consensual sexual relations were barred for pirates who were already married to other women violations were punished severely with flogging clapping in irons or quartering ultimately it was said that the codes gave rise to a force that was intrepid in attack desperate in defense and unyielding even when outnumbered Jing she now led one of the largest pirate fleets in history with the force of over 70,000 men and 1,200 ships they robbed towns markets and villages from a cow to Canton as the Pirates continued to grow they established financial offices and sought out new sources of income racketeering schemes and participation in the all trade had always been profitable but now Ching she turned them into money printing businesses by expanding their operations to cover all forms of maritime traffic from local fishing to foreign opium trade pirate activity grew so large that they even began to act as their own local government establishing hegemony over many coastal villages and in some cases imposing levies and taxes on settlements even the official Qing government in the region was bent to their will through bribery and extortion this all quickly escalated to the point where the Pirates had set themselves up as untouchable masters of the South China Coast for years the Pirates under Jing Xi's rule could not be defeated by Qing Dynasty officials nor by rival pirates nor the Portuguese or British bounty hunters sent after them her squadrons laid waste to enemy ships even sending forces on land to overrun Garrison's and fortresses such was their strength that they precipitated the downfall of several prominent governors and humiliated many powerful generals they were unstoppable in January of 1808 the Pirates continued to cut their way up the government bureaucracy and managed to kill an important provincial commander this was a threat the Ching dynasty could no longer take lightly the Emperor now sent a new official Bai Ling to quell the unrest he would arrive just in time to witness Jing Xi's latest plan a full-scale assault on the Pearl River Delta which included the rich ports of Macau and Canton for a full year terror rained down on the lands in the form of cannon fire and pirate raiding parties some reports claimed that just one expedition carried out by the Black Flag fleet claimed 10,000 lives by 1809 the Chinese government was forced to recognize that the pirate threat could not be dealt with head-on they were forced to swallow their pride and seek an alternate means of subduing them this would include the dishonor of simply paying off the pirates to stop and stooping so low as to recruit foreign aid this change in tactics came at just the right time when the Pirates were open to talks janeshia and her fleet were in need of heavy repairs after their heavy campaigning the previous year and had been forced to retreat from land due to increased government resistance as well as the betrayal of a former pirate Ally in addition ching she herself had just barely broken out of a blockade at lantau with some clever maneuvering and some luck she knew that the winds were beginning to change what followed was a period of negotiations aimed at dismantling the pirate confederation through offers of amnesty surrender without retribution in essence the Ching dynasty would give the Pirates a chance to cash out on their earnings several tense encounters took place between both sides as the talks began Jing she knew that she held a strong hand and used this to her advantage she refused to stand down eventually the offers tipped more and more in her favour when a dramatic engagement saw the Pirates take a hit at the Battle of the Tigers mouth against the Portuguese Jing she knew that it was time to settle on April 8 1810 Jing she docked at Canton and presented herself to Bai Ling and the highest officials of the province she presented her terms these were laughably in favor of the Pirates however all laughter was cut short when Jing she ordered the Pirates to ravage the surrounding areas she was deadly serious ultimately the government caved on all terms in exchange for their surrender the Pirates would avoid punishment keep their loot maintain a portion of their fleet and be offered positions in the Jing bureaucracy this masterstroke is one of the most spectacular career moves I've ever heard of and definitely should place Ching XI in the pirate Hall of Fame in the end Jing she retired from her pirate life she wound up marrying her former son-in-law Jung PO who was now a rising government official and together they would raise a daughter when he died in 1822 she took the opportunity to open a gambling house in her later years the retired pirate gotten involved in the salt trade and even served as a military advisor during the First Opium War in 1844 Jing she would die peacefully in Macau at the age of 69 surrounded by her family and mountains of treasure I hope that you've enjoyed this incredible tale the meteoric career of Jing she was truly remarkable especially given the stifling social mobility of women at the time tales of
