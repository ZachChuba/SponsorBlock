pickaxe let's go hell yes boys we have ourselves the crystal pickaxe now the best crystal or the best pick us in the entire game and fully loaded with 10,000 charges what's that's crazy man alright guys let's check out the collection log of the Sookie no grind where would that be oh ok nice they put on the bosses section so here it is the pet we got one tool seat we got to soak any shards we got whoa three onix's really oh yeah man overall pretty damn nice we actually filled a collection life with this so that's kind of cool hi even though you know stuff like this happens you might be wondering how much resources they end up getting from 1700 so he knows and unfortunately a lot of the jobs just ended up stacking with my previous jobs from other places so I can't really give you a really good idea other than one specific type of ore and that is Roux night or so when I started okay know I pretty much had none just because I turned them on to Dodge previously and I pretty much ran out but yeah man from about 1700 so he knows I amassed 4,500 room pars and 4,000 pounds of route or is there about equal amounts from her so yeah man totalling 9,000 basically brew night bars and that's crazy because what would I do with these uh well I would turn them into rune darts most likely I did at some point had like thirty forty thousand rune darts but I've used them all in the past so now I have you can almost argue unlimited supply of rune darts yeah that's that's that's actually massive crazy amount and I mean all these other ores as well like atom and stuff you know I I have so much I can give you guys an idea what type of ores and you know bars unpacking elsewhere but yeah it's it's actually you know disgusting a lot of this obviously came from Sookie know some of them runes as well she also drops a bunch of runes but yeah the only ones that are precise is the brew knight now at my level of 99 mining dram pick accent you know close to the best gear I was averaging close to about three million our so in 1700 so knose using the three male average per hour 15 kills I was probably getting around 350 mill Chiefy from all those kills and you know minus a few mil maybe on like supplies like brews and stamina it's not not much though honestly but yeah man 300 plus no profit probably from 700 it's crazy this bosses hunt see one of the best moneymakers in the game at the moment players often get hacked use my promo code Frye scope to get 10% off everything alright guys I'm about to do an hour of so kano with the best set up possible for us okay know so we got the crystal pickaxe the biggest thing we got the frack armor for for the extra tough rose we got the max cape or the mining cave for the extra tough rough and the elven signet which is a nice bonus helps me reduce the charge use by a little bit it's about time that I taught you guys about this okay know hose French ass so this is a French that I use occasionally to find teams force okay know so usually operates in for man's you know what I noticed that with a crystal pick I can get the tough for a teeny bit faster that's like usually I can't get the tephra if the exploding things about to hit me but I can actually get it now oh just sit at 34 that's the highest so far I've seen with a crystal pick alright guys this is an hour of doing so Kano so here is the Lutz let me show you in a second okay I'm gonna show you guys the XP per hour as well so first things first XP per hour is getting about 14.5 K - an hour about 3000 Smith experience an hour 1 point 4 K proof crafting experience an hour - alright guys I'm going to show you a full hour of lutes with besan song gear or a decent approximation here so two points 6 ml regular lutes and about 300 K and crystal shards so that's about three million which is exactly what I was kind of looking for it fluctuates a lot depending on how lucky you get August see with stuff like rune auras and onyx ball tips I'd say I was pretty average you know when it comes to the big-ticket drops so yeah it could change quite a bit you know you could probably go up to 4 mil if you get lucky on some of the drops but yeah the crystal pickaxe definitely did do its job though so there's one place besides ok now I want to test out the crystal pickaxe at and that is the mother lode alright boys I just did an hour of the mother lode so as you can see XP per hour was 52 K I'll be honest pretty sure I was like in the mid 45s back in the past with the DRAM pick so yeah it's actually quite crazy but this thing probably cost it quite a lot of charges ah look like a few hundred for an hour but yeah if you have a lot then I guess it's not a big deal but very interesting nonetheless so I just did over an hour of using the Ferno axe which is the best sex I would use outside of the crystal axe with the lumberjack top so this is the farming Gill redwood and the XP per hour I was getting around 50 7.5 K so if you were doing redwoods in the what can I go it'd probably be a bit more than that maybe like 60 K you know what the extra we're cutting boosts and stuff you guys aren't gonna believe this but the numbers don't lie I've been here over an hour with a crystal axe and I'm getting over seventy thousand what can experience an hour at redwoods 71k pretty much that's about 13,000 experience difference crazy that is actually crazy even more massive difference than like the crystal pickaxe I've noticed but honestly both of them it's noticeable you don't really need to see the numbers to know that the speed is definitely better on a crystal site but quite a bit so I've been at the redwoods for a while and I think I'm just gonna stay here for the rest of the grind on back because I do want to get the wicking in bed so that is extra credit you know I my pet was now I'm thinking about using the inferno axe because it makes the redwoods even more afk as there is a chance that the wood that I get just gets burnt and I have a lot of ammunition to charge this thing like I have 15 dragon axes I might as well I mean it's just sitting here otherwise you know I have all these dragon axes all right so I figure out some statistics with the inferno back so the inferno axe has a 1 in 3 chance to burn a log and what that means is to reach a foreign tour it would take about 50 percent longer so that means I'm afk about 50 percent longer the inferno acts at full charge is 5000 logs 5000 red blue logs fire-making XP wise 1.75 know your fire making experience 1 dragons axe where the charge is gonna last me such a long time so it's gonna take me forever I've never actually be able to use all my giant axes anyways 193 greater name is holy crap otherwise no oh Sami spear let's go oh when you pick this [ __ ] up hold on well we picked it up boys we got it oh I didn't know I totally forgot one of these guys is a lizard demon champion ah what a troll man oh my lord my second lizard champions growth what the hell man slime my first one wait what's lizard demon champions crow wait I never gone this before or am i dumb seriously what's this one in Champions girl oh my blown cool cool cool actually this task was more fruitful than I thought oh [ __ ] I just hit 3000 xkc god I need to start paying more attention that's it hey three out of the five thousand to the pet ray oh boy oh boy we are slowly earning that one two eight nine mil and the Warriors ring two boots damn 9 mil tes holy crap guys I'm over 60 dragon axes now that's a lot of inferno axe charges I got one more video of mr.
