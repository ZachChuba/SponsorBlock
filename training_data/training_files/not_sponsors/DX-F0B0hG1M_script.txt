the Mac Pro it's not a bad machine although choosing the Zeon W at this point in time was an unfortunate decision we'll revisit later ladies and gentlemen its later so to help you understand which model of Mac Pro you should consider and whether you should consider one at all we got our hands on the 8 16 and 28 core Xeon w's and laborious Lee tore down and rebuilt our Mac Pro with all of them to find out where the sweet spot is to make our testing more complete we also built benches with both a Verizon 939 50 X and a thread Ripper 39 70 X to see if any Mac Pro is the right choice for a high end workstation or if Apple made a big mistake going Intel this time around just like you'd be making a mistake by free worldwide shipping at the link below [Music] this is awful we'll begin with Cinebench where oh dear it's really not much of a contest is it I mean sure compared to the iMac pros last gen Xeon w performance is up but both our 8 core and even our upgraded 16 core Mac Pro get creamed by our consumer rise in bench that costs less than the base model Mac Pro unsurprisingly then the thread refers 39 70 X for its part embarrasses the entire lineup virtually across the board and adding insult to injury even that bench is less expensive than a base model Mac Pro there are a few cases where Apple wins though there's the Firefox compile test where the 28 core Mac Pro picks up a convincing win of about 50 seconds over thread Ripper and then there's puget bench for After Effects a compositing benchmark weather 28 core Xeon W actually posts better overall numbers than thread Ripper though not by much and the rise in 939 50 X is also in contention for top spot ouch now granted our risin 9 and thread Ripper benches are equipped with much more powerful Titan r-tx graphics cards but the thing is that card costs half of what the Radeon Pro Vega 2 duo in our Mac Pro does Apple's beef with Nvidia is clearly hurting their competitiveness in tasks that call for GPU heavy lifting and it doesn't always work to just throw more smaller GPUs at the problem in case you guys were wondering for games the bootcamp drivers don't enable crossfire so performance even on Windows is about on par with just a standard Radeon 7 there's one other potential market for Apple that some of you commented on in our review that has absolutely no need of a GPU like that and that is the audio engineer market where more PCI Express slots is more betterer and yeah I can see that for sure especially with how many Mac only audio packages are out there it kind of doesn't make sense but it's one of the many reasons why it's such a great option for audio and music production you could theoretically cut a vocal or voiceover like I'm doing right now and it does not make a sound but the thing is that's clearly not who Apple is targeting with this machine with the focus on their afterburner accelerator cards dual Radeon Pro MPX cards and massive system memory capacity and for that matter thread Ripper out does the Mac Pro in PCI Express as well with 88 gen 4 lanes compared to see on w's 64 lanes at gen 3 speeds there's just no way to sugarcoat it Apple far as we can tell should have gone with thread Ripper or epic here I mean just look at what blur studio did with thread Ripper on terminator dark fate we're in an interview with post perspective founder Tim Miller says the difference for the artists is that instead of working here until 1:00 a.m. they're going home to put their children to bed something that normally would take five minutes was taking five seconds you're just not gonna get that level of performance out of any of these Dion WS and with this reality I can't see many of the Apple holdouts holding out for much longer maybe Apple simply wasn't aware of what AMD had in the pipeline or maybe they just didn't want to optimize their software for AMD's unconventional chip lit CPU architecture but whatever the reason Apple's in a position now where not only their price but even their performance isn't industry-leading on this machine but let's say you're a Mac based VFX outfit and you're overdue to upgrade some machines as you probably are if you're stuck in the Mac ecosystem what trim level do you go for there may not be a single definitively right answer here but there are definitely a lot of wrong ones so let's walk through it we know that Apple's base model Mac Pro costs six thousand US dollars and for that you're getting a laughable 32 gigs of ram and eight of Intel's Cascade Lake CPU cores it's worth noting that this Ram configuration is suboptimal not only for how little you get in a machine costing this much but also because it's only four sticks meaning that you're not fully taking advantage of the six channel memory controller on your xeon processor so regardless of any of your other choices you want at least 48 gigs of ram or you're gonna be leaving performance on the table that's a $300 upgrade if you get it from Apple putting us at 6300 u.s. dollars but we actually still recommend sticking with the base model as far as memory goes and installing your own third-party memory it's shockingly fast and easy and I couldn't believe how much cheaper was it's important to note that just like on a PC additional memory will not improve your system performance unless you regularly run out of memory so guys if your workload doesn't demand more system performance will be just about the same going from 48 gigs all the way to one and a half terabytes bumping the CPU up to a 16 cores xeon w 30 to 45 means that you're out another $2,000 from Apple and it is worth noting that because this is not an M series CPU you're going to be limited to 768 gigs of RAM only the 24 and 28 core models are capable of handling the full memory loadout that is so much memory though that unless you're doing 8k raw compositing you probably won't need it anytime soon speaking of the 28 core that's a $7,000 upgrade from stock and as some of you rightly pointed out as an N series ii on these do command that price from intel not the $4,000 price Apple actually are not the ones who marked this one up and that M distinction is important for two reasons one if you're upgrading for yourself you need to make sure it's an M series CPU that you purchase in order to get that extra memory capacity and - this is cool if you don't need one-and-a-half terabytes of RAM you can actually get away with the standard xeon w 3275 for a lot less we tried it and it works fine even though Apple doesn't offer that option themselves as for the GPU there's really only two choices that make any sense right now compared to the single GPU Radeon pro Vega - card the duo gives you a better upgrade path in the future so we would go that route if you need the performance today if you don't need the performance today you can get the stock Radeon Pro 580 X and then replace or augment it with an off-the-shelf Radeon 7 or even rx 5700 XT while you wait for the Radeon Pro W 5700 X to come out that MPX module while it's not yet available is Navi based which should mean a significant performance uplift over the current factory options and support for a display stream compression while still providing you with additional GPU provided Thunderbolt 3 ports now only you know how much SSD storage you need and only you know whether or not the afterburner cards sole function of decoding up to 8k pro res raw makes any sense for your workflow but what I can tell you is that you're a sucker if you buy the wheels okay yes the feet are kind of hard to get off but you can remove them on your own which means you can install your own wheels if you really want to and probably for a lower cost in time and raw cash than the wheels cost at 400 dollars besides it's not like the feet are unusable so we'd recommend saving that money and celebrating all the i/o on this thing with a t-shirt LTT store I'll come any other upgrades like internal drive bays or raid controllers have to come after sale so we won't get too much into those other than to say that they are available and we've got a video showing how to install them and besides for expanded storage I would really recommend an ass in this day and age anyway remember guys you've got dual 10 gig NICs in here so even if you don't have a 10 gig switch a 10 gig equipped NAS can be directly attached without forcing you onto wireless connectivity if you really need the speed so with all that in mind here are a few sample configs that might make for a good jumping-off point if you're in a situation where buying a Mac Pro makes sense for you follow these guidelines with your use case in mind and you'll be ok it's not quite all there is to know though so get subscribed so you don't miss our video on the rack mount version of the Mac Pro for today the final question though is this should anyone who doesn't have to buy a Mac Pro buy a Mac Pro based on what we've seen oh hell no the thing is you're not the target market anymore and frankly no matter how elegant and innovative the machine is and it is after seeing these numbers I just can't be convinced so close Apple if only you'd chosen a different platform that performs better and doesn't cost so much and if you're choosing a different platform maybe try out our sponsor privacy com any
