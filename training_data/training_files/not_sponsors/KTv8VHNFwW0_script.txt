So a few years back on our patreon page some of the patrons were like hey, you guys should do a meetup in Nashville So that you know, we could all hang out well It turned out that it wasn't a few patrons that ended up being a lot more than we thought and then we did it the next year after that and it was even more and it was actually kind of Probably illegal how many people were stuffed into one house so we decided to get a venue and have it again this year I remember the first year we did blimey uh we were so nervous that we weren't going to know what to do with all of these people that were coming to our houses and But then I remember that first night that everybody got here We were all having so much fun and people were just like hanging out with each other and they'd all become such good friends That like there wasn't any pressure on us to like be entertaining. My favorite thing about blimeycon was probably coming and getting to meet all these really cool people My favorite thing about blimeycon was just meeting everyone meeting all the people This was the place where I got to meet my internet friends for the first time. Yeah, it's cool Looking around and seeing all these people who are such good friends now when they would have Probably never met if it wasn't for these only videos that we do I've become really good friends with a lot of the people - so it's blimeycon is like my favorite time of year Because all my friends are in one place, even if you don't know someone here you feel like you do anyway Just because you have so much in common already. You just become best friends through it From the moment it started I enjoyed myself immensely everybody's been so nice I'd say that the majority of people I could count as friends come from the blimeycow community. I became a patron Just to come to blimeycon. The film festival was really really cool to watch I loved seeing all the creativity from all the various patrons how they were working together And I mean, honestly It seemed like it was a real bonding experience for everybody and it was  just a lot of fun to watch I thought it was really cool that we had like an impromptu swing dance party There was something that was a little bit unexpected because we didn't know we were gonna be doing that but we got the suggestion to do that and that's something that Jordan and I really enjoy doing so it was really fun getting to share that with everyone if all of this looks really fun to you and you want To be a part of the cowMOOnity as it has been dubbed. That's cow Moo nity and go to Patreon.com/blimeycom and maybe you yes You will make the drive the truck the fly - blimeycon 2019 here and beloved, Nashville We planned this whole thing ourselves and it all came together really nicely but it was definitely stressful along the way Thankfully it was a lot easier this year because we used our website to disperse information about the event We set up a password protected page where all of our patrons could go to to get more information about the event So we want to say thank you to Squarespace where we built our site for helping us make blimeycon a lot easier to manage We built our site with Squarespace and I just love how easy it is to add pages and then quickly link people to it So that everyone can get the information We're trying to share very easily Squarespace is an all-in-one platform Which means that they do at all domains websites online stores marketing tools They'll give you a beautiful online presence Even if you have very little patience for building websites like me Their templates are award-winning and they have one no matter what you're trying to do They have 24/7 customer service if you ever need any help and now you can even transfer your third-party Domains very easily over to Squarespace.
