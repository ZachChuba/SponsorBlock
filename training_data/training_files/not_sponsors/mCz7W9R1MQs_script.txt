far above the western lake exists yet another hidden realm of the sky called the cloudscape filled with powerful enemies such as thunder mages masters of teleportation celestial crystals creeps glowing creeps thunder creeps and Lance centuries it is the new home of the essence of air which happens to be both the least destructive and easiest to deal with of the five essences making it a fairly viable weapon in a normal run today we're gonna go on a bit of a tour of that area as I demonstrate how to acquire this from a random new game okay so we're basically gonna be doing a speed run of sorts over to the cloud scape that's what the point of this is and I'm doing it from a random seed because I actually enjoy this type of run it's a something I've been working on a lot lately behind the scenes cloudscape speed run this particular one this is post commentary by the way I'm gonna be just commentating on it as I watch it back with you guys it's it's not the fastest I've done but we actually get some pretty good luck here what we're looking for in the mines we just got the first piece of the puzzle fire bolt which is pretty common in the mines you may not find it but that's just to help us get over the cliff because we're gonna head to the desert and use the desert skull portal to teleport us to the lake because most of the time we can use it also to climb over the tree but I found that going to the portal or the desert and using the portal actually saves some time so that's usually the shorter route unless you get something crazy in here in the mines like like teleport or something which you almost will never find but you could every now and then get lucky and find a teleport spell in here or in a chest especially so we got everything we needed we got the fireball to help us get over the cliff and we needed three flasks or two-and-a-half flasks because we need to fill them with water for the desert skull portal here I'm just gonna use that fireball just to make a tiny little indentation in the cliffside just to be able to fly over this some people can fly over it from the very bottom by tap levitating and then I also found I got lucky and found and invisibly um I was said in visibily um but it's actually an invisible iam I'm just gonna keep calling it in busy Billiam because it rolls off the tongue a lot easier for me that's gonna help us a lot especially for video it's gonna help me to actually just be able to stroll through the cloud scape for the most part take a good look at certain things without having to run in and try to find the essence of air in a mad dash just like oh my god help you know which I could do I've done it in the previous run that I was gonna make this video with that's how I did it but we lucked out here I could do a little bit more casually take my time breathe in a little bit enjoy the sights and sounds of the cloudscape you know okay we're at the giant desert skull we just got to blow it open I'm gonna use a bomb cuz I want to conserve my fire bolts just in case because we need a way to open up the the receptacle of the essence of air anyway here we got to fill this eye socket with two and a half flasks of water anyway take this portal and now we're at the island in the middle of the lake and the cloudscape is directly above us right now but we have to we don't have any teleport so we have to go all the way over to the cliffside and climb the cliff slowly and I did make a video showing the locations of all of the essences in that video that was made back when the air essence or the essence of air was still inside the moon now it's been moved to here and I wanted to cover the cloudscape in a video and I didn't want to make just like a 30-second video like hey here's the cloudscape here's the essence of air there you go so I was like let me do kind of like a speedrun' type of thing over to it but that's like the point of this just showing you that you can acquire it fairly easily especially if you find in visibily um in the minds considering all things considered like when i say fairly easily and fairly quickly I mean like this I think it's easy I think it's pretty quick to here's our first enemy bad force enemy to find so I got some invisibility and here I'm gonna demonstrate that we're on clouds and liquids go right through the clouds so you could spray it up on top of you too and that's what I I do here in a little while even if you don't have invisibility if you know how to dodge the enemies which I guess the the worst enemies here for dodging are probably well these guys the thunder mages echo I believe they're called but you basically just have to dodge vertically just make sure you when they they cast pretty slow at you so just fly over it when I cast at you just make sure you give yourself enough time to get over it there's a thunder creep down there anyway the worst enemies pretty much are the celestial crystals they have a tendency to be they're pretty difficult to dodge when they start shooting at you you got to be kind of close to them for them to shoot at you though so here we are the home of the essence of air who's gotta use a fire bolt I lost my invisibility of course here comes a creep messing me up now and I ends up just hanging out here a little bit too long I could just lay a bomb there right now but I decide to this hang out a little bit for whatever reason you got to just lay a bomb there and then just throw another one in there and it's open now we can just jump down there and grab this however the essence of air is constantly rocking like that and even with invisible iam your invisible young or your invisibility it constantly gets interrupted so goodbye invisibility but good thing we're up in the sky and so we basically just have to fall down and there we go we've gone to the mines quickly teleported over to the lake climbed up to the cloud scape took a nice little stroll there grab the essence of air and now we're free to go on a run through the entire game with the essence of air which is actually a lot of fun and I do recommend you try it the biggest difficulty of doing a run with the essence of air is blasts you're not really gonna be able to obtain any from this point on because we're just gonna blow them away and break them and there's the major difficulty you're gonna want to stay very far away from any kind of poly morphine because that can end your run immediately no matter how powerful you are case in point what happened to me on my new game+ seven run anyway so that was my video on the cloud skate like I've been saying I'm gonna be covering everything about new ADA as the game progresses through early access and development and post early access development as well hopefully I'm gonna be covering mods as well very soon because the update did just come out that allows Steam Workshop support anyway I hope you enjoyed today's video have a great day and I'll see you next
