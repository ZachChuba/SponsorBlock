[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you're having an amazing day so far I'm super excited for today's video because it's my master bathroom makeover we have lived in our new home for over a year now and finally got the chance to update this bathroom I will be showing you heidecker eight in each space and share really nice budget-friendly items to take your bathroom to the next level [Music] continue with the rest of the tor I wanted to create a relaxing and spa-like feeling the tub area so I knew I was going to add a crumb curtain rod to the top of the ceiling above the window and add white panels these were a great find from home goods I love the pattern and texture on the panels because they definitely add that luxe look a tip I wanted to share shopping in the curtain section of your home decor stores not just the bathroom section for panels because you can find many more styles and sizes I will try to leave the links to everything in this bathroom so you can get your hands on it too I just purchased this beautiful white tub tray and iced out at two different ways so I would love to know which style you like best in the comments the second style is towards the end of the video also I wanted to mention I never eat while taking a bath I just wanted to give you guys an idea in case you do added some fresh berries and chocolate with ice cold water to give you an idea that's why I wanted to style it two different ways to give you options if you do want food or without food you can never go wrong with fresh sweet-smelling flowers to make your heart smile I love adding pops of color every now and then but these were too beautiful to pass up so I definitely want to add them in the bathroom we have a double vanity with this large space in the middle so I decided to add a marble tray with large apothecary jars and I added them with bathroom essentials in the first apothecary jar filled it with bars of soap and then in the middle want to added Epsom salt and then the third one I added mini hand towels all of these items were an affordable way to fill up the jars and create a spa feel I really like the look of stacking hand towels so I added the screen white towel followed by mr. and mrs. towel on each side of the vanity [Music] this is the before walking into the bathroom and as you can see it needed a serious makeover another tip 1/2 are you shopping your home before going out to buy new decor you can be surprised at how new a piece you already have looks just by placing it in a different area of your home these Wohlers were downstairs in my kitchen but we recently gave that area makeover so we didn't need these down there anymore if you want to get your hands on your own glittered wall or canvasses I made a couple of videos showing you how to do so I'll leave them linked in the description box since this is a little space in the bathroom I didn't want to do a lot here so I just added a little table and a floral arrangement on top of it to finish styling it I scored a Z Gallerie table dude from Ross for only $35 and it's the perfect little mirrored table for this bathroom next I purchased two bathroom rugs by two different brands although they look like they're the perfect match the smaller one was $12.99 and the larger one was $22 on sale from $30 I thought that was such a square because of the size and quality and it's a 24 by 60 inch rug I really like the way that these rugs look in the bathroom they're the perfect fit and now I want to show you guys the before cabinets and faucets since we had our home built they didn't add knobs because I didn't like any of the options they had so for over a year I have been on the lookout until I found these they were definitely worth waiting for I wanted beautiful statement pulls and found these gems for such a steal and we'll leave them link below in the description box if you're interested in them my mom loved them just as much that she ordered them for her bathroom as well I'm sure these will go quick especially at the price listed so get them while you can before they sell out I know this may not be everyone's style but take it as inspiration to add things you love that represent you now everyone watching this video is going to come into my bathroom every single day like I do so don't be afraid to style your bathroom the way you like it that's the only thing that matters your happiness [Music] I never liked the builders hardware so you can imagine these are the first to go and I went to pick these out myself I love the transformation the chrome gave next I picked up two of these really cute sub dispensers and put one on each side it's amazing what a few budget-friendly upgrades shopping your home and smart shopping can get you the
