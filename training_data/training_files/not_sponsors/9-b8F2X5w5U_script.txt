can do it all in one place with Squarespace I want to know like what dates they see is being like the pose I would like to do to stagger it hi [Applause] [Music] welcome to another studio vlog what you just saw was Chris and I having our weekly meeting he is heading to Japan in two days so what's he in for another couple weeks we're just like tying up loose ends talking about client work blah blah blah ignore this hair this vlog is probably gonna be creating a body of work for my next show the other day rocket asked me but he didn't randomly came with this question he was like if you won the lottery and money wasn't an option like what would you be doing and I was like I'll probably just working towards my show we were like why don't we just do what we like we're privileged enough to have that time and so I thought that so I'm gonna focus on I'm gonna focus on my show and yeah so the next things are probably gonna be that and maybe a little bit of client look as well the show must go on we have some booked in as well just hope to give you a heads up that's what I'll be doing so you'll be seeing this piece which is only a like a third of the way done I don't want you to be bummed out that you're saying that like constantly but just imagine the snippets that you see times that by a million and that's how long I've been working on it that how long I've been looking at it so have a bit of mercy with me what unit so often in the vlogs [Music] like client's agenda like what we need to talk about of my notes before the meeting then post meeting notes and also like during the meeting might reduce Chris's to do's blah blah blah and anything else I can think of when it comes to planning I'm not wanting to but that makes bullet journals or anything like I just feel like I choose to get in there get it done not a place where I want to put my time and to make him look pretty Chris and I use slack as like a means for communication when it comes to work stuff which I really love it I love slack guys what I'm just doing here is I'm kind of taking like the notes and the to do's and putting them into slot so that we all know what we're doing just got to cheat little packages and they a little moss making kits I'm gonna be in a group show in Melbourne very soon and they've sent me the stands and the template for the mascot like the thing that it will hold the mark it's a very very small one and yeah I'm gonna attempt to do something with paper with this I have no idea what I'm gonna do I'm freaking the heck out I think I might like jump into some sketches and see what my brain thoughts out [Music] Q&A time first I want to thank purchase Thank You Squarespace I really really appreciate their support do a Q&A time so I little while ago asked of the community tab if you guys had any questions and you did actually there was lots I'll probably come back to that thread of question later and other studio blogs but let's read some now what do you believe is the best way to handle a commission I have little experience with them and I would like to find the best most professional way to go about working and communicating with a client my best advice for Commission is make sure you're covering the hours that you spend on it natives charging very little for the amount of time that they spend on work which includes material cost which includes shipping costs or make sure you let them know that doesn't include shipping cost all that stuff my other main advice for doing Commission is that it's your job as the creative to kind of hold the clients hand through the Commission or if it's a private commission make sure that you're communicating with them completely I usually send an initial sketch for like the compositional elements and main ideas I've been a refine sketch based on any feedback they have sometimes we do another round of refining that sketch depends on how big the project is so that you don't have to go and then have to repaint an entire painting just because they don't like this color or they don't like where this is you know what I mean so make sure you communicate with them the entire time that's the key what degree did you study in order to become an illustrator I got a Bachelor of visual art and design majoring in graphic design footprint but I don't really attribute that to my illustration work because I was freelancing as an illustrator before that degree and on top of that ice mainly studied design and that and focus on design so that I could do design after University I think that the illustration skills that I have come from observations fermentation trying new things out playing with things and sharing them online school is for some people some people can't afford it I just want to make it clear that having a degree doesn't mean anything when it comes to illustration you can not one person has asked me for my degree even in the design industry it's more based on portfolio especially in the creative industry so I would concentrate on creating great work and you could do whatever you want have you ever thought about turning your panties in to repeat fabrics I'd buy those in a heartbeat yes I would love to do that I just need to find out a way to do it that isn't me investing a lot of money initially because I don't know how many people will be interested in that my ideal situation would be collaborating with a brand someone like Goldman but I would love to see my work eventually on in clothes and not just print it on the fabric itself hi Sean what're your really big pie in the sky dreams for your career also side question any thoughts on doing reprints less reissues of previous prints products you've had on your site keep up the great work and thanks so much for sharing it always brightens my day to see your newest videos well before last year was creating a children's book that was like my ultimate life goal and that happened pretty quickly I'm so happy that I've been able to do that I would like to have a number of children's books I think that's a big dream for me and being able to continue to make the work that I want to make and be able to support myself yeah I think that's the dream but I'm pretty lucky that I'm pretty close to living that now or I am living that now I just hope it can continue I only have some really short term God's I wouldn't say any like pie in the sky dream but I would like to be a successful illustrator in that people my work is visible to a lot of people create work that can be admired by my peers and and feel like my work is making a lot of people happy that's my ultimate dream sort of repress the way things work is that there needs to be enough people that want something for me to be able to make it in enough bulk so that I can make money from it and so that it's not too expensive for you guys so it really depends on what it is if you want something let me know below I can possibly do that different of people want in do you ever feel shy to sketch or painted public places I feel like I get this sort of anxiety when I paint a poke because everyone is staring you I don't care so much about the staring the main thing that makes me embarrassed in public when I work in public or if I'm carrying artwork in public is I just feel like people think that I think I'm so cool like they think that I think I'm like so arty I'm so mysterious look at me I'm carrying a painting I'm cool but I really just don't feel that way if you've only done drawing with pencils and haven't gotten any paintings where it's how would you start like anything else I would just jump into it best thing about drawing first is that you have a better understanding of Che standing of form a better understanding of life I feel like drawing is the basic mark making in creativity I think that it will help you depending on what kind of painting you want to do but it will really really help you because then you don't need to think so much about learning to create forms and stuff like that you just you're just thinking about the medium make sure you get the right material but don't spend too much money so that you're not afraid to make mistakes because not being afraid to make mistakes is the most important thing we do starting out but yeah just jump into it hey I've got a slight problem my parents are super super supportive of my art and in four years I'm going to art college but I'm not sure that I'm strong enough against harsh comments and being an artist in general any - I'm not giving up this one's tough because learning to take criticism is super super important the internet whether you're in a gallery whether there's a curator looking at your work whether there's a client looking at the stuff that you've produced you need to take you learn to take criticism it can be really difficult especially when if you think that the person isn't qualified to do that but you just need to discern between constructive criticism and just someone's opinion I mean in at school the criticism wasn't like soul-crushing that I could tell but I have heard stories of people being quiet discouraged at uni by their lecturers and stuff or just small things people have said make sure that you a don't take it so personally that it hurts you which is obvious of course and be make sure you're just earning between constructive criticism and criticism that you use and someone's surety mean opinion but I would also remember that you don't have to take all the criticism you get it at college or university or online it's up to you this is your work what kind of notes should a new illustrator start with I think you need to think about something that you can make small scale by that I mean unless numbers so that you don't have to pay more of an upfront fee without knowing if it will sell and maybe something that you can do at home do shrinky dink I used to make stickers out of like shipping labels and then package them they're really fun and prints as well so if you get some really good artist quality paper and you have a pretty good printer you can make your own artists prints at home but also print shops will generally make whatever number that you want the less that you make is usually more expensive maybe put it to your audience and ask them what they're interested in see from you but to begin with maybe smaller items that cost less to make just in case they're sitting in your store you don't want to be out of pocket okie dokie that's it I hope you really like this
