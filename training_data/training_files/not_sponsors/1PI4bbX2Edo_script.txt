hello and welcome to a video review of the fit on fitness tracker apparently the world's first blood oxygen saturation SmartWatch full disclosure I was sent this review unit free of charge and I have not been financially compensated for this review I want to be as transparent as possible and give the most honest review I can anyway let's get started opening up the unmarked box reveals the timepiece itself I've been told that there will be proper packaging with the retail release I quite like the metal finish the bezel around the outside is purely for aesthetics as are the top and bottom buttons the crown is pushed in to interact with the watch around the back we have the optical heart rate sensor as well as the charging pins also in the box was a USB charger as well as the second band outs of writing this review fit ons kickstarter campaign has successfully made over eight times its pledge goal of 10,000 dollars early backers got the watch for $39 however that reward tier is no longer available at this time you can get the watch with an interchangeable band and USB charger for $49 with an estimated delivery date of December 2017 the retail price after the campaign will be $79 so if you want to grab one cheap you'd better buy it through the Kickstarter campaign using the H band software was super quick to set up and get the watch paired you can track various things like sleep heart rate and blood oxygen saturation unlike the Fitbit blaze it isn't constantly recording your heart rate it seems to activate at certain intervals and when you are actually looking at the heart rate on screen likely to save battery speaking of battery charging it using the design if the included charger is somewhat confusing clearly it's supposed to grip the watch like this however the pins do not actually reach unless you position it awkwardly like this I've been told that this is a pre-production charger design so I assume you will receive a better one if you backed it on Kickstarter thankfully the heart rate monitor seems to be fairly accurate when it works I say when as you can do a manual heart rate test in the app but that will not work unless you first cycle through the watch's menus to the heart rate setting at a glance you have to wait around 15 seconds for the watch to give you a heart rate rating if you go into the settings of the app and turn where detection off then both the heart rate and blood oxygen tests work fine in the app software updates should be able to remedy this issue eventually both track is displayed roughly the same BPM so it's fair to say that you could rely on the readings from the fit on for a good real-world test I took the fit on SmartWatch as well as the Fitbit blaze for a hike up to a local waterfall the fit on is rated as being ip68 water and dust resistant up to 50 meters I subjected the watch to light rain and being submerged in a shallow pool for a few seconds afterwards I noticed water droplets forming under the front glass which is extremely alarming so far the functionality if the watch does not appear to be affected if feed on would like to send me another unit to test I'd be more than happy to retry it suppose at water resistance it does look as if the seal around the sensor is defective perhaps that's where the water got in so even though it's advertised as being ip68 I would not recommend submerging this watch in any water whatsoever after wearing both watches for the exact same amount of time the fit on said I'd walked a total of 16,000 157 steps with the Fitbit blaze totalling 14,000 469 this is a difference of nearly 2,000 steps however comparing both charts they look very similar I tried walking exactly 30 steps starting from zero on both watches the fit on registered exactly 31 steps with my Fitbit blaze only registering 20 I'm pretty impressed with the accuracy of the fit on step counter only being off by one the fit on seems to log your heart rate every 30 minutes which leads to a far less detailed graph of your daily heartrate if they were to update the app and allow increments of say 5 minutes instead of 30 the results at a glance would be far more representative of the data recorded that day the frequently asked question states that the fit on should get around 4 days of normal use on a single charge I charged both of the smartwatches up and they sent on my wrists until they went flat the fit on lasted from Monday afternoon until Wednesday at 8 p.m. just over 2 days of normal use there were no warnings before it shot off either I thought I'd capture a bit of footage of the watch as it charges however it actually died as you can see it glitched out before shutting off completely ultimately rendering the watch useless so in conclusion I actually did enjoy using the watch the heartrate accuracy and blood oxygen functionality were neat but the relatively short battery life and the that it died due to exposure to small amounts of water was pretty disappointing were these one-off manufacturing defects I don't know but from my personal experience I cannot recommend the watch if you plan to use it around water or need battery life longer than two days thanks for watching my review I'll see you next time
