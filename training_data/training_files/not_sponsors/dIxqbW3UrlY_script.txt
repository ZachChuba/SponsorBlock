this video is brought to you by surfshark go to my link in the description for the limited black friday offer so as any regular viewer on my channel hybrids or any of disney's live action cg hybrid movies and it's probably no surprise i decided to skip out on the lion king remake a few months ago even though it was destined to completely dominate the platform for months before and after release there's really not much that could compete with the original success when it comes to disney's theatrical animated films it's been their biggest hit for literal decades and if anything it was surprising it took them so long to revamp it for a newer audience yet decided pete's dragon was a story just begging to be retold it didn't just stop with disney's ever-growing assortment of studios either the original lion king remained the highest grossing animated movie of all time for quite a bit and alongside aladdin and beauty and the beast emblematic of disney's renaissance days if not their entire animation catalog the future seemed uncertain for them when the first few cg animated features couldn't live up to their potential but as the engine slowly started to pick up steam they were setting course for a film that would completely dwarf any of their past successes and turn into behemoth in this new age of animation we live in frozen now when it comes to their cg films there's pretty much no contender to frozen and defining disney's new era of animation it was a humongous accomplishment in marketing and publicity as although it's essentially another fairy tale story something they've largely gone away from at the turn of the millennium it was so entirely indistinguishable from the original tale it didn't even feature its name in the title something that's still a trend unfortunately rest in peace gigantic however frozen was actually never meant to make it onto the big screen and the way you know it for today in fact it was first planned to release way back in the 40s and obviously also wasn't intended to be cg animated at first was a way more faithful adaption of the story and didn't feature josh gatt as a snowman but through that became a much more massive phenomenon later on thanks to disney playing the right cards at just the right time hi my name is cosmidor and today i want to take a closer look at frozen its impact on the animated landscape and where the franchise will go from here alongside my brief thoughts on the newly released frozen two so for all two of you who haven't seen the original frozen it is a tale about anna and elsa two sisters whose parents died when they were just little girls forcing the older sister elsa to take care of her main character ana something that proves difficult since elsa possesses magical powers that curse her with a midas touch-like ability to turn everything around her into ice and snow something she grows more accepting of as the film goes on much to the detriment of anna who only wants her sister back so alongside her new friends olaf kristoff and his sidekick sven she goes out to try and stop elsa from accidentally freezing the entire town of arendelle as elsa's powers grow more powerful while providing plenty of songs for the soundtrack it's a basic story that has a few twists here and there some more some less effective but rest assured it immediately struck a chord with audiences far and wide meaning that although the film was released at the tail end of 2013 it still became one of the highest grossing films of that year and although i personally also really enjoyed the film when it first came out looking back it's very clear they wasted no time in developing it making sure all the nooks and crannies were sorted out to turn this into one of disney's most calculated films as mentioned before the story initially came much closer to the original fairy tale and as such elsa was a much more clear-cut antagonist and not even related to ana that decision came much later into development and helped shape the film into a much more relatable story akin to lilo and stitch a change i personally really appreciated thanks to that it also allowed them to portray both as much more empowering female characters through the sibling dynamic that even resulted in fans speculating elsa might be gay or at least bisexual it was also progressive and featuring the first ever female director on a disney animated film the leading man doesn't really get much screen time and the town reacts appropriately to anna deciding to marry a man she's just met and although this doesn't help disney's case and sometimes becoming too overly meta and self-aware in recent history it allowed the average moviegoer that may only check into disney film whenever it's some fairy tale they're already familiar with or could take their kids with them to see or just to have something to talk about at the water cooler it doesn't stop with anna and elsa either as although olaf may not be the most respected character in animation and had his fair share of controversy too he was easily the most marketable sidekick in any of the films since the 90s much like the soundtrack where every single song almost every single song is easily relistenable outside of the context of the film and all those supposedly written in just a day let it go a breakout hit of a similar scale to the circle of life from the lion king but i think what really elevated this film to such a large scale and i say this in the most appreciative way possible is how it lacks any major theme like say about some other disney films from the early 2000s what you will they all had some thematic string meant to tie together like how lilo and stitch was about family bonding brother bear was about becoming more accepting of others but frozen is about letting go of your former self only for elsa to fall right back to becoming the snow queen at the end of the film it's about the two sisters growing closer together even though they're torn apart for a good chunk of the film it's about subverting tropes whilst also using those same tropes to tell the story and i'm not saying it did too much at once but i am saying it scratched the surface of so many different elements that you could read this movie any way you want which allowed for it to have a much broader appeal than something like tangle that on the surface just seems like another princess movie i think it was a very deliberate choice for them not to ever put out a poster featuring only ana and elsa therefore also marketing the film as largely gender neutral they clearly knew what they had with frozen and it's a very polished movie but it's also a very safe movie disney took many of the lessons they had learned through tangled also reflected in the character designs which looked largely the same and applied them in such a way that for once didn't make it seem like you were just watching another princess movie but that it was larger than the sum of its parts an illusion whose impact can still be felt today in films like moana you really can't blame anyone for being mad disney is essentially just dishing out the same type of movie every other year after quite a bit of experimentation after the end of the renaissance but if there's something frozen hat proven it's that it's a formula that works for a reason and doesn't have to be all bad even if it's a little plastic it's no wonder then that i was really looking forward to frozen two each trailer that was released got me a little more punt for this film as it seemed to be going for a much different direction from the past film and featured a tone more reminiscent of something like over the garden wall which is fitting since they even stole its song spotlight you clods frozen 2 was very good a welcome surprise i'm sure all of you are happy to hear we all know the quality of disney sequels in recent years has stagnated drastically with the bulk of them if nothing more just seeming empty they're all fine but rarely was there ever a reason to come back to them and there's not really a reason for the existence of any of them broadly speaking though there were still a few unanswered questions in the first film that though not necessary to clear up could have helped make the world the film takes place and seem more believable questions like what really happened to their parents or why elsa suddenly possessed these magic abilities in the first place and sure enough these questions all play into the plot of frozen 2 making for what felt like a much more mature film that put more emphasis on drama than the first film i actually got to see the movie a few days before its proper worldwide release which resulted in a theater that was essentially empty and i gotta say after the last time where a few of my friends and i essentially only bought tickets to riff on the film throughout this was a much different and very welcome experience they also showed the sonic trailer which was fun frozen 2 takes place sometime after the events of the first film elsa settled into a role as queen anna's living her best life with her boyfriend kristoff and olaf is still there but one day that all changes when elsa hears a mysterious voice coming from across the land and they all set out to see where it's coming from only to find themselves in a conflict between the city of arendelle and the tribe of where also needs to learn the true meaning of a powers in order to save the town aside from the setting and everything that was revealed in the first few trailers i didn't know much about the film like who would be involved in it what tone it would have i could only make assumptions based on what i saw but the trailers alone already convinced me this was going to be less of a retelling of the first film and its own separate thing and i'm so glad i was right now this isn't to say there isn't the occasional nod to the first film but the story largely stands on its own and was more than enough to keep me captivated throughout as it took a few turns i didn't see coming and the new locations they come across make it feel like much more of a journey than the rather self-contained first film the locations themselves were absolutely gorgeous as you would expect we already got our winter masterpiece with klaus this month so i was welcoming an autumn interpretation of erendale with open arms obviously this film is still no match to klaus but really what is please support klaus i can't exactly put my finger on what exactly it is that made me want to come back to this film so eagerly because i know the story was never really the first film's strongest aspect and part of me feared they would just introduce another cheap twist villain there to ruin the narrative and that kind of happens but not as you'd expect it was actually very welcoming the way they handled this part of the story and was a much more sound movie in its story overall but the characters were would-really shown this time around the sister dynamic between anna and elsa was one of the key factors in making the first film relatable to many kids out there this one only amped up their relationship even further whilst also allowing characters like kristoff and olaf to grow in meaningful ways yes you heard that right all of the singing josh gad snowman finds meaningful revelations about this place in the world and the meaning of life he's not even a hateable character anymore damn i didn't know no nut november could affect hate boners but as the singing snowman olaf naturally also got another song which was way better than the first films as was anas and kristoffs by a virtue of him actually getting a song this should go without saying but this film's soundtrack was really enjoyable and included some genuinely catchy tunes on there not as many as the first films and unfortunately kristoff's song really is the biggest skip of the bunch but it definitely feels like a much more polished album overall though my personal favorite is their mom's lullaby all is found which she sings in the beginning of the movie much like the tribal song that was played during the first one's logo screen much like it it's probably also the most underrated song on the album what's amazing though is that they actually gave the wand from the first film a meaningful role as a light motif in this film that really helped tie this whole film together and make it feel like they planned this all along which they most likely didn't they might have i don't know it didn't just stop with the callbacks to the first film though as they were also references to queen and the little mermaid and one of the characters is voiced by jason ritter and thus we're one step closer to turning dipper into a full-fledged disney princess i will admit that sometimes they did go a bit overboard with trying to be topical the mouse was referenced within what felt like the first five minutes of the film and there were a few lines of dialogue that would feel more at home in a fortnight gameplay video also a few of the rhyme schemes and the songs were a bit sweaty and i'm still not a big fan of the texture on these trolls or the trolls in general but it really feels like frozen 2 wanted to tell its own story in its own way and the characters felt much more at home within this narrative like compare that to the first film where i swear elsa didn't even ever address kristoff directly he was just standing there most of the time but between showing off elsa's newfound power some more meeting new characters which were all fun in their own way some really tight storytelling about arendelle's past that was illustrated beautifully through the visuals that felt much more like a classic 2d disney fairy tale brought into the third dimension than the first one did and beautiful songs to match there's a ton of stuff to enjoy about frozen 2 that justifies its existence as if the most adorable ripoff of pascal from tangled wasn't enough what's interesting is though is that there actually is a very conclusive ending to this one story when compared to the one from frozen like yeah that one did have its happily ever after and most of the loose ants were taken care of but this one not only answered some of these unanswered questions but also leaves out on a completely different status quo with one of the characters explicitly stating that this would be the end of their adventure do you know what this means that's right they're totally gonna toy story for it i've said this before but frozen is like the lion king in many ways they've both been astronomical successes for disney and the kings of the respective time frame they were released in and much like the lion king i don't really see us getting rid of frozen any time soon it already had its sequels and shorts and games now all that's left is the direct to dvd sequels and awful spin-offs it really can't be overstated what an impact it has had on the current animated movie landscape and if there's more sequels like frozen 2 on the horizon then embracing them really shouldn't be so hard that or we wait for another film of theirs to come along to take its spot which i don't really see happening at the moment rest in peace gigantic
