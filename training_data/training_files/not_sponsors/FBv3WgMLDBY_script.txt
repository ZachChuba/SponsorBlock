so now Alex Cora is this guy who is formerly of the Boston Red Sox in Boston just so happens to be attached to this I don't know why everything like that he was at the Astros whenever he was the assistant the bench coach the assistant coach of the Astros the Astros broke basically every single hitting record that you could possibly break at home he gets a job he they win a World Series he gets a job in Boston they do the same thing up there then all of a sudden a pitcher comes out says are there recording a podcast or says it is this something that is understood that happens or is this like what is your take on this as a guy who's a catcher and your exact fingers are probably on some of these cameras out there what is this in the state of the game well for me it's been happening forever I think sign stealing looking for tells I mean it happens in every sport I mean how you playing the NFL I'm sure you watch film obviously I mean you watch film you see guys on the quarterbacks on the sidelines looking at iPads seeing pictures like real-time real-time pictures that happens in every sport and so I kind of don't understand it and my worry is baseball has all these unwritten rules you hear you hear guys say well he's not supposed to do that well it's not by the letter of the law it's not a rule necessarily and so like in preparation for this article or for this interview I I did I did a little research and I read a couple articles and nowhere that I found was anything that was being done at that time it wasn't necessarily against any rules was it frowned upon maybe however from a catchers perspective we do things from inning to inning we change signs you you set up later before the pitch is getting ready to be thrown to you to combat that so anytime like a guys on second base you have a signed sequence it may it's as intricate as the one which normally means fastball doesn't mean a fastball and then you sequence it in a number of signs to try and hide it things like that I mean you you do things to combat those things you look for tells from the other team that make it appear like they're giving signs to their hitters that that it just does make a lot of sense to me I are you saying this is are you saying you think this is kind of getting blown out of proportion and this is something that you as a catcher who is the person who signals are being signed basically understands that there is the potential of this happening and it's your job it's on you and the pitcher to make sure that this doesn't benefit the other team no question no question I think I I would be willing to bet that when Mike fiers said what he said that he wasn't he didn't think it would get to where it's at now I mean guys are losing their jobs guys are potentially getting blackballed from baseball with all of this stuff that's going on and if it's pretty black and white for me if they were breaking a rule I get it if they were breaking an unwritten rule I don't understand it because I mean in any in any walk of life you look for an advantage if there if in a unique position because I'm in a situation as being a capture that that I do things to combat sign stealing but also from a hitters perspective I would love to know what's coming I mean it makes my it makes my job a hell of a lot easier to hit if I know what pitch is coming and so if a pitcher is blatantly giving me if he if he's in the wind up and it's as blatant as his hands go over his head when he throws a fastball in his hands don't go over said when he throws a breaking ball I'm gonna take advantage of that and so where's everybody else that's on that's on our team so I that to me is what I don't get I don't get that that if if a guy was showing that he was throwing a changeup and I and I mean it's been happening forever if you played Little League I have a client I think people are assuming because now is this something you're gonna have to change knowing that there is a chance that there is a camera now they said now I don't know enough about baseball to really ask the right questions here but they said there was a camera being shot from centerfield at the catcher they would then go into a room to see what the catcher was doing and then they would bang on garbage cans and whistle and stuff for what the pitcher is doing as a catcher now I'm just I've never played catcher I've only played right field professionally but if I was a catcher and I heard this type of stuff happening isn't that something that would also maybe tip you off like oh they're giving a little bit of this or they're giving a little bit of that or something like that and is the fact that they had a live feed going on is what they're blowing up about or is that something that maybe you know is happening well hello there get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic they are the the live feed is the issue I believe however the rule of not being able to have I think they changed where you can have cameras they changed that going into last season and so all of this was happening it would happen in 2017 when there wasn't a rule where you could or couldn't have cameras so for me it's a little it's it's really kind of it's odd to me I don't again I don't get it you hate it I I do I think it sucks I really do I think it sucks because a guy outed his teammates that he benefited from and I just think that I think it sucks imagine if your catcher though and you hear an entire dugout like excuse me I think there's something going it that's the thing about baseball though that I think a lot of people appreciate especially baseball fans is like the the game right like there's a game inside of a game it's happening whether it's the umpires strike zone whether it's like a little bit of more grip on the thing or the ball or anything like that there's always like these little games inside of baseball when a lot of people from a 30,000 foot view you see you're like okay it's picture verse batter and then there's nine innings but there's all these little things trying to get this little advantage and he's a hundred and ninety seven thousand games that you have it's almost like a part of the sport is that what you're saying as opposed to these unwritten rules being broken it's almost like these types of things are a part of the sport it's what makes a sport even better I agree it's things I mean it's things that have been happening for 50 years I mean it's just guys like I played with some guys that played with the dodge it was Chase Utley on the Dodgers towards the end of his career and our hitting coach said last year that chases job when he wasn't playing he would just look for the pitcher to see if he could pick up anything to decipher what was coming I mean that was just basically his job with the Dodgers like I said when he wasn't playing so it's just thing things like that and he had he had gotten that from guys that he had played with with coming up through the minor leagues and early on in his career in Philadelphia and I just it's something that's gone on forever now again if they were breaking a rule if there was something in place that said this the live feed couldn't be directly to a camera in the video room or in the batting cage or anything like that then I completely understand it but however if there was no rule in place about the live feed like you said or anything like that then I just don't I just don't understand it
