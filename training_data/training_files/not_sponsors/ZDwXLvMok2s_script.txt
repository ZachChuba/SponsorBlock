this video is brought to you by Skillshare earlier this year xxx 10th asean became the first dead artist to chart at number one since biggie was killed in 1997 and if Biggie's three underwhelming posthumous album releases are anything to go by we probably haven't heard the last of X's music but we've definitely heard the best of it in this video I'm going to look at how an artist's legacy and intellectual property should be treated in the wake of their death lil peep and X are the most obvious recent examples of post death exploitation that we're going to look at in this video not one day after X was killed but if I added a number of his songs to their popular curated playlists rap caviar they put his name on the front page of their app and featured the this is xxx cent aussi own playlist as well and this sounds like an appropriate way to memorialize a slain musician but just a month earlier spot if I had banned X from their curated playlists entirely they cited his legal troubles as their reason for doing so claiming that their corporation was morally opposed to the abusive actions of one artist while of course leaving innumerable other known abusers to roam the platform as they so choose it was only due to public outcry and support from a list or Kendrick Lamar that Spotify brought X back a move of bold-faced hypocrisy Spotify snod 2x after his death was clearly made in the interest of profiting from the death of an artist and Spotify hypocritical actions are just the tip of the iceberg X's label appeared at first to be interested in preserving his artistic vision but that didn't last long one of the first things they dropped after X was killed was the music video for moonlight X had complete creative control over this music video and it was planned for release long before he was killed but over the last couple of months any respect his label seemed to have for his artistic vision has disappeared almost completely for twenty-year-old X's body of work was large we don't know exactly how much music he made and didn't release but it's probably safe to assume there was a lot we do know for sure that X's third album we'll be coming out soon his longtime producer John Cunningham told genius that the follow-up to question mark was almost completely finished before X was killed and it'll be coming out sometime shortly after October Cunningham talked about how all that was left to do for the third album was mixing mastering and adding certain things here and there and this is where the difficulties come in when an artist dies who should get to decide how to finish their unfinished work and should their unfinished work be finished at all many people believe that once an artist has passed their work should be left alone there are a lot of reasons why we might do that first of all unreleased music is usually left unreleased for a reason the best songs make it on to an album and the other ones well they don't the process of choosing which songs get released and which ones don't is one of the core principles of intellectual property is it ethical to release an artist's work without the permission when they're alive it's called the leak and no one likes those so what changes after death it seems to me that the ethical standard in fact doesn't change but the labels desire to capitalize off an artists death quickly takes over so here's where the worst of posthumous releases arise unauthorized collaborations and albums pieced together from throwaway recordings yes it's possibly wrong to finish an album for an artist who died before they could do it themselves but if done right under the guidance of producers that knew the artist these albums can be good elliot Smith's final album was only half-finished when he died but thanks to the caring hand of his producer and girlfriend it went on to become considered one of his best releases we can only hope that X and little peep will experience the same thing with their upcoming releases with both X and peeps longtime producers finishing their upcoming albums there's reason to have hope that they won't suck but it's very very unlikely that either of these rappers had more than one finished album in the vault when they died unfortunately they almost definitely have throwaway recordings and partially finished songs just waiting to be exploited the harvesting of X and peeps recordings for profit has already begun and strangely enough the first instance was in tandem with each other after peope had died and while X was still alive X featured on an unreleased PEEP song it wasn't released until after X was killed a few months later and a lot of peeps friends and family were far from happy with this unauthorized collaboration peeps mother herself expressed disapproval of the song and had been long known that lil peep disapproved strongly of ex's reputation as an abuser but the temptation to glorify dead musicians was too strong and the song dropped anyway now these songs like falling down are a cheap shallow novelty especially in the case of little peep it's incredibly unlikely that the socially conscious openly bisexual lil peep would have wanted to collaborate with someone who's almost proud of the time he brutalized his gay cellmate in prison now X himself will shortly experience the same thing it was recently announced that megastars Rihanna and The Weeknd are going to put out songs featuring ex and they're taking just two of at least nine ex recordings that are going out to whoever wants them during his life X was largely ignored by mainstream artists it feels wrong for some of the industry's biggest figures to be respecting his artistry only after he's died another ex song arms around you was released last month featuring lil pump maluma and sway Lee while the song was reportedly approved of by X's mother he was critically panned for bland production and lyrics the future doesn't look bright for X and peeps musical output by looking at tupac Shakur's posthumous albums you can get a picture of what might be about to happen 2x and peep over a period of years following Tupac's assassination at 25 years old in 1996 his back catalogue was slowly exhausted of quality tracks the first album compiled after Tupac's death wasn't that bad and in fact a lot of people liked it but over a period of years his label emptied the archives of everything they had from him the last few Tupac releases add nothing to his legacy in fact they insulted they were compiled from the absolute lowest quality recordings he had done and were released purely for the sake of profit I can only hope that this isn't what happens to X and peope in the coming years ultimately there is probably nothing we can do to prevent this from happening while X and peeps families are involved in the preservation of their legacies even they might find themselves short on cash down the road and become willing to release recordings that weren't meant to come out the most important thing to do in this situation is to remember what these musicians music stood for and what they believed in this has been Volks Geist thank
