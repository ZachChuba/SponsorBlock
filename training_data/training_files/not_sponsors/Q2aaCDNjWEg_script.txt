[Music] hey what is up guys i'm pbht here so in case you somehow missed it apple's WWDC was this week and the stuff they announced there has been making tech headlines pretty much every day since so typically when Apple gets up on stage this shares something that they've been you know working on behind the scenes for a long time and they're finally able to share it with the world they get on stage and they share it and then there's a sort of reaction from the Internet everyone's blog in tweeting making their videos about it and then apples usually just like zip nothing they never really reply that's typically where the conversation ends but not this year 2020 in many ways is a little different so after the keynote this year after their online only presentation I got to have a conversation with the man you may recognize from tons of FaceTime in the keynote singer VP at Apple Craig federighi we had a decently long chat on the wave form podcast with a whole range of topics from the behind the scenes of how they made that to our keynote movie basically to all the software and the new stuff that they've announced and you know it's not all roses and flowers some of the stuff they announced was pretty controversial too so luckily enough I was recording video on my end Craig had some iPhones set up recording his end in Apple Park so if you want more of the summary of the really long list of things that they've announced that are new you can go back and watch my last two videos that go into that stuff in lots of detail but this this is the more rare conversation part all right so point number one default apps so you may remember one of the new announcements in iOS 14 was the ability to newly change your default mail or browser apps and the reaction to that was at first largely very positive including for me that's like a from a very traditionally stubborn company from like Apple not something you would expect but then after like a day or two of digestion the questions start coming up well what about Maps why not other things too here's what he had to say I did hear that you were looking forward to using alternatives you do too yeah yeah I mean there you go hello everybody I love that extra layer I think my actual question to that is okay it's only male and browser is there a reason you didn't have full on you know chaos or a or even just because I think maps would have been nice to also be able to set as a default you know honestly a a great point I mean I think for us we looked at what were the top things that we've been hearing people say they wanted to configure and there's definitely those two that rose to the top so I'll certainly take the input about about maps as well it was this was this was just where we started I think your point on on chaos is an important one I mean obviously with with iOS we're very careful about trying to keep we know how platforms can sort of descend into chaos and particularly when apps that you know might honestly not even be browsers you know who decide they're gonna be a browser and then you know try to hook into being your browser because maybe they could redirect you to a different track tad experience when you click on something or bounce you into you know who knows what and so we are very careful about making sure that that experience that we don't have people getting misled or have their device gets configured into a place where boy they just don't even like like using their their of their phone anymore because it's gotten so walked up so we proceed cautiously on these things for sure does that mean there will be I assume well maybe I shouldn't assume that not every app can add that flag to potentially be a default browser but only certain approved ones yeah you're exactly right so so we will have criteria for the you have to be a general-purpose browser and they'll be I mean the ones you would think of as using as your browser well of course all qualify but we don't want a random game to just claim like yeah I'm a browser you know I'm willing to throw up a WebKit view now and then in in the middle of my game experience I'm gonna be your browser because we think that could could readily be abused so we want real general-purpose male apps and real general-purpose browsers to be able to present themselves to the user with this functionality and keep out all the rest of the confusion gadget so the browser point I think is actually a really good one something to sort of think about a little bit if any app can just become your browser when any link comes up and then that app has different policies on tracking and privacy then it sort of goes against your own policies on tracking and privacy now we see this on Android all the time and it's actually more of a feels like a convenience and more customization feature but in relay for reddit for example if I click a link to read a story it doesn't have to open Chrome there's a browser built into the app here so it just opens that and that's convenient but Craig's response here is basically that sometimes Apple has to take a stance against some of that convenience in favor of maintaining their own pretty strict privacy policy make sense then next up was Siri so Siri got a bunch of improvements in iOS 14 as well answers a bunch of new questions now and it also is in this compact new UI with a much smaller animation I pointed out in my videos and a lot of people also reacted that you couldn't really interact with things behind Siri despite that smaller animation Syria also gets a new compact UI both on the phone yeah and on the iPad but something that we've noticed since using it is it is a compact UI but you can't interact with things underneath or behind it hmm is that intentional is that a limit Varian what's what's that's where I know no one in fact you know we tried it both ways we we had internally we had prototypes running where you would scroll behind the Siri answers as you brought them up and initially we thought that was going to be really great and so we implemented it that way and then what we found was that for most of the interactions we were having with Siri that that then created this kind of extra heaviness to it because if you just said wanted to check the weather or look up a piece of information and then you were ready to move on your scroll gesture wasn't going to move on the Siri result was going to stick around there so you always had this additional step of dismissing the result and we found that to be extra heavy and so you know we'll continue to listen to what people have to say through the beta period cuz like I say I mean we've we actually have it working both ways but but our feeling was that we wanted to achieve a great lightness not just visually but in terms of you could dip into Siri get an answer and and move on quickly without any kind of overhead in the subsequent interaction so there's there's definitely real balance there yeah I felt that the experience is a little different on the phone versus the tablet you know on the phone it felt like it made sense I'm not necessarily reading or scrolling or doing things behind Siri very often but the tablet with a bigger screen to me felt like opportunity to give me a little more of like the the multitasking feel that I talked about on iPad yeah where you do feel like you have a little more control over leaving Siri there while you do other things and coming back to it so that might be something to look into yeah did you have a thought about what you how you would have expected if you were to let's say start you know you got your answer and then you started scrolling and doing other things on your iPad yeah at what point you would expect Siri to kind of get itself out of the way or whether you would have preferred you know have it hang out for minutes and then you go over there and manually put it away yes so I think because that animation came in from the bottom and then the answer came in from the top I almost felt like it would be different behavior on the phone but I almost felt like just being able to swipe it out of the top where it came from to deserves it sort of like a notification even though it isn't one or bringing that Siri animation from the bottom corner and just swiping it down out of where it appeared so that's again there's probably a thousand ways to to also consider doing it but I think that just because I'm such an iPad multitasking advocate I think that would be something I'd be interested in alright so there you go makes sense to me the one extra step of dismissing Siri is one extra step they feel like they wanted to avoid but also again I think it's important to mention that these are the videos I was making were about developer betas and these are early software that can continue to be changed down the road he mentions they could change it so if they do see that behavior change maybe they've thought about it more alright so then the big one Mac OS Big Sur new visuals new rounded corners new icons I had to talk about it seeing all those visual changes it got a very mixed reaction online and I'll share some of mine after but yeah there's a there's a sort of an overarching theme of these rounded corners and a new transparent and a different sort of look to it can you talk about mm-hmm that theme of Mac OS Big Sur yeah well I think the the first thing just to address the the eleven point Oh I mean we do feel that between the the new design and the the beginning of a new chapter with the introduction of Apple silicon I mean I think this is this is just the beginning I mean this is a this is a real renewal of the platform in many ways and so we're really excited to mark this with the next chapter the turning into the next chapter with with with eleven as far as the the design goes you know I think it's huge part of our visual scenery of our lives at this point and so what seems right is partly what we're used to seeing on that screen every day and when it changes immediately there's all kinds of little pattern recognizers in our brain that go like hold on something that's different something I feel like after you use the UI for and I've been living on it for months it feels natural it feels fresh and yet clearly distinctly Mac and I love it and I think that it's natural the first time you you see it and and of course the internet reacts on like they see a single screenshot and then let's start a tweet storm and then let's pile on they they don't they don't necessarily live on it right and so I would love to hear the feedback of people as they've if they've really made it their system like they have the previous Mac you eyes for you know for weeks and and come back and say how do you feel about it now I think the design team did amazing work and I I find you know things like rounding you know the some of those choices may seem arbitrary but in fact it's extremely consistent throughout that whole experience and I think it's really organic you know straight edges like this or like the process of human manufacturing processes you know if you look out in nature if you look at our own faces it's a lot of curves right a natural curves and so I think there's something really beautiful and organic about the the look of the UI and I think the the use of the use of materials is really great the clarity of some of the unified toolbars I think is is just clean and fresh and really deferential to content and then of course I mean it's a big step to change the icons of the Mac that's certainly a signature change but what we found when we live on it is we're moving back and forth between our iPhone our iPad or Mac and having that consistency in familiarity just takes a level of sort of mental mapping energy out of the whole thing and it's just it's relaxing it's comfortable it's it's clear and so you know we approach that decision with a lot of a lot of debate but in the end we we tried it and it just it just felt right and I think as people use it they're gonna come to the same conclusion yeah those new icons are not from iPad or iPhone right they're new they're a totally new icon set as far as like finder and and Spotify and Final Cut like all these new apps on the Mac we did not create a Spotify or you would not make we would not make that step I mean it might be fun to try but I don't think we're allowed to do that right we we did you're right so there's some Mac some icons like like finder exactly where there's no analog and so we got to imagine with the new shape and aesthetic how should should the Mac look and I think I love what we came up with there then there are other icons like say Safari or messages where we took the iOS icon and the typical you know Chiclets shape but applied a little bit of the traditional mac craft to to it and I think that's been where there's some of the controversy right now where people are saying hold on I know what that iPhone icon looks like and this one seems just a little different something tripping here and going like this isn't quite right and you know that's that's natural and understandable but we we did want to pay homage to that history of great craft and detailing that's been part of the Mac the history of Mac icons and so we kind of brought those those two together and hopefully in the end successfully I think this is all a very eloquent way of saying you'll get used to it and I think that's that's kind of she's got good point you probably will eventually get used to it after a while but the other thing is design is subjective and sometimes there are designs that even if you do get used to them you still don't like them like for me an example is on my phone I use Waze for navigation I don't use Apple maps or Google Maps that much anymore and that's because I like the feature set but every time I open ways I hate looking at it it's just this ugly it doesn't look good it's not clean or elegant or flat or minimal or modern or anything every time I open it I hate it but I don't switch because it still has the feature set I like and I feel like Apple knows that and they also know people aren't going to switch off from mac OS because they didn't really like the new icons people complain about iPhones all the time and then what are they go out and buy the next iPhone so he's got a point we'll get used to it but also Craig or anyone else at Apple who may stumble upon this video I talked about the other icons and how I might not like them and that's preference but this battery icon in System Preferences I you gotta fix this one I'm sorry there's just there's no way this should make it out of the beta please change this battery icon alright I got I got a couple fan questions as well I asked okay I put it out on YouTube we had some some questions and were gonna have Craig on the podcast first one the iPad still does not have a default weather and calculator app and they want to know why you know there's some things that we we have not done because we to do it we would want to do something really distinctly great in that space and I think it's obviously easy to create a calculator app but creating one that feels like wow this is this is this is the greatest iPad calculator app that it felt like I think we we want to do it when we can do it really really well and and we we honestly have just haven't gotten around to doing it great so that day that day may come but and you know whether it be easy enough to scale up our additional our existing weather app but we feel like what would a great weather app for iPad be like let's let's do that before we do it in otherwise the great options on the App Store I mean though there are there are thousands of options on the App Store in fact so very true I think this one resonates to me because one of my favorite apps you guys just acquired dark sky so it's no longer on Android so I'm like this this iOS weather app better turn into this amazing thing some I think I think it may be time for an iPad weather app that's just me I'm just saying alright faint well and it could be could be time for you to go iPhone exclusive I think that that would be another another good move that's a big point of leverage you make a great point another question is a there's a there's a very small group of people out there apparently that have an iPad and want to use an Apple watch but don't have an iPhone mmm is this a workflow you guys think about or are there groups with people who maybe that's too small of a group of people to cater to but will there ever be an iPad Apple watch experience we don't know I mean I I get it I think I think there's an interesting place where Apple watch can for many people take that kind of the device that I need to have with with with that having LTE it can be that device that gives you the degree of connectiveness connectedness on-the-go and then you've got your your iPad when you want to get deeper and it's a sensible it's a sensible point it is not one that we have pursued yet I mean I wouldn't rule it out but so I I get it I I love using my iPad and I love using my Apple watch so I could I could understand that so there you have it some interesting stuff some some new information and some clarifications on stuff that's already been announced good conversation material and again it's a much longer fuller more detailed conversation over on the wave form podcast so in
