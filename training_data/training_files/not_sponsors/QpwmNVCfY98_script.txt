you ever consider punting for an XSL team and what's XFL team do you think has the best talent on the roster that's a great question I have no idea I haven't looked at the rosters I think I would never ever in a million years punt for the XFL I retired from the NFL after a pretty good season I could still if I wanted to literally tomorrow probably go putt in the NFL again I would not choose to go punt in the XFL although I respect and appreciate the fact that to try and change the game none of the changes that they have made have made it better for the kicker or the punter which would be the positions that I would play so I wouldn't to be doing it I am excited to watch the XFL though and see how it works out I'm excited to see if they can draw and generate some fans to the games I'm excited to see these rules changes make it better I'm excited to see if the XFL succeeds go Roughnecks well the one thing I am worried about is from a talent standpoint one second I'm so sorry name two people on the Houston Roughnecks Phil Walker okay Sammie Coates now you just gotta cook you don't know anybody Connick Lopes gonna get cut from a talent standpoint in like a competitive standpoint it's hard to see any team being able to compete with the DC defenders you know address given the season I think the funny things they buy I think the funny thing about this XFL is though is that people could just pledge blind allegiance to these brand new teams and just be so happy for their success Tide did it with the Las Vegas golden knights who became a hot guy yeah overnight and then that first year they made a run to the freakin Stanley Cup yeah it's gonna be just like the Seattle dragons to be awesome Oh your Seattle dragon big-time is that because Matt Hasselbeck was wearing a salute the hoodie that one it's a fact that they had merch and that's the only other team that Nick knows the name of is the reason why I'll be excited to see if the XFL works I'll be excited to see if the XFL works not our percent sure I'll be a part of it but I am I am pumped to see if it works well hello King now back to the magic great questionnaire by that guy I go Putney XFL hmm no way excuse me what I try to be quarterback in the XFL I think so I think that is something I would think about maybe head coach offense coordinator I can see a master plan yeah a lot of time invested there Jackie moving the whole thing well I can't own because I think Vince abandons everything the thing about Vince McMahon knows he's a good businessman the AFL had completely business illiterate individuals running it I don't even know if the players have gotten paid from that league I think they still owe motel fees because the AFL screwed over so many people the XFL won't do that all of her luck Vince McMahon big brains excited to see how it works out excited to see the game excited see the players they aren't helping punters and kickers won't make it more exciting I'll be excited to see
