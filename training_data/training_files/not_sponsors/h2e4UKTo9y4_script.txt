so there's lots of reasons you could have rage attacks depression anxiety feeling out of control of your life or invisible to the people you love so many fun reasons for me I found that when I suddenly find myself filled with anger with no discernible reason it's often because I've had poor boundaries whether by being polite and agreeing to something I don't want to do hey do you mind helping me get rid of this body yeah yeah of course I can or allowing someone to negate my emotions wow that makes me really upset no it doesn't well yeah yes it does no it doesn't okay boundaries are these weird and visible and symbolic fences that are meant to allow us to protect an assert or authentic selves and they're in every facet of our lives I mean we have emotional boundaries physical boundaries spiritual and intellectual boundaries and of course sexual boundaries some being stronger than others so I'm available Monday Wednesday and Friday evenings with the occasional Saturday morning but absolutely no two consecutive nights in a row though I am okay with the morning following evening permitted that you weren't drinking the night before and if you were Mints are a hundred percent necessary Wow okay let me just let me just take some notes here also missionary preferred other positions available but it really depends on how many breeded i am and if you're like me and you tend to have really bad boundaries you'll often find that you're resentful of yourself and others because you're often in situations you don't want to be in and the thing is we only have ourselves to blame I mean bad boundaries are learned but good boundaries can be relearned and it starts with taking responsibility for your actions and emotions so sexy I know we fear being rude or people not liking us or being viewed in a certain way so in the moment it's easier to violate our own boundaries and say yes to things we secretly don't want to do Anna do you want a fake crime tonight uh yeah sure okay let's go great um crime never sleeps and them away okay yeah right now okay let's go reading a really good poetry book about death really no pants on okay but the thing is by not vocalizing our boundaries we're disrespecting ourselves and boundaries you know are flexible and dynamic and constantly changing depending on the context so it's something that you just have to listen to your gut about I mean you'll know when something isn't sitting right with you don't bulldoze over your intuition because you're afraid of a little confrontation it is possible to assert yourself without being a dick hey I'm sorry I would I would love to help you get rid of his body but it seems like it's just gonna be a really like physically taxing thing and I've just got too much work on my plate right now so if you find yourself randomly upset check in are you needlessly over exerting yourself are you saying yes when you really mean no are you letting someone just take over what you want and if the answer is yes get excited to have a lot of uncomfortable conversations because the rewards are worth it hey I'm so sorry to interrupt but I don't use my phone past 10 p.m. anymore so I'm really sorry but I'm great okay okay good luck with everything that you're doing I am rooting for you go box honestly thank
