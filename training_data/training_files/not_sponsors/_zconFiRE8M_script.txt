sponsored by brilliant there have been a few more spoilers around apples next less expensive iPhone what's previously been referred to as the iPhone se 2 or iPhone 9 and even though I've already done an entire video explaining what I think it'll be and why there still seems to be some confusion out there around both of those things so I'm gonna try again but different instead of rehashing the rumors I'm gonna go through what I think the announcement will actually be and hopefully that'll cut down on the expectation 'old ette and make things just a little clearer i'm renee ritchie and this is vector flash back to the fall of 2014 and Apple introduced the big 4.7 inch iPhone 6 and the bigger 5.5 inch iPhone 6 plus what Apple didn't introduce back then was an updated 4-inch iPhone fall of 2015 same thing iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus but then in the spring of 2016 Apple did a couple of things they'd never done before not only announced another new iPhone in the spring but announced a back to the future style iPhone with the S II same 4-inch design as the 5s most of the new internals and cameras from the iPhone 6s but at an all new all lower price that let Apple address two markets at once people who wanted a less expensive iPhone and people who wanted a smaller iPhone now Apple is widely expected to return to that playbook again this time with the same 4.7 inch design as the iPhone 8 most of the new internals and cameras from the iPhone 11 and retain that lower price if you're salty it's not rumored to have a more modern iPhone 10 style design or any new design at all look up that's the point just flying right over your head missed in everything because once again this phone isn't meant or priced for people who want new things it's meant for people who want the low low price and the return of the home button anything that changes any of those things just ain't it for them so here's how I expect it to go and this is just pure speculation but Apple is an extremely logical rational company so it may actually end up being fairly accurate Tim Cook Apple CEO comes out says good morning maybe talk services maybe other products but eventually we get down to the iPhone that's when Gregg Joswiak jaw's vice president of product marketing takes the stage or maybe kya and Rance vice president of iPhone marketing will hear how much customers are loving the iPhone 11 and how the vast majority of Apple's customers are head-over-heels over the modern design and features like face ID but for this event Apple wants to talk about something else their home button iPhones turns out customers love those as well and continue to buy tens of millions of them every year for many of those people the home button iPhones are the very first iPhone they get their first experience with Apple's hardware software and now services integration outside North America in emerging markets the majority of first time customers might even still be going for home button iPhones which is why some customers may have asked Apple to please pretty please keep home button iPhones in their lineup so maybe Apple is gonna do just that and make it a whole lot better as we may have heard with the iPhone 9 now the iPhone se got something no iPhone 5s ever did apples then new rose gold finish whether the iPhone 9 sticks to silver and Space Gray gets the current coppery gold or maybe even takes a page from the iPhone 10 R or 11 and gets a colored model we'll have to wait and see if Apple sticks to every page of the iPhone se playbook then we'll also hear how people love playing graphically intensive games on their iPhones so the iPhone 9 will get the latest generation a 13 Bionic chipset giving it the same processing performance as the iPhone 11 and amazing battery performance to go with it along with wireless charging since people love taking photos with their iPhones as well the iPhone 9 will get Apple's most advanced camera as well the new wide-angle from the iPhone 11 with 100% focus pixels updated smart HDR quick video that single lens portrait mode system maybe even night mode and of course 4k 60 extended dynamic range video with the latest generation selfie and your slopey camera to go with it no 5g of course like most of the world still but Wi-Fi 6 and even the U ones ultra-wideband radio for spacial positioning and it'll still have the touch ID some people love and fur works great with applecart of course it'll meet all of apple's environmental standards as well maybe even be the first iphone made of 100% recycled aluminum that's totally a spit ball on my part but I'd love to see it now maybe I'm wrong about a lot of this all of it maybe Apple can't hit the low low price point they really want to hit with the iPhone 9 by going with the guts of the iPhone 11 if that's the case then maybe they'll go with the guts of the iPhone 10 are instead that means it would still be fast just not quite as fast still have a single lens portrait mode system but not night mode and Wi-Fi six and you one would be up here as well either way though Apple be able to say something they haven't been able to say since 2017 that it's the most powerful home button iPhone ever and it'll start again all less expensive iPhone play books being equal just 399 and if that doesn't make any sense to the usual tech pundits the ones who just can't help but judge everything by the raw specs then I'm sorry so very sorry but it's not for them anyway and let's be honest they'll be fine they'll be getting an iPhone 12 to find boring and skippable later this year just like they did the iPhone 11 pro last year until they actually held it and started using it this phone is for everyone else for everyone who couldn't care less about specs and just wants a phone they feel comfortable using one that makes them happy because it's never really about the numbers it's about the equation those numbers are put in and all of you for supporting the show now Apple could totally mix things up maybe they won't even be an iPhone 9 I've already told you what I think but it's time to tell me what you think so hit like if you do subscribe and one more thing that Bell gizmo so YouTube will actually tell you when new videos go live then hit up the comments and let me know what do you think we'll see with the iPhone 11 and what do you want to see thanks for watching see you next video
