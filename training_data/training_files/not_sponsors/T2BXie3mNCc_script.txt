previously on the hardcore series there it is let's get to the shamans hug the wall and pray for the best we're going in boys for our very first shaman kill ever [Music] [ __ ] hey me what what do you want well the people are wondering when you're coming back to the channel i mean i've been carrying pretty hard and you know i'm stuck in this most giant grind dude yeah how many of those guys have you killed already now about 28 000 jesus and you're still not done nope so you still don't have the essence nope how many of those bosses have you killed already anyway that would be spoilers yeah true well at least you're not in the top 100 i'm already in the top 100 dude oh uh i'll leave you to it then uh i hope to see you soon bud yes there we go now i can use my slayer helmet perfect we're ready to fight the shamans now we just got the brittle key which can unlock us the grotesque guardians which i'm probably never ever going to do on this scout maybe get 50kc to get into high scores but that'll be it but that was uh pretty easy to get cool to get that guess we can unlock that and maybe it's a music track so always nice there's 78 slayer that is the level that we can actually boost towards dragon boost boots not that we're gonna do that but it's nice to know that we can at least try if we really want to for some reason 80 farming not quite the upper level of the farming guilt which i'm really grinding for but 80 farming is a pretty good milestone and there it is the very first lizardman shaman task done 170 kills no dragon warhammer absolute scam we got a couple of lamps here for herblore uh by trading in all the fossils i still had the rare fossils i still don't know what you can do with them like you can get prayer xp from it but they are also hinting towards a fossil boss whatever it doesn't really matter i want one herbal level so i can boost to um 72 to make range potions for this next lisbon shaman task because that'll make it a lot easier and a lot more fun so on that note this is hopefully please don't be too little there we go 68 herb lor ready to boost for 72 with a botanical pie to get myself range potions no burn no burn no burn one yes now make the dwarf weed potions we can do the whole tasks with a couple range pots now so that's perfect and we'll make the rest later now we got some botanical pies to work with wait i already had what and of course i missed it but 80 range which means we have basically all 80 melee stats now i mean combat stats now except for prayer so if we during this task and still get a dragon warhammer then i'm gonna be very happy doesn't hurt to be lucky since i'm not gonna look at the essence anyway oh my god [Music] no hello well that's enough gaming for uh a little bit i'm still shaking from that holy [ __ ] i should have died there getting ring of life at shamans is like almost impossible because they hit a lot so i don't know how that happened uh we're instantly putting a new ring of life on but jesus christ that was lucky i'm pretty sure because i got one big hit and three small hits i'm pretty sure it was the minions that saved me if one of those minions did not hit me for a five i wouldn't have been in ring of live range to be teleported and if the lizardmen did not spawn any minions he would have just smacked me and i would have died and because i felt like i had a guardian angel that day i dared myself to do something that a lot of hardcore stray away from time to question f f [Music] i'm not gonna call easy just yet got him ready for the last one boys run [ __ ] go go go go whoa big imbue your sarah saradomin cape boom baby oh my big shout outs to the boys what a day from the biggest chance on the hardcore yet to a major arena in butte cape this is very very very big for the account i never thought i actually would do it but if there was once a day to do it it was today now you could say that doing it with two buddies is cheating not the ironman way the [ __ ] way out and you'll probably be right but this account is keeping me from burning out of this whole game because it's the only one out of the two accounts that i can choose whatever i want so i would have rather have it alive than dead and at least we got a massive upgrade right now so please don't be too mad in the comments i'd appreciate it thank you oh yes i had one more grubby key i decided to open it and finally we got bruise also dragon arrow tips but look at that one and a half brews that is something that is going to come very useful for somebody else even though i'll probably have brews with herb lore by then but i'm not going to complete the search for knowledge mini quest there just for the 10 000 xp lamp and because i don't want to get these page drops anymore in the fourth those dungeon here we go give all the tomes and that is in search for knowledge mini quest done 10 000 herb lorexp in the pocket going for that 78 as quick as possible and of course it's a trails video so i missed that level 81 farming which is the requirement for dragon fruit trees and i got a bunch of those and they are incredible xp so i'm really glad i unlocked that i'm still doing these farm runs as consistently as i can granted that i don't do like five every day but try to do at least two every day i still don't have kingdom unlocked as i said i want to make a lot of money from slayer before i start doing that i want to put two million in the coffers so i don't have to look at it for another month at the moment we're on a two mil hashtag so slowly but surely in the near future i should be unlocking kingdom for even more herbs and this should be it yes throne of miscellaneous done now i instantly have to do royal trouble too and then it's time to dump two mil into the coffer there we go twenty thousand gold five thousand agility final agility slayer and hit points let's get it now where's this coffer ah yes deposit two million golden pieces and then we do herbs maximum now i think i'm going to do it like this because i want to rush 78 herb lore and when i get 78 or more i might switch it up but uh for now i think this is the play ready to go with the kingdom i'll check back on this in about two weeks all right 1kc over the actual drop rate which means i'm officially dry if this is not the bottomless bucket shake my head never lucky yo what the [ __ ] is the drop rate on this dragon plate skirt that's pretty nice i look like a champ now and with this big ass beautiful cannon tusk we are going to hit 80 slayer and we can finally do the elite clue and get our rune boots upgrade that elite clue has been sitting in the bank for about a good two weeks and finally we can hopefully complete it um and get a room crossbow because i really see ba training my fletching even though i have the roonette limb sorry so let's uh kill some neck reels and try and get those room boots and we already need to get 94. oh never mind we just got him we just got him that was fast that was good the room boots ready for the elite glue nice all right why am i killing this guy get the hell out of here there it is the first upgrade now the funny thing is we got a spiritual creatures task so we can actually go for the dragon boots too the thing is i need 85 cookie to make wild pies to boost so let's get that 85 cooking now and then go for the dragon boots instantly double boots baby but elite clue let's see if we can finish that one okay here we go uh put this on put this on oh not a casket this might be bad okay okay dig casket please yes i think that's the second elite classic boys that's a third okay okay okay no milking let's open it here if we get the room crossbow that'll just postpone the fact that we have to train fletching which is okay uh i don't know what we really want though but let's go boom a dragon long sword it's all right alex i guess guys that's all right i think 164k level 85 cooking we can now make wild pies let's go time to hunt some chompers look at us baking pies maybe 15 wild pies ready to start boosting for the dragon boots i hope it's going to be enough probably not i didn't mind the chumpy killing too much though so if we don't get it within this slayer task then so be it i'm also probably not going to be doing only majors because the spiritual rangers are also going to be low and i kind of want to finish the slayer task eventually so but at least we have a shot at trying to get these dragon boots early [ __ ] it oh my god i just thought i got it jesus christ that glue scroll hard though that's not bad this guy might die in a sec dragon boots dragon boats dragon boats dragon ball z jack and boot second boots but where wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where we got him boys 83 i think that might be the exact same kill count i got him only trails we're done with this oh that is so perfect one spiritual creature tax is all it took and one boost now we can just finish off this task only 32 more to go that is incredible where are those bad boys yes dude that's a massive upgrade for the hardcore whoa yup just got a rune spear wanted a 3.3 k but it is a hard cool requirement so i don't think i have one yet i might i still need that dragon spear for the um elite clue but if we don't have this yet i'm not too mad at it it's not worse than the dragon warhammer in terms of drop rate so i'll take it crap i already had a rune spear oh no i didn't i put it in the stash so i think i might need two though for two different clue steps so that's not too bad that is the task done and no dragon warhammer but some dwarf weed i'll take it but unfortunately 606 shamans is not enough for a dragon warhammer so the grind continues yo the 40th heart clue casket that is stacking up nicely how many we've got see if we get anything there we go that's kill count number six and a new personal best i beat it by 20 seconds no 12 seconds did we get a pet no i have a fire cape here bargain for the jad pet yes i know not lucky okay bro okay the jet kill count number seven new personal best two improved it with four minutes any jad petters no pat but as always we're trading in the fire cape for the second time in a row a bargain we are lucky no we're not the boss fight of framini exiles it is time let's get healed up before we fight the boss and the quest is oh dragon may expect to end it baby oh come on dragon maze dude the feminine exiles is done the grind for the jaw has been unlocked there it is 15 case lyrics be 15k crafting of 5k room crafting 5.8 k more slayer speed till 81 so let's quickly get that there we go 81 slayer finishing off that level from the fremanic exiles just about missed it but not really 90 strength on the hardcore account baby the lost milestone of this episode now let's get don't know what this do for you but oh well and i want to thank you all for almost at 25 000 subscribers so thank you guys very much [Music] my
