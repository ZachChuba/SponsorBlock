wood to make box okay I'm gonna start fighting these guys some very good on dude we've got double rated we defended the whole thing dawg they must have used over 100 Rockets but we sealed it up domed another yeah they're gonna do the red base so under the boat right now shoot the boat shoot the boat on the 220 220 right now in another you can [ __ ] them up here dude they're gonna have to run a coast and another guys going up the hill t10 to 10 hit him yeah they're gone alright I'm coming down to pass so how deep did they get hella [ __ ] beep dude we got raided by struggle that was quick I [ __ ] them all up with grenade launcher or should this guy 25 our high external walls perforated holy [ __ ] I'm gonna come on and negate to 33 high walls of me and then the fine face there crimp it what the [ __ ] dog [ __ ] patched up as much as I could but the base is still kind of [ __ ] over here 33 walls I don't think so but there's I think there might be salud still be spawning bubbles that was skip and he didn't really did there so what the over okay so what the [ __ ] are you guys decided on reading us I was editing big cram [ __ ] called me on we fight you guys and then these guys are rating us what the [ __ ] just happened to you yeah we started defending you I think what I thought I thought but you guys are like like we beat you guys and let it be you team with them somehow because it never experienced that it back-to-back grade like that never ever that was so much fun that was so intense dude that was like for one hour or even more yeah cool you guys [ __ ] them out you guys really helped us like cuz we were hurting after you guys hit us but you guys really give us a chance tears I don't know we had like six bags each all over the place they had a lot of [ __ ] guys man we did manage the depot a half a box of a case Teli on katrinka should dude that must have been like a hundred rockets it must have been maybe about 60 rockets on you okay and these really yeah we just free rooms on it that was [ __ ] fun guys we built the space thinking that people had hit us from the south which both you guys did so though that's good I was down by their base before I logged out that it I was down by the base I'm like you know can I farm they handed me a full metal kit and the camera and I went to their shop they have like bunch of shops it's not their huge base and the guy was standing there with javi I toss them like two K stone that I farmed he couldn't pick it up so I'm like [ __ ] it did a jackhammer dome he was full of components 6 K leather all this [ __ ] I was thinking about raiding their shop like it's loading so far dude yeah it is it's over it's over bro boxes I think yes it was farm okay so see you guys our target isn't you it's it's these guys now you can get a lot of stuff to raise up yeah yeah did they get on my hem we we picked it in yeah yeah just because I didn't wanted to be a learner but I mean it didn't work 26000 yeah yeah damn myself and then all this [ __ ] right here all empty it don't put the boxes over I'll just empty it on the floor with split it in bubbles you've never experienced anything like that I know I haven't mm-hmm it's the only issue burnt out I call I had to use it to upgrade the base again repair it yeah it's fine and I don't know what we have left to actually scratch I'm really surprised we won that guy's two back-to-back raids I don't think we lost one rockex remove things properly I know everyone else is gonna be happy that the habits gone there would be a lot yeah it was [ __ ] cool though we got it we had like 20k every word [ __ ] it's a mess out there as well as [ __ ] yeah any of us were on to defend just crimp me and bubbles it's a goddamn you guys put in work yeah want to go check out the rapist yeah he said do so excite something some goddamn [ __ ] paranoid I'm Rick Dore and everything they weren't [ __ ] around building the car it's Takei already yeah they took everything in its you see didn't get much we could have easily grief them like right here read here we're gonna finish the turn I'm not sure AM yeah and then they had a turret here yeah I blew one of them up and then the Korean senator here I don't know how you guys did it but you did it thank you guys so much for watching today's video as you can tell the odds were against us during
