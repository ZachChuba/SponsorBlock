[Music] little as $1 a month hey YouTube will hear from all-electric back again with another curvy country road test this is test number 17 running 2020 2012 this is in my 2018 model 3 with hardware 3.0 and fsd has been purchased for this car although we're not using it we're just using regular autopilot for these curvy country road tests and here is our first aggressive curve and you can see almost immediately we're going way to sharp the autopilots taking a curve way to sharp here's number test 16 where it did take it a little bit sharp but I did not have to disengage like I did in this current test and now let's take a look at test number 14 and you can see that it did a really good job staying in the lane so I'm not sure there why on that very first curve it's taking the curve too sharply with the most recent software updates this last two software updates let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below there's been no changes to the road as far as you know painting or lack of lines it's the same as it was so let's slow it down here we have a right curve before a really aggressive left curve coming up so we are at 30 miles an hour so let's see if the autopilot slows down before the curve so it's slowing down to 24 we're at 24 okay Oh got a take over here so the right tire went off the road just a little bit and so I should have taken control a little bit sooner but everything's all good so we can see here in test number 16 where we got close to the right side of the road before it said take over immediately almost like the car was unable to do such a sharp curve now here's test number 15 and you can see that I did take over pretty quickly because it's such an aggressive curve same with number 14 so as far as that second curve goes we definitely have some work that needs to be done with the autopilot system and again I do have a theory in that the auto pilot will automatically say takeover immediately if the steering wheel goes past a certain degree or if the steering wheel turns too sharply so this part of the road here there are some pretty good-sized curves but nothing to write home about and the auto pilot is doing a great job and it has never caused a disengagement now let's slow the video down here as we approach the third really aggressive curve in this test and you can see the auto pilot is identifying if what looks like a stop sign or I'm getting a red line across looks like there's it's saying that there's an intersection in the road so I do have to take over here and that's really interesting to see now let's look back at test number 16 because we had a perfect display now the blue lines did skip a little bit meaning that the auto pilot wasn't for sure certain and here with test number 14 I did have to take over as well so with that third curve the test number 17 software 12 definitely performed worse than the test number 16 software 16 dot 2.1 so really really interesting to see that and it falsely identifying an intersection randomly around a curve so let me know if you guys have seen that before and down in the comment section below so now if you guys have been watching these curvy country road tests for a while you'll recognize this road we're getting to a small town here where I do have to disengage because it's kind of like a you know yield veer off intersection but then I do re-engage the autopilot here and now what's really interesting in these past couple software updates is when we get to this railroad track now the railroad track is approaching a up here ahead and we get a acknowledge for a stop sign so I have to acknowledge that yes there is no train in this situation and the car will go through now you can see on the center display it's already identifying the stop sign that is coming up here straight ahead which is really nice as specially as the driver it's telling me that yes the autopilot is smart enough to identify that there is a stop sign and don't worry it's going to stop there one of the hardest curves is coming up here this right bend and we've had several fails in the past let's see what it does you can see I'm looking through the curve and I do have to take over so it was gonna drift out of the lane over to the other side which we've seen here's test number 16 where it starts to go and then we get a take over immediately test number 15 did about the same where it starts to drift over across the double yellow line so I do have to take over here's test number 14 where it starts on the right side of the road and then is unable to maintain that lane position and starts to drift over the yellow line along with test number 13 we get a take over immediately so I think that section of road or that curve back there is too sharp for the auto pilot to take so currently I think the auto pilot is limited on how sharp of a curve or how hard it can turn the steering wheel and if the auto pilot needs to turn the steering wheel too hard then the car will just say take over immediately I can't do this I'm not set up to do it this way so I think that's something that the Tesla engineers have put into this autopilot software and let me know down in the comments section if you agree with my theory so this section of road is pretty straight we do have a couple bends in here but we're coming up to one of the famous curves in the curvy country road test and that is a blind downhill curve that is coming up here and it also happens at a t-intersection so here we go let's slow the video down and let's see what happens here so it starts to go over and I do end up disengaging so here's test number 16 and you can see that the autopilot system was able to pass and I did not have to disengage although it looks like it's going to steer right towards that dirt on the right side of the road before it ends up steering back let's now take a look at test number 14 we're following a vehicle and it does a lot smooth their job maintaining that Center Lane position rather than what we've seen in the previous test like here also in test number 13 where it starts to veer to the right before coming back to left and there I had to disengage so I definitely want to see the autopilot at least with that curve back there start to really maintain that center lane position through that curve although it is challenging and definitely causing a lot of disengagement because when me as the driver I see the car veering to the right side of the road where this huge dirt mound is I'm definitely more likely to take over versus if the car mate is able to maintain that center lane position so now we did have a car come out in front of us and the autopilot does a lot better when it's following a vehicle especially on these curvy country roads and now we have a thunderstorm that decided to join us so we have an extra challenge for the autopilot system here on the second half of the Kirby country road test so we are following a vehicle which is helping us out here but we do have that rain which is just another obstacle here in the curvy country road test a pretty aggressive left-hand turn is coming up here so that you saw the truck in front of us take that and the autopilot is able to tackle that with no problem here with this right curve as well the autopilot is definitely mastered that curve and if you recall from the first few Kirby country road tests the autopilot was not able to handle any of these curves so let's slow it down here for this curve that is still challenging for the autopilot and you can see that it is slowing down and it is able to maintain laying position and I do not have to take over so let's look back at test number 16 now where the autopilot is slowing down before the curve maintaining that center lane position and I do not have to take over so that's two in a row for this curve here test number 15 it does start to get a little bit close to the edge of the road but I don't have to take over test number 14 we're following a truck so it is successful whereas test number 13 I do have to disengage as it's definitely heading for that side of the road over so now I do have a special treat typically I go in the reverse direction like I did with test number 16 but now I have a special treat for you guys some roads that I've never tested before and this is a bonus Kirby country road test so like I just said I've never tested this section of road with autopilot so let's see what happens so the autopilot is maintaining that speed limit of 35 miles an hour so let's keep our eye on that to see if autopilot decides to slow down around some of these curves so the road is pretty straight here we have a left bend coming up I do have it in a faster mode for you guys and I will slow it down on any more aggressive curves so the video here is sped up for your viewing pleasure so we do have a left bend coming up here and the autopilot does slow down 1 mile per hour around that curve but is able to maintain perfect center lane position so really impressive there as far as the autopilot system and we do have another left bend coming up and the world widens right there and now on the center display you see a stop sign is coming up and my wife was asking me how is the autopilot when it's driving completely by itself going to process this stop sign or this T intersection and I told her it would process it just like we as a driver would where I stopped and then I start to creep forward and then I make my left turn so that was information that I got from autonomy day which if you haven't seen that go to Teslas a YouTube channel and click on the autonomy day it is a rather long video but is definitely worth the watch and that's where I got that information from so here we have the Sun is not helping us out here with all the glare so the autopilot system is definitely challenged in that you can see the water still all over the road we have a left curve coming up here let's slow it down and we do get a disengagement there I guess I'm keeping a tight grip on the steering wheel because again I've never tested this section of road here we have a left curve and it look like it slams on the brakes there and identifies that as an intersection all of a sudden sim so that is our second misidentified intersection we had another one happened on a curve as well so with this new software update 2012 we have two misidentified intersections so it seems like Tesla is still working on trying to identify intersections accurately so here is a straighter section of road no curves and the autopilot is able to maintain these Center position here over these little curves very easily now let's slow it down here is we have this big blind Hill coming up and let's see what the autopilot does so there we go at the hill crest performed beautifully so previous times I've tested hill crest like that it's either slammed on its brakes or veered off in a certain direction so they're definitely getting better at identifying hill crest and being able to predict accurately where the road is gonna go again another hill crest there and it does a beautiful job so really impressed with the auto pod system again never tested this section of road so it's really I I'm really impressed with how well the auto pod is able to maintain that center lane position you did see it disengagement back there there was a stick in the road I didn't want to run over it so I did disengage so I'm slowing the video down here because we have a huge aggressive right turn coming up and it does maintain that center lane position until it starts to drift over to across the double yellow line which is a big no-no for me and I do end up disengaging so I really wish they would write something in the software and not allowing the car to drift over the double yellow line that's something to me this double yellow line is such a hard rule that could be followed by this autopilot system now again I am NOT engineer so this is just a theory to me and I'm sure it's a lot harder than how I described so the road here is really tight you can see all that brush on the right side of the road but the autopilot system is able to still maintain that center lane position although it does get slightly over to the left-hand side and I did end up having a disengagement right there and that's probably because of how aggressively I'm putting pressure on the steering wheel to ensure that we don't hit anything on the side of the road so we do have a stop sign coming up here and where you're gonna get some beautiful representation of how well the stop sign actually works so here we're going through a stop sign and we come to a stop and then I simply pull down on the stock or you can press the accelerator pedal and the autopilot system carries on through this little stretch of road in this little town now it isn't able to identify speed bumps I hope that's something that is coming you can see I manually slowed down the car to go over that speed bump and then I tap on the speed limit sign on the center display to hip and go back up to the speed limit another stop sign there executed beautifully by the autopilot system and now this third stop sign here is that a t-intersection which the autopilot system is not yet capable of handling so it will make a stop here and then I will have to disengage and manually take over I am taking a right here turning onto this road so once I've engaged autopilot here it starts to go over almost behind those people for some reason so I do end up disengaging then re-engaging but if you notice here I'm at the train tracks with lights and that time it didn't require that I acknowledge you can see here and test number 16 as well so here I am in test number 16 it says that there's lights there and I use the accelerator pedal that time to acknowledge that yes there is no train there so let me know what you guys think down in the comment section below because as you saw in the beginning part of this video also the train tracks did require an acknowledgment as far as identifying the light there this last section of the curvy country road test is very easy for the autopilot system it wasn't always that way and if you want to see previous tests go check out the curvy country road a list I hope you guys like this video one
