hey it's Tesla connect here back with another video a viewer asked me how much navigate on autopilot has improved over the last roughly year and a half since it's been out I had a baseline video just shortly after it came out so I've got something to compare against I'll link it in the comments below that initial kind of trip just after navigate on autopilot launched it wasn't necessarily the most successful so a year and a half later or so I am now going to duplicate not a the exact same trip but I'm going to do a similar trip I'm going to do a big loop and if we look at the map here let's just take a look and see what I'm going to do I'm basically going to take a lap around the Greater Toronto Area at least the outskirts of the Greater Toronto Area this right here being Lake Ontario just to give you an idea of where I am and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the 407 and I'm gonna go towards Markham and then I'm gonna take the 404 down in North York I'm gonna take the 401 to the 400 and the 400 back up to roughly around the same area where I am right now so this should be a fairly interesting there's gonna be a lot of interchanges along the way here and I'm going to basically set it on navigate on autopilot I'm going to put the speed about 110 kilometers per hour I think that's a what is that I know 65 miles per hour I have to double-check that and I'm going to let autopilot do its thing I'm gonna let it select its lane I'm going to put it on average in terms of the lane change frequency so I'm not going to do Mad Max today there's going to keep it average on that setting what else can I tell you about this I think that's about it why don't we why don't we get started and check this out I'm also going to score this drive as well I'm going to use a scale of 20 instead of a scale of 10 I think scale of 10 is a little bit too harsh if you have a couple of times where you have to intervene next thing you know you're down to your drive being like you know 60 or 70% successful when that doesn't really tell the tale I think starting with a scale of 20 is going to be more appropriate every time I have to intervene I'm going to deduct a point and we'll see how well this drive does and if it can make it all the way without intervention wouldn't it be amazing it's gonna be about I'd say a 60 or 70 kilometer loop that's what 35 miles I don't know I got to get better at doing those conversions on the fly let's get started it's kind of ironic I'm starting out at a gas station but it's just a convenient place for me to pull off of the freeway get my camera's all set up and get the intro done it's currently a long weekend here in Canada it's the Victoria Day long weekend I think in the US you have something similar called Memorial Day I'm not entirely sure let me know in the comments I'm not expecting a lot of traffic today just because the whole kovat thing even though things are opening up I have noticed that just on my journey so far there's been a lot of police out today which is not unusual for a long weekend I'm going to program an app like a location to drive to and I don't know I'm gonna have to select something that's nearby there and what am I going to put here let's navigate to the Ontario Science Centre I guess let me change this navigate to the Ontario Science Centre this should get me in the direction of where I want to go yes it's going to take me the four oh seven okay this is actually notorious bad spot for I'm deducting a point right off the bat could be the construction but this is a notoriously bad area for okay two points off and we're just getting started this is not a good start that being said it's an incredibly bad area because of construction and the speed limit according to the vehicle constantly changes so it's not a good area maybe we do a reset should we do a reset just start again let's do a reset okay starting now oh boy what just happened lost the speed here doc me down in ninety this isn't this is a brutal start I don't know that's let's get the speed up to 110 I don't know what are we we're a 17 out of 20 if I'm being fair no restarts 17 out of 20 that was not good okay back to what I was saying now I've got my navigate on Pyatt on autopilot going and from here on in the car is gonna choose what Lane and it's going to navigate all the intersections itself or the interchanges rather so what I'll do is is I'll try Minh now and then if there's something to chime in about otherwise I'm going to set this to some some really good music and fast forward obviously you know so this isn't an hour-long video so just sit back relax and enjoy this is your Tesla experience [Music] or we're coming we are coming up on our first big interchange here this should be a pretty easy one for the Tesla to navigate there's no construction at least last time I was through here [Music] so you might have just seen there that I I kind of intervened but not in the driving for some reason it didn't go back to 110 kilometers so I just upped the speed I'm not gonna deduct a point for that not sure why I didn't take me back up to 110 but I can't drive a hundred I can't that's sixty two point five miles per hour sixty to sixty two point five at it was something [Music] [Music] here comes an interesting test I see flashing lights up ahead okay I think we're okay because I was worried at first that we were going to be in the adjacent Lane and I was wondering whether the Tesla would move over but we're not gonna get to try that because it looks like there's a lane between us already and what's going on there so okay but we are coming up to our next big interchange this one takes us from the 407 to the 404 this interchange it's fairly straightforward but it might be a little bit tricky let's see how the Tesla does okay so far so good this is a little bit of a long curve exit here and then it goes into a really weird merge so that's what I'm saying if it does have an issue it might be here there's the other thing is I do have the HOV Lane setting and we'll see if it moves us over to the HOV Lane okay so yeah that was good normally there's a lot of traffic entering so it was less weird than it usually is coming through there nicely done mr. Tesla or mrs. Tesla alright there's an HOV Lane to the left of us I do have the HOV setting on so let's see if it automatically brings us over to the HOV Lane which would be totally awesome look at this look at this okay this is so cool so in case we were wondering if that HOV Lane setting works yes it does now one of the things that I am going to have to do is change my navigation because in order to complete the loop periodically I have to change so that it follows the circular kind of loop that I want to do so I'm going to cancel here I'm just going to create a new destination navigate to york dale mall [Music] okay great this is keeping us on our loop so we're going to be going on to the 401 westbound and if memory serves me correct there's two ways to do this I believe that there's a way to go to the 407 West sorry the 401 westbound from the diamond lane from the HOV Lane here or you can go all the way over and take the you know the normal accident with everyone else who doesn't have the ability to be in the HOV Lane so it looks like Tesla's going to take the regular exit here I wonder if that's maybe because the mapping isn't detailed enough for it to know that it has a better option here if I was not on navigate on autopilot I would take the HOV right down to the HOV accent but here now we're with the rest of the people who don't get to use the HOV just for some context in Ontario the province of Ontario where I live if you have green license plates even though you don't have like there's obviously I'm the only one here but I'm still able to use a che HOV because it's a green vehicle but other than that blip when we started where it lost three points like like that I gotta say so far has been pretty smooth okay that this is actually kind of impressed impressive that's a pretty tricky intersection for a computer to do all right so I'm going to change the destination again and we are going to go just to keep on the loop I want to go to super charger let's see here navigate to Tesla supercharger Vaughn Mills okay great no I don't need to charge I'm not going to charge but that's going to be the endpoint of of this little test it'll be roughly a complete circle from where we started circle not really a circle more of like a square circle a skwerkel and we'll end it there and we'll just do a conclusion but right off the bat I think it's doing way better than when it was first introduced and that the credit to that [Music] nice after all that noise is gone okay what was I saying the credit has to go to these software updates that Tesla owners regularly get and our cars just keep getting better and this is really evident here based on my first experience with the navigator on autopilot compared to approximately a year and a half later today it's like night and day I know we had that blip getting started but other than that it's been rock-solid [Music] [Music] okay we are getting it should have an interesting situation here I'd have gotten over a long time ago the exit is coming right up you can see that the Tesla is really slowing down right now I guess it realized that it couldn't make it past this truck so in the end yeah that worked out but in terms of comfort I probably myself if I were driving would have gone over a lot sooner than the Tesla did but it still managed to navigate it just a little bit of a slowdown so I still say kudos we're coming up on like maybe in five hundred meters and interesting you have to get right over to the right to make this next interchange for the highway 400 if it's busy this could be you know I could be grabbing on to something I'm just saying let's see what happens okay it's prepping looks like it's not too busy this but it really needs to get over okay it it did that if we if it was busier I think that would have been probably interesting but well done well done it did it that was fairly tricky if I had one grape its this the speed I don't know why it's not rejecting the speed after it completes the interchange so I'm gonna take a point off for that it's happened to many times not to warrant a point being taken off so now we're at sixteen so can it hold on to eighty percent we've got ten more kilometers to go that's roughly six miles eighty percent I was hoping for eighty percent plus let's see what happens [Music] as we approach this final exit for this test I just want to remind viewers that in Canada we do not have the ability to stop at stop lights and stop signs and stuff like that that's only for our US friends right now I don't think anyone else in other regions of the world have that so we're gonna conclude this session I'm going to manually take over after autopilot navigate on autopilot ends and you know I'll just do a brief conclusion let you know my thoughts and then I will let you go about the rest of your day okay so navigating an autopilot has come to an end I'm actually gonna take over and get back on the highway I don't actually need to stop oh wait a minute can I get back on the highway this way I don't know yes okay okay so we'll just do a driving conclusion all right how did I think that went well first off four points lost out of 20 that's an 80% success rate on a percentage basis for the trip but remember we lost three points right off the bat and we were in a construction zone so I am being pretty harsh here on on the Tesla you might argue that 19 out of 20 is a more appropriate score but nonetheless I think if we are judging the performance today versus when navigate on autopilot first came out this guy wasn't gonna let me merge I'm driving a Tesla dude because he's not that happy why is it always the Audi drivers oh my god really oh boy anyhow where was I yes it's miles ahead of where it was and we can credit the software updates that we consistently get and I'm a pretty happy camper after the next big update I'll do another one of these tests I'm currently on 20/20 dot 12mm not one I think I just lost one of my cameras Tesla connect over now [Music]
