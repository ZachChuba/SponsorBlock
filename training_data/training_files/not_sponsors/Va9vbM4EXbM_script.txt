not open welcome to the show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show today you can tell because Luke and I coordinated our outfits I called him up this morning I was like hey you're gonna wear the floatplane shirt today you can also wear blue jeans and he was like he was like he was like no and I was like okay good then I can wear it and then that piece of human garbage showed up wearing the flow Rhett are you wearing ltte underwear too yes nice but I do that pretty much every time I can be sore calm where the same underwear is that that's right not the same article of clothing know that we charge more for the books do for you guys today we're gonna be talking about the PIAA situation that took place a little back where piao got acquired by cape technologies I actually had a chance to sit down with some executives from both sides and sort of talk through some of our community's concerns so we'll be discussing that a little bit later Intel apparently is allegedly buying back stocks to hide declining growth I mean there's other reasons to buy back stocks but that's sort of one reason you might do it laughter you got xbox says Nintendo and Sony are no longer its main rivals that'll be an interesting conversation and I do not agree with them but we'll go more into that later also in videos g-force now is finally out of beta which is kind of cool it's been in beta for Google you know I wasn't where I'm going is into the intro [Music] [Music] if I can - [Music] surprise they still have like merch eldane know this these these little things are like my mother gave them to me when I still lived at home and they're still like they still function I mean it's mineral oil you know beeswax carnuba wax microcrystalline wax it's just like nothing that's gonna yeah I mean it's I mean maybe it maybe it rotted like I've been using it all that time like bits of skin flake could have rotted on it you know but it doesn't say it expires so I've just kept using them nice before let's let's go sir are we starting to it headliner right no one just go right to the headline topic private Internet access so I had a chance to sit down with well virtually sit down with you know air travel is costly and takes a lot of time and stuff so we used discord yeah unfortunately the audio discord well because they are in Europe so we were like on the Europe server but I am super definitely not in Europe and it was pretty crackling sure anyway point is I actually recorded the entire call with their permission of course like it wasn't I wasn't surreptitiously according it or anything that was the plan but I I recorded the entire call and we're gonna share that and an unlisted YouTube video if you guys want to go ahead and check that out and basically what we did was we pulled our community a little bit earlier was either this week or last week and we asked you guys to give us a list of the questions that you wanted us to ask P ia so I sat down I talked to them myself some of the concerns that people shared were in this document that I cannot open because I opened the wrong one here we go people wanted to know what kind of differences and users are going to see how they can ensure their data is protected whether P I a will remain private Internet access you know what guarantee people have that their information won't slip out in any shape or form whether they'll continue to operate in such a way that they can maintain true confidentiality with no records how does the merger help p IA like why even do this you know one of the things I really drilled into was okay I understand how this helps P ia because you know you have a bunch of money now because you have this parent company with large coffers but you know what's in it for the fur cape technologies because it was said in the news articles about the acquisition that p IA owed a lot of money that they had a lot of debt and so i was looking at it going okay well why does PA have debt unless they're not profitable and if they're not profitable well usually the model there for acquiring a non profitable business is what are you acquiring users why do you want users user data so I asked okay like how does that make sense and they explained that basically the debt that p IA was carrying was actually more to do with product development of you know exciting upcoming products and not to do with that they were not operating profitably day by day and i kind of okay well that makes a lot more sense acquiring a profitable business so what else did we talk about will they be keeping IP records the answer is no what kind of auditing do they do of their systems to avoid what happened oh actually didn't ask that specifically because we ended up talking about the auditing that they are open to so regulatory regulatory bodies are welcome to visit their offices they can poke around in their source code they've actually started open sourcing some of their products which i thought was pretty cool they say they're not planning any changes to the current end-user license agreement that was another big question they couldn't really comment on pricing i understand that they were like yeah i don't know up down like pricing sort of a thing yeah one of the most common questions even though this happened a long time ago like something like a year and a half ago was why did mark Capella's become their new CTO and we've actually got we've got a clip we've actually got a couple of clips here so we've got about 11 minutes of highlights I'm not going to take you guys through oh whoops you're not screen sharing with me so we've got about 11 minutes of highlights here I'm not going to take you guys through the whole thing but I think it's worth including a little bit of it but the gist of that one was that London trust media hired Mark Capella's and he wasn't actually influential on P ia which is was like owned by London trust media but then now P ia was actually acquired by cape technologies so if anything this question is more relevant now than ever but they still were willing to answer it which I thought was great they were actually surprisingly approachable and transparent throughout the whole process and they basically said well you know we believe in second chances you know it's pretty evident that mistakes were made but he never had any access to any user data and was working for London trust media we know he's very capable so you know we hired him based on that and one of pas founders had an existing relationship with them and kind of said like I know he's a good guy and like you know that stuff happens but we think people deserve a second chance and he had nothing to do with any of PIAA privacy applications so we we had a pretty long conversation about that as well yeah so basically the long and short of it is that they're saying Cape technologies had made mistakes in the past I mean that was the other big concern that I think our users had was that Cape technologies in its earlier days was whether directly or basically was in the business of selling user data ended up having it blow up in their faces the the CEO this is what they're telling me the CEO basically burned it all to the ground got rid of everybody brought in an entirely new team and decided okay no new focus we are going to work on the concept of monetizing privacy instead of monetizing data and they pointed at their acquisitions of other VPN companies who notably haven't had any scandals cyberghost is a perfect example in the last few years since cape technologies acquired them as their commitment to keep moving in that direction really interesting interesting quip was they I forget who it was sorry there were there were a handful of people on the call but one of them pointed out that Mark Zuckerberg got up on stage and talked about you know privacy as like you know a really exciting business opportunity etcetra etcetra etcetra and I'm kind of sitting here going okay and they were like yeah yeah no no wrong wrong wrong messenger yeah like great message yeah that's that's fair enough well Greg yeah lie to your users a ton and then advertise privacy yeah so well you know that's the whole it's the whole I want to say conspiracy theory but it seems pretty believable right you know where the the same actors are creating you know weapons and shields yeah yeah definitely are we gonna watch it or are you just gonna do the summary you know what I kind of summarized a lot of it like why don't we watch a couple chunks shirt though sure yep log do log just just for our viewers I want a summary do you log I P addresses do you log you know any like metadata and obviously you have to take payment from people somehow how does this work what do you not log any translations sorry that the video is frozen on their side the connection was what you do and then it's also shown they are very transfer the first company the history of VPNs that open the publish the transparency report regarding police redress and we get these requests here also private Internet is releasing a transparency report so you see in the way we deal with police requests and subpoenas that there is no data out there there is no big above there is no deeper story and we don't log anything as a relates to BP in traffic or anything you know obviously when somebody signs up you know somebody signs up but but you know we're really committed to our no law policy but it's it's it's great that you um ask this question because we're actually taking it a step further and and we're opening our systems to you know review for from both auditors in the community as well as you know professional auditors as well so that they can verify what we're saying not just take our voice this is gonna be a question that you guys so basically that's the that's the summary of the no log policy basically they are committed to continuing to not log anything okay I think my other time stamps are in the dock here the the big middle chunk the only reason I'm not playing it is because it ended up being really long and it was faster to summarize it I did post the full thing in the chat and then I'm just checking to see I believe it's also posted in the video description yeah it's posted in the video description if you guys want to check that out I'm just checking my other timestamp yes so I'm completely off topic question that I have yes guys in a tent I don't know the camping I'm not I'm not sure I'm sorry they were super backlit it was hard to see their faces yeah I mean that answer was as far as I know the same answer you get if you if you look up there like FAQ stuff yep so did know hey this was edited down for long pauses apparently good effort guys oh I asked if there's anything else they wanted to share okay yeah let's try that one more time you know one thing I wanted to share is that we recently open source all of our software and you know we also announced a new program called zero access that you cannot kind of briefly touched on before but we're basically you know opening up our systems to prove that we actually won't have access to the system but at the same time they're running exactly what you know we're saying that is running and it's all gonna be provable okay the big push on our end is for complete transparency someone had an iPhone sitting next to their mic okay well go ahead you know how can be I used to trust you you know and my answer is always don't trust us I mean just just don't just look at what we are doing we are publicly visible we are the most transparent company out there everybody knows our headquarters go on all websites you're gonna see pictures of people working for this company so we are launching a transparency report our policy at cyber boots is since three years and the same policy that the private Internet access or examine any NGO any NGO that is in this field and has experts is invited the market outdoors in Bucharest right ahead for a PR for examle and you can have a watch you can watch our service you can see our service you can look at our source code you can see what's behind the scenes you can talk with the people be our super transfer and don't trust us just look at how we operate the business and addition trust now we start to closely it's lovely open source sound and I think that is important I think that is the difference between our school and our products okay all right thank you very much so in summary what we've decided to do to make things simple so I don't know if you guys have noticed but we worked with P ia for a long time ever since we weren't comfortable with tunnel bears acquisition by McAfee up until the news of P ia then getting acquired now we haven't stopped working with P ia strictly speaking but ever since that day we haven't done any promotion for P ia we haven't put out our affiliate link actually we we had it in one spot it was like in a template somewhere but we we removed it once someone brought that to our attention because we just there wasn't that we were sure that Cape technologies was going to be a negative influence on them we just didn't know and we didn't want to put ourselves in a position where you know PIAA had got acquired and then now we're we're hopping over to some other VPN and then what like are they gonna get acquired and then we have some big scandal and then we hop over to some other VPN and we were just kind of I was tired of that cycle you know don't want to deal with that and from my perspective you know if we couldn't just find someone that we can trust to recommend to our users then I was just gonna bail on it so what we told PIAA is look we're gonna give you guys a chance to speak your mind we're gonna let the community decide I mean everyone's had actually like weeks now actually months to process all of this so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drop the this poll in the forum here all right informed scuse me I'm gonna drop this poll in the chat here and we're just gonna let you guys decide so in order to prevent any [Music] exploiters from taking advantage of that this is a poll that's based on the YouTube community link we are going to cut off the voting in the next five minutes I'm not going to give people time to spin up their botnet or whatever the case may be so guys go ahead and check that out do you want to drop that in the flip side as well this guy's off on it he's on it it's taking care of our flow cleaners I also read on the other two just to make sure they got updated links all right so guys go check that out and that's it you guys are judge jury and executioner so if you guys say yeah stick with P ia then that's it we're sticking with it if you guys say no hard bail then it's hard bail as far as I'm concerned so we'll do one more topic while we wait for you guys to go through that and then we'll come back and have a look at the results this is a fun one this is supposed to by jacob fw on the forum the original source is seeking alpha calm so a popular financial news site intel stock has been trading near 20 year highs however intel's annual 10k filing shows that the company's operations are running far behind the sentiment in the stock and that the earnings per share growth is being driven through stock buybacks I mean this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's been following the that tax changes that have been made down in the States over the last several years Intel is far from the only company utilizing its windfall from not paying as much taxes to buy back a whole bunch of its stock and pump up the value although there may be more to this so let's go through the rest of this so that the driver of Intel's story and the recent past has been its data center group but this segment barely grew in 2019 could be partly because of AMD epic to Rome servers and their profitability actually declined by over 10 percent the first year epic shipped in decent volumes so yes is probably a factor and if the last you know few months ever since Rome to in particular are anything to go by in terms of like third-party reviews and just the buzz that I've seen in the places where people are discussing enterprise hardware for twenty to twenty is talking to be a good year for that unit so the other major group at Intel is the client computing group so that's where you've got your K series overclocking you know gaming CPUs all that kind of thing and growth in 2019 also died down AMD has been consistently gaining market share against the client client computing group ever since basically the launch of Rison I mean it's at the point now where here all we have to do is fire up amazon.com yeah I mean check this out ladies and gentlemens not this is not pre-scripted ladies and gentlemen okay we're gonna look at I don't even know how to navigate Amazon sites terribly post computers terrible computers yeah but it's not computers I need aa computer components here we go ladies and gentlemen we need computer component well whatever here ladies and gentlemen here you go AMD tomorrow AMD best seller AMD some more AMD that's red but not AMD but hey it's red counts more AMD holy crap that's AMD board AMD board AMD processor AMD board there isn't a single intel thing on the landing page that's actually crazy now you know if I wore a tinfoil hat I might suggest that Amazon is you know Lisa Sue's niece is working for Amazon and make it you know that's the Amazon is algorithmically driven I can tell you for a fact that if it's AMD all over the computer components front page that's because that's what people are even if they're not necessarily buying it you know every single one of those products like Intel is definitely still selling CPUs but even if they aren't necessarily buying it that's what people are shopping for that's what people are like lusting after right now wait oh no nevermind I thought I saw I thought I saw an Intel product on the homepage but actually that was just something that I had in my cart as like thinking about item so I sorted to specifically CPU processors and there's Intel stuff right on the front but you'll hold on what do you got what do you expect there to be in the middle top oh boy what the heck is that doing there is back there why is it $500 why is there an Athlon XP what are these sponsored who is sponsoring this we need more transparency what's going on here back in time it's a flawed XP versus Core 2 quad oh it's gonna be a gong show once you get past the sponsored ones however it's am deal and it takes what seven sort of eight because there's randomly an SSD in here until you get to an Intel processor okay hold on I had I had some I had a viewer asked me to do it in incognito mode okay friends I always do it in incognito mode so this is computers up don't just go away computer components here we go all right you ready ladies and gentlemen AMD AMD AMD this is a dandy AMD yeah I actually don't really shop on amazon.com very much so I might as well loading it in incognito mode oh I also went to dot CA oh okay that was dots yet okay what I showed you but you ended up with a couple Intel processors well but that was when you went to the CPU page specifically page after the sponsored posts it's all rising for two whole rows wow the third row the third item is and then you've got like an SSD in there because like you only live once so there's an SSD beating Intel's first entry yes actually get two entries and it's all back to AMD for three more than by AMD town population y'all alright um so what else we got here growth would have been negative if not for adjacent business a segment that included Apple modem the aplha modem business which saw a major growth spurt in 2019 so Intel is posting increased earnings per share despite the declining operating income how is this possible stock repurchases have climbed from three point six one five billion to ten point seven three billion in 2018 - oh that's teen yeah - 2018 - thirteen point five seven six billion in 2019 so some may argue that Intel's continuing to generate tremendous amounts of cash despite the challenges and there's nothing wrong with stock buybacks in fact it can be a sign that the executives are confident that stock price will go up in the future the argument is a little flawed though the main problem is not stock buybacks but that the buybacks are hiding the declining operation I don't I don't so I read this I don't think that the argument is necessarily flawed right they're saying some may argue that they're they're getting a bunch of cash and and there's nothing wrong with stock buybacks then the next statement is saying that they're the arguments flawed which would mean that there is something wrong with stock buybacks well there can be I think is what they're trying to say like they sure but that's a weird statement so if you're doing stock I can try to get that turned back on did we just have like a power flicker here I hear a printer - printer con yeah okay I can keep going okay yeah yeah let's just both leave okay I'm gonna come back hello yeah so I don't know I I was we praised Ubisoft what like two years ago when they resisted a company buying them out by frantically buying as much stock as that really I don't think buying back stock is necessarily a bad thing they could definitely be using it to cover up declining whatever's but if you're making stock purchasing decisions and you're looking that shallowly at things like that's not know we could no you have to protect the lowest common denominator a hundred percent I don't do stock stuff very often so okay know what I mean by protect that I mean protect the lowest common denominator person that's what I think oh yeah no so like that's why I'm including myself in there because super informed on stuff okay but lowest common denominator no I would not consider you to be lowest common denominator lowest common denominator is more referring to the capability or ever like okay or the like the methodology that someone might use to approach something okay you know and you have to make sure that you're protecting the people you protect your protecting like stock do good buy stock yeah like people who are like that because they need to know that something's being manipulative um buying back their stock because know another thing too is that you know if the executives own a bunch of stock if the stock is dipping this might be a good time for them to buy if I that I'm going to come back eventually or buy back so that the stock doesn't dip too far so they can sell theirs for a good value before it everyone clues in and it like really dips that also makes them so anyway I can I could see why someone could maybe argue that it's like a not a great thing that they're covering up the stock dipping totally understand that I don't I wouldn't agree that they like shouldn't be allowed to do it or something cuz it's a fair I mean this is obviously not something that would work for the very long term you know eventually you're running out of cash to buy back yeah to buy back so especially with this increase like the first years increase was over seven billion dollars yep and then the next one was was what like around just under three but I mean I would be very surprised if Intel doesn't come back swinging hard in the next two to four years and maybe this helps them write out that write out that dip yeah alright speaking of speaking of writing let's go ahead and have a look at the results of our poll here and then sponsors and then sponsors right yes you should do that all right you guys are finding out the same time as me a few times it's been tied every time yep okay internet so are we being trolled sorry being trolled Colton you don't think we're being trolled they think small one big one small one yeah it really does look like a middle finger doesn't it yeah yes yes that's what you were thinking yeah that's what you see when you look at that yep a long just RI Gant akin different middle finger all right give it the old refresh I mean good this is not going to get more helpful and for your reference I did refresh it a few times and they were tied every time the the indifference column got a little smaller so I think the excitement about the pole decreased but the the yes and no columns were were tied the whole time I was really hoping for a much clearer indicator I mean I might as well have just gotten a magic 8-ball and then like yo what should I do stop maybe look not so good yeah yeah okay well now what there's there's a winner got a refresh so win here okay I mean I don't know that I wonder 7% is could be a winner yeah I it's meaningless um this is like clearly this is clearly divided divided the community here all right I guess should like rap battle Eastside honestly having having actually sat through the entire interview that I did with them this morning I felt pretty good about the direction they were going I mean I'm still committed to letting the community decide unfortunately I don't have a good way to allow them to decide it because we're moving different without leaving it open to Wilden people yeah no I don't want to take away that vote if people just don't care like that's good right but the difference between the 22 and the 23 will be more noticeable if that column of dump votes isn't there I see okay I I mean it might end up being like oh it's a 2% difference now like it might not I was expecting there to be strong opinions I didn't know which way it would swing this was the last possible thing that I could have expected yeah me too okay we're gonna have to give it some more thought this was like my master plan this was my I thought was gonna work I was like excited for like how conclusive this was going to be yeah I was excited to not have to make a decision he was just like no so you have to decide got people saying Nord VPN they've had their own issues like right around the same time they had a really stupid a right candor I think yeah yeah all right I guess we'll just have to figure out figure it out on our own then go watch the unlisted video yeah go watch the unlisted video see if you feel any differently honestly I'm not gonna be able to keep looking at these numbers though because the longer this sits up there the easier it would be for someone to go in and try to manipulate it with a bunch of zombie accounts or whatever the case may be so you can leave it up just for lulz I guess I don't know no just lock it yeah I'm just gonna no that's okay I can I think I can lock it do I have the power to lock it no I can only delete it you can't lock a poll what a what a feature-rich wonderful website YouTube thank you very much for building this spectacular video video sharing platform oh yeah yeah Nick when's it coming dude yeah all right it's not even so it's literally his own thing I'm believing it was like this amazing yeah come on Jade all right get the dust script let's do let's do our to our sponsors oh I'm so unhappy right now cuz I was just expecting that to be the answer okay thing where you going to the next one yes floatplane there's a pole for just you brought to you by a floatplane there's a pole for just what sorry so one in the floatplane shot came with the idea that the floatplane viewers probably an increased amount of VPN users probably a little bit more hardcores and stuff maybe we should see what shows just their floatplane decide okay you know what screw it I'm just gonna let floatplane decide okay do you have it up on your screen okay do I want it revealed to me at the same time as you let's they're still voting but this one's a lot more clear okay basically nine nice this one is significantly more clear there's still votes coming in as you see but the percentages are roughly staying the same what's also nice about the floatplane one is it's far less likely to have people with ready-to-go accounts to spam like YouTube account yes these are paid accounts so we know that these are actually legitimately real people people are unlikely to have a duplicate account for a floatplane I mean you can if you want thank you very much but I think that's not really a normal dream use case actually another floatplane related matter I did not realize that we were uploading our videos in 1080p quality yeah so yeah we're gonna switch to 4k i actually enabled the 4k tear yeah on floatplane assuming that everything we uploaded was like at 4k source quality I didn't realize that we weren't so we're working on that we're getting that getting that sorted out okay calm and I have another only sort of floatplane related piece of news channel super fun the one the only okay so quick quick just before we go on somewhere in the flow plane audience is a but and leaked this oh no I leaked this you showed my screen it showed the URL oh well that's okay they had are either way okay you know what that's the flow plane audience is perfect that's it the answer is the answer is done flow plane set YouTube says maybe flow plane says yes so flow playing people because we know you're real people I am done conclusive 60% of the time it works every time we're going with the flow plane conclusion okay big news this is like the biggest news ever annal super fun okay display capture oh sure okay everything here good what are you what are you trying to I want to show floatplane okay okay so okay oh boy I'm sorry Fupa oh I'm sorry everyone that's very often sweet all right we are looking at Linus tech tips on flow plane and we are looking at the return oh the only channel super fun please play way to go the awkward there it is ray there it is look at this guy look at this guy his hairline is receding what a loser basically we did like a paper airplane challenge of some sort don't worry about it don't worry about it you know there's no worries there's just you know go check it out it's good stuff hold on let me just fix this this is oh this is so broken one moment please yes I wish to remove the eye and we're back watch the video okay it's gonna be great channel super funds back dog Colton me and John oh we're we're heavily involved it's gonna be a blast you guys are gonna love it the whole floatplane chat is just roasting me right now Oh rose to them but it was actually our fault oh yeah that's fair that's fair you know you win this round um also last month's for the show yep displayed a display is a magnet mounted metal print with art it's durable and you don't need any power tools to hang it they've got over a quarter million different arts spanning a bunch of different styles and influences easy magnetic mounting so there's no holes in the wall and it's easily replaceable they plant a tree for every display purchased and we can show our portraits page let me just bring that up whoops well that's not the right page there it is a and it's loaded five diss plates by Linus Sebastian I actually did not create those but people on our team did look at this look at this Reilly guy hey they got his shirt wrong he works for tech linked actually he does he does LTT stuff all the time so display guys go check them out you can get 15% off using code LTT at the link below so that's Elms you got GG / displayed when I eat what else we got for big important topics today Tesla removing software features from used cars I was actually reading about this interesting so there's a Model S sold at auction the guy bought it with the understanding that it had the full autopilot feature and then I think there was one other one yeah autopilot was advertised as a feature and oh the story here says the previous owner paid $8,000 for it but the article that I read about it was Tesla was saying that actually we were doing an audit and this car was not entitled to autopilot and the description of work it says autopilot was removed on November 18th 2019 after it was found that the customer did not purchase the software so basically the car updated to the latest version and autopilot was removed after this customer bought a car that supposedly had autopilot yeah so I'm trying to see if there's like an official statement or an update or anything like that to see if there's there's something what you said but I don't see so there's a couple of ways to look at this one is like obviously you don't get the Steam library that was logged in when you buy a laptop obviously well hold on no don't think for a second though what if someone sold their Tesla okay no no hold on no no I'm going somewhere with okay stop stop okay okay so I am a Model S owner okay I pathetically sure I'm a lot of less owner yeah and I'm gonna sell my Model S and I'm like you know what Model S that's for chumps I'm getting the Model X x-rated it's big you know big axe big axe in different yeah sure so from my perspective as a Tesla customer who bought as some $8,000 software upgrade for my car maybe I want to take that with me okay okay but hold on hold on hold on I'm going somewhere with this I'm going somewhere with this just can you calm down no it looks externally like he's calm that's why I keep telling new relax cuz I can tell right below the surface right a millimeter below the surface he's gonna he's gonna explode he's dynamite he's a dynamite kind of guy yeah all right so I want to take my autopilot with me okay why should I have to pay for a software feature that I already paid for so in that case if I were to say hey I think the Tesla's should license their advanced driving features to the user rather than the car I would have at least some ground to stand on now I've been playing devil's advocate this entire time cuz I think this is ridiculous but why don't you go ahead and if it was licensed to the user and it was made very clear that that was the arrangement that had which is not how it works at all I think that would be its own conversations yeah it's tied to the car so the steam library argument doesn't really like no no it was just for us to be able to have a conversation about like hey in an alternate reality this could be weird but interesting just because like it could be tied to the user not the car they could go to a car that doesn't support it and then it's like oh yes that is that is really the problem with the entire argument I would you like go into your buddy's car and log in and it's like hey let's all share the same account now that hold on a second whoa whoa whoa so you want to drive your fred around cuz hold on are features in your car hold on a minute no cuz it's an autopilot feature I ain't driving nobody's driving okay okay so I think people who are being realistic and I'm sorry to everyone who this is very bad news for you I'd hate to be the bearer of bad news for people who are being realistic I think the future of people not owning cars is pretty clear at this point yeah cars as a service is happening I'm so sorry I'm so sorry they're grieving right now it'll be there when you wake up it'll just have been somewhere else while you're asleep that's right so cars as a service that's coming whoa so I'm just using some fleet of autonomous cars or whatever oh I as a user license better features now I'm not saying I like this as a user Wow I'm just saying it's brilliant and horrible from the fleet management perspective you can have all the same cars if they just have basic cars and then so you so hold on okay oh my goodness this is like next-level stuff obviously mr. must figured this out ten years ago and that's like why he's pushing so hard for all this crap but okay so here's the here's the dynamic okay you've got the car as a service service provider and I know Tesla wants to be one of them they want to be vertically integrated but let's say they don't reach complete saturation so you've got your car as a service service provider you've got Tesla you've got the end user so now you've got all these different licensing options to work together on as Tesla and the car as a service company right so either Tesla can go hey you know we're gonna offer users directly the option to license air-conditioning for example okay we're gonna we're gonna license air-conditioning we're gonna license you know the ability to go more than more than a hundred miles at a time work or whatever the case may be yeah and then the cars as a service company is gonna go well hold on a second how about this how about we bulk license some percentage of our fleet based on in much the same way that you would that you would shoot I'm missing the word provision it's the same way the provision a server so where you would oversell the hardware that's actually on the machine based on that not all of it will be used at a time so so the car is a service company is like okay 30% of our fleet is gonna have you know music better music quality you know some better better codec or whatever so it sounds better sure right I'm well I'm just trying to come up with yeah yeah yeah you could that you could give and take right now is not that important yeah it's just the idea so we're gonna license that from you and then we're gonna charge a higher tier to the people who want access to those features under the assumption that we will never have more than 30% of our fleet deployed with these higher tier users and so there's all these different ways that they could work together to make sure that people don't own anything yeah that pretty much that sucks it's brilliant yeah they're gonna make so much money like so much more money than selling people cars like selling people cars at this point is like the worst business to get into I mean that's why nobody is doing it like you might say oh oh Tesla no no Tesla's not getting into the business of selling people cars they're getting into the business of being an energy solutions provider part of which is automobiles and they're getting into the business of autonomous vehicle fleet sales and management because the problem with selling people cars is that you only get paid once and that is not the way of the future for better or for worse and not only that but it comes there's so much overhead and like the way we know from a conversation we had of assuming one or two months ago at this point that like taxi company that had Tesla's you remember that like 300 thousand miles no major repairs yeah so if you have that if you have fleet mechanics and you have like repair infrastructure which I'm sure they have where they can swap engines they can swap batteries they can do whatever they need to keep these things going way more cheaply than an end-user would be able to yeah and then your licensing though and you get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of kilometers on these things instead of like I don't know what the average amount of kilometers someone starts to replace a car is but instead of that you get way freaking more yeah people are so in denial in America we own things do you do you do you do you buy movies still cheap do you buy movies still I get physical copies of games yes CDs beauty I want any CDs oh boy yeah so I'm sorry I'm sorry that that was hard to hear but man it is gonna like I wonder I honestly wonder my kids are still not even close to the age where they would legally be allowed to drive yeah and in much the same way that I sort of would marvel at how my parents just knew their way around like driving I was like I just use glue maps you know what right I wonder if there's gonna be another generational gap that soon why are you like the old driving but why are you operating a steering wheel who even needs to do that what that's stupid like it's a waste of my brain cells to even just like just gonna say read yeah watch something a video yeah oh hey Nick I got a question for you and then you can jump in so I'm sure there's a ton of people be like records and yeah there will be people like that with cars yeah absolutely and they can take their cars to the track once manually operated vehicles are no longer legal on roads don't kid yourself that will happen might be a long time yeah 50 is fine no I know I'm not saying 15 years I'm saying that it will be an option in 15 years and then it will become mainstream because the thing is the only way for big changes like these to happen are through people dying and being born people who remember the old way died and people who never knew any other way have to swap over and like be like shipping industry and stuff in terms of like trucks and everything is going to completely swap because they'll seem reliable so like yeah industries will change and re standardized to this entirely everything trickles down for the enterprise yeah not enterprise the car rental company everything in the world trickles down although I are they live I heard they pick you up Jacob salmon says would a limited run LTX displayed at LTX be something we could see in the future okay so well yeah I think people would like to buy them there I don't know something something all right what can I do for you sir I actually did talk about LTTE store.com oh this is great I think it was like one of the first things we said did you mean LTT store.com I did dang it not that one honorably I did see that what are you doing uploading things you should just be buying water bomb you guys should send them a water ball so sorry what's the good news get out of here get out of here I know we need a water bottle subscription oh my god you could have that B you can have that be a company benefit is your service for your morning work pick up and your afternoon work drop off could be covered by your company yeah yeah that would be a way for the company that I'd like you're gonna be here on time and the executive package could include like it takes your kids to school sure whatever Sam I'm carving out that I'm carving out that they could have discounts for for like company fleets man absolutely it could automatically adjust based on schedules input by just like uber you'd have surge pricing during the times when everyone's commuting and it would be cheaper so you're gonna have companies like offset their hours by five minutes and stuff like that I would also help overall traffic yep absolutely yeah like if you if you were on like a somewhat variable schedule it could just automatically change it so you know what's going on your car could inform you when you need to go to work do you speak from experience variable schedule it's like hardly ever here I do not have appropriate facilities okay all right okay wired.com this is this is great I guess well after the announcement from Adobe that they were killing off flat Ben Lattimore at blue Maxima on Twitter has saved over 38,000 flash games in a behemoth torrent as part of flash point a web game preservation product so sites like Newgrounds addicting games comp that was my that was my weapon calm yeah me too maybe clip millions of people went to play and publish games that influenced generations I think that's probably overstating it a little bit but generation he started in yeah he started in 2017 with a group of programmers and creators when you realized there was no historical archive for these games animations and experiments so the flashpoint project is currently 241 gigabytes and includes all the media files and a launcher there's also a launcher only download but allows you to install individual games so the video game designers behind celebrated titles like crypt of the necromancer hollow Knight and Super Meat Boy all got their start noodling around with flash highlights this highlights the importance of digital archiving because we could lose a lot of the cultural history of the internet in fact one of the games on addicting Gamescom that was like my go-to was a little simple flash game called Pearl Harbor so you were a you were a plane and you I forget what the flight mechanics were but you had to dip for some reason you had to dip and then I come up for some reason sure and there were ships down below and you had like a limited number of bombs and you were you just advanced through levels a very simple game but it was fun just one day was off the site if I had to guess I would say someone got uncomfortable with Japanese planes bombing American ships or something that's just my guess I don't know maybe maybe someone out there is watching me this will be like that super just map yeah we're like the entire community was like hey yo you should update it and they any dead and then we played it what you played against them um anyway so it just disappeared and I was like oh well I can never play that game again well that blows it's we have not only things yeah speaking of not owning things the first picture they have on the article on PC gamer is I don't actually see it say this in here but I'm certain it's stick RPG this game was so cool like I just I remember stick RPG I played stick RPG dick RPG was amazing back to G was sweet I did like I think everyone yeah you played stick RPG like that was it being a ton of content IRA no there wasn't boring pretty fast it was yeah but like every it was really cool at the time yeah and for the time I mean it had a decent run of content for a web game for a browser game it's pretty limited I don't even remember anything you could do it was like kind of you go to the bar and you could fight yeah you can where I think through gamble somehow you could go work out there was a job that you could go to I was I mean I had a job and you could like talk to that like dude outside of the convenience store you remember this really well and get like skateboard how much RPG did you play I don't really remember it's been a long time I just well looking at this picture like I got hit in the face with like oh yeah all this stuff I probably put like half an hour into it sounds like you were hardcore yeah I think I like beat it or something I don't know if there is really an ending but I don't know I took it very far I remember that um last topic for today Xbox says Nintendo and Sony are no longer their main focus okay I got it I gotta jump into one thing this isn't here phil spencer said that's not to disrespect a Nintendo and Sony but their traditional gaming companies are somewhat out of position so mr. Spencer knows that content is king right is he aware does he know that memo you get the memo that the PlayStation absolutely killed the Xbox this time around I actually like the direction Microsoft and Xbox have kind of been going with gaming for yeah yep the the Microsoft game pass thing is actually pretty cool and cross-licensing between pricing is awesome on Saul I think they've been making a lot of good steps I don't think that means that they're traditional gaming companies are out of position and I don't think that means I think not to disrespect while probably good intentioned was not a very good way to start that sentence I just I don't know you're still definitely in competition with those guys even if only part of your business sector is in competition with them you're freaking Microsoft you have a lot of different business sectors you're like Project X cloud thing that's invite-only is probably more in competition with Nvidia than Amazon and Google at this point because Google stadia is apparently not really going anywhere yeah judging by how Google does everything they will probably just drop it I don't know they for they'll carry it forever yeah they've had a shocking amount of patience for some stuff that's just kind of - either it will never die but if we ever go anywhere yeah or it will completely disappear randomly so like and like maybe Amazon will actually do something they are pushing a ton of money into that lotr MMO so maybe you are gonna end up going against them but like I don't know I don't think I think that statements a little misguided that's all that's what I'll say there um so yeah now considers Amazon and Google top rivals Google entered the home gaming market etc and left off four games on their App Store's apple offers a monthly subscription they do not currently offer a cloud gaming service I mean the thing is that neither does Microsoft it's invite-only a lot of technology is being built around cloud gaming and I think that there's gonna be a lot of time for Nintendo to step in and compete in that market once it's a little bit more mature I feel like they're gonna Disney plus the whole market Nintendo yeah content King yeah so they just go okay you know what everyone else is like game streaming service that's quaint that's nice good job you guys will come in late to the party kind of make everyone go wow I really wish I could play that gigantic massive epic amount of Nintendo games yes I'll just switch my subscription over to that yep yeah they could easily do that I mean not easily I mean the funny thing about Nintendo is they just like they're slow about stuff they're not very good at like internet forever you know they're not very good at internet things they're not I feel like but I could see them doing it late they'd have to be able to figure it out at some point you know I think they will I mean they have enough money to buy the arts and all the heavens like they just but that's why I said Disney Plus it cuz Netflix has been around and dominating for a long time Jastrow and then prime came in and was around for a long time before Disney Plus actually entered so they could and Nintendo could enter many years late and I still think they would dominate the second they showed up on the scene alright we have time for a handful of Super chats today let's thanks Thomas Jorgenson thanks your average tech what's the average amount of bandwidth you recommend I get for my mind so someone on phone point Chad said Nintendo is a dead horse that needs to be buried no contenders of what dead horse that needs to be buried they're doing fantastic yeah they're doing just fine and honestly the switch is amazing hundred million switches or something like a crazy amount yes which is doing a maze they got their fitness thing back because ring fit is actually doing really well it is apparently like very fun like that you go they figured it out they dropped out on the Wii U they picked it back up again alright I have no idea how much bandwidth you need for your minecraft server it really just depends how many people connect to it but what about dedicated RAM uh-huh what dedicated ram as opposed to much kind of dedicated RAM does he need for his minecraft so you don't understand that reference he didn't ask that I know it's it's a joke don't worry about it multiple people in Chad get it it's fine thanks Petrovsky 2007 thanks James quack what else do you got here big hello from Terrace PC hey hey Manoj Mahendran says since subscribing 2012 for now let's watch the most DVDs we mean most really cool to see your company's growth and the 10 million subscription was in Surrey for Christmas thought about gate-crashing that probably wouldn't be best just throwing that out there uh-huh thank you for not doing that Ricardo says lived in Kamloops in the early 2000s wish I was enjoying the cold day with you guys thank you very much and yeah it's been sort of lame actually it's been a little warm for the last little bit but then I got kind of cold again mostly it's the wet the wet sucks on that on me is in the Pacific Northwest alright brian says car as a service won't work in rural without solutions well yeah they will they will come up with solutions and as always everything worked longer to roll out in rural areas I mean we might need to wait until cars have you know thousand two thousand mile range or whatever the case may be or there might be adapted solutions for rural areas where you know instead of a standard car it's like an extended extended extended range model that's basically you know the entire trunk and and hood is just full of batteries you know whatever the solution is there will be a solution they'll figure it out but you know whatever it is whether we're talking paved roads broadband internet it's always taken longer to roll it always shows up eventually no I'm not talking in my lifetime I'm talking in the amount of time that I have made YouTube videos with the Linus tech tips channel people related to me have lived on farmland that they had to trickle download the videos over like the course of over a day because they're all like dial-up yeah they could watch it how they have broadband it happens all the time all right speaking of happening every time the show has to end eventually every time 60% of the time so thank you guys for tuning in we'll see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel bye wonder if at some point I'm gonna get in trouble for that maybe and that would be an issue because like everywhere yeah I know we'd have to just like show yeah oh wait no I have to stop this one first
