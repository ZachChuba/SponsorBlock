[Applause] [Music] [Music] a couple of months back I made a video about moving from Canon and Fuji to Sony and especially with portrait photography my photography has always been on Canon and I saw a lot of people jump on in the comments and say you've made a massive mistake your portraits are gonna go south sony has awful skin tones and I've done a few shoots with the Sony already and hadn't really noticed an issue but I thought maybe I'm being naive maybe I'm not looking closely enough and I thought we haven't come up with some kind of test so I'm up my friend Vioxx house he's a great photographer I'm gonna link him down below website and Instagram I'm definitely definitely check him out he's a great portrait photographer and he's kindly agreed to help us out because obviously I've got rid of my canon now so I've come over to my ex place he's got a Canon 5d Mark 3 which we're gonna use to do a little bit of a side-by-side comparison and I'm gonna use my Sony a7 3 and we're gonna use the same lens on it so I've what we've done is just use this it's called an MC 11 adapter from Sigma and that just means we can adapt this very very simple Canon 50mm f-14 so we're gonna use the same settings which will be ISO 100 1 over 250th of a second shutter speed and F 2.8 for everything no filters on front of the lenses same lens for both shot the only difference is going to be the sensor on the back and then kindly Radhika's louis uses is a nice home studio so we're gonna use this black background here this light nice little upto box very very simple just one light setup and these great little godox 8600 lights and we're gonna sit same power same settings same lens same subject same background the only difference is going to be the sensor on the back [Music] so brought the images into Photoshop and just so you know all I've done with these images before this is brought them in to capture one I shot the first image with each person with a gray card and I've just color picked the white balance to make sure it's exactly correct on the gray card both cameras were set to flash white balance but every camera is slightly different every flash is slightly different so just to make 100% sure the colors are bang in the middle where they should be on that white balance I use that gray card for the first shot I've kicked them out of capture one into Photoshop now and these are the first of the three images these are the Canon shots again they've been shot with the 5d mark 3 same settings between both cameras and with the 50 mil the can of 50 ml f 1.4 and then these are the three sony shots and i think you can see straight away there is quite a big difference again same lens on this camera I use the Canon 50ml F 1 point for adapted so it's just the sensor that's different it's the same light same setup and there's definitely quite a difference I assumed doing this test actually that there wouldn't be that much of a difference but I think you can see there's definitely a massive difference between them so let's put them side-by-side and I think you can see straightaway what a massive difference there is between those two sensors the Canon let's state the obvious is a lot warmer but I was quite surprised because in my head I've always in having shot Canon for years I assumed it was shifting more towards the red and even the magentas but looking at it there's almost a yellow color cast with whole image even into the shadows that sort of appears on the Canon sensor so it definitely is warm of it it's warmer towards the yellow and if I'm being unkind there's even sort of hints of shifting to green and pushing a little too far to green but a much warmer skin tone on the Canon and the sony is a much cooler skin tone it's almost even a little cyan and some of those highlights if if I'm being unkind to the Sony and you can see it's definitely shifting in more with the pinks and the magentas in the Sony as well so much cooler more magenta on the Sony much warmer yellow on the on the Canon if we jump to the next one and you'll you'll see I've deliberately shot with three different people who are different ethnicity so we can see what this does to different skin types again exactly the same sort of thing that we're looking at the Canon has definitely got a much more yellow shift across the whole image which gives you that that warmer almost glowing skin tone on the Canon which i think is what a lot of people love and why they sort of go with the Canon and the Sony again a lot cooler and a lot more sort of pinky magenta and some of those shifts as well and then let's look at the last one and this is a good one to illustrate this point I think if you look at the forehead on both of these images you can see that the Canon is a lot more forgiving of skin detailer almost and I don't know why this happens I'm not technical enough to understand why this happens but it looks like the way that Canon treats the yellows and oranges and reds in the skintone it's got a very very smooth roll-off so it almost sort of smooths the skin out for you in some senses and you'll hear people say this they'll say that you know the Canon skin tones are beautiful because the role of his lovely and I've heard people sort of criticize the Sony saying that Sony gives you blotchy skin tones but I not sure especially if you look in areas like this compare these two areas here to each other I'm not sure blotchy is the right word I can definitely see that there's more skin detail on the Sony and personally and I mean I've shot with Canon for years but personally I'm really enjoying the fact that there is a lot of skin detail to play with because the way that I shoot I don't necessarily want to throw skin detail away in fact I might want to accentuate it like I did last year were those mental portraits of older men in my life who sort of been mentors to me and I didn't want to hide their age in fact I wanted to to feature it almost so if you are some who wants to do beauty portraits or fashion portraits and you want to make your retouch a lot easier the Canon is probably the way you want to go because it's it's doing some of that work for you beforehand personally the sort of portrait photographer I am I want all this detail and I want to choose to lose it or keep it and I'm quite enjoying how much I have to use but it does mean that my retouch is gonna be more involved and it's gonna take me longer so let's talk about correcting skin tone because sometimes you're gonna take a portrait and the skin tone just doesn't look very natural or it doesn't look quite right so there's a lot of very technical ways you can work this out you can go on and read very complicated formulas for skin tones and download color palettes and charts and gradient maps and all that stuff is great to get into if you have the time but today I'm gonna give you a very very simple formula for how you can roughly check if the skin tone is which should be regardless of ethnicity so let's have a look we've got our C M Y and our K values that's our cyan magenta yellow and blacks we're not going to worry about black it's not really a color it's more of a tonal range and we can ignore it for the for the sake of skin tone cyan is going to be a number and amount a percentage and this will make sense in a second magenta is going to be cyan times 2 so magenta is going to be double the value of cyan and yellow is going to be magenta times by 1.25 so yellow is going to be 1 and 1/4 the value of magenta and if we get that mix between our cyan and magenta and our yellows as skin tones should be roundabout where it needs to be so the first thing I'm going to do is duplicate this background layer and I'm going to come up here to filter blur Gaussian blur and basically what I'm doing is just trying to average even out the skin tones if I didn't do this and I'm trying to pick values in different places on the skin you can see it's hugely different from highlights to shadows and all the detail in between so this just kind of averages everything out a little bit and now if I let my mouse hover over the image and you watch over here in this info panel by the way your info panel if you don't know where it is just get a window come down here make sure you put info panel ticked and it'll appear on the right-hand side but watch this panel here as I hover over different parts of the image you can see those values are changing you've got your RGB values and this is where we're going to live for now there's our CMYK values so you can see if I hover over here on the forehead someone with this good tonal value we've got 27 cyan 67 for magenta and yellow is 81% at the moment so remember we need that formula to work for us so 27 let's have a little look around just in case things change drastically no we look like it looks pretty constant from there so let's go alright 26 60 73 and again because it changes in about we're looking for an average just to get close this making sure that those balances are fairly close and to be honest we're pretty close to good skintone with this 26 60 that probably means that we've got a little too much magenta in so we need to put it back 26 we should be around 52 so let's start there and we're gonna come here we're gonna create as a few different ways to do this but let's do it with curves I'm gonna select my curves layer just to explain to you you see me do contrast videos that's pulling in global contrast we're now gonna start to use channels here so if I go to my red channel if I pull up on the curve I'm gonna be introducing red if I pull down I'm gonna introduce the opposite color which is cyan if I go to my green channel if I push up on the greens I'm gonna be introducing green if I pull down I'm introducing the opposite which is magenta if I come down here to blue if I push up on the blue channel I introduce blue if I pull down that introduces opposite which is yellow so here I know that I want to bring down my magenta which actually means I want to go to my green channel and I want to push in a bit more green I want to balance that magenta out so if I grab this little hand tool here and I click roundabout where I was selecting it's gonna create a point for me on my curve and I'm just gonna push this up slightly just to introduce a little bit of green and pull out a touch of that magenta now if I come back and check yep that's good you can see now it's got a hyphen between those two numbers that's before and after so you can see I brought it down a little bit but I want to do a little bit more it's gone from 69 to 66 if I come back now I'm down to 55 so 27 to 55 is a pretty good mix and I've got my cyan and my magenta pretty much doubled so that's around where I want to be if I look now I want to now make my yellow 1.25 or 1 and 1/4 my magenta because my maths is terrible let's just double-check this so magenta is 55 there let's go to my calculator 55 times by 1.25 is going to give me 68.75 okay so 68 69 that's where I need to be so I can see I've got way too much yellow in the image and we know that from having looked at it early and seen that yellow color cast so what I'm going to do to correct for that yellow is actually come down to my blue Channel again I'm gonna select my little hand tool click over in the same sort of area and I'm gonna grab that point and I'm gonna introduce blue because what that's going to do is take some of that yellow out and balance it a little bit now if I come over back here I am looking fairly good 28 256 56 I can push it a little bit further where it's 78 to 75 has been the jump so far we're down to 73 let's push it a little bit more so we get closer to those early 70s high 60s and that looks like a better skin tone next to me now so if I turn off my blurred layer underneath and I turn off my curves layer you can see I've gone from what was quite a yellowy mix and I've just with those quick Corrections and curves I've now brought in a better mix which feels certainly to my eye and using that formula looks like a more natural skin tone let's do the same thing once more and we're going to use this image out of the Sony just to show you a totally different skin tone you can see the skin tone is also off it's it's cooler it's bluer so we do need to do a little bit of work with it I'm going to move a lot faster this time so let's duplicate that our background layer let's come up here to filter will use the same blur we did before that looks pretty good and as we're hovering over our different areas here we've got 13 for our cyan and then our magenta and we said that this looked a bit pink so this makes sense is 37 and yellow is 41% I'm just going to move it over a little bit over here because it's quite bright in there and I want to make sure there's a lot of color so 15 38 and 42 so 15 I should be about 30 on my magenta not 38 so let's come here and grab another curves layer let's select because I want to play with my magenta value I'm actually gonna go to my green Channel remember pushing in green takes out magenta if I pull it down I'm going to introduce more magenta grab my hand tool and click over in this area I was working on and now I want to bring out some magenta which means I'm going to push up on my green values here and introduce some green into that image and pushed it too far so now because what's happening is as I'm introducing green I'm also messing with that cyan value I have to be careful that I'm balancing the two outs of 17 to 27 I pushed it too far if I pull it back a little bit it should be roughly where I need to be and that looks like 13 to 27 that's good so 13 double it would be 26 I'm roughly in the air and need to be okay now to take care of my yellows I'm gonna cheat again so my magenta value is 27 let's go to my calculator if I take 27 times by 1.25 I know I need to be roughly 33 34 35 somewhere around there for my yellow values and at the moment I'm close to that it's slightly over so I want to pull a little bit of yellow out of the image I'm at 38 at the moment so if I come down to my blue channel that's going to be what affects my yellows if I push in blue I'm gonna take out yellow if I pull down I'd introduce more yellow so again grabbing my little hand tool selecting somewhere around where I need to be I'm gonna push in a bit of blue to correct some of that yellow that's been introduced if I hover over now that's looking better I want it to be about 33 32 33 31 that's looking like a pretty decent mix so if I take this blurred layer off now if I turn off that curves layer that's what it was before you can see that pinky cast and those cooler tones but because I've corrected those skin tones now if I add that kurz they're on top you can see that looks like a slightly more natural skin tone and it's got me closer to what I need to be again if you wanted to check you could just turn on that blur layer and the lease run your eyedropper around and have a look are you roughly within those ratios of cyan and there magenta being double cyan and your yellow being one and a quarter of your magenta value and that looks like a more natural skin tone I'll be honest with you this video is taken a huge left turn initially I was going to make a video talking about the fact that yes I've moved to Sony because it's a right tool especially for video but that I was sad that I've lost those beautiful Canon skin tones and I was gonna teach you in Photoshop how to get from a Sony image to a Canon skin tone in just a few moves in curves but as I've looked at them side by side I can't honestly do that anymore because it's not really how I feel about it I think that these both are great starting points and I even remember when I used to shoot on my Canon and sort of talk about how I love Canon for the skin tone straight out of camera I'd still then bring it into Lightroom and I had edit it I would color tone it in Photoshop and by the time I got to the end of it the colors weren't really Canon colors anymore they were mine anyway I don't actually understand the obsession with straight out of camera with people on line because everyone's saying you know you've got to get that camera with this beautiful color straight out of camera but very few of us are posting images straight out of camera we're not shooting and just posting a Rafa we're all editing to some degree some of us are doing it customs some are throwing on presets but either way when we talk about straight out of camera we can only really talk about it in terms of a starting point to build that edit on this is one of the edits I came up with from this shoot and you can see that it's neither of the colors of the other two it is it's got my colour mix in it it's it's gone I've gone to work on it and produce an image which feels like the sort of work that I do and to be honest I could have got here with either of these other two images personally I got here with the Sony and I'm gonna give you two sides of the same coin here the reason that I'm enjoying editing with the Sony a lot more than I thought even after this comparison is because this to me from my style of where I do want to fine-tune color turning myself and I don't mind going to town and doing all the retouching myself so that extra detail or blotchiness or however you want to put it is information that I can work with and choose to lose or use at the end of the day I've enjoyed this as a very neutral starting point to be able to edit from where I think you should be choosing Canon is if you love this kind of warmer skin tone straight out of camera and you don't want to edit as much and also you're not really much of a retouching you don't want to go in a retouch because it's a pain and you want to take that image just make little tweaks in Lightroom maybe and throw it out Canon is definitely the choice for you if you like that look I will admit that the sony is definitely a cooler look which isn't necessarily where you want to be with your skin tones although it's not unpleasing and I kind of feel like maybe it's a more realistic look under those studio lights but the Canon definitely has a warmth to it that a lot of people love with either of these images if we go to work on them a great starting point so maybe our obsession about which camera has beautiful images straight out the box is not as important as we think com forward slash Sean
