hey gang and welcome back to film director reacts and today we are doing red Velvets Irene episode too called Irene so I guess it's pretty obvious and if you're out there please subscribe so anyways let's check this out and oh by the way this time when I remind you please if there's something that you want to see check out the playlist I know I get a lot of requests some of it is already in the playlist so check those out and action Irene so I know I asked before people I said like I wonder if this is real and a lot of you said that this is a Harper which is beautiful I was actually referring to the color of the sky I wondered if that was real or if they had done that in post-production because it's just this really beautiful pink color and almost doesn't seem real okay so the two of her yep so this is actually a pretty easy effect to do simple anyways in terms of what you do but the way I mean the process but the way you execute it can be very complicated let's see how much of this is like this and then we'll talk about a little bit more in depth let's check this out though it's called cloning it's called cloning in case you didn't hear me say that over the music yeah so that was a really obvious one so what they did here is they shot Irene here and what they're gonna do is it's on a jib the GI arm swings around and then tilts doesn't tilt this way towards this way opposite so comes here tilts up and they just cut cut it like where you don't see her like somewhere here okay so somewhere around here is where they cut the film and cut it to her standing here so that's actually two shots and they just stitched together somewhere in the middle so it's very common like have you seen directors like Andrew - or sometimes you know in true detective season one there was an episode where they had one really long shot which took 15 minutes those shots aren't actually that long they just go over something where they can actually cut it sort of seamlessly where you don't notice it so that's two shots stitched together somewhere over the water where they just kind of really stitch together well [Music] [Music] so with this stuff this is um there's what they're using errors they're using several elements that's not just one thing they're doing they're stitching together many different techniques with this which is actually just beautiful I did an amazing job so one of the techniques they're doing here is cloning again beside you can put two people in one scene tick typically you want to keep the camera very stationary so what you do is you film like Irene here dancing and then you film Irene here dancing [Music] but and then what you do so these are you know she danced it twice obviously and if it was stationary what you do is you keep your camera in one place and she dances once and then you keep the camera in same place and she dances again you just put them on top of each other and you filter through and you're like well you know the just the opacity put a filter blah blah blah it's pretty easy when it comes to actually moving shots like this it becomes much more complicated because you need the exact same shot because you're matching two layers on top of each other so the background look different in one match in order to do this you need to use programs like a programmable jib which is moving in the same way so as an example so the tilt here that might have been done in post I'll explain in a second so that movement there wasn't under post I mean that movement there was what we talked about earlier where you actually she goes off screen and then right in here where you don't see anyone this is where they cut and then you see her there so that's not an example so let's go a little more so this shot were they're moving like this that is actually a jib shot you know it's actually there's a shot that's like this in order to take this shot what they have to do is they have to program it so it moves the exact same way at the exact same time and take the same shot twice once with her in this position and once with her in that position the key is that shot has to be moving the exact same way both times and orders to compose the background correctly you do that with programming and what they're doing is they're taking that and then they're stitching together other shots with that so it's it's one movement they're doing and then they're probably stitching together another movement so they're combining a lot of elements together to make it look like one continuous shot which it isn't and this right here is probably all green-screen at this point because the lighting is a little bit off [Music] [Music] you know the light and see there's little so there should be top lighting here from the back getting from the back and there's a little on her shoulder but the leg does look a little off so I think that looks a lot like green screen [Music] yeah so see she's frontlet here like there's a light right there but that light is not hitting her there and yeah that's really green screen because the light is really off on it so you can even just tell you see the how the lights off [Music] even kind of looks a little fuzzy especially right there around her hair that doesn't look yeah it's all keyed up they look fuzzy was just a very hard cut it's very hard to get that exact so again these are all just and I want to talk a little bit more about what they did to cover this up beautiful beautifully technically so let's go back check it out guys so what I want you to see here is just the combination of techniques oh yeah they they crossed over one place you know and then cut to somewhere else so that's where the cut was they also used a technique where they used a moving jib or dolly but it was programmed so that moved the exact same way twice in that way that when she danced and the camera moved it worked that way both times so it could be superimposed correctly but they did that many many many many times incrementally and then they stitch those together and that's how that worked also there's an what they did to kind of cover it up and create more so see all this moving in and out Vanessa here see that's beautiful work I mean so that I believe is so that is just a program move and then they did that shot twice [Music] so you see those push ins and push outside you see that cut there see that cut there yeah that was really sloppy Wow okay um you guys saw that right so what they're doing is like they're creating energy also by kind of covering up like the way that those are that these are stitched together with sort of a very smooth camera in post-production you can create sort of a shaky movement and somebody else is also pushing in and pulling out really quickly in post-production that wasn't done in camera while shooting this because that would mess up the ability to clone and the way these are cloned so what they did is somebody very lovingly and painstakingly in post-production created sort of a jittery effect and also pushing in and out really quickly once these are already cloned together and I even it must been tough to take this because you know the sky you only this guy that looks like this is you only have that for like 20 minutes and so this guy had to be filming really quickly and these clouds constantly move and so what's been really difficult cutaway yeah so they're stitching the other elements so like I said there's the cloning and then there's the stitching right here there's no more cloning and now they're cutting and then coming back to her there so they're combining many different elements together in the same thing when they pushed in here there that's another place they cut so they're looking for places to cut away they're in there like so as you're filming you're looking at places where you can cut and you're like oh we'll take this shot we're taking this shot where can we cut the shot and so specifically there is place to cut the shot that movement there I don't think is in camera I think that is again in post-production that somebody actually so what they could have done is they could have shot it a little bit wider and then punched in a little bit and made that effect in post-production by looking like it's moving because that would have been very difficult to match with the cloning because you need something very smooth because of the background that is that's in camera it's a jet tilt but that that wasn't in camera well they might have done it slow that was effect afterwards [Music] in there you see where you can cut again so you're always looking for working cut and there you can cut so great job this is a amazing blend of different techniques that they used they really stitched together a lot of techniques very seamlessly and then they created a way to kind of mask those techniques by creating a lot of deuteron jitteriness in the camera so it was a way of distraction it also created they created energy but also distracted you from maybe the way that the overlays might have looked when they did it so very very well done very painstaking especially in the post-production process after they had already masked everything and composited and cloned everything together to go in and add all the jitteriness and all the push quick push ins and push outs and all that stuff it took a lot of time to do that turned out really really well it was very very creative haven't really seen a lot of cloning recently and they did it just fantastic hey that's job doing it so I mean good job although I don't know as I read you did it Irene's team good freaking job and for it's called I ring the song called her ring is called Irene is that what she's saying in the course I'm gonna call my channel Paul now what do you think of that anyways guys for this episode that's right
