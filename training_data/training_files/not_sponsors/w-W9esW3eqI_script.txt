this is really smooth that was really good that's basically how I would have stopped hey everyone welcome back to SAS Tesla in this video I am taking a Model 3 on autopilot through downtown Saskatoon using the brand new stoplight detection update I'm gonna see what happens we'll see how far we can make it stick around okay so here we go we're headed into downtown Saskatoon we're gonna put on autopilot so you can see it slowed me down right 250 because with this stoplight stop sign update you cannot go faster than the speed limit so it's asking me to confirm so I'm going to confirm looks good green light car's gonna go through so my feet I'm kind of hovering on the brake and the gas right now but I'm not touching the brake of the gas I'm not touching the steering wheel I do want to hover on the steering wheel keep my hands on there for safety obviously but we're coming up to this red light and cars hand this is really smooth that was really good that's basically how I would have stopped at a red light okay coming up behind motorcycle cool car sees it's a motorcycle green I don't weigh there we go I'm not touching anything this is amazing yellow light cars gonna stop this is so smooth very impressive confirm for green and away we go another red light cars automatically stopping for hello aggressive in the end but you know it's pulling up it seems like the right spot I'm about a meter away from the line it's not too far back not too far forward cars doing a really good job of finding that right spot to stop that's got to pay attention though because as soon as this turns green I don't confirm there we go green and we're away seize the next lights okay so autopilot does not do turns yet so I'm gonna take over at this point and we are gonna do this turn we'll put it immediately back into autopilot super smooth look at that car see some people even got the walking animations looks like they're doing a bit of a dance on the street but it's good to see the car sees them and what's interesting about these these roads is there is a dotted line on the left but there's nothing on the right and you also see there's a lot of strong shadows and things happening to your - so this is pretty impressive how the cars handling this mark that that's a good light to go through guys on bikes the car actually saw that I just pressed the gas to make it keep going okay so this is gonna fail because this is not marked properly but this Lane actually goes left here [Music] and put it back into autopilot restricted to 50 I think people usually do 55 on this bridge but it's not too bad okay that was really impressive what happened back there the car actually saw the biker coming across the street with a trajectory that was going to cross the lane so it wasn't breaking because I don't think it was breaking because of the navigate hitting seeing the red light well what's it doing here Oh probably that shadow wanted to slow down a bit yeah I'll confirm it's good to go cars gonna go it's having a hard time it's really struggling oh there we go it's going now it had to think really hard about that corner these shadows I think are really throwing it off Oh yellow light I confirmed a bit late so it slowed down and then it turned yellow so it's pretty good that's how I would have handled that light a lot of people you'll see we're this is how Saskatchewan is going I think we've only got five active cases or something in Saskatchewan if kovat 19 just about no-one here is wearing masks everyone is doing the social distancing thing pretty good you know no no big groups but very few people are wearing masks I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing I personally have been wearing masks when I go into you know stores and no cars really slowing again for the shadow oh no that's the light man I forget that I've got to confirm so this next slide yeah good to go through okay so it's not the shadows it's it's the light I'm okay we're gonna go left here and I gotta get over into the left lane so I'll just disable pilot as we do this we'll take the turn and there we go so this is a good example you can see the right side of the lane is really dancing around but the car is going a pretty good job of staying nice and even and pinned mostly to the left side of the lane but I find that some there's a lot of lanes in Saskatchewan that are like this where it has a clear left marking but on the right side it's really nebulous you know sometimes there's an extra shoulder or it goes kind of fades into grass and I find the car has a hard time seat right there and wants me to really keep my hands on the wheel because it's not totally sure where the lane ends and begins so here we're gonna get some lines and the car be nice and happy see that line straightens right out it's feeling much more confident about where the road is so give it a green well here we go oh and there is some construction up ahead - we're gonna see how the car handles that I am really curious the only thing is a speed limiter restriction I understand completely why Tesla wants to keep it restricted right now but even another five kilometers an hour hour faster okay so there's a karna left me I'm gonna signal left let's see what the car does here are we gonna completely fail and hit this yet we're given totally in the barrier so car did not handle that well at all had to take over put her back in so here's a good example of what the recent update does the lights gonna turn green I won't have to confirm to go forward look at that the card even started inching forward before the other cars ahead moved that's new I haven't experienced that before often when you're behind a car it takes a really long even an extra long slightly uncomfortably a long time for the test let's start moving when the cars ahead of you start moving I'm always like pressing on the gas but come on car let's go that time the Model 3 actually started pulling ahead as the light was green even before the car had and he pulled ahead that was really interesting ok so there's no way the car's gonna handle this because of the lane markings I'm gonna have to take over it would have just not handled that I'm curious I mean get back in the autopilot now that were in this construction zone yet there we go beautiful it's really cool is all of these want to say cones or not cones these markers it sees them on the display whoa that was a green light I needed to confirm no there's a car ahead of me stopping for traffic control and hundred stopping for track this seems to be a glitch there's a car ahead of me yet it needs me to confirm and just back there kind of slammed on the brakes traffic control I know why it's because we're on the left side and it's seeing lights on the right that's totally what's going on okay I am I'm gonna let the car holy smokes it actually did half turn there that was interesting definitely what crashed had to take over we're gonna put her back on we're gonna get the right lane so that I a slower car going right slower traffic stays right the first set to go for the second set there you go well there you have it that's what it's like to use the new update with stoplight recognition overall I am so impressed yes there was a whole bunch of edge cases where the car failed and would have slammed into some construction cones that obviously needs to be worked out but the fundamentals of the car recognizing traffic lights seeing them seeing the stop line handling all of that it's really really good it's really smooth the deceleration the braking everything is just fantastic I'm super impressed with this update there we have it so I'm gonna be making some videos as I've got some time for it specifically about the experience of having an electric car in Saskatchewan in Saskatoon in the Canadian white north if you have any suggestions or questions that you want to get answered about what it's like having a Tesla in Saskatchewan in Canada drop it in the comments below will be good reason for me to make the next video and try and answer some of your questions so thank you very much for watching
