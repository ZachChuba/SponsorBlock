at curiosity stream comm slash vector I'm pitting the iPhone 11 up against the pixel 4 in a camera to camera video to video shoot out I'm Rene Ricci and this is vector the pixel 4 can shoot up to 4k video at 30 frames per second 1080p video at 30 60 or 120 frames per second but no slow motion up to 240 frames per second for that you need to drop down to 720p and there are a couple other very obvious omissions here as well first there's no 24 frame per second mode not at any resolution now 24 frames per second isn't science or anything like that it's just tradition back in the day movie makers found that anything less than 24 frames per second just didn't fool your brain into thinking it was seeing smooth steady motion and anything more than that was technologically and financially just too expensive to justify so because most of us have grown up seeing cinema in 24 frames per second our brains have come to identify that as looking cinematic and 30 frames per second well more like TV even now even in the age of ultra high frame rates people still want to shoot in 24 frames per second to capture that cinematic feel the way I've always shot this channel for example in 24 frames per second and the pixel Ford just won't do that sure you can change it in post but that's an extra step and an interpolation which is never as good as just capturing it that way to begin with now whether you personally care about that or not let me know in the comments second is the lack of 4k 60 frames per second yeah the exact opposite problem videographers want 4k because we either want a post video in 4k or we want to be able to crop and move around and render out in extra-crispy 1080p we also want 60 frames per second for either silky smooth motion or to have extra frames so we can reduce it down in post and have extra silky smooth slow-motion b-roll and the pixel for again just won't do it in fact Google is 4k last on the pixel for spec page 1080p first 720p second and 4k dead last which is kind of a wicked obvious way to make it look like the exact opposite of a prior as well and for the company that also owns YouTube and hosts more 4k 60 frames per second video than anyone else in the world not being able to generate any of it themselves is just bizarre they set stuff like they're still concentrating on 1080p since that's what most people use or that 4k 60 is just too large for the storage but since the pixel starts at $7.99 for 64 gigabytes and goes up to $8.99 for 128 gigabytes compared to the iPhone 11 that starts at $6.99 for 64 gigabytes but only goes up to 749 for 128 gigabytes and also has an option for 256 gigabytes for 849 something like pixel just doesn't offer at any price that's a problem entirely of Google's own making other Android phones including Samsung using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset and universal flash storage or ufs 2.1 don't seem to have any problem doing 4k 60 at all so it sounds like Google just can't currently get their electronic image stabilization and image fusing HDR algorithms to handle 4k video streams at 60 frames per second and they won't do it until they can which will require better silicon better algorithms or simply better willingness to get it done I honestly don't know which not a clue the iPhone has been doing 4k 60 frames per second since the 10 in 2017 the 10s in 2018 added interleaved extended dynamic range at 30 frames per second and now the iPhone 11 in 2019 can do EDR at the full 60 frames per second along with electronic stabilization again that may or may not matter to you so let me know in the comments the iPhone 11 can also do 4k at 24 frames per second but strangely not 1080p or 720p at 24 frames per second those are locked to 30 or 60 fps unless you're in low-light in which case they can be set to automatically drop to 24 frames per second for better capture quality the iPhone 11 like the 10s can also record stereo audio slow-motion is 1080p 120 or 240 frames per second no 720p slow-motion anymore at all though but all for $100 less than the 64 gigabyte version of the pixel 4 and 150 dollars less than 100 gigabyte version even the 256 gigabyte iPhone 11 is $50 less than 128 gigabyte pixel 4 and if you want to spend the money or you're a videographer billing it out to clients you can go all the way up to the iPhone 11 Pro and up to 512 gigabytes for thirteen hundred and forty-nine dollars both the pixel 4 and the iPhone 11 can record in h.264 or h.265 for higher efficiency files albeit ones older software may not play as nicely with it's also interesting that Google is willing to support h.265 or HEV C for recording when they're not so willing at all to support it for YouTube playback for example to allow 4k playback on the Apple TV Google probably just feels like they have more leverage with YouTube than they do with video editing software go figure either way both produce really good video the iPhone 11 just gives you options Google won't or can't at least for now both Google and Apple made very different choices when it comes to the secondary cameras on the pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Google opted for a telephoto which plays to their strengths in computational zoom Apple opted for an ultra wide angle which is quote-unquote more fun but also lets you capture not just a more expansive frame but an entirely different perspective the 2016 iPhone 7 through the 2018 iPhone 10s all had secondary telephoto cameras just like the pixel 4 does now and I like them and still liked them a lot if you have enough light you can get a really nice natural depth of field right off the camera I'm really enjoying the ultra wide-angle on the iPhone 11 though sure some people will tell you that you can just sneakers oome in or out to get closer or wider shots but you can't not really sometimes there are obstacles or hazards in the way all times the different cameras give you different looks that's why different lenses exist including and especially on high-end cameras which one is the better choice telephoto or ultra wide-angle will come down to personal preference you can and both cameras do especially in low-light computationally emulate telephoto you can't do that with ultra wide-angle because there's just no data for it so technically the ultra wide-angle again just gives you more options that includes capture outside frame which lets Apple use data from the ultra-wide to better track and stabilize the wide quick video without having to crop in for example having more options is what I really care about so that's why my favorite here is the iPhone 11 Pro which like many other Android cameras gives you all three wide telephoto and ultra wide so you don't have to choose between them you just have to choose the right one in the moment drop a comment and let me know what options you care about neither does night mode for video yet but both use their image processors to get as much extended dynamic range as possible neither of them let you do portrait mode for video some other Android phones offer the option but it's not really ready for primetime yet and for actual video depth of field that's where big lenses on dedicated cameras still win the pixel for front-facing camera is 1080p 30 frames per second the iPhone 11 front-facing camera is 4k at 24 30 or 60 frames per second or 1080p at 30 or 60 frames per second it can also do slow-motion at 1080p 120 frames per second yeah slow fees in other words optically at least the iPhone 11 can shoot a higher-end video on its front selfie camera than the pixel 4 can on its main rear camera something pointed out with panache by Jonathan Morrison in his pixel 4 video shot on iphone 11 selfie cam again they both produce really good video but stop me if you already know what I'm gonna say having really good options is better than not having those really good thanks to all of you for supporting the show so pixel 4 vs. iPhone 11 video for casual users they're both great great color great stability at the end of the day though Apple just offers more good options for video and that means whether you're just shooting video of your kids or friends or pets and want them as future proof as possible or if you're a professional and want to shoot post or just edit from 24 frames per second to 60 frames per second the iPhone 11 is the one to get at least that's what I think now I'd love to know what you think so hit like if you do hit subscribe if you haven't already plant that Bell gizmos on YouTube will actually tell you when the next show goes live and then hit up the comments and let me know thanks for watching see you next video
