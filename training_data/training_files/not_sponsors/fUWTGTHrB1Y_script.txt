even though it looks like the camera was trying to film Big Foot rather than a robbery anyway for gang members got out of the helicopter and armed with sledgehammers and bombs they smashed and blasted their way through the skylights on the roof and roped themselves down into the building's Lobby reports of some machine gun firing inside were made and the robbers used more explosives to blast their way through into the building's vault as you can see in this video the thieves came pretty prepared with buzzsaws to hack their way into the cash cages they just began helping themselves to literal bags of money before deciding to depart back up to the helicopter using a stolen helicopter to land on top of one of the biggest cash reserves of a major city and using machine guns and bombs to blast your way in is the most guaranteed way to earn yourself a GTA 5 stars in real life but the thieves knew that they knew this would attract basically the entire wrath of the country of Sweden so just prior to the robbery some accomplices laid out metal caltrops on all the roads connecting to the building which prevented any police cars from getting anywhere close but why didn't the police have just use their own helicopters then to intercept them in the air well they thought about that too insulted in both the dumbest and the smartest way possible they stole the helicopter from a police base and then they just put an empty bag at the entrance of the hangar that just said the word bomb on it the police took it seriously enough that they weren't able to scramble their own helicopters to intercept the thieves in time so no helicopters 20 minutes after they first landed the thieves loaded their new cache aboard their stolen chopper and took off without the police ever once entering the building the Swedish government has never publicly confirmed exactly how much money was stolen but speculation ranges anywhere between 5 million u.s. dollars equivalent on the low end up to multiple hundreds of millions of US dollars equivalent on the high end we may never know the true amount and the thieves completely got away with a crime for exactly one or two days just 2 hours and 40 minutes after they left with the money the helicopter was discovered in the woods just 30 kilometers to the north of Stockholm just two days after the heist one of the men responsible was caught fleeing to the Dominican Republic where he was apprehended by the local police and extradited immediately on a chartered plane back to Stockholm to face trial another man attempted to flee to the Canary Islands where he was met right out of the gate by the special services arm of the Swedish police in total over the next year 7 men were arrested and sentenced by the Swedish government for their roles in the robbery while nobody was physically hurt they had stolen an unbelievable amount of money through violence the pilot of the helicopter received seven years for his role in the crime one of the men who entered the vault also received seven years as well two organizers who helped the bandits procure explosives and SIM cards each received five years while a Serbian man accused of being the heist mastermind received three years a man who falsified an alibi for the missing helicopter on the base about two years and the man charged with hiring the pilot for the job it received just one year behind bars now obviously at least four men were caught on camera of robbing the actual inside of the vault and only one or two of them if you count the pilots have ever been arrested and sentenced for anything which means at least two other dudes are out there still free and unknown it is widely believed that most of the money stolen has never been recovered to date which means that it was maybe in the hands of the men who were never caught the entire time we and Sweden might never figure that out and meanwhile all of the men who actually were sentenced for the highest have since been released back into society if the other unknown men were just holding on to that money the whole time for them waiting it would it be worth it to sit in jail for five or seven years and then leave a millionaire the total value of the money stolen ten years ago remains mysterious but it is known that the Swedish government announced a warning that ATMs in Stockholm may run out of money in the days immediately following the heist so it can be gathered that enough money was stolen that a major European city almost ran out of cash at least for a little while so if these bad guys fought so
