of wait there's this time there's this tiny game okay that's out right now that like a small group of people have been talking about and it's called just a few yeah it's called like the oh my god it's like wow or something yeah like wow where did my time go yeah otherwise known as wow what did that what am i doing with my life um yes i'm currently investing some time into wow wow and i i wow yeah i the time just disappears right i've never seen uh such technology before where it just feels like you teleport forward in time uh like time machines they say they weren't built but i feel like i'm experiencing the first technological advancement of them oh my goodness and you got and you and a few people are the first test subjects of this technology your question was do i have friends yes oh yes um yeah of course okay i i will prove you i want to show you something okay is that your friend oh there um we we had a party we had a party wow yeah and they're just on the floor like that yeah they just uh sleepover you guys were you guys were hating the drinks hard last night oh we don't we don't drink we just slap her out oh look at that more friends see i have a ton of friends they just you know they just like to hang out real close sometimes your dad is batman please please please please keep it on the down low okay yeah i will can you give me a moment i'm having a book i have this weird bug where i vibrate do you see this that looks kind of fun you know you can take a moment hold on i gotta i gotta fix this it's just it's really annoying bug i don't know why it happens okay hold on hold on i haven't fixed it yet okay there we go now now we're good now migo isn't going bur so um why are you very uh uh yes see-through or like a very uh uh uh blank right now like your features seem to be my pictures uh yes you're very uh lovely is what i meant to say sorry lovely my my chat says that like this form so this is a ghost form i am a ghost because you saw how they nuked me right oh yeah so they killed me so um i'm like a ghost form and the way to revive me is by democracy or democracy yeah you might not know what that is because you're from north korea but democracy is when people choose to you know people vote on things for you know for things to happen you know and through democracy they can heal me or they can heal me by paying me 999 that seems a little inefficient they like this form oh yeah they keep telling me that it accentuates my personality i've been told that a lot too oh you're back yes oh and this is how they make me dance randomly throughout the interview because they think it's funny oh oh you also think it's funny i think it's kind of funny it's actually not that funny because you know have you ever been you know made forced to dance without your will against your will i you know [Music] me no never never in my life it's not it's not the best feeling i don't know but does my head look a little bigger to you bigger no it looks perfect the way it is it's like i thought my head was smaller i thought it was more like one fourth of the screen you know and now it feels like it's like half of the screen you don't see it you don't see it i i understand completely i've been told that as you you interact with smarter people your brain expands so so i can it's it's scientifically proven actually which is why it may seem like your your head is bigger so me talking to you has caused my brain to become bigger oh i'm in chat oh crap [Music] hmm okay oh i see you have a one-to-one resemblance as well right it's um oh one second it's reloading everything must reload my world must reload and i'm back look at this i'm all fresh and new you're perfect i know i just got reloaded does that ever happen to you where does that ever happen to you where you just like explode and you die i need to reload only in my dreams oh i see of becoming a first-person shooter pro player right yeah yeah yeah so tell me more about your prison cell why don't you have anything up on your walls so when i first moved in which was a couple days ago wait you just wait you just became jailed yes oh my god long story short i can't divulge what happened but uh they let me decorate it because they were just like you know the taxpayer just gave us too much money so you can just do whatever you want with it so they gave me like a lot of cool stuff here let me go show you some stuff that they gave me show me wow what he's not [Music] all right i might have slammed my pc and my desk there oh is it broken i hope not but uh i like a couple things and i think what happens is and this happens a lot when i go to prison yeah i don't i like when you're setting up your cell and you get 80 of the way there and it's fully functional yeah um the the next 20 is difficult like i have a bunch of stuff i need to hang up on the walls i have some nightstands i need to buy i have a little bit a few boxes left but um everything is it's fine it's fine that i don't do any of that but it just looks a little a little bad what do you what do you mean it looks a little too much like a jail cell you know you're supposed to be a little bit homey well so you just so you're saying that you have you you want you go through 80 percent right yes and the last 20 percent i just little lazy what can i say i know you have trouble finishing i get it like i have trouble as well like just following through at the at the last [Music] minute and the last sec the last twenty percent when you have to fully commit and follow through you just you can't you can't do it you can't do it sometimes it just just doesn't work you know yeah or you just finish sooner than you want to and you just you just left with the 80 and it just happens a lot and what can you what can you say it's like a personality trait at this point yeah same i relate to you a lot in this world of warcraft yes that's going to take up your entire time from now on what's going on yes when you asked me for an interview time and you gave me all these dates i immediately looked at the dates past tuesday and kind of x them off in my brain because they don't exist i need i need those days to play world of warcraft with my friends it's just going to be a void wait you have friends um a couple i i pay them to stick around you know and that's nice and so threaten them oh yeah that works too mr scara you just wave this knife around like this and for some reason they just happen to stay well i only have like a nail clipper you know what that won't work god is threatening you go up to your friend and you're like you know what you mother if you don't play me well right now i want to go clip every single one of your toes oh and eat them [Music] like what if they're into that the nails you know the nails like yeah what if they're into that oh oh oh yeah my mother not my friends oh my mother and my people do you think i'm a friend of mine mr scarf sorry bond servants you know i keep them in my wardrobe look listen i i'm a very generous streamer you know i not only give them a wardrobe i've also given them pee bottles oh yeah it's part of their health benefit and you have health benefits for your mods yeah i hope my mods never see this i will never give them benefits i don't know i know but like you know i i don't necessarily want them to suffocate you know inside the wardrobe either so i poke holes but i only poke one hole though because it gives me slight joy to see them suffocate a little bit slight joy yeah so mr scott how long have you been wanting to be a streamer for how long have you had this dream and how long probably 15 years and i've just never been able to cut it [Music] uh don't worry don't worry as some of my friends say i pay them and they say they call me a young my friend especially yeah yeah yeah i'm not old i'm a young a young buddha buck [ __ ] like a butt oh a bunch oh i see oh i thought they said young buddha that wouldn't make any sense you're a bambi didn't bambi die at the end no no no no his mom died oh yeah they were eating grass together and then like this mean hunter came back out with a rifle and was like boom boom and then they started running and then the mom dies in front of him and her blood is seen in the grass good movie i usually don't look up if you know look up you know my guests parents does that because you don't no that'd be kind of creepy you know i usually just look up their social security number their credit card information their phone number their ad their facebook yeah their facebook their instagram you know their exes you know their past lovers or you know gay lovers they're you know when they were experimenting in that bar and they met this man named john and then they you know went a little too far um yeah i don't have any i don't have that last part just letting you know that that doesn't exist i know i know no i'm serious it doesn't make sense i know do you get it because you're safe with me that's mascara don't worry don't worry okay yeah you never told me an end time for this interview you just said be there at 12 30. it's usually around an hour okay yeah i i knew that but i might push it to 1 30 an hour and 30 minutes an hour and 30 minutes where are you going mr scara what's where are you going oh are they like is it prison break time did the guards want something yeah yeah the guard wanted something were you getting he actually wanted this he wanted a signature it was crazy oh really yeah yeah why would you want a signature from a tiny streamer i mean no because he said i needed the signature of someone who's talked to the famous miko and i was like oh i'm sure just rolling for him right there it was crazy how long has it been since you've seen the woman just think about it every girl uses me as a way to get closer to pokey it's actually ridiculous think about it what was your question again i have adhd i forgot great i remember now i was sniffing your clothes and then you liked that and then i was like how long have has it been since you've seen a woman because liking a woman sniffing your clothes is a little weird scarra [Music] the implication no no no you are jumping from one thing to another okay you like you just because i didn't say anything when you said you were gonna sniff my clothes doesn't mean that i liked it okay it just meant you know what maybe she loves it okay and i i can't say no because or else i can't be i have to be accepting of everything okay that's a good point there you gonna meet fish girl i did not appreciate the talk of my cousins through sashimi my cousins signed up for eating these are not food they're friends hi mr scara oh hi i died how did you know i clowns i mean the clowns yeah what the [ __ ] because i researched about you i know everything about you i know your family history i know your address i know your phone numbers you like clowns because they make you laugh right yeah do you want to hear a joke yes knock knock who's there can you give me a moment knock knock who's there broccoli broccoli who broccoli doesn't have a last name silly yeah it does it does yeah you've never heard of it what what is that rock broccoli these nuts this is the funniest song i've ever seen thank you oh my god did you see this is the funniest clown you've ever seen thank you i really appreciate that do you want more yeah sure okay okay okay 115 plus best prison check oh this could be a good one all right all right okay oh the joke may contain profanity oh i don't know if we allow that on this my cousin okay okay i got i got one you ready you ready yeah my cousin who stutters was sentenced to six months in prison that was two years ago he still hasn't finished his sentence what's in that bottle um so that over here it says um water not oh hell out this way this way not vodka oh so what is vodka no it's water i literally just told you it's water yeah so it's like one of those like it's water like technician says that all the time on our stream it's water i haven't i don't drink anything but water look watch this do you want to see something scarra yes i would like to see what you got hold on this is also water let me just wow water well it just there's a lot of force in that water water fixes your problems i agree water fixes our problems no no i'm serious yeah i know look at me look me in the eyes okay okay okay i will look you in the eyes i will do it [Music] yeah yeah water is good for you a lot is good for you you know that's as close as we're gonna get yeah daddy yeah so why did you stop playing league of legends you know i think that the human mind is was built in a way that you cannot do the same thing every day for for years you look for more you know you aspire for for greatness i agree um yes yes so it's like some days you just feel like you want to do more you know one day your view the other day you want to be a clown or a fish um or funny what this one is oh that's your your job no well no uh this is my church outfit is that like after hours church or like on sunday on god obviously no church oh okay yeah a sunday no capture just right right this is what i wear to bring people to the chat to the holiness of god you know and sister yes do you like here to pray to the to the lord do you have i am so happy that i'm blessing you with my holy that your sins are forgiven i am watching you dear scara are you still not part of offline tv are you part of offline tv yeah even in jail yeah wow so how are you why do you ask well here's the thing yeah okay so i'm i see i'm pretty cultured but i'm actually really not cultured okay i know there are several streamers who are part of offline tv but i don't understand how it actually works what is it is it like a okay okay okay here let me let me let me show you have you uh have you ever watched uh uh movies before yeah movies with a lot of nuns in it the classics you know yeah yeah yeah yeah they're classics and they you know they just the ones without the couches it's just the ones where people watch at theaters where they get stuck [Music] one of those movies uh that is the godfather and that's kind of how tv operates so wait you're a bunch of mafia no no no no no no no no no yeah you guys were pretend to be streamers [Music] family a family and when the family needs something [Music] it's a favor and you know if the family gives a favor to you you have to give a favor back because they're family that's how prison works as well none of them the family works you know it's like reciprocity you know and if you don't give back the favor if you don't remember well then maybe you'll remember a little bit better once we talk to you once we explain [Music] in five years where do you want to be i know i know i know i know i don't care okay every time i get asked i have taken a lot of interviews over the course of my career well this is my interview this is my hangout a lot of friend questions like this and specifically where do you expect to be in five to ten years from now and every time someone asks that question i always respond the same exact way and that's happy oh so wholesome but i'm starting to think maybe i should respond with it differently because it feels like such a lame answer like everyone wants to be happy so like i don't know uh you know what let's just hypothetical future in the future five years from now just say a couple i'll say a couple words and it's not gonna be a full sentence but you can kind of get the picture okay yeah uh private island strippers death star how does that sound okay private island yes strippers will talk about it and death star sounds a little ambitious why do you move around so much uh you know what i said i like to to human beings weren't meant to not go upwards i like to move to a better one every year this one's my nicest one you know i agree with that i 100 agree with that yeah yeah everyone asks me why do you move so much and i'm like why not if i want if i if i want a better place i could just move for a better place i i die from stagnation it's a good and bad thing right because if you always keep going up it's hard to really appreciate the flowers this is scary and you're single yes yes let's get married let's get married you're a man you are single and you [Music] let's get married [Music] guys this is my d4 floor but look this is my dobby form oh you'll never be boring with me i have all sorts okay and then also look at this if you're into more of a wait here here let me let me uh let me change more uh what what kind of hello is this working yeah see see that no yeah you can have different types of men different name yeah this one this one is called mike thunderclock mike thundercat oh okay if you want to experiment with mike thunderclock my thundercock is here and then look watch this this one is called sparkler i a little too sharp [Music] yeah a little too sharp okay and then this one is my favorite this one is pencil you want to see because it's got a tiny hat you see that i'm starting to see how your forms are you know usually the male fantasy is something different but i i can see i can see some people liking this right i can see a lot of people liking this chad made this for me you know i've got a character screen where you morph me like you know you see that so chad decided to create this for me and i think that they created just for you i'm just curious how do you feel about prenups rabbits prenups oh i burn them i throw them into the fire [Music] look at my big spidery sword what about prenups what'd you say something about [Music] you know you know maybe what can we have pokemate as our flower girl you know she's she's not doing anything else right now really can she be my dad as well can she walk me down dad yes can she walk me down the aisle that's gonna be tough to do both but you know what i'm sure we can make it happen can she also be my husband [Music] i mean yeah i mean yeah i guess i guess we can make that happen too oh my god i mean you're great and everything but like let's be real you know like it happened again the fifth one is always i swear to god no every girl uses me as a way to get closer to pokey it's actually ridiculous [Music] and i understand god damn i understand i mean but it happened again i really thought this was different listen pokey has that manly power you know what i'm saying i like how you just didn't say no you just went you were like yes and i you know what she's got that command that's why i think we'd be perfect for each other we have a question i may have an answer not single you got me i'm not single single holy [ __ ] how do you know there's no way because you're mr scara i was just kidding this whole time i know who you are you're not a small streamer chad i have a surprise for you he is actually a big big big pro player inside he was inside the league scene now he's from offline tv he's a huge streamer on the twitch channel yeah that's right yeah i know he is a massive stream yeah i i fooled you all it's true but this is the scara i wasn't kidding this wasn't the fake scare this was the scare and he's actually i know but he is still in prison for tax evasion but that's okay he's he's working it out and he is still north korean

desperate but you know what that's okay he's working it out in all this is this is the scara the legend all right mr scara i have tried to become friends with you how do you think i did up until pokey cucked me again it was pretty good once we got to that part you know here is here's something that you don't know mr scara what pokey slid into my dms what's new you know life is my life it's like a comedy sketch just happens every time i can't believe she got away with it again it just always happens but mr scara i have to say to the great pokeman the great beautiful pokemon the goddess you know
