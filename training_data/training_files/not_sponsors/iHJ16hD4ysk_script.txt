what Ram you choose can have a profound effect on the performance of your new gaming PC but because memory isn't as Sexiest CPUs or graphics cards it often gets overlooked well not today behind me courtesy of g.skill is 11 kits of dual channel ddr3 and with it we intend to arm you guys with all the information that you need to choose the best option for your new 3rd gen AMD Rison system what's going in and out of offer code Linus to get 25% off at the link in the video description [Music] AMD's news n2 course have twice as much onboard high-speed cache which keeps them fed with data much more efficiently than before which is great but the thing is all of that cash still has to pull data from somewhere which means that we still need fast system memory now third gen Rison increases the stock supported memory speed all the way up to a whopping thirty two hundred megahertz that means but not only can you count on that speed being a good fit for the platform you can also count on being able to achieve much higher speeds than you previously could and that's even without the best RAM chips that money can buy and a degree in overclocking from the University of oh my god I'm so bored when will this end so that sounds great just buy the fastest cheapest trend you can find and run that is what I might say if it weren't for the close relationship between memory bandwidth and the high speed interconnect between rise and CPU cores called the Infinity fabric now this generation AMD has opened up some new and interesting options by allowing users to decouple the Infinity fabric clock from the memory clock so from stock speed around 3200 up until around ddr4 3600 which most people should be able to hit you'll be at what a.m. do you refers to as one to one that is to say both the memory and the Infinity fabric share the same input clock and run in sync just like last gen but it's also possible to crank your ram speeds much higher than you otherwise could by abandoning that one to one ratio so that needs to be investigated because higher memory speeds should yield an increase in RAW throughput but they could also cost you dearly because of the extra latency that is introduced due to the unsynchronized clocks making matters even more complicated you can also go the other way and crank your Infinity fabric clock even if you have slower memory modules that can't keep up then you can try to make up some of that latency penalty by tightening up your round timings so we began our journey by making some educated guesses first because the Infinity fabric is known to reliably hit 1800 megahertz investing in a ddr4 3600 kit and running that at one to one should be a pretty safe bet and then the lower the rated Layton sees the better the overall performance in theory second there's probably a higher tier of performance to be had by decoupling the Infinity fabric and the memory speeds if you're willing to put in the work because otherwise why in the devil would AMD have put the engineering resources into making that an option many questions still remain them so to answer them we gathered our giant pile of g.skill Trident II memory high speed low latency kits high latency low speed kits and then everything in between and blocked Anthony in a room until he was finished testing them let's start on the lower half of the performance spectrum here we see that memory speeds lower than 3200 mega Hertz are in fact pretty harmful to rise and third gens overall performance that is unless we run slow but very low latency memory and then crank our Infinity fabric as high as we possibly can which on our chip was about 1900 megahertz that actually yielded performance similar to our low latency 30 200 megahertz kit but at 2/3 the memory clock speed so then if you can't afford or find a high frequency Ram kit cranking your Infinity fabric could help make up a lot of the difference especially if you get a golden chip then when we switch to the higher performance kits things get even more interesting now at first as you might expect going from 3200 to 3600 and then 37 33 megahertz makes for some pretty healthy boosts and performance particularly on those low latency kids but look what happens when we go to 3800 megahertz and beyond as a result of the higher latency involved with memory this fast and the D synchronized infinity fabric we actually end up losing some performance putting our Infinity fabric back to 1900 megahertz which is the highest that ours will go without crashing we do pick back up a little bit particularly with our thirty eight hundred megahertz kit since that can run at that nice sweet one-to-one ratio now as of writing ddr4 36-hundred can be found for around the same price as thirty-two hundred depending on where you live and where you look so we also tried running both of those memory frequencies at the maximum infinity fabric clock that we could muster and it turns out that depending on the application this can provide a boost or a slight hindrance to your overall performance finally because Anthony couldn't leave well enough alone we ran the fastest one to one ratio kit that we could and tightened up the timings to test memory overclocking potential and holy schmoly with averages anywhere from two to eight percent higher than our previous best and percentiles jumping up by up to twenty seven percent we've not only validated our low latency results for the twenty 133 megahertz kit but we can also confidently say that aggressively tightening timings on any memory kit on Rison can dramatically improve your gaming experience if not your Cinebench score which didn't really seem to care about any of this unfortunately this is where our journey into high-speed memory on rise in third gen ends at least in these early days we did manage to reach 4000 megahertz ram stable by the way guys but we had to dig deeper into system voltage adjustments that were not that comfortable recommending to the average user and then we weren't able to get anything beyond that to post at least with our CPU the good news is that we've already got enough results to boil down our recommendations to a few key points number one don't stress the super high memory speeds and instead target memory that your system can support if all you want is something that's fast but that you know will work grab a 36 megahurtz kit with low latencies number two if you're adventurous go for it get a higher end kit and see how far you can push your infinity fabric the worst case scenario is you can clock the memory down and use DRAM calculator for Aizen to help you convert that extra speed Headroom into tighter timings it's not going to result in worst performance under any circumstances number three if your region's market is bad for memory pricing or availability you really shouldn't stress too much find a low latency 2133 memory kit and focus on overclocking your Infinity fabric you'll still be getting darn near the full experience it really is a testament to how good of a job AMD has done in engineering there's end to course that even though of course memory does still affect performance it's not quite as necessary to get a great experience as it might have once been ting is the mobile carrier that's focused on customer service and customer satisfaction and with ting you pay only for what you use with the average ting bill coming in at just $23 a month per device they have no contracts and you can try it risk-free and if you're stuck in a contract with your existing carrier and you switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to $75 they've gotten nationwide coverage from coast to coast in the USA and data is now just $10 a gig beyond the second gig they never block throttle or interfere with your online access and you can find out how much you'll save on ting by going to Linus ting comm and trying out their savings calculator we used their voicemail to text service and published our number one eight three three five six five LT TV m to hear some messages from our fans I unfortunately don't have access to think here in the UK but I would love to get it would save me roughly around about ten pounds if you were to convert it so I really hope they're able to come over here it could be UK so lower your phone bill at Linus ENCOM and get $25 in ting credit we'll have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you just like this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like and subscribed
