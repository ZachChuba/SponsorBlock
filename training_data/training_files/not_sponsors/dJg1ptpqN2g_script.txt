He‚Äôs sitting in here with these... Other disgusting... Things. Joergen (the second) deserves a *brain cells die*, his own house! Right Sven?? (yes pewds) Just like you got your own house. Joergen at least, at least, deserves a stable. Oh my God, get out of my house. Alright, don't escape, Jorgen. Don't escape. I need to make it safer, so that Joergen never disappears again. Because my heart can not handle it, anymore. Isn't that right Sven? Don't worry Sven, it wont be as fancy as your house it will just be a stable. How tall does it have to be for me to ride out of it? Okay. Oh my God this is the most annoying place to build! You guys are in my face! You smell. No wonder Joergen doesn‚Äôt like it with you guys... Oh my God Joergen noooooo! I'm tryna bUilD hERe! Its gonna be the best stable you have EVER seen in your LIFe. I couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing *laughs at his own sentence* Oh God.. Sven and... His perverted ways. Do I have fence? I do have fence. There we go. I mean, already looking low-key kind of cute. That‚Äôs AdOrAbLe ÔºàÔºæ‚àáÔºæÔºâ No, YOU‚ÄôRE breathtaking, Joergen.

It‚Äôs for Joergen. Do it for Joergen. Smurgan Purgan. OH MY GOD I‚ÄôM ONE SHOR- oh never mind

AHHHH I‚Äôm not making that- Oh it‚Äôs for Joergen though. I have these stones. *laughs* *groans* Guys. Alright. I can‚Äôt enter now :/ ahhhh! Like wouldn‚Äôt it be cute... If he had this littl- oh there‚Äôs already water in it. Perfect. Look, so he can make a drinky drink :) So he can make slurp slurp! Can I ride the Llamas? I can‚Äôt.

No cows can en- oh god this is an- oh god Joergen has already escaped *whEEZE* GET OUT! Yes! This is for Joergen only! Joergen Smurgen o- What is this? DON‚ÄôT GO BACK IN!! Gosh. This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things in Minecraft! Get out. Oh NOW it works! Let‚Äôs go there You too Dinnerbone, you can stay. Oh look! Look how cute. Joergen has a little friend in here. YOU DON‚ÄôT BELONG!!! Don‚Äôt EVER speak to Joergen again! *woof* That‚Äôs right Maya. Look he has a cute little- you can drink water now. Okay that‚Äôs freaking adorbs! I don‚Äôt care what anyone says! Okay so you may wonder ‚Äòwhy do I have this ugly wall here?‚Äô Well I wanted to try out If I could build like a... hidden door. The thing is like... ‚ÄòCause now, When I AHHH Now when I ride out with Joergen Smurgen It doesn‚Äôt work! It doesn‚Äôt work I could make a door with like No, they‚Äôre too sm- They‚Äôre too small for Joergen. So I want to make like a... Like a... A piston door, I think. Because pistons are fun. GET AWAY FROM HERE! So- So when me and Joergen go out on adventure, We hit button, Door open, and we go out and it‚Äôs epic fun time. Okay let‚Äôs do that. I don‚Äôt know how to do that. Let‚Äôs figure it out, right Sven? Let‚Äôs use our pee-pee poo-poo brain Okay. Okay so first what we have to do is we have to cook a steak. I need- I know I have- Okay I have three sticky pistons. I think I might need more. I need these, and I need lever. Probably a new axe. I don‚Äôt know how my anvil broke and I‚Äôm so low on steel! Fine. Y‚Äôknow what? Fine this is- I have a lotta diamonds, okay? I think- I think I can spare to make an axe. What level am I? 27??? I‚Äôm freaking rich‚Äôa‚Äôfricky Alright, enchantment time! What did we get? What did we get? What did we get? Efficiency 3!! Okay I guess I‚Äôll take it. Dude, can we talk about how I‚Äôm fully diamond? Can we talk about that? You guys wanna talk about that? You wanna talk how rich I am? I have so much diamond but no steel? How will this work? Let‚Äôs test it out on neutral ground. I don‚Äôt know how sticky piston work. But I think what they can do is they hol- They hold the- The block that it‚Äôs... Listen I‚Äôm a Minecraft veteran, I think I know better than you. So don‚Äôt even... Steven Smeden. How does this work? Does it come ba- IT COMES BACK! That‚Äôs epic! So, the idea... Then, Joergen if could just stay over here. Oh god this is gonna be annoying. NO ONE GOES NEAR JOERGAN! NO ONE GOES NEAR JOERGAN! Why can‚Äôt you leave us alone? No! You cannot enter, you shall not pass. God I hate you all. Leave us al- leave us. LEAVE US! LEAVE US! Oh you‚Äôre asking for it. You‚Äôre asking for it. You‚Äôre asking! Don‚Äôt come near you‚Äôll get fricked. Okay. One, two, three. NO!! NO! AHH! I‚Äôll kill all of you. Oh my god, you frick. Already extremely annoyed. Wait a minute, can we even go through this? *groan* Joergan is too fat. Sorry Joergan. Yeah, you bette- aw. You‚Äôre just showing off now, you‚Äôre just showing off. So that means we need three more sticky pistons. Dammit! I‚Äôm poor. Don‚Äôt worry about the yelling, Sven. It‚Äôs literally Pappy has a tough day at work. HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH??? Oh my god! Pistons, yes. It‚Äôs only one steel so we actually can afford it. I think I have slime. Yes I do. With a squeeze of lemon and lime. Okay, slime- no! Piston. Sticky piston. One. Okay, then one, two. This better be cool! This better flippin' dippin', skinny dippin', ball pippin'... Get away from him Joergen! He's evil. Okay, so... This will go here... I realised this whole contraption needs to come further back. God you're annoying!!! If it wasn't for Water Sheep, I would get rid of all of you. All of you would go bye bye. Just so you know. Just so you know. Ahhh... I think I fricked up again. For the third time. It's my frick day. Birthday I mean. Today... Thanks for all the birthday wishes. Why did I said that, that's a lie. Okay, Did I frick up again? I cannot frick up three times. I've never fricked up three times. One, two, three. And then.. It will go here. And then... One, two... Two... Two, three. You will pee in my... Skiis. That sucks. We gotta get rid of lantern. Okay so, This is how it looks like when the doors are open. Now I just need to wire it somehow. I got your... Thankyou. Thankyou. Keep telling them to leave. Hopefully I can make it as clean as possible. I don't really get how... Redstone works. I'm still like, I don't know. Should I make it go under or above? Or  both? That does not activate it. What? Maybe it's better if I go under. He just hit me with a gate? He can't hit me with a gate! Gosh, okay. I'm almost done. I'm almost done! If you just leave me alone. Let me think. What? How is that connected? Is there like an- What? This game makes zero sense. Look how much space there is. You're all- Oh my God! The gate is back! Are you kidding me? I don't understand redstone. How does th- Okay, I don't understand redblock clearly. But, It works. Nooo! Noooooo!!! My wiring! *Arghhh* aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAA Oh my God.. Yahaaha. But why does.... This not kill? You know what? Alright. Let's just try it out now. Oh yeah, let's just try and hide the ugly... Okay Joergen... We are riding off. I guess I need it to close aswell. I just. Oh my God, peace and quiet. I've been listening to the sheeps for so long. *Sighs* I mean, I did loose a little bit of the aesthetic. Maybe I should... Spend some time. Oh my god!!! Get down from there!!! I hate you!!! They're escaping! *Cries* You're so annoying. Cool, literally one cow is left. Joergen!!! Not you too! Okay, So it will work like this: Boom, we're out. And that's it. That was-  That was what I built. *Applause* And then we come back. Hit the switch. Joergan is safe and sound and he has water. It's perfect. Do you like it Joergen? He loves it. He said he loved it. I heard him. Oh no, Boat Cow! Sven!!! *Cries* Goddamnit!!! I was trying to get rid f the boat. My God!!! Please don't make a big deal out of boat cow. Please just- That's right Sven we're actually heading out on adventure. Because when I went all across the f- Sven!!! Uh, I discovered a jungle. And I never went like, Inside it. But it's time to go. I think I know... Where to go- Find it. Okay, let's go. Wooohooo! Yeahhh! Come on Sven and Joergen, it's adventure. As always, I forgot a leash. I need to bring a leash. There's so many things you need to think about in Minecraft. At least, if you care about your animals  it becomes a whole different aspect of the game. 'Cause you can't go without- ah. I'm really glad I spent half the episode trying to build a frickn' redstone... It's fun! I like it. Look, it's cool. I think it's cool. I wish I was better at hiring the- At hiding the wiring. If you guys have any tips, like let me know. Sven is with us. I wish Sven could on the horse. On Joergan, that would be so cute.
