lately massive protests in Hong Kong have been drawing the attention of the world but as many look on they do so with very little context for the events that are unfolding in this video I hope to help educate audiences by providing an overview of the history of Hong Kong and its relationship with both China and the West a quick thanks is owed to Squarespace for sponsoring this video let's start with some basics on geography when we talk about Hong Kong we're talking about an area in southern China along the Pearl River Delta the region of Hong Kong is about 1/10 the size of Iceland or half the size of Rhode Island the landmass consists primarily of a chunk of the mainland separated from the rest of China by the Sham Chun River and includes over 200 Islands the largest of which are len tao and hong kong island proper much of the terrain is mountainous or hilly with many forested areas unsuitable for construction the coastlines are quite rugged as well but do feature many bays and inlets which provide ready access to the sea most people live near these low-lying areas it is here that significant land reclamation projects have taken place to expand the habitable zones for one of the most densely populated areas of the world now for a quick and dirty overview of Hong Kong's history the region was inhabited as far back as the Stone Age and developed into a farming and fishing community that would be incorporated into the various Chinese dynasties from the chins of the second century BC to the kings of the 1800s at this point it passed into the hands of the colonizing British who briefly lost control to the invading Japanese during the second world war before recovering the territory in 1945 156 years of British rule would end in 1997 when the colony of Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China as a part of broader 20th century decolonization trends Hong Kong would be designated a special administrative region which featured both governmental and economic systems separate from those of mainland China over the years these lines have been increasing we blurred today we're watching as the nature of this relationship is being tested okay with that out of the way let's do a deeper dive on the history of Hong Kong as we've stated the early history of Hong Kong dates back almost 6,000 years to a time when Neolithic tribes found refuge along its shores these early humans set up basic houses and provided for themselves by farming and fishing they left behind rock carvings of religious significance eight of which have been discovered in the area today over the years these various small family grips would consolidate into larger villages and eventually form relationships with their neighbors ancient Chinese scholars referred to these southern communities as a hundred Yuet tribes this distinct indigenous group stretch out along the southern coast of China their kingdoms greatly benefited from a temperate climate fertile fields bountiful fishing grounds and lucrative maritime trade routes for a time they also enjoyed relative safety from the warring factions to the north however in the 3rd century BC Qin Shihuang would complete his conquest of six warring States and found the first imperial dynasty of China this new Qin Dynasty Empire would turn greedily to the south five successive campaigns were launched against the ua tribes while the area was sparsely populated its wild jungle terrain made it possible for the outnumbered defenders to put up a fierce guerrilla resistance however by 214 BC they would largely be defeated what followed was a concerted effort by the Qin Dynasty to synthesize the area the territories were broken up into new administrative zones for easier control while massive numbers of colonists were brought in to settle the area and the Chinese script was imposed on the locals when Amber Chen died his empire barely outlasted him as insurrections rapidly spread across the land in the south the you air regions once again regained their independence in particular a Qin general named Zhao - Oh would use this movement to found his own Kingdom sending troops to garrison the mountain passes and eliminating all rival Qin officials he proclaimed himself king of nan ua in 204 BC with its capital and pen you he would find success in conquering his neighbors and the Kingdom even managed to take over part of northern Vietnam eventually however northern China was able to emerge from its infighting and reconsolidate under the Han Dynasty this new Empire quickly sought to reassert power on the south as tensions escalated nan UI formally submitted itself as a subject state but in reality maintained much of its autonomy in 111 BC this would end when nan ua was invaded in force by several Han armies from this point on the southern lands would be caught up in the greater cycle of imperial dynasties that oversaw China's unification and division over the centuries in these matters there is relatively little to be said of Hong Kong specifically it fell under the administration of the Guangdong province but would have been of little note as its communities were made quite small with the population in the low thousands the inhabitants of early Hong Kong therefore would not have played a large role in affairs beyond their local region and remained fairly isolated maintaining their traditional way of life for many centuries yet they were not completely unaffected by the larger tides of history we have just discussed the people of Hong Kong increasingly fell under the sway of Chinese influence making its way down from the north which gradually displaced or assimilated with the local you a culture for now this was a rather slow process but as we shall see the trend would accelerate during the later imperial years between the 2nd and 20th centuries China would go through numerous dynasties the years of peace led to a flourishing of Economic Opportunity which attracted a steady flow of Chinese immigrants to the south the years of war turned this flow into a torrent this was particularly the case during periods of Imperial transition which were accompanied by years of widespread warfare and disunity such turbulent events often centered around the more prosperous areas of northern China which would drive huge civilian caravans into the safer regions of the south as an example it's reported that the an Lucian rebellion during the Tang Dynasty of the 8th century led to an almost doubling of the Gwangju prefecture an even more dramatic migration would take place during the 3rd 18th century with the Mongol invasions these terrifyingly brutal Affairs devastated the north huge numbers of refugees and even the entire Song Dynasty government was forced to relocate away from the threat as the Empire was slowly conquered the boy Emperor Zhao Bing temporarily sought shelter atop a sacred mountain hill in Hong Kong upon hearing that the Mongols had defeated his fleet at the naval battle of Yaman the Emperor along with much of his royal clan committed suicide this event and the collapse of the song is preserved today in stone carvings located within Kowloon in Hong Kong during the years of Mongol rule much of the population was a mix of farmers fishermen pearl divers and pirates over the following centuries more people would arrive to populate the various regions of Hong Kong which still remained quite wild these would build up walled cities to protect themselves from bandits wild animals and rival clans by the 15th century Chinese maritime activity was kicked up a notch as foreign trade and contact with the outside world exploded under the Ming Dynasty this was typify by the incredible voyages of Zheng he's treasure fleet with increasing traffic throughout the South China Seas yet more people were drawn to seaside communities such as Hong Kong however things weren't always in a state of influx for instance in the late 1600s the Ching dynasty was stamping out resistance to its rule and issued the edicts of the great clearance which mandated the evacuation of coastal regions tens of thousands of families were relocated as government forces were deployed to enforce the decree Beacon Hill in Hong Kong was the location of one such garrison which oversaw the transformation of the region into a barren wasteland while the edict was eventually lifted and the people allowed to return home the event led to an even greater mixing of the population all of the emigration we have just described further diluted the original population of southern China however rather than outright replace it new cultural groups such as the Cantonese emerged as the centuries rolled on there would be a great layering of immigrant groups one on top of another today many distinct groups recognized throughout the region of Hong Kong such as the punty Hakka tanka and Hokkien people who can trace their origins back to one or another of these early communities it wasn't just the other Chinese who were increasingly interested in southern China in the 16th century maritime trade links with the rest of the world were opening up and European merchants were now making frequent stops along the coast of Guangdong province the Ming government of the time wished to maintain a watchful eye on these foreigners as a result they allowed the Portuguese to establish a singular permanent settlement at Macau in 1557 where they could be relatively contained the result was that Macao soon became the center of a hemispheric exchange of commodities this had many benefits for the economies of local neighbors like Hong Kong by the 17th century the British had overtaken the Portuguese as masters of the sea and were granted their own trading post in Canton which the Ching government decreed was to be the only legal Chinese port for overseas trade fortunes were to be made in southern China this was a fact well understood by the many European merchants and envoys flooding the region as well as the numerous pirates who followed in their wake we just produced a whole video on one such famous pirate pirate Jing Shi who operated out of the Pearl River Delta and who often set up shop around Hong Kong to the foreigners these pirates and the overly controlling Qing government were hurting their bottom line for these reasons they sought out ways to protect their commercial interests as one would imagine this interest quickly manifested itself through armed conflict the greatest of these aggressive negotiations would be the opium wars fought between the British and the Ching empires they would cede the Chinese government severely weakened and forced to open up trade with the outside world Hong Kong would be caught up in these affairs in 1841 the British Navy made its way to the Pearl River Delta and after winning several encounters occupied Hong Kong as a base of operations the British flag was raised on the 26th of January when Commodore sir Gordon Bremer claimed the island as a colony however it wasn't until the 29th of August 18:42 that the subdued ching dynasty would officially cede the island of Hong Kong to the British under the Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War when hostilities again flared up with the outbreak of the Second Opium War the British used the peace treaty of 1860 at the convention of pay King to get even more land the terms of the treaty specified that Southern Cal lune and Stonecutters Island would be leased rent-free in perpetuity a fancy way of saying it was conquered further concessions were obtained in 1868 at the second convention of pay King in order to safeguard Hong Kong Island the treaty extended British control up to the champion River an area known today as the New Territories and included an additional 200 islands in the vicinity the terms of the deal stipulated a 99-year lease which would expire at midnight on June 30th 1997 surely enough time to kick things down the road far enough so they could get sorted out for now this is where we will end our episode at a point in time where most videos on the history of Hong Kong begin in the next part we'll continue the story by covering the colonial period and the transformation to a special administrative region of China see you then I wanted to thank Squarespace for
