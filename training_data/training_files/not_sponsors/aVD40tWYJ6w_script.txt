hey there everybody it's Adam here from Tesla Australia welcome back to another video well unfortunately I still don't have the latest software version that is starting to be pushed out I think there's about 22 cars right now according to Tesla fire in Australia that are running the 2024 version of software but unfortunately I am still waiting I am madly obviously checking testify and in the car to see if there is anything to download but unfortunately there isn't anything at this point in time so I can't give you an update video on that yet but as soon as I see it dropped and available to install I will definitely get the install done and take you through those release notes but in the interim I wanted to do a video today on Auto Park I actually haven't used auto park to be honest a great deal in my model 3 since I've had full self driving I think I've used it twice from memory and on both occasions it has worked really really well but honestly a lot of the time when I actually would like to use it the option kind of hasn't come up and become available and there's there's kind of some reasons why that is the case so so on this video I want to take you through Auto Park just to give you a bit of insight in terms of what it is and how it works and we'll try and get some examples of it fully working fingers crossed all right so we are going to go and find some areas whereby we can use auto park I only said autopilot there though is the general trend or videos on my channel but auto park so there are some scenarios whereby where you can use it and some areas where you can't so generally auto park gets its kind of bearings based upon other cars so if you're trying to park in a spot where there's no cars around then then you won't get that option made available to you and it guess similarly if if there's only one car I generally if in my experience warrants bring you up that option that generally would like to find itself kind of parked between two cars or some other type of kind of physical barrier in order to kind of navigate itself so there there's a few things to look out for it obviously help if you're trying to drive into a spot sort of front on but it will work well if you're trying to reverse park into say a shopping centre car park with sort of a car on either side of a parking space it would generally present itself as being available in that instance so gonna sort of go for a little bit of a drive around a bit of a populated area just to see if we can see if we can find some areas whereby you all are present itself there's something that's available for us to use and test with all right let's try this here and see if we can park into this spot just here let's see if the pee comes up yeah it does tap the pee shift to reverse it start let's see how we go fingers crossed struggling a little bit but I'd rather it be overly cautious and hit something so thing is just getting its bearings set now this looks better this looks better there's turn in the wrong way struggling it's gonna give it another go it is a pretty tight spot that I give her that I probably didn't set it up for success in terms of getting that happening but it's corrected I think three times and then aborted just was a bit too tight for that one so let's let's go and see if we can find another one all right let's go back to the original one we tried before let's see right here kind of angle ourselves ready okay shift to reverse start let's give this one a crack [Music] [Music] mmm not bad not bad not bad not bad you did see it come up and ask me to resume before because I did I did just touch the brakes slightly just when I saw it kind of going back into the into the space behind but I mean okay not too bad I probably would correct this slightly in this particular spot I'd probably move forward just to touch and maybe just straighten up a little bit but overall pretty good obviously you saw the first one failed I think it was just too many attempts I think from memory the documentation states that the Tesla gives you seven attempts I think or it or a warrant auto park if it believes that it'll take seven attempts to get the the car sorted in the correct position which is which is possibly what happened there and and plus it was a pretty tight spot see if we can use one of these spots here and reverse parking here shall we yep so I've got the P so we can just simply tap the P ship to reverse and the car is going to attempt to park here obviously supervising as we go don't want the car getting too close to the gutter we don't want any kerb wheels well that's pretty damn good that is waiting that's perfect is really good maybe just a touch too close to the car in front he doesn't have a car in front of him so he or her so they could just drive straight back out but that's pretty damn good looking at the side there's plenty room with the gutter it's nice and close but not not too closely by worried about curbing the wheels but that's uh that was really really good so I think from my experience you know at least testing this the parking next to a curb is probably a little bit more accurate than in the car park as you saw I did have another example whereby I did have the car park similar to what I just did then but unfortunately the camera stopped recording halfway through so I couldn't use that clip but that was perfect just like this one as well so very very cool indeed Auto Park seems to be working quite well I'm gonna keep an eye on it and maybe try and use it a little bit more when I can I have had some instances where it has come up and I still just preferred to to park manually but uh to me that's pretty damn good I'm pretty happy with that all right well that is gonna be it for today's video I hope you found it beneficial I have had a few questions recently around the use of auto Park and whether I use it or not so again I hope you found that beneficial and maybe gave you some confidence in terms of using it if you have full self-driving capability on your car or maybe that's something that you've wanted to see before looking to sort of make the make the swoop and enable full self-driving support before the price goes up in just a few days time so as always thank you so much for watching I really do appreciate each and every one of you that have been tuning in and watching the videos and obviously commenting on those and liking where applicable as well so you're all awesome and I really do appreciate it so that's gonna be it for this video hopefully the next one you you will see will be a software upgrade video with some luck we'll get that in the next sort of few days or so and I'll do my best to get that one out as soon as possible once I've obviously loaded it and had some time to test with the car so stay safe stay healthy look forward to chatting with you on the next video bye for now [Music]
