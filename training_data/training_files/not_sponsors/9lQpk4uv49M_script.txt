hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with plastered pork tacos that's right i was in the mood for some pork
tacos but i was looking for a little bit of a change of pace to the normal
carnita style i would usually make which led to this wild and crazy experiment
and while i was very happy with the results and the tacos really were
delicious especially with the apple and jalapeno salsa I'm going to show how
to make it was also one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen come out
of my oven and actually believe it or not look like a famous historical figure
or should I say disfigure but anyway you'll see what I mean in a few minutes
and to get started the first thing we're gonna do is season up a nice big pork
shoulder roast which as can see his bone in an in case you're keeping score
at home that's the shoulder blade and the first thing I did here was cover
this very generously with some freshly and finely minced rosemary which is not
only lovely with pork but I thought would pair very well with the apples in
the salsa later and then once my pork shoulder was Rose married I went ahead
and cover that with freshly ground black pepper and while can use pretty much
any herbs and spices want here the only thing I don't want seasoning
this with would be salt since we're gonna put a ton of that in the plaster
that's gonna cover this which by the way is the next step and for that we'll take
some all-purpose flour and add to de tremendous amount of kosher salt and yes
that is a ridiculous amount but we're not gonna eat the plaster we are just
using it to hopefully trap in the moisture and flavor and perfectly season
the pork as it roasts and then to that we will add one egg white and then
finish up with a splash of cold fresh water at which point we'll give this a
very enthusiastic stirring until we have something very smooth and Lum free and
since this was an experiment I wasn't exactly sure how thick I wanted this
okay I didn't really want to end up with a dough but I also didn't want a super
runny otherwise it just might drip off the meat as it cooked and so what I
ended up with after a few minutes of stirring was something that look like
this which I guess kind of looks like plaster although to be honest I'm not
sure I've ever seen wet plaster but anyway once that was mixed I went ahead
and plop my pork in and then use my spoon to spread that all over
and when I first started doing this I was thinking I would just add all the
herbs and spices to this mixture but the more I thought about it that didn't seem
like a great idea since as I mentioned we're not actually gonna eat the plaster
and I was afraid a lot of that flavor will get trapped in the crust and
basically wasted and I was thinking with this method this plaster coating would
harden as it baked and trap all that goodness against the meat but anyway
once I had that covered I went ahead and spread some of the excess into the
bottom of my roasting pan which probably didn't really do much but at the time
felt like something I should do and then I went ahead and placed my pork
on top and then I made sure I reapplied some to any of those spots that got
rubbed off during the transfer and then once I was sure was covered i spooned
even more over the top and then once I had that pork as plastered as I was I
proceeded to place it into the center of a 325 degree oven for about three and a
half hours or until it looked like the Elephant Man so that just might be the
strangest thing I've ever pulled out of my oven I mean just absolutely
horrifying although the other side did look relatively normal and kind of sorta
like plaster pork and that surface had become quite dry and hard check it out
oh yeah pork don't lie although maybe sometimes it should and if weren't
gonna cut this up and make tacos later could just crack this crust off at
the table and go ahead and slice up and serve what would hopefully be a very
flavorful roast pork but anyway that wasn't my plan so I let this cool down
for about an hour at which point I became uncrackable okay because it
absorbed a lot of moisture became sort of leathery so basically I just had to
slice it and peel it off and at this point I was really looking forward to
tasting a piece to see how it came out in fact I was so anxious and in a hurry
I was not really paying attention and I sliced right into that shoulder blade
which will explain that beautiful piece of cartilage see but know what I
got over my fear of eating around cartilage a long time ago so I tucked in
anyway and that really was some fabulous meat okay like all saldo crusts
I was hoping this would trap in a lot of moisture and flavor and I think that's
exactly what happened in L in case you're wondering it was not
too salty it was absolutely perfect and then because I wanted to cube this up
for the tacos I decided to break it up into his larger chunks as I could
although fair warning around the shoulder blade there are gonna be little
pockets of meat that are just gonna be small because they're small and if
you're gonna have a few more samples that's the spot want to get him from
but anyway I went ahead and broke the outer part mostly leaving in nice big
chunks so that once this is chilled they're easy to Cuba all right if you
want shredded pork tacos go ahead but I wanted cubes this time and once I had
all that meat on the plate I noticed some very delicious looking brown goo in
the bottom of the pan that I figured I should spoon and spread over since
technically those are accumulated juices which of course we never throw away and
can definitely use this right away if want but it was getting dark so I
decided to wrap it up with some of those bigger plaster pieces placed over the
top and then I pop that in the fridge and went to bed dreaming of the tacos I
would be enjoying the next day and then at some point before we actually build
our tacos we're gonna want to put together this very special salsa which
will include some Honey Crisp apple that we've cut into a nice small dice and
then to that we will add some finely diced white onion as well as some seeded
diced jalapeno I also tossed in some freshly chopped cilantro as well as a
nice big pinch of salt plus the juice of one lime that as can see I freshly
squeezed by hand and then I finished up with a little pinch of cayenne just to
stay in shape and that's it we'll take a spoon and give that a mix and of course
give it a taste and adjust if need be and that really was so delicious it
could have been a video all by itself but it's not it's gonna go on some pork
tacos so I grabbed a chunk of what was now very cold pork and I sliced that up
and then cut it in strips and then into about half inch cubes and like I said if
wanted to shred this or chop it up even smaller go ahead but I was in the
mood for cubes which after cutting I went ahead and browned up in a dry
non-stick pan over medium-high heat and yes heard that correctly a dry pan
okay pork shoulder has a fair amount of fat in it and as that heats up it melts
you'll see this will Brown up nicely of having said that if want to fry this
up in a whole bunch of fat sort of carnitas style if it's the reserved fat
say from the pan that would also be perfectly fine and absolutely incredible
but as I said earlier I was kind of going for a little bit of a change of
pace for my usual carnitas method but either way is fantastic so decide I
mean are after all the joseph merrick of how to prepare it and once I
had that nicely browned I went ahead and transfer that on to a homemade flour
tortilla which was actually half white half wheat flour and after piling on a
very generous amount I went ahead and spooned over that absolutely incredible
Apple help and yo salsa and that my friends was one of the best pork tacos
I've had in a very very long time okay even though it looked absolutely bizarre
that plastered pork method really did produce a tender juicy flavorful meat
and we could have seasoned that with anything and these tacos would be
amazing but because this meat is subtly scented with rosemary and black pepper
it works incredibly well with this sweet and slightly spicy jalapeno apple salsa
so I really did enjoy every bite of this and how much different with these tacos
have been if we had just roasted the pork using a traditional method I don't
know okay those questions are really hard to answer although it has been my
experience that meats roasted in a salt crust or a salt dough usually do come
out fairly succulent plus if did use a traditional method for the pork there
is no way it's going to come out of the oven looking like the Elephant Man which
is why especially if make this salsa also I really do hope give this a
try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredients a principle
