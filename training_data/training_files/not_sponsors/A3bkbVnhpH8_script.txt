[Music] hey guys this is eckhartsladder hello and welcome to another star wars video today's might be a little bit shorter because we're talking about a smaller aspect of the star wars universe and specifically the goal and defense stations which could commonly be seen defending planets in the star wars galaxy so there are many prongs to a good planetary defense probably the most important one would be a planetary shield and really a good shield can basically halt even the strongest attacking forces if the planetary shield is up and if it's strong the only real way you'll be able to beat it is through an extraordinarily prolonged orbital bombardment which is not really practical some sort of sabotage on the ground to destroy the shield generators or a blockade which will cut off supplies to the world which is especially effective if they're highly dependent on shipments from other planets however the planetary shield is only one aspect we also have defense fleets which were often at major planets or at least in the same system to respond to attacks there were ground-based weapons like the ion cannon we see on hoth or the various turbo lasers that were stationed across the galaxy and then of course we have space stations now space stations came in many different varieties coruscant for example had everything from orbital yards to private sky hooks to giant mirrors which would direct the sun to the planet's surface and weaponized defense platforms now there were countless types of defensive space stations used in the galaxy but i would argue that the most common was the golan line i would argue that the golan was the primary space station used defensively by the republic by the empire and by the new republic and it's not really a surprise because the new republic inherited a lot of their space stations from the empire for example when they took coruscant although they did have to assault some of the golems directly many of the stations actually remained operational and would serve in the defense of the planet for years to come including against grand admiral thrawn but let's talk history because the golan line has seen several different revisions with each one improving quite significantly on the prior version here's what we get from the ffg source book fly casual the goal in one space platform was a very large heavily armored and armed space platform and the first of a series of planetary defense platforms built by golan arms it continues and gives a bit of history saying that the golan was developed during the clone wars to help free up ships for the war effort so basically instead of having to park a few venators over coruscant you know you build some goal and defense platforms that being said especially by the galactic civil war they were sort of showing their age especially when it came to firepower and a lot of this would have had to do with just the sheer degree of militarization after the drop of the russon reformations so the golan one would have been relegated to backwater worlds or worlds that couldn't afford to upgrade and it wasn't really able to take on large capital ships but still could have taken on pirates or even some smaller cruisers golems however were not only present around planets but also sat within hyperspace lanes sort of as checkpoints aside from 14 port and starboard turbo lasers 3 dorsal and 3 ventral torpedo launchers and a series of tractor beam the golan one also held two squadrons of tie fighters the golan one wasn't very prominent in the post-endor period at least as i said on important worlds however the golan 2 which of course was next in line was still active we see for example an heir to the empire that although coruscant had upgraded to golan 3s important shipyards like the one at bill bringy we're still simply relying on golden twos the last command source book says specifically that the golan 2 is meant for repelling starfighter and light capital combat starship assaults and has not only been significantly up gunned and upsized from the original design but also has more efficient power generators and thus greater shield power it has in total 35 turbo laser batteries 10 proton torpedo launchers and a massive upgrade of 8 tractor beam placements additionally even if the shield has been breached it can absorb a lot of damage because of its compact and cross beam design the starships of the galaxy source book gives a really good explanation for how the golen class was developed and how the space stations were used across the galaxy as we mentioned the golan 1 was developed during the days of the republic and was very common however when the extra firepower was needed to face off against increasingly powerful ships the golan 2 was made and it says by the battle of endor they were considered to be commonplace however this brings us to the next station in line the golan 3. now golan 3's were extraordinarily powerful space stations and as the last command source book states they were reserved for only the most important military installations in vital civilian worlds which is why you see some at coruscant for example the golden three's increase in strength was similar to the golan twos increase over the golden one it was much larger and it probably had larger power generators giving it a stronger shield it maintained the smart design of the golan 2 which made it very sturdy and it had even more guns specifically 50 turbo laser batteries 24 proton torpedo launchers and now 15 tractor beam projectors plus whatever amount of star fighters could fit on board when thrawn raided coruscant he attacked two of the planet's coal and defense platforms with a fairly sizable force taking advantage of inexperienced command on the ground and forcing the new republic to divert ships away to try to defend the platforms despite the fact that as thrawn said goal and defense platforms can take considerably more punishment than their former ground commander apparently realized thrawn used the words former commander because once general bell ivliss assumed command of coruscant's defenses he pulled the fleet back and basically let the golden threes sort of slug it out with the imperial fleets and none of them were lost at least as much as we know now these were all golens that the new republic captured from the empire and palpatine also had these stations installed at other key worlds including this which was basically his fortress planet and arguably to him the most important planet in the entire galaxy which really speaks to the power of these stations golden 3s are often described as not much more powerful than imperial star destroyers but it seems like they are much much sturdier this makes them great for planetary defense duties because if you're on a planet that has a golan platform there's probably also a fleet in range and a shield and a ground-based cannon so as long as the stations can survive long enough to hold off an attacker they are really contributing overall to a planet's defense if that makes sense golden threes would continue to see use throughout the end of the galactic civil war the yuuzhan vong war and beyond they were even used for example to contain the death seed which was a really nasty disease that took a hold on nonchorios after the death of palpatine the goal in line would continue production and by the legacy era there was a golden 8 space station indicating that there had been several models of course since the golden three one interesting thing about the golden eight was that it actually had a hyperdrive attached to the space station which i think is really practical and i guess they would just shut it off when non-use and route the power to the weapons and shielding but we don't really know a lot about the actual weaponry especially because the legacy era campaign guide is kind of weird and how it displays weapon numbers it also makes me wonder though i guess other golem platforms were just moved by like hyperspace tugs or something i think it would have made sense to give them just a very very small and very poor hyperdrive maybe take you know weeks or months to move across the galaxy but you won't really be using these very flexibly like that you're meant to drop a golem in place and basically leave it there otherwise you're just building capital ships and that really i think is the main benefit over a capital ship though i think there are some strategic concerns in the other way presumably golan platforms are not geosynchronous they would be pointing towards i guess any likely hyperspace vectors in towards the planet now that can be guessed somewhat based on hyperspace routes but if a planet can be attacked from two sides well then one golem is just going to be completely useless but to be fair that's also the case with starships it's going to take a fleet a long time to actually move around a planet anyway golems with their accompanying starfighters and their tractor beams also work well as we discuss in a sort of checkpoint role or working on borders or in the middle of shipyards basically anywhere that you need extra protection but guys that's all i have for today before we leave however i will do a hashtag ask today's question is an interesting one it comes from matthew kelly who asks what are my thoughts on the special editions and the visual effects of the star wars movies so i actually have the version of star wars that i grew up on on vhs sitting right in front of me as i work so i was raised on the 1997 gold special edition which actually had most of the major changes it had of course the new music for a jobless castle the controversial han shot first you guys get most of the idea not of course all of the prequel tie-ins because well the prequels weren't out yet so i had seen star wars but we got this for the first time in 1997 when i was five years old and i grew up on the movies in this form i used to watch return of the jedi literally three or four times a week when i came home from school i was obsessed and probably an unhealthy way hence my career choice so for me a lot of these special changes are just one i grew up with so it's kind of hard to see them objectively when i really think about things critically some of them are pretty dumb on shot first for example some of the extra cgi but i also think there were some really great changes they tweaked some of the special effects like the explosions in a new hope i think the ending song for return of the jedi i.e the victory celebration theme is miles miles ahead of yubnab and i know that's an opinion that you guys can fight about below but just because that's what i grew up on i really liked them all and i just wish that they would release the original films in theatrical format i know you can get fan creations online but just give us a 4k version of the films as they appeared in theaters but then do whatever you want i guess i mean i haven't liked a lot of the changes since the special edition i'm not in love with hayden christensen being a force ghost at the end of episode six i really don't like vader saying no before he saves luke in my opinion that takes away from what i think is my favorite scene in all of star wars so i guess i've got a nuanced opinion on special editions but an opinion that's obviously quite biased based on what i grew up on hope you guys liked that answer i hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions you'd like me to address in future videos leave it down below with the hashtag azk but guys that is all for me have a good one and of course may the force be with you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
