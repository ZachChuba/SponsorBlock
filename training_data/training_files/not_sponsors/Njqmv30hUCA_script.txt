went live today the garbage man not been the true the Garvin imitation work I just wanna let's that's offensive to call it a garbage man cuz it's not a garbage person he's a sanitation lorry sanitation employee somebody I think Wes it turns out Doug was at West it was Brock blocking the way for the garbage driver apparently it was Wes Jesus Christ yeah I you should double-check that it's working Matt because what was happening was that theme song was so goddamn loud that it was blasting everybody out of variance okay no excuse me literally a minute before we are gonna go live knock knock and and and here's the other funny thing there's a super they said there's a Subaru blocking the there's a Subaru blocking the garbage truck can I say garbage truck sanitation sanitation device sanitation transportation vehicle now you you could the the number of people that owned Subarus in this room is is a little obnoxious so everyone's scrambling whose anyway so so then west went running out Doug went running out we went live anyway and nobody could hear me but if I mean could make can the people hear me one two three oh you're kidding me thank you well we had a good run of tech free tech disaster free shows but it is sort of in our DNA it is who we are essentially welcome to the show everybody we are back welcome back to the to the show Doug and Vic thank you for joining me this morning huh my pleasure to be back I have not seen you guys in a while but I funny quick story I got to see Doug quickly yesterday we were barreling down the 15 the i-15 the freeway south of Salt Lake City I was up in Montana visiting my sister and her family and Doug was out you were Doug where were you in all over the place but you were rounding things down in Salt Lake City that's right I was in Albuquerque then I went to Denver then I went to Salt Lake City so we were my wife was driving and folks let me tell you my wife I don't like to drive I'm Aang's aya T when it comes to driving and but my wife loves it and she treats it like a race you know how on the on the Apple Maps or whatever the maps it shows you what your estimated time of arrival is so for a big long trip she tries to get it let's say you want it says you're gonna get there at 6:30 she wants to get that down to six or 5:30 sometimes so even in and out and stuff what pass it on the right like like yeah she's like the whole it's like a video game for her and it's some of these like you know we're up in the western expanse of Utah and Idaho and everything and you know she is going like a hundred I'm not getting going like a hundred miles an hour flying sounds dangerous I was nervous I was saying I was white-knuckle in it though you got a buzz buzz bustard no doesn't work I think I would see a cop and I'd go cop cop cop cop and then she would kind of slow down to eight but the speed limits 80 up there so it's not that crazy to go 90 but anyways we're barreling down the 15 on our way back down south of Salt Lake City we're barreling going at least a hundred and we're going up this hill and in the distance on the right lane we see this puff of black smoke this looks like a little looks like the mystery vent like the mystery from Scooby Doo going like 48 miles an hour in the right lane and I go what the [ __ ] is that thing as I get closer it dawns on me it's my friend Doug it's my friend Doug and we've whizzed past and I'm like hon pull like get in the right lane and bring it down to 90 we get down let's see if we could this is like sidle along with him and say hi but and we went down as slow as she could possibly go without causing an accident but still we were flooding what do you what kind of you have us interesting van a camper van what is it it's a it's a Japanese import it's diesel that's why I was smoking and it's but what kind of car is that's a Toyota Toyota Hiace 4x4 diesel van and what's really weird about it is you're the driver the you're the driver seat is in is like a British car it's like in the on the right-hand side that's right no weird stuff man seems dangerous too anyways it was fun and my kids were so excited that we you know in this whole vast length of the the i-15 stretching we were coming from Butte all the way down to San Bernardino look at the map that's just it's 900 miles or something in there he is my friend I miss you and it was fun so anyways look I didn't find out until the next day I was I cut my video camera out my phone I was making videos I was waving at you my kids were sticking their hands out but you were in some kind of trance you were not paying attention while I was focused on safety you know speed limits and things like that anyways it was neat and I hope people can appreciate how cool that is and the world is small it is a small world and we're we're you know we're so the Lord is watching over us and creating these miracles I've just made an elapsed so I know that people can hear us let's talk to Ana real quick amen hi how

Hollywood oh I see it was in vulture I believe yeah that was terrific I I mean I think we may have shows developed we have something that absolutely might have something there but I took a few I took I think one meeting there but there was something fishy about it because you know you're like well everything has to kind of go through Jeffrey creatively and you're like oh well then what are we doing here he's not gonna want to deal with any of my [ __ ] you know Vicks [ __ ] bro Thanks right Epstein which one different Katzenberg and the guys totally disconnect I mean he's been like a billionaire for twenty years and how does he know what anybody wants and there's the gist of the article yeah anyways it looks like there would be some kind of come up and because of that attitude but maybe there'll be maybe it'll be like one of those things where they they they creator and then they rebuild and it becomes the most powerful media empire the world's ever seen it's too early to say what was the the what well the name wasn't the name isn't I said wasn't it's still a company apparently it's uh who knows I mean like the article said who lose a dumb everything is a dumb name my show off your salaries is a good name as a positive name that's what the shows about really but I have so many great ideas we could change the name of this show if you want what should what should we call

Anna thank you for checking in with us all the best it's good to be back city the day before you get to it Tim's voice have a prediction do you want to get you want to do the ad you want to get to our sponsor first or our prediction let's get to first of all I want to hear Doug's grievance I saw him chiming in he's got an issue what are my ears shot or is Tim's voice distorted OC I thought he's sounding too low to me whoa no boy I'll bring myself up here's our shot your shot dude the mix is fine on YouTube thank you this is just our headphone mixes we'll have two well dialed something that's cracked the code let's get through that first somebody's cracked the city of the day code and the way we're going to discover that is if that person would be so kind as to I've gotten predict what this is what the next city of the day is and now we can only assume that this isn't some sort of inside job is that person on the line who are we talking to yes I'm here I'm here this is mark mark Bay yeah were you calling in from Austin Texas not the city of the day not the city of the day okay so how do you want to play this do you want to guess the city of the day yeah I've I mean you guys made it a little complicated but I have a I have a I feel maybe like fifty percent sure I know the city of the day but this is this has become exciting now because if 50 percent odds are not good odds so this could go either way let's see how it goes City the day is Marc bases home of mayor Pete the Studebaker corporation Fighting Irish South Bend Indiana I'm sorry that is incorrect Wow tell me what you tell me what your this is this a bummer what a bad way to start the show I mean actually it's exciting to me I'm happy that you have no-one's crafted its well I have a [ __ ] bona fide alright I can say all right give me your second guess and then that'll be it alright second guess and this is very California biased of you guys if you go with this ego is correct [Applause] [Music] seems like he hasn't actually cracked the code though wow you guys just have a crappy code well what's the code like explain the code well that's the idea of this segment is that you reveal what the code is okay so you guys you guys are using a list of cities population yeah that's it Wikipedia yeah but no but but what's complicated is that on May 22nd they updated the list from 2018 to 2019 also the city list changed so you guys got confused and you started going up from where the city used to be but then you recognize it went back down I don't know about that I guess you're right I listen I see we got confused here's what I do is I'm a big idea guy I'm sort of like Jeffrey Katzenberg I big visions I have so many great ideas for how the show is gonna go so I say I come up with city of the day and I say how are we gonna do this an i Duvall devised the system of going from the smallest city by population up to the biggest and because so many small cities are down at the bottom and people don't really you know aren't really thinking about population size when it comes to these small cities I figure we've got something that's gonna be intriguing and sort of hard to crack for a long time now I send that off to Matt I sent it off to Jay or in turn they're doing the grunt work I'm getting on Wikipedia so whether whether they're updating the list or whatever it's not on me so I'm brothers I'm I remain unimpeachably on this issue I'll start [ __ ] banning people from patreon Chico Chico California city of the Dale okay thank you very much for your efforts mark thanks for

Republican as a independent that's right yeah I'm an independent I'm a registered Republican voter but an independent you know I've got a huge NPA following or independent following in the state of Florida we've got about twenty five twenty five to twenty to twenty seven percent independent voters in my district and then obviously we got a split between the you know registered Republicans or registered Democrats and what is your word Florida you at give us I don't know districts where what's your big city there okay so well let's it's Florida 18th congressional district it encompasses North Palm Beach County oh so it's North Palm Beach County Palm Beach Gardens Stewart Jupiter all the way up to Fort Pierce so we're in what they call the Treasure Coast are you in so you represent mar-a-lago Nomar Lago here's the interesting point you're gonna love this Mora Lago is actually in a separate district that's held by a Democrat so Donald has to basically do what the Democrats ever go what isn't interesting they they love it they love to torture the guy he's an Epstein country yeah you're done in Epstein so Epstein country where was he where is that your district as well so that's also Donald's territory yeah Mar Largo is on Palm Beach Charlotte and Palm Beach Ireland is in a congressional district that's held by a female Democrat and you know Donald and her let's just say don't get along in what's your background this is your first time running for political office first time yeah long long term businessmen international businessman I'm in the energy infrastructure business for the most part traveled the world lived overseas most of my life you know give it give or take and seem like a globalist to me no I'm the opposite I'm the guy that fights the globalist I'm the goddess going out there defending the flag making sure they're globalist don't take our businesses offshore your career your career up to this point has been global business have been big in this way well it's about basically using us manufactured industrial business components overseas versus shifting our manufacturing you see I'm the guy that basically tried to use our US manufacturing and deployed overseas not not not use Chinese and other other goods okay and how did you become how have you how did you become so-called quote-unquote awakened to this cue nonsense awakened what does that mean to you the Q the Q nonsense with the you know oh well you know listen I'm an independent right so essentially I speak a pure message and Q in all these other groups that you refer to they follow me out of all them what does that mean how do they follow in what way do they follow you you don't have any kind of leadership role in government or in business right now so what do you mean they follow you well I mean I'm still very active in business from a government perspective no I'm not an elected official that's that's the truth not yet so what what do you mean when you say that these people are following you and that you're not following them how are they farming I guess they follow my social media platform they follow our messages we do daily videos you know they follow they follow the truth you know what is the truth what is the truth well what truth would you like to talk about we have so many these days well let's talk about the deep state and the Q the insider that supposedly are in the deep state that is inside the deep state that is giving all this information out all this classified information about who's going to be arrested when they're gonna be arrested how come none of that's happened yet what is what is Donald Trump doing what does Bill Barr doing or isn't I mean you've got to be disappointed in the leadership of the administration well you know I mean how do I put this for for you and your followers right the old saying you have to beat the bushes to find the snakes comes to mind right so so let's just let this play out right I mean let let's let let's let the grand jury investigations that are being held it's been years dude well you know I mean it you've gotta be gotta be disappointed why hasn't cute predicted the pandemic that we ran why is there why is it all this stuff not sort of like you could look back to 2017 and say this is what the Chinese are gonna be doing not cute but you follow this garbage no I don't know they follow me you may follow me you've you promoted though you're talking about who you've been going after this week who's on notice beyond say you saw you go to what who the other way a little bit Patti LaBelle talk to me about Patti LaBelle what the [ __ ] did Patti LaBelle ever do that's got you all pissed off I don't know who is Patti LaBelle you tell me she's a duck she's a singer yeah she's a singer Lady Marmalade new attitude so why are you going after these there you go going after them you're saying that they're that they're always notice what is let's talk about what the real issues are the real issues are is that the globalists the leftist media and entertainment industry has been systemically poisoning the minds of our children and and that is the real issue where I'm attacking they're doing that they're they're doing it on they're doing it with an agenda oh I think why would it not be an agenda why what is the look at what's happening and in our schools today right we kid what you tell me I don't know my kid goes to school they come out they know how to speak they know how to read they know the alphabet they know how to add and subtract well I may do that let me give you an example you ask the question let's let's drop the hammer okay so right now are our good friends want to remove what the ACC the SAT tests from all of our standardized testing why because the kids can't read it right they can't they can't they can do it no they can't I've been a counterpoint wait a minute vixx vixx wisest teacher and the food's public schools in there they're underfunded they keep cutting the budget they don't they can't they have like 30 40 kids in a classroom and we think that's wrong with city is that with state California [Applause] the republican-controlled states are over funded and the education and Alabama couldn't be better seriously let me let me just kind of talk straight so look the reality is that if you look at what's happening in our primary education you look at what's happening in our secondary education they're basically saying to the secondary education system the collegiate system the junior colleges are above hey these kids can't compete so we neighbor to remove all of the standardized testing all of the credentials so that everybody just comes in on a kumbaya basis my friend that's not the real world the real world is you have to walk talk to them and you have to get a job it's a good example of the school that you're impressed by what school is that but no I'm asking you what what is the best school date that you're right right now right now my view is all of our university system completely both public and private has been compromised I mean they're all just they're add you guys must just live in cowering in fear it's so it's just like first of all you have got every privilege you seem that you I mean you must have tremendous wealth if you've been the natural resources of the world for the past 40 years no you must have tremendous wealth if you're if you're wasting your time I discovered because you you don't have any shot in hell do you of winning this election correct you know you have know 41 well you already know you're a goddamn joke hold on I have a say you're a goddamned everyone hates everybody I said that I was gonna interview you said well this is one of your characters right they think that you're a character of mine nobody by the way listen no hold on a sec let me ask you something where you you engage with the social you engage with social media you use Facebook you use Twitter you want the answer look my friend you can do you can do your own homework do you think a man like me steps into the political arena not knowing he's gonna win you lost your mind we've already done the whole world I think you're I think you've lost your mind if you have some kind of presumption about what that you are going to win you're not gonna you're not gonna make the you're not gonna state that you know we're trying our best is gonna be a hard race my I'm low in the polls there's already a formidable incumbent who people have no real desire to vote out of office so I'm not is that is that is that from is that from the Tim Heidecker parody account or is that from California central or where's that coming from what do you well I'm just saying my my quick observations in talking to people that know what they're talking about about your district now listen how much how much of your Twitter personality is bluster and and and silliness because you know you say something like I am July 4th 1917 76 which is just silly but you must be having fun with it right you must be having fun and by the way by the way you know what by the way just for the record okay we can do this any time because I'm an equal-opportunity you know uh you know basically American you know I'll talk to left the right to Center so let's be clear now you asked the question so let me close it out do we expect to wind a congressional district 18th Florida absolutely you know why the we've got the independent voters and we've got a big chunk of the Republican voters know that's the answer to the question now you can come back to that in November we can talk again well let me add let me close with this kW yeah which is whatever that means no one's have been clear by name keep winning what I what I what I'm what I don't like about what you're doing is you're going after people online in and maybe you're joking and maybe you're having fun with it maybe you're kind of doing the K fab pro wrestling style tough guy but these are real people and and I've been the subject of this where people that that believe in conspiracies they think there's some kind of child sex ring out there the pizza gate thing and it's damaging it's hurtful it's I believe it's on American I believe you're disparaging and disgracing people have worked hard and I consider them proud respectable Americans and I ask that you cool it down kW I ask that you come the [ __ ] down on the social media because you might not feel this way but I bet you've got some dope out there that listens to everything you say and maybe they're gonna make a mistake maybe they're gonna take take you too literally and think that they've got to do something about what's-her-name Patti LaBelle or whoever you're talking about so calm the [ __ ] down out there kW and respect other people because when you say that so and so's on notice and you these are threatening words kW shame on yet a lot of goofballs following you and then ya being my tack don't have some responsibility now because you have an audience we shame because all the your wackadoodle crack a little followers basically light up our message board every night they just

Charles the chicken who is a question for you [Laughter] q stand for they follow me up there celery Clinton not been arrested yet you don't oh I think it's a good question Charles but I think you should be a little more respectful why isn't Hillary Clinton in shackles why is truck so weak on this Jeffrey Epstein with Danni trap I think the problem is is well well you know here's here's here's something that we're looking at right if you want to if you want to go to that road my question would be how many times is Uncle Bill been on DEP Steen's island and how many times does uncle bill taking a ride with Epstein in a little candy stripers you know I don't know you're asking me you know you're asking me questions I can't answer I would be fine if they arrested Bill Clinton - there you go there you doing you think hey let me ask you a question do you think bill will be alive when it all comes out yeah I mean it seems pretty healthy at the moment I think he's eating well I amazing music is he gonna be a rock is he gonna be a Roger stone face it you know oh we can't put bill prison because it'll be a death sentence right you know because bill wouldn't last a couple days in prison right you asked you know you know there is there is the conspiracy theory that work that's beyond both you and me right so but you must know somebody's picking right you must know some of these creeps let's talk about the business okay the business I'm in right now is currently making a podcast one Scooby that's about all I got well you know and that's a media and entertainment right you're you're serving a public function for a group of people that that like to hear different views so why isn't the media for example and the entertainment industry which is funded by people that I used to work for so here's what we can relate you see the global private equity in the global hedge fund industry yeah and the global insurance company they fund all of the media they fund all they write the debt and the equity the issues for all of these groups that basically own all of these companies so it's a monopoly right now you're a free sort of monopoly because there's thousands of companies that are engaged in this you should have a concept of what of what manat their companies but they're controlled by you at the top oh the Jews is that where you're leading towards kW Miller or not at all SiC anti-semite working from me Matt Carlin here's of Jewish descent and I've worked all over the world and I've done more with the Jewish people and anybody on your crowd I can promise you where's my Shalom let's go where is it shabbat shalom bro this is Monticello let's go come on with the World Cup Cup what can I ask you a head we got I'm turning it over to Vic where's your puppet right here okay frog Vic the Frog as a question hello kW I want to know if the deep state is in charge why did they let Donald Trump win the presidency and why is he still alive yes the question is the question is why is the Trump still alive why is Hillary still alive that's a question you there's never a question you're thank us you're asking your ask another question why did why did Donald Trump win why was he allowed to win like this new voice I'm gonna give you the answer they ain't the reason that Donald Trump no yeah it's very simple it's because there's something called a silent majority oh my god you know what the silent majority is code for it's the opposite of minorities that's what it's it's a it's a term to [ __ ] piss off dumb white people and get them to vote because otherwise it they get they notice how shitty their lives are now just talk about minorities what about me I'm the man I'm not no you know what it's like you know such bad is one what is the black lives matter come on tell us I can tell you but you're not gonna listen you're not gonna believe it you're not it doesn't get change a thing well listen man listen listeners you're taught your clock is tickin people like you are the minority that's the truth you're not the majority you're the minority and people like you are going to start dying out the country's becoming more Brown the country's becoming more enlightened progressive on a number of social issues and you and your pals your golfing buddies and you know and I'm not saying you know you're going to die of natural causes most likely we hope I hope you're not gonna get kovat or hope you're not gonna get struck by heaven don't wear a mask when you go outside here Demick your your demographic is fading away and it's upsetting to you and I understand that because because it's it said a certain way of life is ending for people like you and it's being replaced by I hope something that's a more conscientious conscientious of other people it's a little more democratic it's a little more diverse bye-bye and you know so we're amusing you because it's funny and you're funny on Twitter but that's really all it is and I'm having fun with you so what you're saying is let's be clear now look I want to give you credit for what you just said what you're saying is basically the American dream people who basically start with nothing they come to that's never have or live here thanks everyone listen good let's start let's start with nothing that basically build their life from nothing to put themselves through school daddy didn't pay for temple like yours okay that go out and get multiple degrees that go out and work their ass off for 30 plus years that basically now that dream is over that they are no longer irrelevant in this society so what you're saying is you're gonna be fine I'm not saying we're taking in Noah's like in anything away fine it was my people I'm talking about the population of this country my friends there's the we people us people you people it's we the people come on get on the wagon brother it's we the people I'll tell you what you're what you guys have done the past 40 years and I that's why I'm so annoyed at [ __ ] like the the Lincoln project because hey they're so anti-trump it's easy to be anti-trump cuz the guys you know adult with a major major mental deficiency and as well he's coming you know probably you know dying of some kind of brain disease but it's easy to be make an anti-trump at president Crump is quick-witted but these people have been at this for 40 years my grandfather was a you know quite a conservative man but was also a blue-collar construction worker he did he'd uh he built bridges in Pennsylvania and he was a union man and he was able to retire at a reasonable age and have a reasonable retirement and live a long life without worrying if whether or not he was gonna lose his home or whether he was going to be able to feed himself and his family and the past 40 years the the the right has chipped away at that and it is destroying the opportunity for people to have a reasonable life where they can have a good job that pays well that provides them with benefits that provides them with security and gives them a happy end of their life and if anyone's to blame for that it is a right wing of this country since right and this is not Trump this is cultural 40-plus years I have to really show along kW hey shut up with you that I'm gonna have the last word it's my show goodbye and remind yourself tonight it's not remind yourself right it's not the right it's not right and it's not it's not Reagan politics my friends not very good economic of course it is Thank You Katie good bye all the best piece of time shame on you kW and delete your account [ __ ] bonafide [ __ ] and please not educated I wish you would have answered the my best I don't want to be on notice everyone in the in the zoom looks what do you call it trauma time yeah let's talk to somebody Matt Van Dam out of people awake who Matt Van Dam asked him you doing okay how's it going Tim I'm okay you know I'm filled with adrenaline yeah that sucks people like that are frustrating and you know it's hard they're grifters they're not gonna listen they just are gonna just drifting I'm sorry I should know you know I saw I thought I saw that I bet I thought I saw kW still in the zoom somebody's Ollie's you know he's fine I mean I got nothing that you know I don't know the guy I never heard of him the first is the ice so we want to bring him a national prominence so he can enjoy him for many more years forget him he's gonna keep winning I guess I don't know but you know it's frustrating because I'm gonna change my voter registration to West North Palm Beach star voting multiple forms through mail in ballots can I tell you I was born in it now I was born listen I was delivering there's troublesome troublesome politics there I understand that you know but you would hope think you could have a conversation people would listen and not just try to keep hammering in the same points that people could say four to three years and not even try T it's just frustrating because no one's no one's here any you know I know it's not really it's not really a good use of my time too it's weird that I could like get online with this guy and just because just like I would never do that in my real life oh I'm sure he doesn't speak for everybody I'm sure there are conservatives that you could have a conversation with maybe at this point with everything going on that wouldn't just repeat the same point or who knows maybe I don't know a lot I don't know a lot of conservatives you know I give you credit for having the conversation for sure but yeah it's it's frustrating that the guy didn't give me the honor here's a question though go ahead on a lighter note did you get to watch any beyond vaudeville just check it out I'm lost I don't see you send it to move I'm gonna lighten the mood and talk about a fun public X all right to public access no I haven't got used to watching so much fun you should I think you would love it I on here they have a YouTube channel now I just found them out I was going through I'm a tape videotape collector and I collect all this old TV [ __ ] I was going through these archives and I found I just kind of randomly found this show and it's surprising how underwhelming of a following they have you don't have a huge following at all how do we find it they are the butan channel it's crazy though it's from the 80s I guess they ran through the movies okay by the way I do want to thank Elias she in the room I can't believe can you believe these puppets by the way these are from Ellie a fan of the show who's sent us quite a bit of she does a lot of the beef house art and now we're a puppet show and I love using puppeteer and if you're listening to the podcast this is why you also have to watch the YouTube stream because you're not seeing these beautiful puppets but thank you Ellie and Ellie also sent a beautiful cartoon of her from beef house that she does on what's her Instagram handle anybody know I don't know anyways I always root wheat it or I always repost it so you can look that way Thank You Ellie ah would be a great shot if met switch switch over to this would be a great shot that's not a great shot there you go that's a great that is do I do your cartoon do your voice for for your robot welcome to our office our lesson is mouth [Music] anyways how about Diana Howland Diana Howland what's going on there Tim are you enjoying the show today I'm really oh well welcome to the zoo that you could drop in why don't we do this you you uh you ask me questions and I will not will be answering and drops are we answering in drops oh cool go for it I'm right now I'm studying for my veterinary technology class so maybe I could ask you some questions about the cattle and egg white industry you want to sell we'll talk I'm a sucker good conversation what's the most popular breed of dairy cow put me what about how hard I'll answer enough with those two I've seen if they're sleeping back there what did you astronaut how about how long do cows get milked for and how many times a day did you get milk I mean in the wild or in you think cows they know each other in the wild yes I do well they do they second calf sucks on the teat so a normal dairy farm or is there like some yeah okay so how many I'm gonna say they get milked every every 90 minutes for 12 minutes out of town no but that's it Wow alright give me another one let me see if I can if I can go two for two because I I got that one right Technic technically you know I think if you look back on that you'll see that what I was going for was essentially the same the rate at which they were milked is basically the same but go ahead do you know three stages of rumination yes yes I do next question please [Music] yeah do you know whether or not all these questions are boring as wait why do you know why are you asking these questions are you going to do say you're going to school for this or something yeah I'm trying to become a vet tech that oh yeah the holy cow it what's the gestation period of a cow gestation period of a cow I know this is 24 months yep it's just no I know I know I'm saying bro I'm saying nine months from not like 24 months would be what you would get if there was double that plus some let's move that was fair what I was going to if you say to nine times 12 yes anything [Music] it is a do we have a anyone on the phone map that we want to talk to here it's a tough part of being a vet tech sorry no questions from you how can I mean is it to put down the animals I could never handle doing that like putting down the animals like when you get a you get a euthanize them and stuff like do you just get like do you lose that part of you and I mean you know what I mean like yeah the way that Sophos you just I mean it it usually is makes sense for the animal like they're not enjoying and one more question like can someone just bring a dog in and be like I'm done with this dog it's not sick put it get it out of here I've told this story before have I told this story before about my parents they lived in this condo down in Florida of course and they live in this condo where they could not have big dogs you had to have a small dog and this guy moved down there and had a big dog perfectly healthy big dog but he said though they can't have this dog in this this apartment so great big bulldog he had it euthanized and stuff that's right and put it in his living room that's pretty [ __ ] up I shouldn't be allowed seams against the law anyways kW will drop yet last week right one of these guys at the at one of these towns that is beautiful is a kW right from a movie by the way kW one of the conditions of the interview was that he was going to be recording it on his end so that there would be no but he did he went through with the zoom and like I know he was against the that's like well we're live streaming this on YouTube so I don't know how we're gonna be able to manipulate him treated like a dog anyways now is there any is there something on my schedule here but it's not happening no that's coming up soon I don't think he's joined there I don't think Eric's joined the zoom yet but at let's talk to Kate okay Kate has a hole okay it's great but oh but she's got a muted stream Oh yuck Andrews Kate chef oh I see officer zefa hi do you want to talk oh we could you want to hear another opposing voice energy yes energy all the live long day all right well this is yeah he'd DM to me let me see if I can find him in the chat he's actually a police officer hmm interesting I've tried to be respectful you know in in in individual cases to police it's been I know it's difficult for some I am here can you can you hear me am I on the call yes a little officer oh hello mr. Heidecker thank you so much for having me on the program I appreciate it come on up sorry where you calling from is gonna interrupt me right away okay um yeah I'm calling from Oregon Portland Oregon so police officer out here but yeah the reason I want to come on the program is just to provide sort of a dissenting voice I know a lot of your viewers listeners probably have a an issue with the police and I just wanted to come on here to show you know we're not evil people we're thinking feeling human beings like you're just trying to do our job okay well I haven't been to I mean you know we've certainly shown our support for the black lives matter movement and we've had Alex Vitali on talking about defunding the police and understanding what that concept means but what was your point of view on that sort of interesting that I came for her to sort of a polite conversation starter and I just get nothing but animosity from you I throw an olive branch out there you take the olive branch snap it into and shove it up my ass and that's the way that it is I guess that's what I get for trying to start a dialogue with a civilian no I I apologize if you picked up on any hostility or animosity I am suggesting a drink today by any chance you said of curiosity no I mean coffee and some Lacroix don't act like that's a crazy question by the way as well I did a little research checked out some of your tim and eric' stuff and I'll tell you what you you're smoking something when you came up with that [ __ ] matters we get that a lot sir but yeah so what are people what do people have it wrong I guess would be my question like what well that's it that's a decent question it's not the best one I've heard it's a decent question I think the whole idea of abolishing the police for one I've heard that as a concept abolishing get rid of the police let's get rid of them in mind you those same people Tim and probably you included you'd be the same people calling us who are you gonna call Tim if your little kitty cat is is up in a tree who are you gonna call then I mean I don't have a cat but I I don't know maybe the fire department that's [ __ ] Fire Department don't even have guns how they gonna shoot the cat why would they shoot the cat in the leg you shoot in the leg falls down somebody catches it it's called police work [ __ ] oh Jesus man it's you know you came in accusing me of having some kind of hostility but you're the one that seems kind of you're using language and you're being very aggressive with me and I I feel like I'm you're started proving the proving our point here it's my point what what I want to say the de fun thing is I think that's probably you discuss it to fund the police and I think that's the wrong way to go personally that's all I feel like what you want to do is refund ad funds you want to do more funds and because what we need to do is we need funds to police ourselves that's the best system we've come up with so far we police ourselves we do something wrong we oversee it we look into it I got a partner he was that he assaulted this perp one time planted evidence on him I looked him right in his eye and I said you're a you're a bad little boy you're a bad little boy okay and and and he's I'll tell you what it guy has done very few assault since then very few that's indicating to me that he has done assault since then yeah so okay so you're gonna get hostile with me can we turn the recording off for just one second just talk man-to-man do you mind if I do that sure yeah okay we can stop the recording okay yes listen listen to me you little [ __ ] [ __ ] keep [ __ ] pushing me and see what [ __ ] happens you see how [ __ ] scary I am asked my [ __ ] family how scary you can't you can't cuz they left two weeks ago didn't tell me where they moved okay you can turn it back on now thanks so much Tim appreciate you having me on the program to give that dissenting voice and yeah I will talk to you later bye thanks Wow joke's on him we were recording the whole time in fact I one of my ideas today was to make sure that we were recording this so for authenticity so that we have a record of this just like my man kW oh [Music] they should have a special division of the cops that just do cats you know like maybe cops do too much stuff they're doing parking tickets they're doing speeding tickets when they all could be [Music] different just nice stuff and I like the ones that they dance like the cupid shuffle together and the Macarena yeah maybe the only building maybe all the cities should have these like orcs like in the Lord of the Rings those orcs that they that they grow underground only for when the protests come and these guys come up out of the ground and yeah I don't know just like a wave of orcs idea what is going on great ideas can you buy sorry about that can you believe that I do this show standing I think that's what never get no one ever gives me any credit for is I'm standing on my own two feet all day long doing this show that is so meaningful to me and I'm almost getting choked up oh my god you're my hero you guys pulled clips from that interview weeks with [ __ ] Larry Charles from right on brothers son of a [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] I played a game [Laughter] he's okay the kW so kg backed the Q stuff it's very like you believe something so much it's just where he does it so much and then when you ask him like oh no they follow me I've heard never heard of such a thing oh we don't have any Q followers why are they flocking to him IIIi do feel like how about Kate what's going on Kate you looks like you're there with your friends and family buddy there with his tank top on and you got some hippy thing behind you turn off your stream please let's hear it for Kate everybody okay okay your your your your you gotta mute the stream mute the stream put the bomb down alright enough of that I can't that was insane sorry Kate you've got to figure it out wave when you think you've got it figured out bastards a [ __ ] bonafide [ __ ] Hey [Music] let's try to retry Kade again you're saying this listen to what happens when I unmute paint be quiet guys it's got another caller he's got a show you're going turn your speaker off hey turn your speaker's off I think it's a lot of yetta's if you have speakers on the desktop just throw them away have we ever talked to Josh long oh let me just see if I can remember he said no Josh you don't want to talk people just like to look gays in now we've talked to Josh before he in fact josh has been yes many times no no that I mentioned hey somebody's from Montana here let's talk - from Montana hey what's up brother [Music] of course I do that's a cool place isn't it strange looking well it's you I'll tell you Butte is crazy man cuz it's like it's a it's a full-on mining city like a total one company town from the early from the mid 19th century they found a bunch of copper there and a bunch of other stuff and they just dug the [ __ ] out of that place they tore they tore the mountain apart and pulled everything out that they could possibly pull out what are you doing back to the mining song yeah there's a lot of cool labor history really strange I went down super hold on go ahead I did this they have a tour you can do of the mining the big there's like a mining museum there and they do a I'm getting a note delivered Oh interesting it's so distracting it was meant to be not distracting but it was totally distracting anyways what was I saying oh so we do this that you can do a tour of this big mining facility there that was it's discontinued but and I my and I along with Amelia who's six was gonna go cuz the younger kids couldn't go and I go okay I'll go and then at the last minute my sister said I can't go because her kid was acting up or whatever so as me and Amelia go on this tour and we go down this culvert into the ground about a hundred and fifty two hundred feet down into this mineshaft and about two minutes into this tour I go [ __ ] why did I do this why did I agree to do this this is an interesting or fun for me or my daughter and and we have this tour guide who's this college kid who is very knowledgeable about geology and mining and minerals and everything and it's me and my daughter and this other couple and their teenage son and this I just I mean I I do I don't really talk about much but I do suffer from like anxiety you know and I know you guys do too we all do in our own ways like maybe the anxiety Tim well first of all I'm going down into this tunnel and it's dark and wet and cold and underground and I'm starting to feel claustrophobic I'm starting to feel like this is not a good idea what if we get to do what a fantastic like like the classic my meeting tour trick is to turn off all the lights and then talk about some major disaster they didn't do that it wasn't like that I didn't do that No thank God and luckily my daughter was very cool about it but she was real quiet the whole time and this guy was going on and on about [ __ ] anthracite and whatever like and he had this tone that was kind of like desperate kind of talk like about the whole reason they did this was because if it would have caved in that they would have a bond oh no no no not this tone this was because back in 1918 233 a man by the name of and you ever get that thing when someone's talking and talking you're like if this guy keeps talking I'm gonna lose use it I'm gonna lose it stop stop stop and you kept going and going and wouldn't breathe and you know me I like to clown around I'm trying to make it a joke to lighten the mood here and there nothing no one reacts to it no one makes a note no one likes smiles or what was your joke I can't remember I was like you know it's just Montana but it seems like people talk super loud here and they don't want to hear anything you have to say yeah no it's an interesting about Santa thing but my background by the way yeah hey seeds purchases yeah so this is outside of Red Lodge Montana I don't know where you guys travelled while you're in we're we're totally confused by this so if you guys can help us understand we don't know if this is meant to be like like I'm in wrong right we're making or making fun of their neighbors I think they're like proudly dumb right they're like we're loops I was mature T I saw a few Trump flags out there and I just thought it was so funny that these monocle you know actually little Montana it seemed from what I was talking to my sister like the cities are fairly blue and fairly kind of progressive as they can be there but and and there's a lot it's like an independent streak there a lot of sort of libertarians type people but it's just funny to see that like these Trump flags flying in somebody's giant property there because God the guy can't mean name such an embarrassment to the guy and he's also so like the opposite of like what you would think of like a Montana sort of rugged guy would you know like he's all he's like this gossipy wears a lot of makeup and super insecure super insecure like mountain guys would look at that guy and just bury [ __ ] that [ __ ] it's been a pro-union state because of the mining and all that kind of stuff in the past I met my wife that I actually moved here from Madison Wisconsin last year July almost almost a year to the day we were at a bar like when you could go to bars before covet and a guy was telling us about how she's like Scott Walker our former governor and I was like oh really like what did you like about him and he was saying like well if he's pissing people off to me no he's probably got to be pretty good and uh I'm a public schoolteacher I was like well he's a union buster so is that Montana values or what he's like silence yes I got it we can't keep talking about Montana Eric Andre's on the line Eric where you calling from no you're on now is that you want to reschedule this I mean what's the problem why don't why don't we punt this can we point this same on you why don't we do this why don't we circle back on this when we have a better idea of your schedule why don't I do this why don't I why don't I bump this up in your email next week I'll just do a I'll bump it up so it shows up in your inbox again welcome to the show my friend how are you

did the same thing but with peanut M&Ms I've been honest about this when quarantine hit I got this party sized bag of peanut M&Ms and was like it was like they could have put one of those horse things over my mouth but you'll be impressed with me we were leaving we're up in Montana and we drove my family and I drove back two days ago we did it in two days but on our first big stop at like the Flying J you know Travel Center my life put a big bag of peanut M&Ms in the in the ashtray in the shopping cart and I said no and I took it out and I walked it back to her that's pretty brave well I

audience that's a little sliver of the audience I mean that's just it listen this is the number one show on the Internet now little fun fact about you and our friend Vic burger as you both went to Berklee School of Music I lived you wouldn't remember me but I lived a few doors down from you on in the dorms is that Vic's voice over here and just look in the camera technology just the Vics gonna come over and just be here with me there he is he's right here oh there he is okay yes you guys and apparently did Eric used to haze you all the time or so used to throw you in the toilet no no he was he was very loud and I remember hearing if my roommate and I were in our room one time and we heard I farted blood what is what do you play Vicki is triangle play everything guitar guitar piano majored in songwriting which is why I'm here today now here's the game area yeah here's the game I'm gonna quiz you both on music theory and see who knows more since you have a degree from Berkeley music let's see how you did or clearly Berkeley sued Berklee School of Music Bill Cosby gave us a diploma oh that sure is that true Eric the COS Cosby gave the the diplomas was our keynote speaker wearing all sweats guess what me too yes [Applause] Dirk and I are launching a Eric Andre and I are launching a advocacy group called alternative comedians for the innocence of Bill Cosby all right you ready for your first question yes okay this one goes to Eric what is the following which of the following is the parallel minor of C major is it C major C sharp minor a minor or C minor the parallel minor of C major I think is a minor you know what I would have thought that too but it's incorrect it's c-sharp minor C sharp minor does not sound Kerr well this might be these might be incorrect the answers we don't know we have minor yeah the parallel minor of C major is a minor right yeah I think so too what I don't made this this quiz it doesn't say let's try C sharp would not be correct no I know this is a mess hold on let me ask another can I ask another one now are you got your piano there right well good I'll do it too [Music] alright here we go here's another question the harmonic minor scale is different from the major scale because a it has an extra note B it has a flat 3rd and 6th it has a raised 7th degree it or it has a flat 1st and 6th ok here we go the harmonic minor scale is different from the major scale because a it has an extra note or B it has a flat 3rd and 6th see it has a raised 7th degree or D it has a flat 1st and 6th the harmonic minor scale is different than a major scale yeah because the harmonic minor I think has a raised yes so you say it's the answer is it has a flat 3rd and 6 but they say wrong - no it's raised 7th yeah flat 3rd and the flat 6 it is a flat 30 distinct from the other minor right any minor has a flat 3rd and a flat 6 and yeah natural minor would have a flat 7 but if it's a harmonic you would have a raise that's what I love about this I love I love not delivering I love putting them into a submissive place [ __ ] this is where we want the this is exactly where we want them I want them down on the ground

savvy she was in business for many years and how she's maintained the legacy of John Lennon in a very respectful way in all its anyways I digress how old do you think Yoko is she's 212 that's it woke up oh she's gotta be 80 I'm gonna say she's like 87 is it right seriously I know about veterinary stuff with cow Yoko's she's how old eighty-seven yes she was older than the gut than the the beats
