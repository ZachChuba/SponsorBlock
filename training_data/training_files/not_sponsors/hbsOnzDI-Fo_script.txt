this is absolutely sanity oh my god when you're gripping this don't grip onto it like tightly like they're holding on for dear life they call that the grip of death I like how they're using the very traditional type of stuff hey guys what's up I'm engaged I'm an actor and a musician and I've also been doing archery for about 20 years and today we're gonna check out this game called horizon zero dawn and check out all the archery skills in there be sure to LIKE and subscribe to more episodes of experts react your training will be hard I've heard that before whoa he's hardcore it took they put a lot on that I would say it definitely passes for a recurve bow it's just a simple one string attached from one end to the other it reminds me a lot of like what the Native Americans had used I like its traditional look especially the arrows they have that very traditional look with the feathers on the back and the arrow tip as well especially being wooden arrows I like how they're using the very traditional type of stuff especially like with the feather hanging down I like how it's got that homage to the Native American bows this is absolute insanity oh my god the pros about like a compound bow like this is they're fast they're durable and they're strong the cons I would say you know and you do have to replace the strings every now and that as for like are the traditional bows same thing you know but like obviously it's one string and it's much simpler and faster to put together whereas these they can take time what's great about that is you know I like how it combines the traditional arrow especially like with bow hunting and all that with a futuristic era you have the future and the past colliding together which is what I think is great about it damn that thing is huge oh it's is that like it it sound like a tripwire TriCaster what I've never seen that before from what I can see in the video one arrow shoots one end of the trip wire and shoots it to be the other and probably has some kind of explosive device on it it's definitely fictionalized I like the concept behind it I like the idea but I've never seen anything like it before she's dodging everywhere can't just imagine how tired you have to be after that I want to estimate the pullback up her bow I would say it's about maybe 30 pounds maybe 35 like where it's not hard enough to pull back like even 50 pounds it's gonna take a little bit of strength in the upper body to be able to pull back whereas hers might be more simpler since she's involved in like a lot of battles and all that she's gonna be more primarily focused on just proper aim so I would say like while her bow is probably more about just getting proper aim and hitting the target then obviously just trying to get strength out of it so a pullback is how much you're pulling back on the bowstring like that so what I'm pulling back right now is about 50 pounds that's how much I'm pulling back there's 50 pounds what she's pulling back I would estimate maybe about 30 pounds maybe around there which is much simpler so 50 pounds is gonna give you a bit of a workout there's even ones that go up to about I want to say maybe 60 70 pounds for pullback so yeah the pullback is I can be weight on the pullback is how much you're pulling back the more weight there is the faster that the bow will end up being shot so on a 50 pound ol bag you're looking at about two hundred and six feet per second in an approximate fifty to fifty pound 55 pound pullback so yeah oh come on really well I gotta give her this her aim is on point she's got good form actually I like she's got her back is straight and that's what you're supposed to do like especially in the beginning stages when I first started and even like with a lot of people is you know they lean back too much and that's the thing you don't want to lean back you want to just keep your back straight and go like that kind of like what she's doing she's got the thumb right up to her chin which is exactly where you wanted her left leg is in the front and her right leg is in the back and she's got an arm straight one I primarily focused on the crosshair and also when you're gripping this don't grip onto it like tightly like you're holding on for dear life they call that the grip of death so keep your hand relaxed keeping your back straight and then pulling back just like that and then you release and hit your target you know with a an archer versus a man with a machine gun it could be possible they could win the fight I don't believe it's a fair fight but you know you have somebody with a full automatic weapon shooting at you you're gonna be taking cover but eventually they are going to have to reload the weapon once they're out of ammo so that might give them a chance to come out of cover and take their shot so like I said depends on the setting depends on where each character is where the protagonist and the antagonist is set obviously I do believe that would be an unfair fight if you ask me it looks like an interesting game I would definitely try it it reminds me of like Zelda meets Jurassic Park and the Terminator like I mean they look like dinosaur machines almost which is cool and like I I've said it before I'd like how a lot of video games and even movies appreciate our children for what it is so no it's really cool they even say that video games just what originally got me into archery if you survived like the n64 era I mean and you know about to rock and all that then yeah if you like this video be sure to subscribe to experts
