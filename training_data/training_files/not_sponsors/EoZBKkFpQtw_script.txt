the collection log it paves the way for my account progress as i work on one task at a time randomly generated by my spreadsheet now that we're in the heart here it's time to kick it up a notch with some of the hardest grinds we'll ever have to face this is generate task season 3. [Music] in the previous episode of generate task we first got the berserker ring from dks followed by us visiting the mining guild to get the expert mining gloves we then killed the money gorillas for the first time on the account and got the zenite chart after which we got the magic fang from zorra with the new soul wars mini game we had to go there for the ectoplasmator medium task and we also got two more beginner clue uniques because of a spreadsheet change we completed the male addiction ward with the final shard from decals fanatic and finally got some crazy luck on the second demonic gorilla task today we are starting the episode with two more uniques from the hallowed sepulcher so we are visiting mauritania once again for that one and relax so it looks like we are about to get 350 hello marks because we need 100 for the hello hammer and then 250 for the hello to ring those are gonna be the next two items for us to obtain although we could still get lucky and get the strange old lockpick along the way as well and then we only need 100 for the hammer let's go to the apple car and let's see which one we'll have to get i think we have everything though that we need time for some more agility training 37k until 81 i feel like we might get that level on this task and there's 101 marks which means we have enough to buy the hello hammer so that's gonna be the first out of two items that we get for this task we'll still have to get 250 more for the ring unless we get the lock pick along the way but uh we'll see if that happens all right let's trade the mysterious stranger and let's get the hammer first boom oh apparently that doesn't give the message from the collection log that you get a new item but there we go there's the first one let's get the ring or the lockpick unexpected new pb there 153 on floor 3 i'm sure that that's still garbage but we take those and there's 81 agility coming in as well just one level away from the next floor also one second of the pb again we're gaming guys look at that we have the strange old lockpick that means we don't have to get the 250 marks to get the ring because we are done with the task that is a new item look at that untradeable drop oh no wait valuable drop this one right here that that's that's the marks we got the lock pick nice i thought it was gonna be the uh the new collection lock message but it doesn't show for that one unfortunately but we can move on so that means that next time we will go for the ring at 250 marks and then i think there's one thing else at 300 marks which is gonna be the last two uniques we get in the heart tier from hellotableclicker but let's find out if that's going to be the next task or not so we did end up getting lucky enough in the end there to get the lockpick and that means that the next task is going to be a pretty quick one as well it's not going to take too long to get the final two uniques from the hello topic we can complete this one for now we're still stuck at 69 percent hard so that means that the next house is gonna get us to 70. now what's that next style is gonna be let's find out straight away it's going to oh no man dude i'm just done with the other shard and now i have to do scorpio for the odium shard 3. we're going back to the wilderness already it didn't take too long but yeah at least that's exciting right wooly content always fun let's see if we get the scorpio but along the way imagine that that would be cool all right let's charge the toxic trident for the first time because that's what we're gonna use as well for killing scorpio here boom look at that lovely lovely lovely we have plenty of zorra skills for a while hopefully uh let's gear up and let's head out we are currently at 38 scorpio kc from the male diction chart let's find out how long it's going to take to get the odium one as well and then we are done with those wilty demi bosses because we'll have both the male addiction ward and the odium ward so that's gonna be very nice we are looking ready right we've got ice barrage we've got everything needed let's go and kill some scorpio [Music] wait how did that not freeze him anyways i'll just log out i guess all right we're chilling right that's gonna be the end of a first full trip where picare didn't interrupt us we're at 73kc now in total three 34 kills into the task so far no luck yet just some rune items that's gonna be kill number 50 in total on this task so far 89 kc i'm gonna gonna call it here for the day first day of scorpio done and there's gib hope he doesn't kill me because i am i'm like a weak lamb right now gabe don't do it okay he's following me we're all good that's gonna be the last kill of this trip unfortunately on the last trip i died against the peak air because he was waiting outside when i had no food left let's see if that's the case this time around now we're all good 134 kc now we killed 94 so far on this task so almost have 100 already the kills are fairly quick so it won't take too long to get to the drop rate which is going to be 256 in total let's see if we get it before that or not all right look at that 150 scorpion ac 110 on this task and we just reached 128 kc on the task which is the drop rate for any shard but in total we have 168 so i guess we can't complain yet about not getting anything this task 150 kc on the task 190 kc in total 200 total kc nice 160 kc on the task 240kc on the task and 200 no 200 on the task and 240 total yes that's what i meant to say just 16 away now from the drop rate of a singular specific shard and we are now at 256kc in total that means we're on the drop rate for a specific shard still only have the male addiction one though from the first scorpio task but i mean we are getting a lot of kills per hour so i feel like this still won't take too long even if we go dry but let's just hope that it's not too dry all right this is gonna be kill number 256 on the task 297 kc in total which means we are dry i suppose and we don't have the odm shard yet need to buy some more food just bought some more death runes as well to keep going we're getting closer to 98 magic only 116 k xp away but we're not done with the task yet so we we might still get that on this task who knows just finished another trip and ran out of trident charges so we have to spend some more money on death runes once again we're already at 303 kc on the task 345 in total and still don't even have a duplicate male addiction shot either 404 kc odium shard still not found there it is guys look at that 98 magic i [ __ ] up i throw scorpio i didn't mean to do that but yeah 98 magic just one level until that one is 99 as well look at that beautiful oh get out of here get out of here we have the pets oh [ __ ] it happened it happened i saw so much text in my chat window oh my god run how do i keep getting pets just give him my audio shot we still haven't had a duplicate metal diction either and we just got the pit we have scorpius offspring at 489 kc holy [ __ ] dude nah there's no way we actually got it let me go to ardy as well to go and insure it straight away yes guys that means that we've just completed the final boss bet task in the elite tier there was one more boss bet task that we would have to do in the elite here but we now have our fourth boss bet with scorpios offspring look at that oh my god dude i love it yes look at that little fella let me go grab some money and let me go insure that one straight away oh my god we're going dry on this stalls but that makes up for it i'm i'm not mad anymore i'm happy let's use the scorpios offspring on probita that's another 500 000 coins down the drain but look at that we've got the pet degenerate prime pet kraken scorpios offspring and skodos now i'll go and complete that task on the spreadsheet once we get the odium shard we'll just mark that one as completed but look at that i'm i'm so happy with this one scorpius offspring that means that if we get the odium shard that's going to be another section on the collection of completed let's go and get it wow 500 kills in already in total god damn i don't know how long how much longer we're gonna be here for this odium shower but hey at least we've already got the bet to show for it so i don't mind too much well we just did another 100 kills and that is 600 kc uh yes wow who would have thought another 100 kills all the way up to 700 kc already now i mean before you know it i might and ironically get 99 mage here but there's no way that's happening right uh but just to throw a little salt in the wound just throw a dragon spear at my face why don't you yes i'll take another one of those thank you please please 800 kc a prayer potion huh oh yes just what i needed slowly approaching that 1000 kc and i'm not a big fan of it not gonna lie 900k until 99 magic almost 20 mil hit points it's rough out here rough out here in the scorpio prison right we're at 900 kc now it just keeps going we're not done and we are not stopping anytime soon uh 1000 next stop we might go uh four times drop rate on this one again wow that took a while but there's the first duplicate shard the male addiction shard three coming in once again at 940 kc we finally saw something after like 900 kills on this task it's still not an odium but at least we have another male addiction shot to show for it as well ah yes let's keep going until we get this odium though all right here we go kill number 1000 the big one is another prayer potion that means that we are now approximately like two percentile uh of dry people which doesn't mean many good things uh we're super dry basically one thousand scorpio kc this is the crazy archaeologist all over again with the male addiction chart there but hey what can you do we're already 40 40 of the way to 99 40 jesus christ 40 of the way to 99 magic that there's no way that's happening right nah it can't be it can't be new collection log item odium shard three okay guys let's get out of here 1019 kill count run run get out of the wilderness we are done with scorpio thank god right before four times the drop rate because that would be 1024 but we got it at 1019 beautiful beautiful lovely oh that took like basically an entire week of scorpio to get this stupid odium shard three but we finally have it let's go and take the other two pieces once again like we did with male addiction let's go make that odium ward now ah yes throw back to the good old crazy archaeologist where we got four of these things ah look at that all three of them let's grab the wilderness sword as well let's go and put them together here we are let us use it on the thing how where is the thing boom odium ward has been made look at that i think that is our new range best in slot shield i think it's better than the uh the armadillo book right so that's pretty cool we take that we now have all three tsar shield colors look at that that's pretty cool we can make like different color combinations all right we also got a lot of loot to alk because uh our cash deck went down from like 39 mil all the way to 32 but it's gonna get back up there a little bit with all of these rune items i'll probably all them in a bit but first let's get this new task and let's see what that's gonna be after about a week of amazing scorpio content we can finally move on that also means that we are no longer 69 hard because we are now on to 70. only 30 left of the heart here i feel like this this went by very quickly but we still have a lot of tasks left so let's see what is gonna be next it's gonna be back to barrows for us we need one more unique once again let's go do some more barrows now before i completely forget i still have to mark the scorpio pet as completed as well of course because i got a new boss bed once again and that is the last one in the elite here so we are completely done with pets for now and that's pretty nice four percent elite now one thing i can do as well is go to the pet dab and mark that one because i don't think i've done that for the previous one either the pet degenerate prime i've got that one and now we also got scorpio right here boom four pets nice oh yeah now of course one more thing thanks to the fact that we got the the pet as well if we now go to bosses to scorpia that's gonna be the entire section completed look at that three out of three in 1019 kills we got the bet we got the odium shot and two male addiction shots that's looking pretty nice let's all all of these things real quick before we go to barrows let's see how much money we get back from that all right we are done alking we have 5.8 million coins uh so that brings us back to a total of 38 mil so we didn't really lose that much from scorpio that's nice to see and now let's get ready for some barrows all right here we go first chest of the task wait wait do we have the wait do it wait hold up oh i do have them damn it's a duplicate okay never mind it's a duplicate it's a duplicate we're starting with a duplicate 408 barrels just count no worries no worries i did also just realize that i should probably bring that lockpick that i got from hello sepulcher so let me take that one as well there's the other hammers let's add those onto them let's bring this strange old lockpick so the things i do still need from the weapons it's only one the veric flail we need one legs which is a derox playlist and there's three bodies with carol gotham and torrek and two helms with carroll scoif and verrex helm i think the thing i want the most right now is probably carol's leather top so let's see if we get that one oh we got an elite clue we can try and get another gasket here lovely hey we've done it we've got another elite casket that is going straight to the bank and now we can continue with the barrows grind only five chests in and we we've had duplicate torque hammers and an elite gasket now not too bad so far oh my god we got the varex helm 11 chests that is new right because we didn't have that look it's a new item but it didn't show with the uh plug-in but there we go we got it a new unique 19 out of 25 wow we only have six left in in 418 chests i feel like that's very good actually i feel like that's very good 418 uh just one item away from full actually we still only have full arm we're one item away from derral guthen toric and varek as well pretty good pretty good i like that 11 chests on this task is all it took we still have to get two more barrel uniques in the heart here though let's see what the next task is going to be we also got one elite clue gasket along the way again so that's a nice one let's go back to the spreadsheet so that was a quick one after the long scorpio grind that was only two hours of barrows and we completed it together with one elite clue as well two more barrel tasks in the heart here four more in elite do we get the back to back barrows no we don't we get the soul cape task which means we have to go to seoul wars and get 2 500 points to buy the cape well uh here we go the ectoplasm wasn't too bad because that was only 250 but this one is gonna take a bit longer all right let's go and get it hey look at that we earned 50 zeal in a draw i think that's that's good right that's about the max amount you can get i'm pretty sure so uh well 50 zeal done we only have about 2 450 left to go okay so i think we've got things figured out we earned 60 zeal on this victory we did also a lot of avatar damage to be honest 443 that's a decent amount let's try and keep applying this tactic and we'll see if we always get the maximum points just a matter of rushing the graveyard uh getting some fragments healing some people and then rushing the uh the avatar so uh let's see if we can keep this up it's time i have obtained the crystal halberd for the very first time because i got laughed at for having a dragon heli and i yeah i can't stand by that i i went for the crystal one yep now we're loaded let's go well with that 36 seal we got from that loss we are now over 1 000 zeal tokens just just another 1 500 to go well just a bit less but man this takes a while jesus christ so i i kind of messed up and stayed afk for too long at the enemy avatar and now i got kicked and can't enter again so i feel like buying a crate just once i know this is not gonna like make the task any faster if anything it makes it slower because obviously it might take longer but it's only 30 tokens so let's get a pet boom uh i did not get the bet i did not get the bet okay well that's a shame that's a shame maybe maybe next time if we do end up having 30 extra at the end who knows so we got 1260 zeals now sealed tokens that means we're halfway halfway to the 2500 just another i don't know how many hours left of soul wars but yeah if we get the max amount at least it takes a bit less long so that's nice there it is 60 zeal once again for a victorious game where we did everything we could and we are now over 2 000 zeal tokens just less than 500 left until we are finally done with soul wars i cannot wait but we're getting ever so close i can't believe it i cannot believe it four minutes left to like get six hour looked the game is seven minutes left no this is just pure pain i'm like 150 points away and and i'm getting punished oh this this is just oh man nah but i i just got six hour locked and now i'm now i've got a 10 minute penalty for leaving it had it had one minute 30 oh man this is fine it's it's only the final stretch we're almost done yeah this is this is okay we have made it the end of the very last game of soul wars for us because that is going to give us 60 zeal for that victory and that is 2 515 zeal tokens in total thank god for that let's finally trade the nomad let's go to other and oh my god there's a lot of things here now i didn't even realize but we can get the soul cape now which is 2 500 tokens done with the task is escape any good i think it gives plus eight prayer bonus and that's about it let me take a look here if it gives anything else it's only plus eight players so it might be useful at some activities where you really only care about prayer bonus but yeah there we go we've got it it can change from red to blue and the other way around that's pretty nice we are done with soul wars forever let's go and get the next hard task the soul cape has been obtained after about three to four days of soul wars i think it took me like 18 hours in total i'm not even sure i lost track but we got a decent method going and it worked out in the end we got the cape we can finally complete that 171 percent into the heart here now alrighty it's going to be more boring content or is it some more maybe pvm let's find out okay that's fine a unique from inside i'm okay with that because you know we do have two bludgeon pieces so far which is quite lucky to have those two as the first on side uniques we can find out if we can get the full bludgeon now we only need one more bludgeon piece but it could be something else that we get from the next inside but let's try and get a new abyssal demon task and let's go back to the abyssal sire once more so we have to go back to the abyssal sire we currently have a basilisk slayer task still so i'm gonna skip that i'm gonna start tutorial skipping again to try and get another abyssal demon task for that i need to do some preparations i'm going to cut some opal make some more bracelets because i completely ran out of those and as soon as we get that abyssal demon task we are ready to go back to the sire and we'll see what we get from the next inside all right ready to get started let us get rid of the basilisk task and let's start killing some cows also did i disable the basilisk yet no i didn't let me disable those because we're never killing basilisks again after getting the jaw there we go there it is 210 abyssal demons we are ready for some sire let's get geared up i think i might have to get some more supplies as well but uh we'll see how that goes once i'm ready we're gonna head out to the sire i think we are all set up and ready to go to sire let's head out i believe we have about 113 casey or something how much was it uh casey sire is currently 131 which is what we got two and cyrus in both being a bludgeon piece let's find out what we get from the next one hopefully we'll get that one soon as well all right first trip not too bad just warming up and we got four kills on the first one so that ain't too bad off to a decent start 135 kc now kill number 150 for some more jugs of water 19 kills into the task so far 150 in total not bad i think we've done three or four kills every trip so far so that's not too bad interesting guys we've got an elite clue scroll and some sarah bruce as well to go along with it let us see here can we do this elite clue what's up the entrance to the ice path well we'll give it a go let's see if we can do it hey we did it another cause i think that's number three now right add it to the bank not too bad next elite clue task we'll be able to open those again kill number 200 in total for some more jugs of water that's all we're getting 69 kills on the task nice well that was a big trip that was probably like six kills or something but we got another elite clue that's the second one on the task so far in 81 kills 212 kc in total southwest of april let's head out let's see if we can get that fourth casket in the bank now i also just ran out of charges on my crystal bow so i'll have to recharge that one recharge my arc light as well because that's 200 charges left and we'll come back after the elite clue as well we did it costco number four let's go back to sire we've got the bow recharge the arc light recharge we're good to go kill number 100 on this task 231 kc in total still no unsired inside we've got about 4.9 mil in loot so far uh we're also getting quite some slayer xp to be honest we're about 28 percent on the way to 93 already which is going to be the highest level we need in the heart here so we'll see how much more xp we get on this stars but yeah 100 kills in now guys guys guys guys we have an inside 109 kills in 240 kc in total let us make our way over to the phone and let's see if we get a unique oh here we go this could be our bludgeon right here this could be a whip as well or something else that we don't need as a reminder we need we need the bludgeon piece the abyssal dagger or the abyssal head all of those complete the task the pet does not complete the task the jar does not complete the task and the whip does not complete task either let's find out which one we end up getting here we go into the font of consumption yes we have a full bludgeon in 240 kill count let's [ __ ] go get the hell out of here we take those gladly take those kills three on sides three bludgeon pieces and we're done with siren the heart here lovely let's take all of those pieces out of the bank look at that accent claw and the spine put them together oh [ __ ] i need to go to the nexus okay hang on okay now now we can do it okay that's super scuffed holy moly we got it we've got it abyssal bludgeon on the task account oh my god look at that oh that's so good that is so nice 240 kc for the bludgeon lovely jubbly that is us done with sire for the heart here yep time to move on let's get a new task man what a great way to get the final unique from inside in the heart here three unsights three bludgeon pieces that's really all you could ask for isn't it especially in the kc that we had to get but we are done with the task and that puts us back to 71 after adding those shades of morton tasks which also means that the next task is going to be shades of morton in the medium tier because there's two more in there so there we go we have to go back to the shades of morton to get some of those new uniques that they've recently added to the collection log as well so let's see what the new version of shades of morton is like let's get back out there and kill some shades get some remains burn some logs and get
