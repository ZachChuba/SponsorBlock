ever since manufacturers first discovered the keyword gaming it feels like we've been on a bit of a slippery slope here you see at first gaming was used primarily to describe products endorsed by professional gamers or that had features that were somehow directly related to their gaming utility like headsets with noise cancelling microphones for example but then came gaming power supply's gaming chairs and gaming computer memory none of which perform measurably better than their similarly priced non-gaming counterparts so where does this path ultimately lead us to here today in this moment to the epitome of bullsh gaming marketing the gaming microSD card from HyperX today's video is brought to you by Thermaltake thermal takes gaming level 20 cases feature radiator mounting for water cooling gaming focused aesthetics and beautiful tempered glass panels check them out at the link below [Music] let's begin with an entirely on ironic read of the press release the HyperX gaming microsd card is an ideal storage solution for gamers who love downloadable context what are they finding these people and downloadable games but don't want to buy multiple cards or deal with long load times this card features read speeds of 100 megabytes per second and write speeds of 80 megabytes per second and capacities up to 256 gaming bytes so you'll get fast access to your games and you can download to your heart's content hyper exes senior manager for console business said that our goal was to bring reliable high capacity and plug-and-play storage to mobile gamers and HyperX is excited to make that happen already so as usual there's not a word about exactly what makes these cards gaming and the only performance claims are asterisk as per the tradition so let's start then by exploring just how they came to those numbers we hooked up the 256 gig version to a USB 3 port on our Z 370 test bench Va Kingston card reader and ran crystal disk mark which is what the HyperX rep told us that they used for their performance claims now our results fell well short of the 100 read 80 write claims coming in at 80 8.7 Meg's on sequential reads and sixty six point three on writes and then when we sanity check to these results with a sequential file transfer we ended up with very similar results now the disclaimer does say the speed may vary due to host hardware software and usage so digging for the truth we tested the card again in all four major platforms as you can see when paired with an X $2.99 motherboard we actually came extremely close to the stated claims with X 470 coming in at a close second alright fair enough then hyper X now we move on to our real-world testing mobile game loading time excuse me mobile game loading times starting with Android so we used a razor gaming phone and pub G mobile version 0.8 point Oh to determine how long it took from tapping the icon to reaching the login screen and believe it or not the gaming card actually managed to match our onboard storage on the phone which I guess kind of makes sense given that it's got the fancy new a1 speed rating which is a newfangled way of saying that it'll handle the random i/o necessary to run apps better than traditional SD cards which are rated only for sequential read and write speeds which I guess brings us perfectly to our next challenger our non-gaming high-capacity 512 gig card from integral this puppy is rated at 80 megabytes per second read speeds so not that different but it's bad out eh this card is slow morning when we first formatted it and on its first run it got absolutely stomped by hyper X's gaming card gaming sorry so at this point thanks for actually looking pretty darn good for the world's first gaming micro SD card ah that was until we followed up the test with a couple more rounds of game launches and the issues with our integral card disappeared never to be seen again so after that first launch anomaly our gaming cart is faster but only by about 8% or three seconds to put that in real world terms okay well hyper X is marketing barely even mentions phones anyway so let's move on to our next test device the Nintendo switch running The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild and in a massive surprise to no one just like with our smartphone testing the results came in only marginally different with the switches onboard storage being the fastest no solution achieving a drastic experience altering performance Delta over any of the others so um what's left to say then this is a perfectly good micro SD card with a lifetime warranty from a reputable company that will probably still exist in the time that you'd actually want any warranty service on this so we are not saying not to buy this we're just saying that there's nothing about it that seems to be any more gaming than the socks and sandals that I'm wearing right now and that the main takeaway today is that regardless of what SD card you choose the experience is unlikely to be dramatically different that is unless you're the kind of person who gets off on sitting next to people with cheaper SD cards on the bus and opening up the same programs as then then gloating about your loading times for three glorious seconds before they are sitting in exactly the same staging area waiting to get on exactly the same parachute bus speaking of gaming is yourself a new mouse and a new keyboard for gaming so thanks guys for watching if you disliked this gaming video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out
