and yet coming up slowly that's really Oh welcome back everybody to taser Drive I hope you're doing very well today we're gonna be further testing the autopilot safety and ABS safety systems today I've actually gone and got this blow-up doll that I have to have put clothes on because otherwise it wasn't appropriate for the video so it's about the child size which is perfect and we're going to test it out because last time we use the penguin and it wasn't sure if the penguin was a person or if it was a bin bag or a cone or whatever so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna drive down this road several times and we're going to put the little kid doll in separate areas and we gonna see how the car reacts in every scenario so this one here the car technically can go around it I'm gonna drive this at 15 miles an hour to start off with if we hit into her then you know we hit enter I guess that's just unfortunate but let's let's see what the cars going to do at 14 miles an hour my hands are completely off this is private road as well by the way and it thinks it's a cone it didn't even show her as a human it just thought it was a cone now that really surprises me because if we have a look at if we actually have a look at this human there is no way that that is a comb let's just just go up closer to it it's got shoes on it's got hair it genuinely thinks it's a cone how interested there's no way the car can mistake that there's not a person that is so clearly a person yet you can see it's picked up a person now early on and I'm just gonna let the car do what it wants now because this is just obviously a blow-up doll oh it thinks it's a car it might be a bike it thinks it's a oh it's not 100% sure it definitely knows there's something there it's come to a complete stop yeah it's definitely person so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna slowly accelerate at it and we're just gonna see what the car does oh oh no we run her over I know is she popped police say she hasn't popped off the one go you okay yeah you're okay let's try get up to 30 miles an hour and we'll see how the car deals with it this time autopilot on 25 miles an hour instead and yet coming up slowly that's really Oh oh my god no Wow Wow okay so let's just see how long this goes on for okay a long time apparently so basically what happened there was the car actually got a little bit confused whether it was a person or not it slowed right down and then right at the end you saw it changed values here it changed to a car to a person it's now as a bike and what it did is actually showed nothing continue to drive forward and then the ABS the automatic braking on the car slammed on at about 20 miles an hour through everything in the car forward and save this little girl's life after looking at this clip in post as well I've noticed one thing the car seems to think this is a full-sized adult and then at this point here it shows a car in front of it and then all of a sudden it shows a person very very close to it so what I'm thinking here is the car is getting confused about the size of the human and because it's a child because it's smaller it actually thinks it's a tool or adult further away and that's why it didn't break so hard at the start but then if you look as soon as it shows the car it shows another person in front and it realizes oh this person is really really close the ABS then sees the person come up on it's ultrasonic sensors and says we have to slam on so I think this may be a vision problem I'm not 100% sure let me know your thoughts down below in the comments now this is a test loads of people wanting me to do in the last video but I didn't do it because I didn't want to damage my car because I would have been driving into Jeremy Clarkson with a coal bag because we were using a coal bag to hold him up but this time I'm gonna be able to drive at this kid I'm gonna pretend I'm not looking at this point and we're gonna drive at her at 50 miles an hour and will the car stop or not I've got my foot on the accelerator will the car stop incredible oh my god I have never felt that before but guys that that was insane this time I put a camera outside as well so hopefully you can see from that angle I'm gonna go at 20 miles an hour this time and I'm gonna accelerate and I'm not gonna let let off and yet again we've had the exact same problem happen but this time it showed that it's gonna hit the child and break as much as it can to reduce the impact as much as it can look closely at the screen here you can see that even though the child is pretty close it looks like a full-grown adult on the screen and it's further away but in a few seconds that's gonna disappear and it's gonna all of a sudden peer really close read slam on your brakes that is a small person close that is not someone big far away you can see it does as much as it can to slow it down and it hits her at 10 miles an hour which really isn't good so hopefully this is just gonna go around her here with no problems autopilot on at 17 miles an hour isn't showing any one on the screen yet as you can see but it should be able to go around her without touching her and that's exactly what it's done absolutely no problem we're gonna try the 30 mile an hour test here so she's really far down the track as you can see we're gonna get autopilot on we're gonna put water pilot up to 30 and then see how the car reacts again nothing touching here I'm not touching it at all the car has come and braked perfectly and then sadly it's accelerated over her see I don't understand why it does that it knew that that was a person it actually said it was a human or human on a bike yet it still continued to go over her and I just don't understand why it stopped down to basically zero but then it continued to fly on I was really hoping that it would have stopped and then if it tried to continue again the ABS would have slammed on like it did last time aborted everything and said hey there's a human there here we go at 30 miles an hour will the car stop for it a wall that goes straight through him a little bit nervous cuz this is gonna be a hell of a stop if it thinks it's a person oh it did oh so you saw that it said automatically emergency braking but then for some reason it didn't brake and it just kind of went through so I took my foot straight off the accelerator pedal which is what slowed it down to here but weirdly enough it didn't actually fully break it think there's an arrow there as well oh I'm not I don't know I'm not too happy with the results that we're getting if I'm being totally honest I actually didn't want this to run her over at all today but as you can see from that it's not a pretty sight and that brings me to the rather serious topic of this video I was pretty surprised by the inconsistency that we had here with the autopilot and with the automatic braking system I honestly didn't expect the car to run over this doll I know that it is a doll but it's a 3d doll it's very clearly a person I even dressed it in my daughter's outfit so it looks as much like a human as possible and there's no way a human would not be able to see that and say that a person I need to stop and we were really surprised to get some just strange results the car thought it was further away and then realized it was closer and that did some damage sometimes it slammed on and broke perfectly it's just flawless and that was great sometimes it thought it was a bike and that's not really a problem if thinks it's a bike as long as it sees its a person and it BOTS and it stops you that is what you want but towards the end we got some pretty inconsistent results it didn't stop at all a couple of times did some serious damage and I think really needs to be looked into the biggest for I can see is that it thinks the item is further away than it actually is and then when it gets close to it it panics realizes how close and slams everything on or just sometimes doesn't because it's too late maybe lidar would help there who knows let me know your comments and thoughts down below in the comment section this is a real serious topic and I would actually love to know what you thought about this and whether you thought it was gonna hit this blow a doll at all let me know down below hit thank you for watching and shout out to all my patrons don't forget drive safe
