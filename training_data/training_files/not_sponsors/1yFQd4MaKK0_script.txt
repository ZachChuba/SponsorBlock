on our last episode in this epic series you guys saw the not quite $100,000 PC finally finished and ready to concurrently edit six 8k read videos but we cut the video short just before we loaded up our editing software Adobe Premiere and then made our editing team actually try to use the thing but don't worry because right after this word from our sponsor that is exactly what we'll be doing private Internet access that's exactly what you'll get with PIAA a safe and protected IP and it's got loads of other features as well check it out at the link in the video description [Music] if you've already seen the rest of the videos in this series you can skip to where we test drive the system but if you're new here's a rundown this is the $100,000 PC or 6 8 K editors one cpu project it started out as a sparkle in my eye more than a year ago when I began to wonder if we could take the 7 gamers one CPU concept our 7 user virtualized gaming rig and morph it into something actually productive like for editing our videos from there we spent months part shopping online troubleshooting broken hardware and testing different configurations in an effort to build a single machine powerful enough for six concurrent users and without the traditional virtualization headaches like a lack of hot pluggable USB so let's run through it now I couldn't get the Quadro GV 100 graphics cards that would have brought this build up near the target $100,000 mark but I was able to get my hands on 6 Nvidia Titan V's which have essentially the same horsepower just at about a third of the price think of it as kind of the Audi r8 to the Lamborghini Huracan 4 CPUs the plan was to use the two Xeon Platinum 8180 processors that Intel graciously sent us so those are 28 core 2.5 gigahertz behemoths except that I dropped one of them off the table and broke a memory channel we can't have one of these 32 gig ECC memory modules from Kingston not working so we ended up having to buy a matching set of qualifying sample CPUs on eBay definitely took an L on that one in order to reach our target of two USB ports for each editor one stop systems provided us with this crazy PCI Express expansion board which took one slot of our motherboard and turned it into eight that gave us room for the six USB cards that we'd need one for every user as well as a 40 gigabit Mellanox network adapter now mounting it wasn't particularly difficult but it did require cutting a massive hole in a case that you literally can't even buy anymore which sucks in its own way for storage we ended up use some fancy MDOT - to you - to PCI Express adapters to plug in our dual PCI Express 960 gig obtain nvme SSDs these bad boys have excellent random i/o performance which is important to keep program loading snappy when you've got multiple users hitting the drive at the same time so we combined all that with a bit of water cooling hardware from ek some power supplies from EVGA talking 3200 watts total and some hard drives and we've got a recipe for a seriously badass system now the problem is when you play with this kind of semi experimental setup you're bound to run into some issues so in our case that manifested in our first choice motherboard from Asus which after days of crash troubleshooting ended up having a BIOS defect that they say they fixed now but we haven't verified that caused some of the PCI Express slots to not bifurcate or split properly as a result our virtual machines kept crashing thankfully with the help of linux guru Wendover door and got it diagnosed and the guys over at ty n sent over something that just worked right out of the gate so we switched over to that giving us our sort of sexy but in an industrial way and definitely not $100,000 final build we've already made sure the VMS work and the cooling system is sufficient so all that's left now is to SiC our editors on it and see if it can actually handle the load so now we're at the moment of truth we are taking it into the editing den and for better or for worse we are having our editors try all at the same time 6 editors to edit 8k footage off a single machine there are a couple of things we need to do first though one is I need to pull this power supply out Oh including its mount thanks Jake oh we're having fun having fun already and we need to swap out the 10 gigabit network card that we have in here now for this 100 gigabit network card now we're only gonna be using it at 40 gigabit we're gonna be plugged into our Dell switch that's in our server room using a fiber optic cable that Mellanox very helpfully sent over to us but the reason that we need to go from 10 gig to 40 is because even though 10 gig is lots for a single editor editing 8k video if you have six editors x 8k you are well in excess of ten gigs so 40 gig should be plenty one other small upgrade I'm making here is both the one stop systems daughterboard card and our 100 gigabit nic are really designed to have like server airflow over them so we're just gonna throw this fan on here did we figure out the final price tag for this thing uh no it's like 30 or 40 grand I think it's pretty good it's a lot less impressive but yeah well we didn't end up putting quadros in it that would have pushed us to 100 grand you know what the craziest part of this is this looks like a relatively economical solution compared to the new Mac Pro uh-huh you buy Mac Pro's for six editors seriously seriously a base spec and you're at like 36 grand already this is a boat competitive I think with the base spec it has more RAM better graphics card 64 gigs of ram you'll have your own Titan V it's water-cooled look how horrified all these people look so guys remember how cool it was when you each had individual editing workstations Oh new paradigms a single tower and everybody just plugs into it the great idea so some of the cabling for this setup is admittedly a little bit janky I'd like to take a moment to bask in the elegance it definitely froze of our solution here okay I may have to restore give it yield restart if you didn't pick up on this at any point prior to this moment in this series this is not actually a solution that we're endorsing this is a super super clergy weird stupid hack around for lulz now all we need to do is enable ah that's quite strange a Logitech software go away please I can't deal with this right now oh wow go away please well 2 for 12 leet is that gonna help me okay Tessman holy crap you don't get to go on top of task manager what about this one okay well that's a lot better you know not like that I mean I guess technically we can move forward with one monitor okay so theoretically we've got a 10 gig virtual link let's go ahead and you might as well see if it works at all right okay we just broke one gigabit per second so we're up sitting around 1.5 to 2.5 gigabit per second while we're loading in all the files here I've had better at least one DisplayPort cable is dead out of three clearly when show needs to start at some point so and also this timeline is super super super chunky it's very slow I mean it's premiere only spazzing out when I try and go full quality maybe I'm just getting too ambitious here here we go I think this is a network problem like I don't know playing okay it seems to be playing normally now this is you know at the beginning come on come on they took a while below the strike loading up it was a bit of a hitch there F oh there we go there's a couple dropped frames at the MA anyway so let's try one quarter just because we knew this wasn't gonna be like the most powerful worse day she always work on one quarter Oh just pause just off yeah just wait a little bit the premier whisperer yes I don't know what's going on yeah see it's like weird super weird you know okay maybe I'm read doesn't like handle this well that was not successful but there's good news so we spent the last week tinkering with it and it looks like resolving our performance issues could be as simple as enabling a feature called huge pages now under normal circumstances when you've got virtual machines running within a host operating system in order for those VMs to know where to find their memory there has to be this table or a map of where their virtual memory corresponds to the physical memory of the system the problem is that the default size of these you know little table entries is only four kilobytes which is tiny so you've got 384 gigabytes of memory you end up with so many entries on this table that it can't all be contained and instead of just referring back to the map for where the memory is the CPU has to calculate it instead which adds an enormous amount of CPU overhead so with huge pages we take those four kilobyte chunks and we make them 2 megabyte chunks which drastically reduces the size of our table and therefore our CPU overhead now by default on raid doesn't have this feature enabled they had to send us over a special build because they didn't observe any performance difference between regular pages and huge pages but they probably didn't test with 384 gigs of memory and six VMs running a RAM intensive workload so we've got it and we're ready to carry you back in there and give it a shot right hey oh you want to go in this way actually well that's what I was trying to so we had some issues with our super long DisplayPort cables last time some of them didn't seem to be working right so we're going slightly less ambitious one monitor per editor this time around we've pre-tested these cables what you plugged in the other end of this though right oh well this is just broken so our latest problem appears to be cable slash monitor related we ran an HDMI cable to Dennis's station and no problem okay editor to Taran let us know if it lights up hey you know what I want I want a DVI back I loved DVI you know why cuz it worked so we don't have enough long HDMI cables but what we do have is couplers and at this stage in the game I think it's more likely that two HDMI cables with a coupler is going to work than these stupid long DisplayPort cables there we go it's all yeah I got it all right we got six sex machines off some yeah nobody move okay good can I get that soundbite good you're gonna fire up After Effects what are you trying to do to us here you say yours Nowell I'm gonna just do whatever you got to do okay so Dennis is hitting it full ham CPU usage at around 70% can you even like Mouse bro we don't know we've never tried this before ad no one has ever tried this before why are you talking about your popcorn chicken or about the editing experience one point eight gigabit there you go it just had a bunch of stuff stored locally oh ok gigabit yeah 3.2 gig right now 5.4 what are you even doing Oh after effects is still in the background Dennis you're killing you're killing the server and everything no no it's fine it's fine it's fine this is what we want to see okay so Genesis is running okay now yeah everyone make sure you're doing something as heavy as you can right now let's see how much we can make it hurt so we're at about 46 47 % 55 59 68 okay how bad is it chugging kids whose being 1 Hoffman what are you doing what are you doing so guys with everyone hitting it hard how bad is it how would you compare it to your regular workstation but does it on your regular one I don't okay so like um but like is things the same pretty much the same okay and how would you compare to your regulars do you have an edit video anymore you know what forget it it's better it's greatly better than what what yeah isn't as good as the other ones oh okay ok pella how would you compare this to your regular machine I'll go one down can't do it perfect you'll go one down 9 at 9 out of 10 score okay Alex passable passable it works for one screen okay other than the monitors other than the monitors I can't no I'm not there's no way I'm what I'm not doing it well though cuz we could solve Weeksville monitors is solvable that around $400 per editor we just didn't want to spend the money well we're not actually deploying this technicalities come on out of 10 out of 10 performance responsiveness yeah [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we're looking at a 40 gig connection here and we're gonna have everyone play back phantom footage everybody ready go ahead and hit it let's see how hard we can make it hurt 8 12 13 oh just 14 15 gigabit per second ouch alright so the last thing I'd like to see is everybody just grab a giant file off the server and copy it to your desktop when I say go okay I want to see how close we can get to 40 gigabit because theoretically we should be able to saturate that connection Windows File Transfer though still 3 2 1 go oh oh how much space is there there only 100 Gig okay you've got to find something under 30 gigs okay so I wanted to have 4 octane drives in the machine but remember we had to change motherboards 6 months ago ok 3 2 1 hit it 312 1921 so would you how what are you guys getting approximately each three four 500 megabytes a second not too shabby not full 10 gig but not too shabby either oh we're done that's it six editors one CPU is complete and I think it's fair to say mission accomplished boys because all of our editors described it as eight and a half to ten out of ten like their usual editing experience on you guys have 69 50 X's right is that right yeah I think so they have 69 50 X's with 64 gigs of ram and then they've got Titan X Pascal's or Quadros oh you youthful a quadruped that's fine doesn't matter the point is this plate makes save 15% through the link in the video description if you guys dislike this video you can hit that button
