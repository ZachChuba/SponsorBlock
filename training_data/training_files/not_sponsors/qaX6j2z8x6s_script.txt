hello everyone and welcome back to episode three of the vanilla ultimate iron man last episode we actually snagged ourselves that juicy pair of green boys on our feet and straight afterwards i just happened to get a skeletal wives task so i figured we've got the task we've got the range of boots and no time like the present to get ourselves a bit of gp and that is the first of many elite clues i say and i think i'm just going to leave them on the ground as realistically i don't have the stats or the items at the moment to tackle them so it's really not worth my time to leave here and then wait another 20 minutes to lose aggro over and over when i've got myself a good spot yeah that's uh that's a little unlucky wow okay hey and that is level 63 prayer a nice little bit of passive xp on the side whilst we're killing these guys for money so i don't quite get what's going on here but these guys are full d-hive maging the wyverns and the wyverns have really high mage defense so after a little more digging it seems like all these guys are venezuelans and they're maging the wyverns so they don't lose their spot when they go afk as they're just gonna splash on it every world is full of these guys and the rangers are definitely real people it just makes me wonder how many accounts are being played by one person i missed the initial clip but we are now over one mil gp in the cash stack actually some of the best money making i've done on the account in a long long time and just quickly only about 40 can change your mind at any time cheers and that is level 89 ranged oh dragon med helm that's actually the first one i've ever gotten as a drop pretty cool i will have to look up the level that i need because i'm pretty sure there's a stash for it uh but i don't know if i can build it just yet okay so according to the wiki it's a part of an elite and master clue so we're just gonna have to alk it as the construction requirements for those stashes are 77 and 88 and we're not even level 70 yet so i'll just get another one later down the line thank you for the free herb xp and that is level 64 prayer just had to top off the broad bolt supply and burn the 5k fletching xp off the next level and we just missed it for level 90 ranged i don't think i'll go all the way to level 91 whilst we're here we only needed around three to four mil gp just for level 70 smithy and construction so i think i'll stay till around 1 000 liven kills and we'll see where we go from there level 85 hit points just call me mr no sleep as that is 1 000 wyvern kc completed got a solid amount of xp and a really solid amount of loot just over four mil gp a solid amount of addy bars runes to sell off still and a whole heap of seeds especially around our seeds we're looking in the green for that and that is a solid amount of herbal or xp that we've just stacked up so all round i'm really happy with that and it was just a nice bit of afk on the side and that is the last of the runes sold off there we're almost at 4.3 million gp the most money this account has ever seen and we still have these magic logs that once we get the fletching level we'll sort out into magic short bows and these addie bars will go down well once we get the smithing level and here we are over at the blast furnace we're using gold ore currently and the goldsmith gauntlets we're going to go for level 70 so we have the rex song of the elves that is level 56 smithing right there so we have quite a ways to go level 61 smithing i decided to hop over to iron bars instead of gold ore as it was costing us quite a pretty penny to get the gold or xp so a bit less xp an hour for saving some gp is definitely worth it and there we have the level 70 smithing that is the smithing requirement song of the elves knocked out i was gonna hang around until i had the smithing level to turn these adi bars into addy bolts but i think i'm just going to hold on to him and pop him on my looting bag so we're going to move on over to trying to get level 70 construction now okay then here all of five minutes and we've just got ourselves the talisman already fair enough i'll have to go and farm up some more fangs and i don't really have the invent space or the thieving level to continue farming these chests but the zerex talisman is going to be our replacement for the hot air balloon construction training method xeric's lookout takes us right next to the wood cutting guild where we can chop and make planks and that is another talisman a very nice amount of thanks for dismantling that we only need around 260 odd charges so this gets us about halfway there and there we go the last talisman achieved just dismantle that thanking you and that brings us up to 283 charges that is more than enough for what we need so we can move on killing the lizardmen got us to around 50 favor and now we have 100 just from doing some gangs got a couple of planks you know a bit of extra construction xp but we just polish that off and we'll go lock it in and there we have it three out of five shazian favors completed and that is level 63 construction seven levels to go level 64 construction and that is level 71 wood cutting honestly the construction xp an hour in between this and the taverley hot air balloon method is only maybe two to three k an hour difference so this is a nice alternative for not having to go and do an enlightened journey level 72 woodcutting just from chopping oaks level 69 and you'll never guess what's coming next level 73 and there we have level 70 construction completed much much slower xp an hour than the smithing grind but we're done i've actually got to look into what i can build with boosts and crystal saw now as it opens up a whole new world of possibilities but that is the last construction training we're going to do before we reach prooftinas and now with the construction ground finished we're on to mining it's occurred to me that i am essentially completing toronto only in one episode so if that puts that grind into perspective for you there you go and there we have level 70 mining achieved my least favorite skill in the game there is nothing worse than having to power mine iron but that is the last of the mining i'll have to do for a little while snagged ourselves a chunk of these unidentified minerals too just going to help our subs to some bags of gems i don't even know what we're going to use them for but we've got to do something with the minerals back out here at tithe farm working towards another level 70 and this should be level 66 farming and there we have a level 70 farming completed xp rates here once again similar to mining not too crash hot but it is done we won't be back here for a very very long time i also found a use for the rubies i managed to score from the gem bags earlier 237 rubies to go till i can get the medallion from this place and then i can actually mount a dig site pendant on the poh if anyone knows what to make of this please let me know d boots dragon defender full rune obby cape and bronze crossbow against goblins very nice and that is tower of life completed just gotta kill a sword chick down here for an arty medium task we're actually gonna try and smash our way through some of the diaries so that we can get some xp lamps and put them straight into herblore it'll be one of the best ways to get our herblore up and once we're at level 60 we can use the rewards from sins of the father to get 45 000 herbal or xp and there we go a medium task completed i can't tell you how long these strawberries have been here it easily has to be over six months thank you past me for allowing me to complete another medium task scored ourselves a grapple hook for one of the goofiest looking animations we're just gonna go around now and complete all the grapple hook shortcuts that we need for diaries i just started iclarin's little helper for the desert diaries i also needed a cat for rfd so it works out quite well i'm just going to be careful through here is the pyramid is an instanced area and if i die i lose everything in my invent and everything in my death bank ah that's some free herbal or xp back there with that imp but i can't get to him because of the mummies i just hope he comes over to the other side oh my god it's an instance oh and he just disappeared oh come on i just want my herbal or xp man i remember getting stuck on this quest when i was a kid i think i lost the jar or i picked up one of the wrong jars i couldn't tell you how i was never able to complete it but uh eight-year-old me must have had some issues this is a very easy quest completed exlarian's little helper and an easy desert task ticked off and there we have the easy desert diaries completed for two and a half thousand herbal or xp that is equals peak done a very good quest to have ticked off as it's needed for a lot of diaries and that is all of the eagle diary tasks completed and if we whack the teasing stick right here we can gain access to it again and we're sorted that is spirits of elite completed and the medium task for visiting the genie and another medium task for praying at the altar and that is anakras lament completed and level 74 magic and our desert medium diaries are done for seven and a half thousand herbal or xp and level 48 herbal and that is between a rock completed so now we can do the fremunic diaries this is probably one of the riskier things i've done on the account i have to make it all the way to the other side to the lighthouse for the diary if i die here i wipe my account and i've never been down here before so we'll see how it goes and we're almost there that was honestly a lot closer than i was comfortable with and that got very hairy for a bit but that is the medium task completed and now we can head back and claim our herbal or xp and we have two xp lamps here for 10k herber xp which will push us over the line to level 49 herblore just scored the cutest little guy if you guys have any ideas for names chuck them in the comments i'm thinking jeffrey and that is the kandaran easy diary done for two and a half k herb or xp and just broke one hundred thousand total and that is level 50 herb law and the kendaron mediums completed for 1650 total level on the vanilla uim 50 herb log gives us access to a few new lamps requests and one of them involves us getting level 70 cooking so we're out here in zaya going for level 70 cooking so we can finish off rfd and get the 20k herbal xp label at the end of it it's going to be the first time i've ever taken it on in the history of me playing runescape and i can't wait to share it with you guys but that'll do for today's episode and i really hope you guys enjoyed it we made a ton of progress and it's just going to keep up into the next episode so i'll see you all next time you
