this episode of Indy mogul is brought to you by Monday calm as a producer you want to give everyone the tools that they need so that way you're on set and like there's no fires we didn't forget anything it's always some fun I don't care how big your budget this is always some fire what's going on any Mugler's today with my buddy Moses Israel is is a fantastic producer that's just had a second feature go to Sundance he's produced videos for people like Diplo david smith wiz khalifa a lot of the big artists out there and today we're going to talk about what it actually takes to produce a video or a film from start to finish all the way up until that shooting day so you've got a script you've got an idea you want to start making it but you don't know where to start this video is for you so today Moses the Edit team has actually pulled out three scenes from a movie now I don't know what movie it is I haven't seen it either of us have seen it here but we're gonna watch that first scene where to pretend as if that scene is the short film we're gonna walk through how to produce it and then at the very last minute we're going to add a second scene and all of a sudden we're gonna make the movie those two scenes and see what changes in the Prussian schedule okay and then finally we're gonna add a third scene all of a sudden the movie is going to be all three we're gonna see how it actually changes the actual prep for the movie and how to put it together alright alright sounds pretty common the director is uncompromising so everything that you see in this film here we have to prepare for there's no going to the director and being like sorry we can't make this scene happen because you don't know you gotta pull together and you gotta pull it together in two weeks is gonna be a challenge do this roll the first clip alright okay we got Lowell and this is the movie we're watching here Damien Chazelle Academy alright okay so we have our location mm-hmm looks like we're like in a upscale restaurant there's a nice grand piano some beautiful slick wardrobe nice soft lighting mm-hmm and in the restaurant there's already like 30 to 50 people sitting down nice beautiful look that looks like anamorphic lenses napoca anamorphic lenses there is our wide shot of the restaurant so there's a lot of art here right there's a lot of lighting a lot of GED stuff here nice camera moving look at that thank you okay all right gaffers gonna need to have a DMX thing going but actor needs to know how to play the piano I don't think they teach them the Mickey Mouse Club they do so far like this could be in a stage it could be on location in a restaurant not bad it's not bad it's not bad this is manageable two weeks out for yeah hold on it's not over Emma Stone okay he is Oh JK Simmons Academy Award winners of course Oh for the most part one location three characters pretty solid yeah I think this is a manageable thing for two weeks out the very first thing is I would probably read through the script and break this down in terms of like a day out of days or like a strip bored basically get like a preliminary shooting schedule I think this scene looks like it was probably three to five pages long so it looks like we could probably knock all this out in a one-day shoot and because the dialogue is very low it's a lot of action going on right okay so one day shoot so let's draw the stuff so okay I want to hold a production meeting yeah with all our key department heads so that's the very first thing so how we're cinematographer we have our first ad our producers or directors looking production designer costumes I'd like to have our costumer there our wardrobe stylist we can bring them in introduce them to make sure that they all read the material we show them the schedule the first ad is running through what the shooting day is gonna look like for example in this clip it starts off by pushing in on Ryan Gosling playing the piano so maybe our first ad is saying that's something we're gonna shoot last so in terms of schedule we're communicating this to everybody so maybe we do all the dialogue stuff in the first six hours of the day before lunch yeah then we break for lunch and then we come back from lunch and then also we have to focus is him playing the piano with the lighting cue that comes in for the indie people out there that don't know the protocol is you have to feed your crew every six hours I would say this would be like a 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. kind of a shoot during the day yeah because it looks like if it's all interior you can black out the windows you can make this controlled environment in terms of lighting only because like you don't want to be sure 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. and like you're really messing with people's schedules it becomes an issue just of like people's faces especially your actors to look like they're tired day three let's go Scout this place yeah so we're bringing all these key department heads so that way art department can see the space your DP can see the space in your DP you're probably bringing your gaffer in your key grip it's just so important for them to know what the space looks like and what they're working with in terms of what tools they should exactly because right after this scout you know the the DP and the key grip and the gaffer they're probably putting together a floor plan of their lighting setups right yeah a lot of this looks like it was a 360 lighting so seeing it sounds like if we have a prep day for lighting mm-hmm they're pre rigging everything so that way we can just shoot 360 and then everything's controlled what does the producer actually thinking of when you're on that's Gunn five main things parking a GE truck we have a camera truck maybe art department has a cargo van also there's just a ton of vehicle there's always all the crew and your cast is gonna show up at this place so if you're filming on location maybe there's like a private lot somewhere that you can rent out for the day that kind of a thing huge thing you don't want to figure this out on the day of the show number two staging for all your departments on the day of the shoot or you don't want crew members assuming they can put their stuff down in a certain spot but like if you're shooting in that area it's not camera safe and the clip we just watched it's like almost like a 360 thing so we want to put it behind a wall somewhere we're not going to see but when it comes to staging you want to think about camera working camera department they're set up their camera carts their video village that whole deal right they're gonna need their own space you got GE they got a bunch of genie carts lighting cards a lot of grip cards so we need to find a space maybe that's outside and you're the grip truck to make it easy for them whatever it is let's just make sure we have a plan when it comes to hair makeup and wardrobe you want to put them somewhere interior where there's air conditioning definitely don't want them outside under a pop-up tent kind of sweating only because you don't want Emma Stone sitting outside sweating like crazy and you're trying to actually just do makeup so we've got parking we've got staging what's nice restrooms you want to figure out where your restrooms are right hypothetically if you're filming in the desert or somewhere super far away you don't have restrooms so you're gonna need to like rent out porta-potties or something you don't want to figure it out on the day of the shoot of like what if this restaurant has like only two working restrooms and that's gonna be an issue for 30 cast members and another 30 crew members for this clip we're probably getting two or three porta-potties with a hand-washing station putting them outside near their like grip trucks somewhere outside where it's like convenient to just go out use the restroom come back in number four I want to talk about crafty and lunch this kind of ties into staging right you need to have an area where you're gonna stage you're crafty probably not by the restrooms as far as the actual crafty and catering goes where would you put that no occasionally probably crafty I'd keep that in the space like maybe behind a wall or somewhere where it's closed we behind the bar or something behind the bar there's like a coffee station crafty and then maybe lunch it's probably gonna be outside in the parking lot like under the pop-up tents the last thing safety is a big thing that always have like if you can afford a set medic we don't if you're going to Indy like that's hard to do we Genet get a first-aid kit ya know where the nearest hospital is and then have like all the emergency numbers on standby if you have this stuff ahead of time in the event an emergency you don't need to think you already know I know a big one too is if you're in the desert or in the forest make sure you know where the nearest cell services to yeah so safety wise what are you actually seeing in this thing there's not too much going on here right not too much I'm noticing that at the bar there's a lot of glassware right there's a lot of glass now if maybe then that's a safety thing that wardress in the safety meeting at the top of the first day of shooting is hey at this bar there's a lot of glassware everyone be cautious coming into this area I would even have our department post signs don't touch the glass don't touch the glass hot set don't just letting everybody know that like hey you're getting into a safety issue here so now that we've seen the space we've had our production meeting I want the first ad to finalize their schedule yeah and this is which shots are they doing in what orders exactly so this is letting us know exactly how the day is gonna run so that way we can give this to all our key crew members and then they can start booking the crew they need after we've got our shooting schedule set what are we doing next it's finalizing casting and crewing meaning that when it comes to crew our department probably has people working order there Jeannie has people working under them camera department is camera department glam all of the people that aren't key department heads we can now start doing a hard hold on them where we can send them deal memos kind of lock everybody in and then there's casting I'm gonna have casting start sending me pictures of all the extras they look like there's 30 extras in that dinner scene mm-hmm so I want them to send me stills so that way our director can picture pick people as soon as casting and crewing is done basically we're looking at pickups and returns for all our gear art department which vendors do you want me to set up camera department Jeannie Department send me whatever is the wish list so that way we can start booking it so for a shoot like this you know we need anamorphic lenses so camera team is probably sending me a couple vendors that we can start pricing out camera gear for yeah so now we're at the beginning of week two beginning a week two were most likely I'd love to have another proper meeting location is law yeah we've already maybe we've started pulling the permit you only really need like three or four days in advance so we're probably pulling our permit more importantly we're having orderable pools which means our main three actors are getting fitted for wardrobe and this is time that also each department is doing all of their rehearsals and prep - yes so actors and directors are getting together they're sitting there doing rehearsals at this point cameras doing camera tests Jeannie is doing they're taking the package together in their art department they're probably picking up all of the set dressing set decorations so in this crops getting that piano they're getting that piano oh yeah they're leaf table lamps inside of the room the little practical lamps yeah everything that you saw on the restaurant there in terms of set deck and then there's also generators and distribution like our gaffer needs to make sure that we have a generator with enough amps and wattage so that way they can power everything that needs to be power for the scene our sound team is probably picking up batteries our sound team is making sure that they have everything that they need making sure that their boom is working there their sound mixer is up to par production side are there any tools that you have to prep to any supplies the union we're talking about walkie talkies director chairs tables regular chairs coolers pop-up tents wardrobe racks maybe a crafty car and working printer on set we're having making sure we have a bunch of paper so that way on the day of the shoot if we need to print any other stuff or prep anything we have it all there we've pretty much outlined kind of how this two weeks would run before the shoot this is just a one scene one location super simple we had two weeks out to prep for it problem though is I don't think you get a lot of scripts for one location one scene simple two people talking that's not most movies so to make it a little bit more difficult we're throwing a second scene here I haven't seen this either you ready I'm ready you film let's go okay so we have Lucy seen a location we have a huge backyard we have this party with like a live band and it's got like 80s vibes going so this is a band full instruments okay there's like a little stage this is a pool party with like 50 extras round of extras ton of extras some of them are in the pool not bad and there's people in the pool we're gonna need a set medic for that if you just set medic for the medics and you know somebody swallows too much water they need it or someone slips or something like that - or head I would say okay director you're pushing it but we can maybe we can pull this off and I said hey director we're gonna need to use those same extras because we can't pull this off and the director is gonna be like yeah great with their in the background out of focus it's gonna work guy jumping into a pool okay oh so what when you look at this schedule I don't repeat things but what do you have to change in terms of the production ah just recapping new location same amount of extras pool party wardrobe we have a band so they have instruments which is part of art the lighting looks really nice and backlit so they probably have a condor with a light so let's say this is now a two-day shoot so what I'm gonna adjust that prelim to say Monday we shoot the interior dining scene Tuesday we're shooting the pool see in our pre-production meeting our first ad now has to run through two days of shooting mm-hmm which means that during this time if we have soft holes on our key we now have two soft hold the band because the band has speaking roles we have two location scout both locations okay parking for everybody so this is looks like a residence all our trucks are gonna be art at the residents but when it comes to parking for cast and crew there's like 30 or 40 extras here and then you have 30 or 40 catchment crew members so where do you park that many cars because I've seen these kinds of houses these are Hollywood Hills hell yeah super narrow road that goes up in the hills impossible to park we're gonna need to get a parking lot and we're gonna need a shuttle people so we probably have two or three shuttle passenger bands yeah a PA is driving those vans and we have a spot where everybody parks casting Department is starting the casting for all these extras so kind of what I was saying is maybe we recycle a lot of these extras but you got to remember in that restaurant it looked like an older crowd you got to remember at this pool party there's a lot of younger folks right so if that's the case I would say the day after the Scout when we finalize our scheduled casting is securing all of these other thirty extras that we have to get costumes department now has to dress all these extras and so costumes probably has to update their vendors and this looks like already that they're probably hanging a silk over some people yeah it looks soft so now all of a sudden you need big GE tools oh yeah Condors flyswatter the whole the whole nine so now you're GE your camera or every department is going to need to adjust their vendor list for the second day of shooting remember back when we're saying that our key department hands are now getting all the lower-level people right art department has their team costumes and makeup has their assistants so now they have to update this because if now you have double the amount of extras yeah costumes is gonna need another hand we're having our production meeting this first day of the second week which means that we are talking about the safety issues meaning that we're working around a body of water yeah right if anything electrical goes into that water it's gonna be a huge insurance claim and it's if there's people jumping in and out of the pool it's a slippery thing it's not technically technically it's a stunt you want to make sure wardrobes or production has a bunch of towels or robes for the people that are in the water when they get out they're gonna not want to stay cold the whole time so the directors just like come on this is a full scene we'll go to my friend's house we'll shoot in this pool it'll be totally chill dude first day of the second we're adjusting our permit right we're amending that permit to add a second location on that on shoot we're gonna wear that probably the only last thing is the director is doing more more rehearsals with the actors yeah the director adding the second location I mean if when we're budgeted for it and we can pull it off yeah it's really just going back breaking that down adding it to the schedule talking to all the department heads not too bad not too bad doing that now in case you haven't now back to the episode so apparently this is too easy here we go moving on third scene edit on directors just changed his mind he's turning this movie into a new movie let's see the scene let's go let's go adding another scene here we go this is a pretty iconic scene oh yeah what are you seeing in here in terms of production logistics is obviously an overlook right this is an area that kind of overlooks the city like there's these places are sprinkled all around LA but this is like either being shot at dusk or dawn you have apartments for this stuff definitely there's no shooting at your friend's house that's very true this is you got a lock down the street you got a lock down Mulholland Drive types yeah it's a pretty popular street that a lot of people drive on exactly and I think a lot of like she's sitting on a bench that's probably already there if not that's art department and making an extra pickup in their truck because all at one time - there's a lot of choreography or meaning that if you don't nail it we're coming back to this that's definitely a techno crane right that's a technical moves a lot of crazy camera moves that have to be precise it's really wide lighting and there's a prelate this sucker there's a there's even a street lamp there so that's part of our department right I love this this theoretical director yes awesome he's freaking sweet man hey I know you just read the script and broke it down but I have another scene it's really small it's just one small dance number that's you know okay if you still only have two weeks oh yeah we're not saying this was done two weeks it's definitely not done in two weeks but if you had to kind of make these adjustments how's it actually look in the production timeline very first thing on day one as I'm breaking down the script they better be rehearsing this stuff with a choreographer nailing these numbers down because this was all one take at a specific time of the day every little mess-up we're gonna have to retake it I'm gonna try and find a house in Hollywood where we film that pool scene that is close to the mahal and drive over look and I'm gonna tell our director and our DP let's make this work in the indie world we can technically shoot this night scene after we do our big pool party scene so let's say the pool party scene we shot that in the first six hours of the day we took our lunch and now we're doing like kind of a small company move I would propose that to our DP or in our director or else we just add a third day but if we if we were to add a third day of filming we're getting up to this spot and we're waiting all day for the Sun to set we should probably soft hold our techno crane guys like if there was a techno crane on this video and that means our DP should soft hold the techno crane two weeks out in our Scout we now have to go to this third location which is this overlook same thing copy and paste we have our main production trucks there and then everyone is still getting shuttled so it's probably gonna be a thing where we need a parking lot again we need a couple of passenger vans there's no restrooms up here we need to hit up a couple of Andy Gump's and we get some porta-potties up there I would say we should probably get a production trailer that has like a makeup station attached to it with this scene we're only really filming in one towards the direction of the Oval everyone can kind of just be staffs right behind the cameras shooting at this location if you do shoot the other way the Sun is setting a little nicer the magic hours painting the clouds I believe the DP is like this let's flip this way and then it's a huge logistical but as a good producer it's like good thing we staged everything not only behind camera but a little to the left I would say if you're permitting for this place you're probably gonna need off-duty police officers maybe some barricades to block the street because this looks like a street here this is right this is a public street it's a public street so you really need to barricade it get off-duty police officers that are in alignment with your permit make sure your your permit notes this for this scene we're probably gonna need to bring a huge generator right this is a nighttime shot with like overhead lighting probably on Condor so we're probably bringing a generator if you're going to need a large like tow plant generator like a generator that attaches to a toe lift that you have to bring to set that's gonna trigger a fire marshal and this is something I've learned with experience in producing that you're gonna need a like four hundred five hundred gallon water truck fitted for motion picture in terms of psi you've logistically added like a lot more money you have to you have to pay all this crew now fire marshal off-duty police officer now water truck it's crazy I spent all this time making fun of this director now I feel bad for him you just wanted a shot of a guy in a button-up and the girl in a yellow dress dancing on a mountain when now all of a sudden not easy and the possibility of not even getting it the first day exactly you might not get it the first day so you got to do it again and so all of this stuff is is in the back of my mind when we're location scouting this having the experience producing like I kind of know what these things and entail so as the DP the gaffer requesting this stuff in my mind I'm already thinking budget wise we're seeing the numbers go up and up and up and up but it's you know you have to keep your cool and keep that in the back of your mind here's a note for the indie guys out there for the indie filmmakers out there if you call these vendors they're gonna assume you're a big studio when you're calling to reserve so if you specifically tell them hey I'm a little guy I'm an independent they're like oh yeah let's give you the deed let's give you the indie rate already so mmm directors out their little ambitious but this is basically what it would look like generally speaking to kind of pull together a project like this step by step and now that you know how to produce a film now you have no excuse to enter apertures like this location where we're giving away something like $200,000 in cinema gear including a new red 8k helium camera the rules are super simple it's just one film one location show us how you'll edit in fact in this video Moses produced all these videos with a two-week timeline but guess what you have three weeks competition doesn't end for another three weeks you can still enter you got plenty of time so literally no excuse for you guys that thing most people have questions how do they reach out to you Moses underscore Israel or at bandwidth brothers both on Instagram you can check me out there feel free to reach out just with questions comments concerns yeah this is this is very awesome good this really good to see Moses thanks so much for watching of course ad mogul I'll catch you guys next time [Music] sidenote here if you're shooting at your mom's house a friend's house somewhere where someone's doing you a favor and you're using their restrooms bringing toiletry supplies like toilet paper disinfectant spray or some like air freshener there's nothing worse than like going and like telling the person that's doing you a favor like hey you're out of toilet paper and they're like well why didn't you bring any so I'm telling you this is P this stuff people forget
