hi guys my name is grace I'm back with another video today it's gonna be a quick one because I actually have a job interview right after this but twice came back with more and more and yeah I'm gonna watch the music video so I've seen the trailer for this the two trailers the one where they're in their flowery outfits and they're in the square formation and the one they're in all white the dance break but I haven't I've stopped myself from seeing spoilers on Instagram so let's get right into this hi this is Grace editing the video right now I just want to say that watching the video over with subtitles I'm now noticing that the lyrics that twice are singing and more and more are a bit problematic in the same way that they're yes sir yes lyrics are problematic saying that the person boy that they are singing to cannot say no to them it's it's something I don't agree with and I didn't notice it in the original recording so I just want to get that out there okay there are English subtitles and let's get going right now long intro yes so it sounds like they're they kind of have their cuter vibe bag they they went from their sort of typical cute cute like TT likey all those kind of vibes to feel special and fancy and I preferred they're more mature concepts feel special is my favorite title track by them followed by yes sir yes yes sir yes it's just like really catchy but I love to the vibe of feel special and I was hoping that they would return to that more mature concept and I think though the lyrics they're saying are more mature how you know nyan was saying you know she deserves it and they were like oh I don't care if you don't like me for a little bit but it sounds like the chorus which they're going into now or this is the pre-chorus is going to be a little cuter [Music] [Music] are they in the garden of eden' question mark [Music] okay so I guess what goes along with like a cuter sound is more of a speaky sort of singing they're kind of shouting in unison and what I loved about feels special so much with what I love about feel special and yes or yes is that it's very singie like it's a very melodic sound like there's a there singing singing instead of speaking and I think in like TT like the cuter sounding twice songs it's more of a shouty speaky sort of tone and I think that's just something that goes like hands at hand like cute and mature like they're just different sounding songs and I'd say they look more mature in this music video they're styled more mature but I think they kind of went back to their typical I don't want to call it generic but like typical twice what they're known for sound cuter but come on with the dance I do have to say I discovered twice as they're kind of cute concepts I think the first the first thing I saw from them was what is love and for some reason I thought it was like a 2000s kpop it just felt like very kind of mm pop to me I have no idea why I thought they were like a senior group but they were kind of rag Don for a while to my knowledge that they had easy dances and that they weren't skilled enough or whatever but you know watching like ooh their debut it's so wildly different than what they became known for as they're cute concepts it was like a girl-crush concept and I know black pink they debuted a year later than toys black pink came in with the girl crush concept and really kind of popularized it again because you know 21 kind of created it and then there were sexy concepts throughout the early 2010s but black pink really solidified and popularized girl crush concepts for the later 20 but I always found it interesting that a year before black pink twice debuted with that darker styled girl-crush concept and then they became really cute really quickly like I never knew that their debut was so darker so much more dark than what they were doing and it made me really happy to see them maturing as they be they went into their 20s doing fancy and feel special and also through their maturing of their concepts their dancing has become a lot more difficult like the dances they do or I'd say the most difficult out of the big three girl groups and they're just they're great dancers [Music] [Applause] and it's just like the development of them as they they mature over time as they get older the the going from you know likey and TT and signal and heart shaker and all that to their more mature more skilled obviously it takes skill to do any sort of concept I don't want to downplay the skill it takes to be a cute concept idol group but the development of twice in particular over time is very interesting and I like it a lot and I oh oh my god what's happening [Music] [Music] it's very tropical house kinda like that summery sound everyone goes for Garden of Eden I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be the Garden of Eden yeah so I will have to say not my favorite twice I I don't think I'll be adding this to my playlist I'm not a very tropical house kind of vibe person if I do like electronic electronic music I'm more I go more like the ever glow route of that that hard-hitting like heavy bass but with a melody to follow along to that's just more my vibe but yeah like I I enjoy twice I really love feel special like that's one of my favorite songs in general yes sir yes is my favorite kpop choreography ever I just love that choreography and I love that song this just this didn't hit it for me like I said not really a house kind of person I love that their styling has matured a lot and they're allowed to show their mature sides as they become older they're going into their early to mid 20s and I I just enjoy watching them grow it's something interesting to me and you know they're dancing when his dance practice comes out I'll probably watch it it looks it looks really it looks really good what can I say and you know they're going into the summer all these tropical house and summery comebacks are gonna start coming out they release it on June 1st which you know June's like the first month of summer you know everybody's getting into it and you know I I talked about what I feel about the song what do you guys feel about the song yeah let me know in the comments down below and I hope to see you guys in the next video bye bye
