lil peeps body was found by his tour manager Steve Paul he had burst into the tour bus to wake people form insist a few minutes before he was due on stage only to find the 21 year old laying completely still pale as a ghost head thrown back he had no pulse and wasn't breathing peeps other to her manager began applying chest compressions and paramedics arrived just 10 minutes after the body was found they administered narcan dextrose and epinephrine nothing was working efforts to resuscitate low peep were unsuccessful and so were the team's attempts to keep words from getting up nearly a thousand fans spilled into the street and chaos was unleashed people were fighting crying and screaming it was a single moment of pure emotional destruction that will live on forever in the minds of millions lil peep was seen alive for the last time by Steve Paul at 6:40 p.m. on the evening of November 15 2017 just a few hours before he was supposed to start his performance at the rock in Tucson Arizona Steve Paul as well as peeps opening artists Beck C who had taken a now infamous video of peep didn't notice anything was wrong because they both thought peep was sleeping but as it would turn out peep snoring was not in fact normal rather it was a symptom of him slowly dying from an accidental fentanyl overdose as the storm following peeps untimely death finally began to clear it was ruled an accident caused by the deadly combination of fentanyl and xanax but it wasn't that simple in fact it wasn't simple at all peeps death resulted in a chaotic storm of accusations investigations and lawsuits from all sides the search for someone to blame for his death continues to this day but in this video I'm not going to talk about whose fault it was instead I want to look at how ill team's life death legacy and music can teach us about ourselves and each other understanding Lil Peep is brought to you by skill share click the link below to get two months of free tutorials on almost any creative business or tech subject you can think of lil peeps life up until around late 2015 was pretty normal his parents both went to Harvard as did his grandparents they were a high functioning family with a long history of success peep was born in 1996 in Allentown Pennsylvania a small city that peeps mom said was pretty dead when they lived there she told pitchfork that they didn't have much to do in Allentown so she would stay at home and play with peep and his brother most of the time they moved to Long Island in 2001 and peeps mom said that he started taking dance lessons around this time peep was a gifted dancer but after just a few years he started to feel self-conscious as a guy doing tap dancing and ballet and he stopped taking lessons his mom told pitchfork that she tried to encourage her son to keep trying but he just didn't feel comfortable dancing anymore peeps mom Liza taught her son to be an empathetic socialist who cared about the bigger picture they had a great relationship even though Liza hawksin talks about struggling to understand what exactly her son needed peeps parents never really got along and when his history professor dad left the picture in 2012 peep really started to struggle it was also around then that peep started suffering from intense anxiety and depression it was hard for him to feel motivated to go to school and he quickly turned to self-medicating with things like xanax and weed at the same time his dream of making music professionally was only getting stronger he dropped out of high school and got his diploma online and then moved to LA in 2013 when he was 17 he wasn't even old enough to sign a lease so he slept on people's couches he quickly returned to Long Island and changed his name from trapped news to look people in honor of a nickname his mom had given him what he was young peeps first project lil P part 1 was released in 2015 it gained over 4,000 streams in its first week on soundcloud and things only started moving faster from there people click a year later in just a few months after that pitchfork named him at the future of emo music and an article that looked at peope as a continuation of the emo tradition begun by Kurt Cobain so many years ago the pitchfork article inspired more and more profile pieces including one by noisy peeps effortless mixture of rap and emo rock was taking the industry by storm he rapped with equal apathy both about the women he's known and his desire to die a lot of emo people declined to claim peep though and so did a lot of rap fans he was just somewhere in the middle a young kid in a lot of pain trying to use music to feel better it was a brilliant effortless mix of insider style with outsider attitude that resulted in peep watching at fashion events in Paris in Milan while simultaneously being seen as a musical dirtbag peeps first album come over when you're sober was released just four months after the noisy article he received massive attention and he was on the verge of becoming a pop culture icon the hard work long nights the unsteady living situations the depression and anxiety it was all paying off and then died I think we can all say that even if we maybe don't see parts of him in ourselves we know people who identify with peep in some way or another an ex a cousin a friend from school peep personified the darkest parts of our generations collective unconsciousness but how did he ever today streon teenage Punk and emo with hard-hitting hip-hop he did it by being surprisingly normal because lo peeps upbringing was for all intents and purposes safe he wasn't raised in a burned-out urban ghetto like many rappers his age rather he grew up in Long Island a part of New York State that's mostly known for how normal is Pete was into normal things growing up he liked video games and skateboarding you listened to a lot of brand-new and Avenged Sevenfold he was honestly kind of a stereotype not that that's a bad thing because it's not what I mean is that Pete became so popular because he drew his creativity from things that we all understand he was just so sensitive to fame in the stress of touring his platform was too much to handle I kind of see it as a metaphor for the rest of us too so many of peeps fans have been through more than is healthy before young people to go through and peep understood that he may have not had the most depressing or the most broken upbringing but he was a true artist things affected him strongly and it gave him a powerful but fragile view of the world I think what people misunderstand the most about little peep is that he saw the world as a miserable gray landscape lacking hope or beauty I don't think that was the case at all I think lil peep saw a life as beautiful but the beauty that he did see was sadly outweighed by the tragedy that filled his mind and ultimately it was too much for him to handle he was overwhelmed by the nature of his fame and he used drugs as a coping mechanism the knowledge that he had countless fans looking at him as a role model a superhero it was a tremendous weight on his shoulders lil Pete provided a voice for the anxieties that all of us feel he provided a voice for victims of abuse and bullying but he had his own demons too and the pressures of the success that he had wanted for so long are ultimately what took his life I think the biggest lesson that we can learn from the story of Gustave are is about the importance of taking care of ourselves lil peeps close friend and producer smoker sac wrote in the memorial on his website people would want me to tell everyone to support your friends watch their back if they're struggling with issues that are too big for them to manage get them to seek professional medical attention don't try and find your answers in the street the story of low peep is heartbreaking but it's also a reason to have hope his life was beautiful but he lacked the support to make it through alive by learning from his tragedy we can make the world a better place we can look after each other with more care and pay better attention to what's going on around us because it's hard to tell when someone is really suffering even if it's the main focus of their art lil peep will live on in our hearts forever his story reminds us that even though life can be violent dark and unfair beauty can still be found if you're willing to look for [Music] while we wait to hear more peep in the description and get two months of unlimited access for free you
