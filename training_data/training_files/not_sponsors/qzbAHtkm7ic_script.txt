VPN stay tuned to hear more you knowa consoles doing pretty well when there's an overabundance of games to play Nintendo might have had this problem last gen but the switch is like a Costco in comparison boot up the eShop and it's like oh god no it was admittedly pretty easy to keep up with Wii U exclusives but with Nintendo and third parties going ham this time around it's like we're in the wild wild we lands again don't even get me started on the endless ports look I'm saying good job Nintendo maybe some of the ports are a little lackluster but you got games this time around considering the eShops of pain in the butt to navigate currently with no way to sort by exclusivity I realized I wanted to see all there was we all know about the big triple-a Nintendo stuff but what about the random Indies are Double A titles the things that get buried in all the new releases that drop to like 10 cents on sale why would you why CEO it's Austin and today I want to take a look at some of the lesser-known and weirder switch exclusives out there there's actually a ton of these even without hitting up the Japanese store so I guess we'll probably make a lot of these videos but first a word from our sponsor that sucks and so does article 13 if you're watching this from Europe there's a pretty big chance that your ISP might have the ability to censor things that you see on

fighting through your attention even on the digital side of things if you wanted something that wasn't a pour it you'd be forking over a decent amount of money I for one like finding the cheap things priced brand new at like 3 or $5 games that may not necessarily have a ton of content but are pretty fun in spurts I'd like to think that Kimiko is exactly that Japanese indie developer skip more responsible for at the time a 3ds game called Drancy a-- put this out and I think surprised everyone the switch was hot the want for budget-priced games was hot people had beaten breath of the wild and they needed a new thing while they waited for for this this one Kumiko popped up for five bucks and I guess everyone felt it because skip more reported over 200,000 sales last year so hey good on you guys it helps that it's pretty good Kumiko zzz elda like action puzzle game that takes place in an extremely unique setting you control a priestess on a mission to save the world a lot of the imagery is reminiscent of Shintoism paired with like a magical girl kind of thing aesthetically the main girls are basically magic knight rayearth and that's pretty cool I guess now because the things only 5 bucks it's kind of limited and not very long effect there's only five levels to get through and it took me about an hour for my first run Kumiko wants you to play it multiple times to get higher scores find the secrets in each level and of course play with each character they got different weapons and special attacks and colors I liked playing as he know me here but they're all pretty fun to control also the music is like really [ __ ] good [Music] look if you want something cheap and easy to play at just about any time it's hard to go wrong with Kumiko it might be a game II game with little to no central narrative but it is a pleasant experience so the next game I want to talk about decided to like D exclusive PI itself in the middle of filming this video like get like yesterday so I just want to mention it real quick before it is no longer an exclusive so let's talk about Toki on the switch Toki's a remake of an old Japanese arcade game that faded into obscurity it's got an NES port that's worth a decent amount but other than that it's a pretty run-of-the-mill old-school platformer about a dude that turns into a monkey and tries to save damsel also you attack by throwing up on people anyways here's the ex switch exclusive remake of the arcade version Toki I missed this one because it came out mid-december and I feel like a ton of others did as well she looks visually amazing but also here's a clip on YouTube of the remake from 2009 by a developer called golgotha studio it also got approved on Steam greenlight in 2013 wait what yeah so for some reason the toki remake was in development held for nine years even though it came out under the publisher and developer mike freud's it's very clearly the remnants of that original project I don't even know if it's the same person considering there's not a proper credit sequence but there's something weird going on here and who knows if we'll ever get the full story it's a visually beautiful remake and is pretty damn faithful to its original source material though I will say remaking toki was a weird decision in the first place also [ __ ] this [Music] what step away from the Andes for a sec some time last year Ubisoft decided that they were going to basically reboot an old Wii game that they made it wouldn't be a modern Nintendo console without shovelware garbage so let's talk about sports party you know when I think of like retail released games that are exclusives my mind goes to like Yoshi's crafted world Smash Brothers and Zelda so when I was squatting down looking through game releases at a random store my ass probably hanging out it was pretty bizarre to see sports parties sitting right next to Sonic forces though that's probably exactly where it belongs I'll admit it I got a soft spot for these dumb motion-controlled minigame collections I said it before but I love playing bad games I'll never recommend them but owning something like carnival games or Help Wanted and putting it on for my friends and having a laugh as always the best so when you toss sports party in front of me and I see a woman on a skateboard going straight into the ocean this dude golfing his ball in the wrong direction and this [ __ ] jumping like Kobe I get excited so we boot this bad boy up and the beautiful island looks really Brown but that's okay because we got to make our characters it's weird you actually have a pre selection of characters that will appear in mini games with you and you can customize each one of them that's pretty cool it's like a little family I actually thought that UI and art style was totally fine as well in fact it's it's too fine it's extremely sterile but I kind of expect that from these types of games I'm not sure how I feel about this grandi unlock system like in this really got to make sure to do your sports party dailies your sports party jet ski all rights reserved dailies [ __ ] okay let's get into it golf it's it's golf really poorly designed to golf now I'm all for everybody's golf for Mario Golf but something about sports party feels really off you're automatically in the test shot position anytime you play so you can't just let go for it like in those other games the physics of shooting the ball are nearly as in-depth as your normal golfing game so you spend a lot of time guessing during the putts it's pretty forgettable volleyball way no III mean beach tennis because animating people playing volley was too difficult you don't get to move around freely just kind of like scoots yeah sick basketball you know how this goes there's also a hoop shooting contest you can do it's fine it's easy like maybe maybe a bit too easy skateboarding I wish I could convey just how bad this feels the skateboarding game is so easy that it might as well just be an auto-scroller you just race and hit boost pads you'll win don't worry frisbee all rights reserved yo this is the worst there's two different modes the first being press a button while holding a direction but there's only three directions to throw it in so make sure to remove your brain cells before trying if you want to have fun there's also a mode where you have to aim more intricately and attempt to hit balloons there's no way to really tell where or how you're aiming or this [ __ ] power so just you guess [ __ ] sucks and lastly jetski all rights reserved it's good to know that Ubisoft isn't just reviving starfox turns out in Tendo gave them waverace as well you know I expected of all the games here that this would be a good one considering it's like front and center on the box but I mean look at it your jet ski feels so awful to control its constantly jerking around I've played a ton of games with water sports I mean water racing and none of them have felt this bad not even jet moto which is like a masterpiece in comparison but also [ __ ] jet moto and that sports party like actually I've done just about everything I can do in this game it's been like an hour most of the challenges I did first try so now all we got is grinding for costumes don't forget to do your dailies brother all I'm trying to say is that it's no surprise that sports party was half off in its first month but look everything I just mentioned is pretty well known compared to what's coming up the new Denis which has a ton of digital indie titles and even more that are exclusive so let's start with the extremely weird Tori dama brave challenge Tori thamma brave challenge is a strange warrior we're like game made by 1g mode is it mystery mode I don't know what about this one no I got she was the first one but these guys on the rights to all the old data East so like y'all want to make another tattoo assassins like down Tori dama is basically exactly what it sounds like you're challenging yourself to be as brave as possible how much are you willing to tempt fate so that this game won't call you a [ __ ] ash chicken you played three games at a time which for some reason are called questions you got like stop the car right before you dive off the cliff defuse the bomb as close to the time limit as possible and the most dangerous of all protecting my precious first kiss disgusting love the idea it's just unfortunately a five-dollar game where you can experience everything it has to offer in like 40 minutes I love the cute references to other video game series I love the ranking of your score based on birds I'm not huge on the only soundtrack being the beating of a drum which for some reason clips the audio but that's okay maybe we'll get a full-fledged sequel but I can't see that happening at least you can play it with a friend it's cute next up we got doggie ninja the golden mission I looked at the trailer and cover art for this game and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks neat it's like samurai pizza cats but with ninja dogs or doggy ninjas I love the goofy art style and pun names but this game should not exist coming in at a whopping $8 doggie ninja might be one of the most OneNote games I've played on this channel sure it's a switch exclusive but what you see on the screen right now this [ __ ] Smash Brothers level this is it it's the whole game the developers at toy idea known for dragonfangs ii and that this thought it a great idea that turned the coin battle mode from smash brothers into an entire game you break the platforms to get coins yeah crush your enemies with the falling platforms I got nothing else the game's description on the e shops pretty funny though every sentence ends with an exclamation point like you're being scolded let's enjoy this game with anyone anytime and anywhere pitch you guys probably sick of me talking about like real video games so let's ask ourself the age-old question the way you had it but does the Nintendo switch have memes well you could play guacamelee but today I'm talking about super Ola and the lost burgers what is a super Ola I have no idea but if you think you can go two screens in this game without seeing a dated me more reference from a decade ago you'd be sorely mistaken under colas super Ola might be one of the strangest things I've seen on the eShop not just because it's a switch exclusive but because I saw a [ __ ] hotdog doing all your base are belong to us less than 20 seconds into hitting the [ __ ] Start button talking doshas cars getting rekt like Street Fighter I mean hell your main method of attacking is a shoopdawhoop which goddamnit I said that in 2019 oh my god you have all of this and I just have one question to ask why super ollas an autoscroller or you die in one hit so you got a retry or use power-ups to get to the end you jump jump occasional minigame Shoop some loops jumps again that's it it's a meme game it's garbage trash for idiots like myself now it's much higher quality than meme run on the Wii U there's a semblance of care here with some of the references although you might just interpret that as laziness probably leaning on the ladder with the fact that Dragon Ball Z's Shenron and rage phases are in the game but I guess that's how it goes it's not how it goes who thought it was a good idea to put Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song in this game [Music] the best thing I can say about super Ola is that it's $6 and like triple the length of sports party so if you're looking for a game with a good self-hatred to money spent ratio this one's pretty good or you know you could like buy a burrito and eat it when I saw our next game in our final game being shown on a Nintendo Direct some time in like 2017 I was like wow that looks like the most me game ever and I didn't hear about it for like a year you guys know gala medal came out like like look at it [ __ ] while ago this is gal medal this probably doesn't make any sense you're looking at the screen right now I'm thinking uh and that's okay this is a rhythm game I'm not sure if it's a very good one but it is a super interesting one you play as Rinku well actually you play as this unnamed high school kid who gets abducted by aliens at the same time as her we're then infused into the same body where he controls her and she's like in the brain but that's like the same thing right you're part of the metal Club in an all-girls school where you play the drums now look as a drummer this immediately speaks to me I've been playing for like 17 years so any game that gives me the ability to drum or play as a drummer is a big win in my eyes but hold up hold up let's rewind you all know the name talk Fuji I remember talk Fuji he used to work at Konami on various games but you probably remember him for high wom million troops Wow you'll be sucked extreme police clap yeah so after leaving Konami Fuji joined a dev studio called DMM games they made this about it and like a Virtua Fighter thing but last year they released gala medal and it is almost everything I want in a weird game so Rinku and her band Kichi gog metal girls find themselves having to be the final line of defense against an alien invasion turns out those aliens are weak to the sound of metal music so these girls do their best to fight them off as the drummer you're basically the core so if you sound like [ __ ] everything does so uh don't [ __ ] up you've got multiple methods of controlling things here the main one is swinging your arms around like drumsticks your left icon is a snare and the right is a bass drum but as you can tell if you look at the screen there's no notes to follow it's not rock band where it's like yes here is the chart and now I will play this gal metal wants you to do it on your own you make the beat you determine how the song is gonna flow you need to practice with your band awesome I love it I played weird things like these growing up like all the time so something like gal metal should fit in really nicely however you play it like this the entire time and it's not very intuitive there is another control scheme but it also kind of sucks gal metal lets you play by pressing buttons on the Joye cons and it does a cool thing where it gives you access to an entire drum set however nothing counts towards your score besides bass and snare and it's extremely to pull off a proper beat with this nevermind in a TV latency you might have the best way to play it is like in the portable mode but I don't feel like getting my screen all greasy and fingery the lack of notations on the screens of fun and novel concept but it'll make certain players feel lost however gaol metal isn't just a rhythm game which is weird to think about it's also part incredibly charming comic-book part visual novel parts social simulator each chapter has these cute and fantastic looking story panels that are extremely stylistic the music itself is fun and very percussion heavy which I really enjoy when you're not practicing beats on your own or songs with your band you're working jobs hanging out with your friends building your social links and personal stats these actually affect your scores and game so you got to make sure to build the ones that you want to get big point your band members are pretty charming and there's a lot of fun dialog while it's limited considering this is a budget India sh game some of the interactions genuinely made me laugh it's all light-hearted silliness and gal metal which is welcome after watching [ __ ] Avengers end game also shin Dory's the best she's pretty read playing through ghoul metal actually has me interested in an anime or a comic instead while I love drumming in rhythm games the mechanics themselves just starts in cycle enough to carry its own weight the art style and concept is strong enough alone for me to want to see it animated in some shape also I need some confirmation that Renko isn't just leaving her [ __ ] drum set lying around for other people to carry like dude I had to move my drums hundreds of times and that [ __ ] sucks [ __ ] you anime girl but you know what for 20 bucks or cheaper cuz it goes on sale a lot a weird rhythm game like this is pretty easy to recommend but with a big old asterisk because I'd recommend you be pretty familiar with rhythm games for this one even if you are you might get lost since gaol metal doesn't tell you what it wants you to play besides like basic beats in what order figure it out be more varied [ __ ] you also be prepared to fight the joy con what did you expect motion controls still have like a really long way to go well that's all I got for today but I actually do have a ton of switch exclusives that are just ready to be looked at so if you want to see that let me know I I'll do it as soon as I can Kumiko and gal Mel are probably my favorites of the day so if you're gonna try any of these games out definitely give them a look get Galgano gun gal metal comes like a little less recommended you got to be like a certain type of person to enjoy that but still I really liked it I liked them both maybe you like them as well but until next time I've been Austin and I promise that I won't look in your webcam also I go to interruption safe 75% off a three-year plan you can do
