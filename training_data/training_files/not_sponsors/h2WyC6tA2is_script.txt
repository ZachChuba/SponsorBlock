[What is the point choreography of “PLAY”?] I was filming another content video and I was asked to give a point move at the end of the clip But I couldn’t think of one 2017 Solo debut song  The point move butt dance 2018  hold-my-hand dance 2018  heart dance and cat dance  in 2019, followed by a lot of parody The supper addictive  in 2019 2020  The so-called lamb skewers dance and fascinating voguing This one for  and this move for  [Each song has point dance] I literally had no idea this time around Because it’s all about some moves and rhythm So, my favorite move is this one with a spinning hip in the chorus But giving this pose is a little bit too much, I thought So I kept thinking and I came up with a move that is also the point of this song itself "Play Play Play" this part There's a fake bouncing butt move Bounce Bounce Bounce I think that's the point dance [D-24 MV set by MC Duhui]
What is this? This is a reality show self-cam really?
You mean, my reality show? Of course It can’t be mine [MC Duhui got the mission from the staff] [Mission: MV set with a casual atmosphere] [Let’s see Chung Ha later on] Hey guys Yes??? I'm filming a video For what?
[Collectively embarrassed] [Never stop her interview] This is the second time, right? What is the concept of the makeup? There's no concept - No concept?
- No Okay, next Jung Duhui(Dancer):
I had no idea about what to do. I just said something random. Were those clips helpful? Did you add in any of them? Do you like being an MC? I guess I do [Who's the next interviewee?] I heard that B-boys are here Hey Are you... Are you the B-boys? Really? [Not a relevant answer, still the dialogue goes on] That's great We need some lights [Such an expert in front of the camera] [But so random]
Hello, everyone We are here to film a music video So, let's go inside! [He also likes being an MC] Okay. Come here! (I'm the only MC today)

Something cool, please [Ta-da] [The cute B-boys on set?] [D-24 Tireless Chung Ha Night] [This is a REAL B-boy!] [Art-piece-like performance] [Cute B-boys again after the performance] Are you satisfied with the performance? Yes. It was a little bit scary but it was a new and exciting experience [It's already midnight with the night growing late] [The MV filming still goes on] Ready, Action [Chung Ha still working hard with energy] [Very attractive, dreamlike scene] [Chung Ha working hard at a hot summer night]
It's really cool this way [Got a new skill(?)] [Double Fan Play] Ah~ This one doesn't work [Everyone knows this sound] [Chung Ha having fun with the mini fan]
I didn't know I thought I could make even a small vibration with the mini fan I can make the sound by myself [Chung Ha never gives up] - Is everyone here?
- Yes Let's do a rehearsal [The highlight group dance scene] [Last practice before filming] [The real game begins] [Perfect Sync] [Nine of them with a perfect sync] [Perfect teamwork, Perfect group dance] [Concentrating] [Monitoring is a must for a even better performance] [Can you explain "PLAY" with one word?] To be really honest "Play" is... an out-of-it song I hope it is an out-of-it song in a positive way The team is smaller, but still big When I dance I just get out of it So, I would say "PLAY" is an out-of-it song [It keeps going on without a stop button] [the never-stop dance that makes her out of it] I'm tired Now I'm... I'm kind of out of it How long have you been here to film the video? I'm not sure 18 hours? 19 hours? No. It's more than 24 hours I've been dancing like this for more than 24 hours So, I can't even count now But you look okay Maybe because I have a stronger body... It's just me who needs to do well [wake up] [filming the scene again with all energy she has] [Always like it's a first time in front of the camera] [Never look like she has been up all night] Cut [The last scene is done] [Make some noise!] Okay. Good job [Everyone is screaming] [Her team makes her smile] Let's take a photo [Everyone shines brightly in Chung Ha's "PLAY"] [Giving applause to each other] Thank you guys [What is the secret of the perfect teamwork?] I think that's what creates a synergy Filming an MV is an exhausting job But they always try to stay happy So we had a fund time again, shouting and screaming When we practice, the mood is really good Because Chung Ha 
always makes us happy and comfortable That is why we have a good teamwork [epilogue: SeeChungharang coming soon]
