one super neat thing about escalators is that even when they're turned off they still function as a regular old staircase but what about your phone why does the screen go black when you turn it off instead of it showing my wallpaper forever well it could if you used an ePaper display like the king broke a won a full on smartphone promising four hundred hours of standby battery life but are there enough benefits to consider switching to eat ink or is it more like ease stink [Music] we're gonna get to all the downsides above this phone in a minute but first the benefits who would want this thing to begin with well the company's IndieGoGo campaign advertises it as being optimized for eye health because as long as you're in a brightly lit room the phone doesn't have to emit any harmful blue light for you to see the screen that's because unlike the LCD or OLED screens on most phones e-ink displays don't work by shining light through a pixel and into your eye instead they're what's called reflective displays where the light around you either reflects off or is absorbed by the white and black parts of the screen just like most other objects around you like my t-shirt or this banana the k1 is certainly easy on the eyes and I personally love reading on it and it even comes with a Kindle app pre-installed sure the phone is only black and white but that can actually be seen as another benefit bright saturated colors are super stimulating to the brain but are relatively rare in nature your phone and its attention buying apps is full of bright colors that contribute to the urge to pull it out even if it's just for a few seconds while you wait for an elevator to arrive or your game to load switching your phone to grayscale is commonly recommended as a strategy for fighting tech addiction because it makes your phone less interesting but the k1 takes us a step further because there's no way to switch the colors back on in a moment of weakness it's like this forever and finally I could also see this phone being useful for certain occupations because unlike regular screens that can be near impossible to see in direct sunlight this one actually gets easier when it's brighter and the battery life can be a lot better depending on your use because although it does take energy to update the screen to create an image retaining that image like the wallpaper takes no energy at all that's how the K one's 3,100 milliamp power battery can claim an amazing 400 hours of standby if the phone's just sitting in your work trucks love box but only a much more modest 20 hours of talktime which brings us to what it's like to actually use this as a phone it's pretty bad mostly because of two interrelated problems app support and latency the k1 does not support the Google Play Store so can't easily download apps instead you're supposed to use the apps that come pre-loaded with the phone or any that become available later on when King grows own app store finally launches in whether we expect to be October and maybe the people who want the phone don't really need that many apps anyway but the limited selection along with the dated-looking UI and the jellybean era app icons make the k1 feel like a monochrome feature phone from the early 2000s but the reason they've made their own custom version of Android 8.1 and do not support the Play Store again comes back to the screen the eating display actually cannot pass Google's device certification because they're just not designed to display animations or videos at high frame rates and by high frame rates I mean anything above 10 fps really now I gotta hand it to King grow a little bit because unlike most ear eaters that blink every time the screen updates showing you the inverse of the image then all black then all white the k1 it is a little more choosy for example on the kind of always-on display the screen only does a partial update of just the clock so it does still blink which is actually pretty distracting when it's sitting on your desk like you think that I have notifications or something but if you open up the browser and go to YouTube you can actually watch video the higher frame rate comes out the cost of horrible horrible ghosting that gets wiped away by a full blink every minute or so but you can't do it another thing you can do is take photos with the 8 megapixel rear camera you can even use one of several built-in filters you just won't know what any of them look like until you view them from another device oh and the for selfie fans this prototype has a front camera but the final device will not so should you buy this phone well unless you're just super gung-ho and having basically a smaller Kindle that can make phone calls probably not I mean as far as mid-range phones go with just 16 gigabytes of storage 2 gigabytes of RAM and a mediatek helio p23 I think it's way overpriced at 350 US dollars I mean a redmi note 7 has better specs for half the price but on top of that I don't even agree with their main claim about eye health because the k-1 does have a backlight you can turn it completely off but it does have one which they claim does not emit blue light but it looks pretty blue to me and I'll probably be using it when I'm scrolling my phone in bed and that's actually worse than regular phones which nowadays almost always have a nightlight mode so with all that said plus the fact that ever-present image retention makes the screen a perpetual palimpsest I'm recommending a pass to all but the most avid ePaper fans door pupils
