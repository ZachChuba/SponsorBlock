Don’t go Don't say you'll leave me here Don't leave me in this memory Don't look at my eyes that cannot hold onto you Just don't go Don't be fooled Don't give into the temptation Not everything lasts forever When winter passes, spring follows, you know that Just don't go When today passes It feels like tomorrow will be different Will I be able to go on without you Goodbye until the day we meet again Goodbye until that day we meet again Does anyone know Does anyone know how it makes me feel Goodbye until the day we meet again Goodbye Goodbye Don't trust Don't trust the broken stories Don't lose faith The promises we made together come to mind Tears are falling down Don't forget Even if things get rough, it will be okay Come find me when you need someone to lean on Even though I cannot stay forever with you It’s okay just for awhile When today passes It feels like tomorrow will be different Will I be able to go on without you Goodbye until the day we meet again Goodbye until that day we meet again Does anyone know Does anyone know how it makes me feel Goodbye until the day we meet again Goodbye until the day we meet again Goodbye until that day we meet again No Goodbye Goodbye
