how much was the landing fees for Melbourne what's the landing fee law that was so cool how much was the land how much did it cost too much with the housing fees across him at least 2k thank you for all the feedback on my landing at Melbourne Airport video now you clicked on this video to know how much the landing fees were and I'm gonna start with that but stick around because I've also got some behind the scenes footage and a little bit of unseen footage that wasn't in the previous video so if you want to watch that stick around but let's go straight to landing fees then here's the schedule from Melbourne Airport the schedule of charges for anyone wanting to land and use any of the services at Melbourne Airport you can see it's divided into regular public transport our PT and non RP t and Section B in non RP t general aviation that's what we are fixed-wing general aviation column - there it says it's twenty four dollars sixty five six thousand five hundred and ten or twenty four point six per 1000 kilograms so you need to work out your max takeoff weight HECO Yankees who loses three thousand four hundred pounds which in kilograms is really easy to work out it's 1542 kilograms or 1.5 for two tons so 1.5 42 times the landing for in charge of 24 65 is a grand total of landing fee of $38 and once it's not bad hey until you check the footnote which actually follows there you can see the little number 6 and you go down to the bottom and the notes number 6 minimum charge a minimum charge of three hundred and sixty six dollars and thirty five point five cents applies now there are other charges as well if you look at the column headings across you've got things like Airport passengers security and general airport Security's charge passenger bag screening parking charges per 15 minutes checking charges I'm not gonna have to pay any of those I didn't use any of those airport services but if you do fly into an airport and you do park the aircraft and you leave handling you need security if you do have passengers then expect to pay additional charges on top of that but to answer the question how much is it going to be to land at Melbourne Airport I haven't actually got the invoice yet but I'm hoping it's gonna be three hundred and sixty six dollars and thirty five and a half cents it's not cheap I get that was it worth it yes it was worth it it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing to do but if you're planning to do something similar yourselves then just you know expect to pay around the same sort of amount but obviously check with air traffic control and air services before you fly in just to make sure that that's still relevant for yourself because those charges do change the second most popular thing I was asked is how did I get permission to do this and one of my favorite comments here is is this even legal well yeah I can assure you it is legal and I did get permission from air services beforehand what I basically did was I do have a contact to Airservices Australia from the work I've done with them previously I spoke to them about wanting to fly into Melbourne International Airport they gave me another contact in approach control to speak to I spoke to them I was then given a contact in the tower to speak to to plan it all out now the way that you can do it is look inside things like ursery as we have here in Australia or anywhere else in the world you're gonna have an official document of airport information and there's usually a number in there and that's where you start find that number call ahead tell them what you to do and just ask them first of all is it possible and secondly what are the likely procedures that you're likely to encounter if you want to fly in there another question that came up a few times next up Sydney may be well it's an interesting question because of course the opportunity to land at Sydney Airport would be amazing it's a longer trip from here it's about two and a half hours from Melbourne up to Sydney but I have done it many times before into bankstown Airport not Sydney International Airport am i planning to do it no actual plans right now would I like to do it hell yeah of course I would there's no restrictions of travel between the states of Victoria New South Wales at the moment so technically I can but it's just whether I'm actually gonna go and do it and no plans right now but watch this space the other question you guys like asking you a lot and not just on this video but on many of the ones that I do is the gear and the camera setup that I have so I did record a piece before flying that flight on what cameras i was using and where they were positioned on the aircraft I didn't actually use it in the final video I didn't think it was relevant to the story but because of you have you been asking cameras are obviously really important for these so I've got as many cameras bottled to the aircraft as I can for this flight the GoPro max 360 obviously sitting here on top so we can get those 360 shots I've got another GoPro Hero the Hero 5 that's sitting here underneath the wing which I've angled a little bit further forward as well because normally it captures like the main gear and the front nose wheel but what I want to do is capture a bit more of a forward view when with like hopefully over the top of Tatler Mehreen Airport to try and get those shots of maybe some planes on the ground and see what's happening down on the ground then inside the aircraft I've got my GoPro that's here on the window so I can get some beads in the cockpit and then is the overhead one which is pointing forward to give you those forward-facing views as well so four cameras oh and this one as well of course this one that I'm holding right now the clearance that I've got out of Melbourne international flying back to Moorabbin it was a VFR flight like I said in the original video and but there I actually edited out the clearance because again I didn't think it was that relevant to the story but I know that a lot of you you'd like here in the air traffic control calls and arranged it in this side of aviation so here's the clearance that I've got from Melbourne tower as I was lined up ready to fly back home tomorrow be Zulu on holding point kilo is ready for their fire departure we can get 1500 to station yeah that'd be great thank you okay Yankee is really keep Moorabbin virus and and climb to 1500 walk three four three seven cleared rapid fire Saturn 1503 437 echo Yankee Zulu ok Yankee lineup from like three four and like three
