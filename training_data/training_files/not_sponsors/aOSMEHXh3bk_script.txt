business [Music] welcome back everybody in this video we are going to take a look at the Sigma 14 to 24 millimeter F 2.8 d GD in art lens which is an ultra wide-angle zoom that is designed for sony e-mount and L mount Alliance cameras so an ultra wide-angle zoom is actually a pretty specialty lens it's for when you need to get a really wide area view into the frame so this works really well for architecture tight spaces an ultra wide angle zoom actually comes with an interesting set of design challenges so first of all you want to design a lens that stays sharp throughout the entire focal range so not only at its widest point but also at its most telephoto points the second challenge is ultra wide angle lenses are just prone to distortion and so controlling that is really important and then the third challenge and this is pretty much a thing with any wide-angle zoom lens even for like a 24 to 70 is something called field curvature field curvature refers to the part of the image or the field that is in focus and we assume that that field is straight and oftentimes the case with zoom lenses you have a little bit of curvature to that or kind of a wave pattern and so this will impact your image if you're shooting a group of people that are in a straight line or if you're doing architecture that has something flat in it you can have issues with sharpness and contrast tend to drift so I was super excited to get to use a new modern lens that was designed specifically for mirrorless so the test shots that you see in this video I headed over to the old T&P station here in Fort Worth the station was built for railroad use in the 1930s and features this beautiful art deco interior which was restored and guess in the late 90s and today it's used for commuter trains to Dallas I use it when I have to go to the airport but it is a beautiful space and absolutely perfect for testing this lens in terms of detail and resolution with all of the decor that's going on in this room so the Sigma 14 to 24 millimeter DG DN art lens is a brand new lens design so don't mix it up with a previous lens design they had four DSLRs which is the Sigma 14 to 24 millimeter DG hsm art lens Sigma do love their initials but anyway anytime you see in their nomenclature the letters D in it stands for design native for mirrorless and so what it was really interested in with this lens is the fact that we're taking advantage of a much shallower focal distance from the back of of the rear lens element to the sensor and also the fact that some of the older Sigma lenses especially when we went into mirrorless where DSLR lenses essentially with an adapter stuck in there so you can expect in this lens and you do see it better autofocus performance better responsiveness it's just a better lens in terms of ergonomics it's very well rounded optically this lens is designed with 18 elements in 13 groups there are three aspherical elements one fluorite element in five super low dispersion elements there's a lot of glass in this lens but it still is a reasonable weight and handles very well the front element though is extremely large and so as a result unfortunately there is no filter threading and if you want to use filters Sigma does provide a mechanism on the back of the lens for making your own or getting them from a third party you can put them together comes with a little frame that you stick in here it's not optimal but at least you can use filters in some capacity controls on this lens are minimal you have a ring for focus and another one for zooming there's an auto focus on and off switch and a dedicated AF lock button autofocus uses a stepping motor it works fairly well and it's extremely responsive sometimes non-native Sony lenses feel a hair slower I did not notice this with this lens at all the autofocus here is fast and very responsive so let's talk about one of the design challenges that I mentioned earlier which is called field curvature now this was a concern of mine before I use the lens because it's actually fairly common on wide-angle telephoto lenses field curvature is where that plane of focus is not flat and so particularly on a lens that is capable of shooting at F 2.8 it is possible that if you were trying to shoot something flat like architecture you can have it where the contrast and the sharpness are gonna kind of wave in and out on you and so I have a method for testing that that I want to share with you mention this in a couple other videos but I test this by using the find edges filter in Photoshop on something with texture so that we can see the field of focus and in this case it's just pavement on the street and what I do is I run several tests at different focal lengths and I found that there is a little bit of field curvature but it's actually impressively controlled compared to other lenses that I've looked at and easily dealt with if you stop down obviously to increase the depth of field but even at F 2.8 if you're careful you're probably not going to experience a whole lot of problems like I said this is actually quite common on wide-angle zoom lenses and it's very well controlled for sponsoring another episode of the art of photography field curvature looks pretty good but let's talk about sharpness so if we look at the MTF charts Sigma actually gives us two completely different kinds of charts there is a geometrical MTF this one is the standard way that most manufacturers measure MTF and a lens Sigma feels that this one is slightly misleading because it doesn't account for diffraction of light inside the lens they may be right on that but since they have a really involved method of recording MTFs for every actual lens that they produce as it leaves the factory and they put them all in a database they actually supply a second method known as a diffraction MTF now in either case you can see that they're both extremely impressive you see two line readings here there's one at 10 line pairs per millimeter and the other at 30 we look at the ten millimeter typically for contrast and sharpness the 30 for resolution both are really impressive there's a little bit of fall-off at the corners and just a hair of a stigmatism but this is really not something that most pixel peepers are even going to see this is a very sharp lens and as you can see in these images the results pretty much echo this at both the wide and telephoto ends of this lens it's very sharp and impressive throughout the entire focal range and it is an F 2.8 lens so you can get some bouquet if you really get up on top of your subjects it looks great but I feel sharpness is really the big selling point here all in all this is a fantastic option for mirrorless cameras Sigma have come in competitively with price point image quality is awesome and performance is outstanding I only have two gripes with this lens the first one is the lack of filter threading and I understand that it is an ultra wide-angle lens and you're going to have a mammoth front element and that is going to limit what you can actually put on the lens in terms of attachments or filters but it's mirrorless and Nikon were able to overcome this with their 14 to 30 millimeter ultra wide-angle this is a 14 to 24 I wish there was some kind of trade-off there I do respect the fact that they allow you to put filters in the back but it's not really optimal and for landscape photography I like to use filters quite a bit so it's a small complaint but I think it's actually kind of a big deal and secondly so this isn't exactly a complaint that's specifically targeted this lens it's more of an ultra wide-angle thing in general but that is Distortion and I think that Sigma have done a terrific job of controlling distortion in this lens in fact they make a big deal of the fact that let's say you're shooting a beach or something where you have a flat horizon you can actually move the horizon up and down in your frame and it won't curve which is very cool but the problem is is in reality usually you have vertical lines if you're shooting architecture you've got buildings and what happens is if the camera isn't perfectly level at 14 millimetres those lines will move around it has the appearance the buildings start to fall away or fall forward on you because it's so wide now you can go into Lightroom you can go into capture one you can do some keystoning adjustments and you can kind of fix this but that's not exactly ideal what I would like to see and I think that Sigma or the company to do it is I want to see somebody do a tilt shift lens native from mirrorless now sure you can adapt a DSLR lens to a mirrorless camera and you can get it tilt shift lens and do it that way but I would love to see what somebody does with a mirrorless lens and we haven't seen it yet this would make architectural photography or any kind of technical imaging where you need to have lines exactly perfect this would make it a breeze anyway I would love to know what you guys think I was really impressed with this lens I thought it was outstanding especially for an ultra wide-angle it's sharp it kind of ticks all the boxes it's available and I think a very reasonable price point but I would love to hear from you so drop me a comment if you enjoyed this video remember to thumbs up and subscribe for more I'll see you guys in the next one until then later
