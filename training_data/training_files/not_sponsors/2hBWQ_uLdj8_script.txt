in 3 2 1 light phone - it is a different take on the idea of a phone a phone that you carry that is kind of intentionally not exactly a smart phone it says it's a phone for humans what does it all mean maybe this is just more in tune with human things it lets you be a human more of a human less of a digital human and a human human it's not their first kick at the can they made a different phone this phone over here this was a light phone number one shipped in a book flip the book it's pictures cuz you're a human that was the phone at the very end of it it had a power button a headphone jack a speaker that was the phone look at that's it could call people that was the whole point of it but of course but of course that wasn't perfect we need a less light light phone and then that's where light two comes in my knife keeps banish'd 4G LTE version raised a bunch of money people are interested in this idea digital detox that stresses you out and leads you straight to misery well your you know about this stuff yeah it's not a typical smartphone package as you could tell cardboard it looks like a book kinda reminds me of Amazon frustration-free you pull down the light phone is for going light it is a choice how will you experience your life today Jack out yeah you're not even you're barely there today where's the human you just liking it up a little heart here a little heart hair appreciate your time life is right now did you know that well life is right now you got the e-ink display for the tremendous battery life and of course it's easy on the eyes as well he's got a headphone check power button speaker light sensor up and up button toolbox menu down display microUSB and a microphone of course it takes a SIM card you're gonna need a SIM card still you still need to be available in the case of an emergency so you can pull out the phone over here it is a micro USB cable unfortunately not type C so if this is a companion phone for you you will need to bring an extra cable I really wish they didn't do that like that will I'm on the Lite phone I'm living my life on being a human and that's my right and that's my luxury I'm gonna go rock climb what else can it do well I mean the old one you're just making phone calls what about this one not much okay in terms of Canadian dollars this thing raised four point six seven eight million now I don't think that they really intend for you to replace your smart phone with this I think going into it they don't you don't realize the addictive nature of it the discipline might be lacking you find yourself out at an event on a trip you're out to dinner and all of a sudden a smartphone it emerges it finds its way it finds a path and be into your environment into your event and next thing you know you're locked and loaded the real application is as a as an extra device comedy shows they're forcing people concerts they're forcing people to put their phones away because of the recording and the video and the whole thing that people are doing spoiling the event in fact it's affecting many of life's experiences possibly in a negative what e-ink display as mentioned six hours and three minutes of talk time thirty percent charge in half an hour greetings welcome to your late phone okay so if you're gonna see wide adoption of these intentionally dumb devices then we're gonna have to get to a place where these can be substantially less money because at 350 bucks will you understand people are are squarely in smartphone territory landscape keyboard that presents itself it's such a bizarre experience because it blends you barely see the display in relationship to the phone they almost nailed the gray okay so it's booted up as you can see and you're left with the time you can see we're connected to Wi-Fi we have the battery life up there and then what looks like a simple home button I'm gonna hit that recent activity will be displayed here I click over here I have a number pad look at that traditional number pad over there I can search my contacts in the center and I can compose a message is that it said it will said all I get we survived we existed for so long with those features and this would be a cool phone if you had a phone this small back then with that set of features that you could touch oh here we go okay phone alarm he got the alarm we mentioned earlier and settings now because it's an ink display it has to refresh every single time so every click gives you this kind of blink they said that they're gonna include feature like future features future fits a future feature so a local music player turn-by-turn directions so it's important to know at this moment that this is not the final version of the software but what's different about this phone compared to the original is it does have the horsepower to have a slightly more comprehensive software suite and apparently in the coming months I believe the official release are the next release you're going to be looking at a calculator a Wi-Fi hotspot feature a music player somehow turn-by-turn navigation I don't know how they're gonna do all this on e but in a weird way this lack of tech is kind of the point of the device if it gets too fun to interact with then all of a sudden you're back where you started far as the essence is concerned that kind of understand the motivation there are individuals gravitating towards something like this will it work I don't know because that person obviously has an issue to begin with it's like a Nicorette package yeah you still get to get something but not the whole thing a little taster it's gonna be hard I think to figure out where the line is cut off if you do buy this as a companion device think a lot more people would be inclined to try out a lighter digital lifestyle if they didn't have to spend smartphone money on the light phone the other nice thing about this is going to have a mobile hotspot and so what ends up happening there will is you might offload some of your smartphone activity to a more stationary device like a laptop and I know you're saying that's a weird roundabout hack but just that small degree could make sure that there's there's more intent on your end and that you're less likely to do to kind of vegetable act of just almost automatic behavior of there's there's the smartphone so I'm gonna go ahead and throw the sim card in real quick is that a downgrade or an upgrade I don't know it depends how addicted you are so I'll pop the sim out real quick there are people who are looking for help they're all strung out with the Instagram and whatnot there's strong write out when you operate it you have to have an intent you have to have a reason yes all right I'm gonna try to call Willy do what's your number four one six this is where Jack leaves your number again hey hey there you go oh my god you sound terrible really well maybe it's cuz I got the volume cranked hang on a day hey oh that's better that's better yeah that's better okay you sound like will now ah I'm just calling you from my light phone - okay yeah I'm post I'm post social media you're a minimalist now yeah I post social media okay well you got a pixel over there yeah yeah you're not a human you know I'm gonna Android working in Android right now that's right you know what gets weird with this well uh once you start saying hey it can't be too great because it's addictive then you can't figure out if a particular thing is bad on purpose or not okay make calls to nice no cuz I might get addicted yes so I gotta go okay I understand I'm gonna go be a human okay how do you evaluate something that's intentionally not trying to have features the premises please don't use me that much it's the opposite of what we've been told it's the opposite of the name foe mercial it Lewis it'll scratch your back it'll show you a good time it'll fix your plumbing and then this is this one is saying now we don't do further or like we don't do further maybe it's time for another experiment I've done it before I barely survived what was it the punk phone do we have a punk phone this phone I tried to live life on this phone of course there's a different take at the minimalist phone what did I do a week with this thing kind of went crazy you don't realize it until you do an experiment like this just how reliant you are on the smart phone to do all kinds of daily activity so we've seen a couple different attempts at this I don't think it's going to change the world do I think it could make some people happy or sure it could but on the flip side it could also make you feel more isolated if the conversation has moved to the smartphone to what level of isolation are you willing to go to make this alternative statement to attempt to get healthy you might get more unhealthy it's gonna be an uphill battle if you think you're going to fight the technology beast the culture beast the movement the progression of humanity through technology it's an uphill battle well and we've been right here on the front lines and we'll continue to be
