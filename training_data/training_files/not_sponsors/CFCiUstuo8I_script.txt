hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with Salisbury steak that's right when I was a kid we didn't have
smartphones or the Internet all we had was a TV that if were lucky got like
three stations and the only shows on where the news are Ed Sullivan but we
didn't care because as we watched we got to enjoy a little something called a TV
dinner and the king of the TV dinners in my opinion was the Salisbury steak which
is what we're gonna show how to make here while at the same time showing you
how to make one of the greatest gravies ever invented so with that let's go
ahead get started with a pound of ground beef and for this I suggest go right
to the meat counter and have them grind it fresh for and ideally you're
gonna use the 85/15 blend and what we'll do is spice this up with some freshly
ground black pepper plus a little bit of dry mustard at which point we'll add a
couple very very key ingredients which are a couple tablespoons of tomato
ketchup plus a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce alright don't skip
that we'll also sneak in a teaspoon of soy sauce and then we'll finish up with
one beaten egg a few shakes of cayenne and then last but not least some plain
breadcrumbs and then once all that's in there we'll take a fork and give this a
mix until everything is very thoroughly combined and while it's gonna take a
little longer than just using your hands I think by using the fork we avoid
warming up and mashing in that fat which can result in a tougher Salisbury steak
so while we do want this very well mixed the last we handle it the better but
having said that because we are using a fair amount of breadcrumbs even if you
did over mix this a little bit these patties are still gonna be pretty tender
so don't stress too much oh and by the way speaking of breadcrumbs this is
often described as a hamburger steak but because of what we're throwing in here
this is much much closer and taste and texture to a meatloaf which is one of
the reasons I love it so much I am a meatloaf fiend and then once that's
mixed we could use it right away if we had to but I think it's much much better
if we Pat it down wrap it up and place it in the fridge for at least a few
hours okay and can even go overnight if want and that's just gonna give
it a little bit of time for all those flavors to develop Plus while that's in
the fridge we can go ahead and whip up our brown gravy
she's gonna start by melting a couple tablespoons of butter over high heat in
a large non-stick pan to which we will add a whole bunch of sliced mushrooms as
well as some diced onion and a nice pinch of salt and what we'll do is saute
these stirring occasionally until they're very nicely browned in the
process for what happens to these veggies I described as first we make
them wet then we make them dry then we make them
wet and what that means is when these first start sauteing you're going to get
a lot of moisture coming out of the mushrooms and the onions and it will
sort of bubble in its own juices and be kind of wet but as they continue to cook
that water's gonna evaporate and the pan will dry out at which point things will
start browning in that butter nicely and once that happens we want to continue
cooking until these take on a really beautiful deep rich color which for me
look something like this and then once that's been accomplished we will stop
and add our flour and we'll go ahead and stir that in and we will cook that for
about three minutes just to take the raw edge off that flour at which point we'll
stop and add the rest of the ingredients okay so to recap first we made it wet
then we made it dry which is where we're at now now we're gonna make it wet by
adding a spoon of ketchup a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and then three
cups of the finest beef broth can find all right preferably low-sodium and
we'll go ahead and stir all that together still on high heat and if there
was ever recipe where want to splurge on a nice beef broth this would
be the one in fact may even want to consider splurging for one of those
fancy bone broths which by the way are exactly the same as regular beef broth
but they do tend to be a little higher quality and lower in salt which since we
are going to reduce this a little bit is an advantage but anyway we'll stir all
that together and bring it to a simmer over high heat
at which point we'll reduce that to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes
stirring occasionally until it reduces a little bit and thickens up and if
everything's gone according to plan looks like this which i think is just
absolutely gorgeous and if want to give that a taste for salt go ahead but
mine was perfect and then once that's done we'll go ahead and transfer it into
some kind of measuring cup or bowl and we'll make sure we use a spatula to
scrape that pan as clean as we can and that's it once our gravy is done we'll
simply reserve that until needed and yes I'm doing this backwards most recipes
have cook yourselves berry steaks first and then remove those from the
pan and then make your gravy and then put it all together but I think this
method works out so much better and is much easier logistically when we're
ready to serve and that's it will return our scrape clean pan to the stove where
we will eventually fry ourselves berry steaks and some melted butter but before
that happens we have to form them which I'm going to do of course with some damp
hands since damp hands make smooth Salsbury steaks so will moisten our
hands with a little bit of water and then we'll take one-quarter of our
mixture and form it into a patty about a half inch thick then while Oval is the
most traditional shape could make these round if want or I guess
square or triangular if you're really weird
so doom how want I mean are after all the dr. James Salisbury of how
the shape might vary but the point is it really doesn't matter as long as they're
about 1/2 inch thick and before we fry these up I do like to season both sides
with some salt although be careful especially if used a cheap beef
broth which tend to be a lot of salt here and depending on how salty your
gravy already tastes may want to skip this step but anyway I did put a
little bit on mine and that's it we're gonna go ahead and brown those up in a
couple tablespoons of butter that we have set over medium-high heat
and our previously used pan and we are only gonna cook these for about 2 to 3
minutes per side or just enough time to get a little bit of browning on the
surface ok one of the secrets to a great Salisbury steak is finishing cooking
them in the gravy so like I said we'll just give those a couple minutes per
side and because the egg and the breadcrumb in our mixture that is still
going to be plenty of time to get some decent color and then what we'll do to
finish these is simply transfer in our gravy and then as soon as that starts to
simmer which is only going to take a couple minutes we will back our heat
down to medium and simply cook these for about five more minutes basting with a
spoon or until ourselves barry stakes are just cooked through and this is not
something we're trying to catch it medium rare medium alright it's
perfectly fine if not better that these cook all the way through since they're
only 1/2 inch thick that's only gonna take maybe four or five minutes and one
way to test which I didn't show is just poke them with your finger and if they
feel mushy they're not done but if they spring back and feel a little bit firm
there and that's it once those are cook we'll go ahead and serve them up
preferably next to some butter mashed potatoes and the vegetable side of your
choice and of course we'll spoon over a very generous amount of that gravy which
is not only one of the best-tasting Brown gravies ever but probably the most
beautiful I mean come on look at that and know a case you're under fifty the
ones in the TV dinner did not look this good but anyway let me go ahead and grab
a fork so I can make sure it tastes as good as it looks and I am very happy to
report it did and then some this really was fantastic all right what we have
here is just big beefy flavor and a surprisingly tender texture plus like I
already said one of the most amazingly delicious gravies will ever taste I
mean even if never make the steaks should still make this gravy even if
it is just a serve with mashed potatoes oh and one interesting thing here you
heard me named Chuck James Salsbury earlier he was the doctor that this
ground meat patty was named after since he actually prescribed it for dietary
reasons for his patients but ironically his was just a very lean patty that was
broiled and then just served with some Worcestershire sauce on the side so I
don't believe if he was alive today that he would be very amused that this is the
rich and decadent dish were calling Salisbury steak but anyway it doesn't
matter he's dead whoops hold on my melted butter dam broke let me fix that
there we go but anyway that's it my take on the
Salisbury steak whether you're gonna eat this at the dining room table you're
gonna find an old episode of The Ed Sullivan Show on the YouTube app on your
smart TV and eat this and from this screen like you're supposed to either
way I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below
