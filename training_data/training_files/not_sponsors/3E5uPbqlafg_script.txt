software version 2020 12.6 is here and it's getting us one step closer to full self-driving I'm frugal Tesla guy and we're going to take an in-depth look at traffic light and stop sign control when hardware version three started rolling out it was exciting to see the new visualizations like the traffic cone stop signs traffic lights and even markings on the road and although they were neat to look at it got old fast especially when orange traffic cones were popping up everywhere but now their true purpose is being put to use with the release of Tesla software version 2020 12.6 now for those with full self-driving the stop signs traffic lights and even the markings on the road are helping the car stop automatically at a stop sign or red light and with a little help from the driver crossed the intersection after a complete stop at a stop sign or once the light turns green now these features will work when the car is in traffic aware cruise control or auto steer now it's important to take note that with traffic light and stop sign control activated you will not be able to go any faster than the speed limit while using auto steer but you will be able to go at least 5 miles per hour faster than the speed limit when using traffic aware cruise control once you download the software you'll need to go into settings by tapping the car icon autopilot and then toggle on traffic light and stop sign control you will then need to read and agree to all the legalities now it's time to have some fun as you approach the stop sign once you get about 600 feet from it it will give an indication that you were about 600 feet and then it will count down from there 500 400 and so on now as you get closer to the stop sign it begins to slow down and then it comes to a complete stop you have two options at this point either press down on the right stock or press on the accelerator just give it a tap and it will creep out for you to check for oncoming traffic then you just let it continue to go and traffic aware cruise control and everything continues as normal this next stop sign was interesting because it confirms the fact that it not only uses the cameras but the maps as well as you can see I got the indicator on the screen that there was a stop sign within 600 feet away but it's nowhere in sight because it's actually around this blind curve here as you can see right there now we get first visualization of the stop sign and of course it slows down comes to a complete stop and like last time I tapped on the accelerator and it creeped out into the intersection allowing me to check for oncoming traffic and once I knew it was safe that is continued as normal but traffic aware cruise control so as you creep out into traffic from a stop I wanted to see if there was an actually oncoming car if it would stop so you can see it stops here there's a car that goes by and then I pushed down the right stock to creep out in traffic and there's that blue truck came way too close what I had to stop and press the brake myself then of course I got back into traffic and put it into traffic aware cruise control so you just need to play it safe and be sure to check that traffic even when it's creeping out on its own this next example is pretty basic just showing a four-way stop sign with oncoming traffic and once it came to a complete stop I pushed down the right stock and it went across the intersection no problem with other traffic on the road [Music] much like that of the stop sign once it reaches 600 feet from the traffic signal it will give you an indication as you will see on the screen there and again much like that of the stop sign it will count down for you how many feet you are from it if it's red it will of course stop now since there were no cars in front of me uses that white line as a point of reference where to stop and on the screen is indicated as that red line there now once the cross traffic goes and the light eventually turns green and then pushed down on the right stock and the car crosses the intersectional you'll notice there's another green light and another small intersection I had to push the stock down again in order to continue to move forward next example shows what happens when you're approaching a green light so as usual it shows that there is a traffic control in six hundred four hundred feet eventually it will see that it's green at that point in fact at any point once it does know that it's green you can push down on the right stock and it will move through the intersection without slowing down however if it turns red at any point after that it will stop at the intersection now what happens when there's traffic in front of you in the light turns green well once the light turns green all you do is push down on the right stock or tap the accelerator and it will move through the traffic light without slowing down however if you don't give it that confirmation it will stop at that green light I wanted to use this next traffic light this next intersection example to show you what happens if you're turning left what I wanted to find out is if my light is green but the oncoming traffic is red if it will indeed go on its own and traffic aware cruise control so once the light turned green I pushed down on the right stock as you can see there the car moved forward and you can see my light was green but the oncoming traffic had a red light but again my car continued to move forward but another safety feature is interesting it noted that the truck in front of me was a safety hazard but once it realized we were both turning left it no longer indicated it was a danger and everything moved forward as normal so the next question is what if you give it confirmation that it's okayed across the intersection if you see that the light is green which I did here you can't see too clearly I did give it that confirmation but between the time that I gave a confirmation and the time that I got to the intersection it had turned yellow and then red and as you can see here it safely stops at the intersection now what I wanted to do is see if the car would turn left on a red arrow as you can see here my arrow is red the left arrow but the oncoming traffic is green now you can see there's no oncoming traffic so I pushed down on the right stock and indeed as you can slip closely you can barely see it my light is still red and it's still moving across the intersection keep in mind I'm still in traffic aware cruise control so just one more confirmation that you need to pay attention at all times this one was interesting because I was approaching some train tracks and it did have the lights but the lights actually weren't on so what the car did is actually treated it like a stop sign the line is there the red line indicating that it was stopping so I had to push down the right stock to get it to go across the tracks so kind of interesting there up until this point we did see what the stop signs in the traffic lights that there was a white line for a point of reference for the car of course now we have confirmation that that is a point of reference for the car on where to stop now as you can see here at this intersection the car in front of me is actually on that white line and on the computer screen it's red because it's a red light and that tells the Tesla that is where you're going to stop even if the light is green now what I've got to do is of course either tap on the accelerator or give the right stock a tap down and it will go from red to grey once that line turns gray that tells the car it's safe to cross the intersection this was kind of interesting because I was in the left lane uneven and I wanted to straighten it out and the only only way I could do that was just to slowly move forward with the accelerator and it did allow me to go over that red line but the car never moved forward into the intersection until of course it turned green and I pushed on the right stock and it moved across the intersection eventually we saw that the car turned left on a red arrow so the question is will it turn right on a red arrow so you can see here it comes to a complete stop I push down on the right stock and it won't move forward the only thing I can do is press on the accelerator and move over that red line and once that red line is crossed if then goes back into traffic aware cruise control and everything runs as usual and of course I check to make sure it was safe to turn right so what I wanted illustrate here is that Here I am in traffic aware cruise control now the light turns green and it will move forward as usual but this is confirmation that it will indeed stop at a green light now there was no one behind me so it was safe for me to do this but you can see how it pretty much stops right there but then I pushed down the red stock and a moves forward and you'll see that there's another green light not too far ahead here I once again had to push the right stock in order to get it to move forward otherwise it would have come to a complete stop now next here I wanted to show what happens when you kind of get into that downtown groove and all of those green lights just kind of come on one right after another you still have to pay attention and you'll see that of course as we get to this first light you get that early indication and say hey 600 feet away is a next traffic signal once it knows it's green and once you know it's green all you do is tap down that right stock and it will move through that next slide now this next one is not too far away you can see I push down the stock and it moves forward this one's a little bit farther away but again early indication that it's safe to cross the intersection as long as it's green it we'll do that so once again you've just got to pay attention but you can get through these legs pretty quickly just by a quick tap of either the accelerator or the right stock overall I'm really impressed with the overall performance of this new feature I like the fact that Tesla has taken measures to make sure you're paying attention with conformation to move through a green light much like that of auto steer and auto lane change it feels safe and at no point did I feel like I was in danger or didn't have control if I needed it I like how the car slowly creeps out into the intersection a stop sign to give you time to react if a car is coming the on-screen notifications make it easy to react accordingly and it's nice to know that even if you give it early notification to move through a green light it will stop if the light turns red before you reach that light I was also impressed with how well it handled blind curves with stop signs and it actually stopped without any delay what cane is a nice surprise is it recognized train crossings and will stop if you don't give it confirmation to move through as with anything else it's not perfect it didn't move through a left red arrow however that was after I pushed down the right stock to move forward now this may be because not all left turns are protected but it should still recognize the left red arrow and treat it like a red light and not allow you to move forward until it turns green now at times braking was less than smooth and quite jarring and I was disappointed with the fact that it didn't stop while an oncoming truck was moving toward me while creeping out into traffic at a stop sign to me it feels like this is something the car should be able to handle and certainly leaves room for improvement in conclusion I couldn't be happier with this update is it perfect of course not but overall it works beautifully as far as I'm concerned now keep in mind this is my first experience with less than an hour of driving and I'm sure there are several more traffic situations I didn't come across and may discover more good and bad things as I use it more so what do you think have you tried it if so how was your experience I'd love to hear what you all think in the comment section below well thank you all so much for watching and you know the drill like subscribe and stay positively-charged
