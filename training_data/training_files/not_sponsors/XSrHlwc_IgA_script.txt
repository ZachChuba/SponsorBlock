[Music] [Applause] good afternoon everyone how are you doing it's lovely to see you all again as usual and I very warm welcome back to what's for tea and if you're new welcome to you as well this is what's for tea in my name is Cheryl and forty tonight amid these absolutely out stunned and let me tell you individual steak pies now I've asked for a race I've been asked for a recipe for such a long time for stand-up pies so I thought I'd do one tonight and it's all about this too and that's one guys it really is I'm going to be using ready-made pastry it's just a lifesaver but if you're good at pastry feel free to meet your own obviously but just my patreon underneath this video so I'm just going to get right and tit I usually leaving Lee didn't so for you to see but I don't have enough balls so we're just going to get right into so and a large pan you want to heat some olive oil and do that you want to add about a pound and a half of blazing steak or chuck steak a casserole steak whatever you want to use I get mine from a local butcher and there's a special offer on two for three at the moment so I ended up with three pounds or less beef so I used half a unless recipe so you just want to sear your beef so you want quite a high heat to that you just want to add some salt and pepper the mountain is up to you just to suit yourself so just make sure it's well browned on all sides and this'll take you probably about five minutes but this is quite an important step so just take your time and do make sure it's well browned and once you're happy left out and just set it to this side for the time being everything just gets done in the one pan so then you can pop in your onions and also your garlic you just want to fry these or sautee them and they're softened again I'll just take you a few minutes and then when you're happy you can pop in your flower this is going to help thicken up your gravy or it will sucking up your gravy you just want to let that cook for about a minute and then you're going to add your liquid so first of all I'm adding my stock just give that a good stir and it well second and then I'm going to pop in the red wine that's about 400 ml of red wine and all of these ingredients will be in the show more box underneath this video just poppin a tablespoon of your tomato puree followed by the Worcester sauce or Worcestershire sauce and once it's something you can add your beef back and give it a good stir the last thing we're going to do is add a few beliefs now if you've got yeah you know proper beliefs use them I don't have any so I'm using these paper ones just make sure the submerged popular lid on and you want to cook this for about an hour and 45 minutes as low and slow as you can and after known 45 minutes you'll be left with something like this now they're still quite about a kid even near so want to reduce this a wee bit more so leave the lid off and gather about another 15 minutes Semmering OE and I will just reduce down further and it will intensify the flavor of your gravy and that's this ideal you don't want too much liquid out of it because you want us to kill completely and more water will evaporate off so yeah just like that cool completely and once it's cool you can turn your attention to your pastry and I'm just using for individual enamel puns I get these ones from Lakeland but use whatever patterns you want you can even just do the one back-pay if you wanted I'm using two different types of pastry I'm using short crust for the bottom and puff for the top but you can use whatever you like just make sure the pastry that you cut out is slightly better than your 10 because you want it to come right up the sides to the top of your 10 because when you put your lid on you want them to connect together so we're going to blend beak the the qisas for about 20 minutes so you want to pop in some greaseproof paper or some foil and weight down your paper with some rice or baking beans or you know split peas lentils whatever you've got you just want to bake these for 20 minutes and that's your temperatures of the year because you know if you put your mixture into raw pastry that they're not going to cook underneath and like I said I'm just going to cut out the tops so I'm using puff pastry for it the tops so after 15-20 minutes left your base is out and they should be looking something like this now they're just about all the way cooked but not completely cooked as you can see they're you know they're perfect you just want to add your beef back in and just make sure it's cooled obviously now you can just pop your lids on and just make sure that you join them up together at the edges make sure that your tops meet the bottom of your pastry so that this tea nice and sealed just like this it's really easy you just want to brush the top sweet either a beaten egg like me or you could use some milk if you prefer cut away whole of the talk to let the steam out again that'll just help to avoid soggy peach tree and you want to bake these until they're golden probably about half an hour and you'll have something that looks like this and I was really chuffed with these ones like I said we're doing individual ones but you can just make the one becca-pie if you prefer so this is what we had 40 last night and they're really easy to get out the pans as well I'm going to cut into this one shortly just to let you see you know what they do look like and Sade when you cut through the middle there should be lovely and tender you know the meat should be lovely and tender there should still be bags of kitty and there you don't want these dry and we had errors with mashed potato and some green beans on the side now there's one missing I wonder why that is so this is that inside as you can see absolutely ideal it's gotta be squidge down and some of that gravy will ooze out wonderful and so rich as well you know because of all your wine and your stalk and you've cooked it for so long you're just beautiful and rich and that meat was fall-apart tender it was i mean it's lovely beef anyway because it's from the butcher and i would suggest getting the best beef that you can because it really has the start of the show and natural race appears all about that's you but like I said if you're good at making pastry I'm not I'm terrible at pastry then by all means make your own but puff pastry can be quite time consuming as well and very very tricky to get right I do from time to time eat what when shortcrust pastry that's fairly easy and straightforward but I always buy puff pastry like this it's such a you know it's an excellent time saver as well as you know a ton anoke perfect every time it takes the the guesswork out and not knowing whether it's gonna work out or know it so I would see go for the ready-made stuff or you know like I said if you if you're good at making pastry make your own but thank you ever so much for coming over like I said in the beginning just the check out the speed recipe I really do appreciate it and let me know if you're planning on giving these ones I go for yourself highly recommended if you delight yourself a wee pie then these ones were absolutely delicious everybody like they're mean who doesn't like a pie let's be honest so I'll be back in the next few days I think my next video is going to be the sharpen hole and then shortly after that we'll be telling you about that giveaway because that is just around the corner so whenever I see you next and whenever you choose to join me again main to take care of yourselves and I'll see you all soon back here on what's for tea so bye for now I know
