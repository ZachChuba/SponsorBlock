[Music] all right what's up mkbhd here and this is the new iphone 12. it's the purple one so this was probably the quickest announcement at apple's spring-loaded event this april but yeah here it is it's the same box as the normal iphone but purple and then inside it's the same accessories or lack of accessories and it's an iphone 12 but purple [Music] so there's been a lot of colorful products coming out lately so apple just unveiled at the same event their colorful new imacs they've got the m1 chips and they've got seven different colors now they've got colorful keyboards and colorful mice and colorful track pads so now there's a purple iphone in the middle of the cycle again so the classic six to eight months post release new iphone color to get it back in the news cycle to get people talking about it again and it works so typically this was a product red iphone they've had a couple red colorways drop six to eight months after the newest model and product red stuff was always this very deep vibrant red and they were done in collaboration with the red charity and helped create donations supporting hiv and aids treatment programs around the world so why purple this time well i can put a couple of clues together first of all there already was a product red iphone at launch time second this might seem random but i was told that purple was steve jobs favorite color and actually i had to google it and turns out if you google it it still comes up that purple is steve jobs favorite color and this actually marks the 10th year since he passed in 2011. so this could be some sort of tribute or a nice gesture for that seems nice now there are a lot of pastels in the smartphone world right now it seems pretty popular there's even a couple other light purple phones this iphone is kind of like a medium purple it's definitely not super deep it's not a bold purple at all it's more of a lilac more subtle reminds me very much of the xiaomi mi 11 which had a totally different texture but same idea medium purple you know what here you wanna know the exact purple color i'll give you a hex code this is the exact color google that pull it up on your screen give or take how well your screen is calibrated that is the new color of this new april 2021 purple iphone and holding it in person it very much looks like this the aluminum rails on the sides though are slightly darker just slightly but overall it's a pretty subtle look other than that i mean it's an iphone 12. there's there's also a purple iphone 12 mini so they'll both look just like this no 12 pro or 12 pro max but everything else about this phone is the same same cameras same hardware same phone just purple so i can see the comments already oh most people put a case on their phones so who really cares about a new color but they're on top of this already everybody's on top of this so apple also made a new magsafe purple case it is uh way darker way more purple but it's launching alongside this iphone so you can grab the purple case for your current phone and it'll actually look pretty nice i think it turns out the purple case here on the red iphone 12 has this kind of cool double layered look on the outside i think that's kind of nice but at the end of the day if you're after this purple pastel look on any phone you can always just skin your phone so channel sponsor dbrand has you covered and honestly they're very close in color minus the reflections so i'll link it below if this purple really does speak to you videos like this are pretty short and simple some the question might really be was this worth the whole video and some would probably argue no most i might even argue no but at the end of the day when it comes down to it people care about new apple hardware and specifically new colors of iphones more than i ever thought when you look at the view count of this video i mean you're watching it now you got this far people actually care about this stuff so at the end of the day this video probably helps to pay for another better future free video so that's a win this type of mid-cycle refresh happens like clockwork and if you're wondering why i've already made an entire video on this specific topic i'll link it below just about why companies do this six months later one new color of the same phone thing and i did that video about three years ago when oneplus came out with a new red version of the oneplus 6. so this is not like some new phenomenon so purple purple is new and cool but new color six months later we've seen it before so i'll link that video below like button if you want to checkout you'll save 15 bucks you're welcome all right thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
