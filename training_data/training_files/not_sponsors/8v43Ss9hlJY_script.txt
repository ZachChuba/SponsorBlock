let's take a look at the story that's got the people worried in New England this week it's Tom Brady and everything he's gonna do this year this offseason he's setting up perfectly for Tom Brady to maestro 31 NFL teams well I'm sorry 26 NFL teams and have one team and it's fan base in New England ultimately worried as hell that's the greatest of all time the man who spent 20 years in one city won six Super Bowls God handsome got famous did all of this while taking pay cut after pay cut after pay cut has finally decided that he wants to take his business and his futures control into his own hands and everywhere he goes is gonna be a story just this past weekend while Conor McGregor knocked out cowboy I must call him cowboy McGregor Connor knocked out cowboy Cerrone sitting front row with a great leather jacket as if he's in a midlife crisis as if he's maybe feeling as young as he's ever felt looking as fit as he's ever looked having a smile and a genuine passion about him for being out in the public walked in alone sat with Chase what a  and some guy sitting next to him I'd assume is some type of businessman then he was photographed talking to a guy with the worst haircut in the history of billionaires about his potential future they talked for 15 to 20 minutes and the world is up in arms yes Conor McGregor is back yes he didn't have a hair out of place but what conversation lingered into the next day and into the next day and into the next day which is what the internet does is oh my was Tom Brady talking to Mark Davis what's Tom Brady talking to mark Davis about do the new Las Vegas Raiders potentially needed a face of franchise because they're coming to a new city do the Las Vegas Raiders potentially sell more tickets no they don't need to sell more tickets they made like four hundred and seventy eight million dollars at one day in the seat licensing which every stadium does I guess which is a big hassle or too big a big work I guess they sell licenses and if you have a license then you can buy season tickets and they made they expected to make 107 million and I'm making four hundred and seventy eight million because all of the casinos I bet just bought up all those licenses so that they can buy the season tickets so that if you come in and gamble with them they can just give me tickets to a game obviously what they did didn't even think about that the NFL probably didn't think about that either until they saw almost a half a billion dollars coming in one day before even selling a ticket they haven't even sort these are licenses to buy a ticket they're already making money so they don't need to sell tickets but do they need somebody to go there and potentially legitimize them who's their star now their head coach Jon Gruden oh my god you get Jon Gruden and Tom Brady what a tag team for a team going to a new city that would be something that everybody talked about do we think that's the right fit for Tom no no way for Tom well hello there get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic I think it's a fun fit it is a something that we could potentially talk about Tom and Gruden having a disagreement is something that I'm here for I mean remember Tom Brady is a guy who does get fiery on the sideline he's not a guy that doesn't show his emotions Jon Gruden same type of guy they both have had success Tom's had more success than Jon Gruden Jon grids gonna say hey knock on what is your with me everybody's gonna knock but Tom and then grooms gonna say excuse me why aren't you knocking he said well I'm not with you I don't think that's what we should do they're gonna have a disagreement is that potential maybe but boy would it be fun to just every single time Tom Brady lands his plane somewhere just speculate that he's gonna be the quarterback for that NFL team because he could potentially be that because that is how this is all shaping up Tom Brady could go anywhere and none of us would be surprised he goes to Miami yeah he could be a doll for the starting quarterback for sure he knows Brian Flores Miami's the closest to Brazil I guess everybody cheers warm it's a team that won a lot of games that they weren't supposed to win this year it's in the division so I get a chance to play Belichick twice and everybody be like oh yeah you could definitely go the Dolphins maybe goes to Myrtle Beach everybody's like Oh is he going a Carolina Panthers over there because you went to Carolina like I can't go to Carolina can't anything oh yeah he can go to the Carolina Panthers if he wants to he can do whatever the hell he wants saw this success to Joe borough had he's like you know what that's type offensive I can still run because you know I have no the Carolina any team any team other than like five of them Pat mahomes team and Aaron Rodgers team Lamar Jackson's team Russell Wilson Russell Wilson's team maybe the Cowboys and if they pay the cop that Prescott maybe the Cowboys but they're gonna pay them because it kept killing more for a reason so like five teams every other city is up for grabs for Tom Brady and he knows it and Patriots fans just have to sit there and take it
