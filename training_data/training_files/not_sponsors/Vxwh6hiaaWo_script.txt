oh my god what's it mean the numbers Mason what if there's like a monster in Arizona did you just hide it here win I guess yeah if the circle came to you oh this is so cool any loops because oh wow nice gold loop Slough to get it is there no there's another door let's take our fill first and you got the code still Tom oh yeah I've still got like that oh wait now I don't we need another key card then no layer that's gonna go further underground in it if you look at cuz that that won't go back upstairs I bet you indeed I bet you needs a very deeper underground what was that noise Godzilla under here are there any secrets in here look around oh eight seven eight oh one good what could it mean seven - four - seven that the Phantom program pretty much isn't it oh no oh no joy what's that in Russia what does that mean in Russia a danger of electric shock okay nice brushing up on your Russian I see yeah I've been learning three to four 507 right just to explain before we get into some gameplay there was a big patch for call of duty today and in war zone now you can find these read access key cards and they are quite rare but their census form in boxes and also you can loot them off players that you've eliminated if they were carrying one and when you pick this up you can go to some of the bunkers that are just the doors and interact with them and it will open inside is a load of loot and at the back as you saw another locked door but you try that key code and it doesn't work and some people have guests on maybe this is something that's upcoming in the future some people have said that in one of their bunkers they found a nuke whatever that means we were thinking that maybe you need to get like two key cards in a squad to open that second door but we didn't manage to do it yet either way though this is pretty awesome it's obvious that there's going to be much more here you can also now interact with certain phones and when you do it plays a recorded message of a Russian saying to all units the base is captured change the encryption now and then he will read out a string of three numbers how many people have got lots of different numbers so I do wonder if collating them are putting them together might be to some kind of clue either way super cool love this kind of stuff in games and it's just awesome and doing it in war zone up next though I've got a really high kill count game for you guys to watch using a sick m13 built that I've created there's also some really satisfying sniper shots in here too but I'll put the m13 build up on the screen now so you can see what I was using and I'm playing here with jacksepticeye and my friend insta mash with that said I hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like and subscribe for more sit back relax let's do
