welcome to old school runescape's newest league trailblazer a two-month-long journey where everyone plays as an ironman paving their own unique path through gilenore you'll start out in mistlin where it all originally began and karamja is a free unlock complete tasks to unlock further areas but think carefully you'll only get access to three other regions so choose wisely tasks can be as simple as defeating a goblin or as difficult as winning a specific reward from a challenging boss and the more tasks you complete the more points you get to spend on powerful relics relics range in ability from tier 1 to tier 6 and one of the first choices you'll make is deciding which starter relic to receive [Music] the endless harvest relic doubles the resources you gather from fishing wood cutting and mining plus everything you gather will provide additional experience and if you lack the space in your inventory your wares will be sent directly to your bank the production master relic meanwhile will process all items immediately and award full xp when performing a number of tasks smelting oars smithing bars making cannonballs fletching logs cutting bolt tips cleaning herbs brewing potions cooking food and making jugs of wine also when crafting leather uncut gems glass jewelry pottery and battle staves and when spinning flaps or wool lastly the skilling prodigy relic boosts all non-combat skills permanently by 12. if they're boosted beyond that or drained below it they will eventually restore once again to this level plus as you'll be wanting to get about as quickly as possible as a bonus passive lock your run energy will not deplete this is all just the start of it relics come in all shapes and sizes they can offer xp boosts buffs for combat prowess additional luck with drops or even specific skilling buffs and if that's how powerful tier 1 relics are you can only imagine how powerful tier 6 will be those who manage to become one of the top trailblazer pioneers will be handsomely rewarded some of these prizes will help you in the main game while others will be handy in future leagues so as you can see there's plenty to play for [Music] hello everyone welcome to this week's uh old school runescape q a i am your host mod husky and today joining me are mod flippy hello and mod west hello we also have uh mod spear of course running the show and uh mod sarni on the chat to grab as many questions as you guys have to answer so hopefully we'll get around to that um this is mostly going to be a trailblazer sort of q a but the questions we've got i think we'll get through them fairly quickly so um i should have enough time at the end to answer your questions going through the announcements first um you all just saw the trailer there leaks ii trailblazer uh

backgrounds which we'll we'll look at together in a moment um we recently published september's gazette type exclamation mark gazette in the chat that's one zed and two t's uh where we talk about changes to our road maps uh an insight into leagues trailblazer leads to trailblazer design and we introduce you to a new jmod and our sort of usual update on all active projects um and about porting

you've done a great job cool yeah um i think i think we're all just great anyway um but what yeah yeah i'm uh i was a bit nervous at the start i haven't hosted but then like you know uh mod sweden put together a nice little a little page for me with just some bullet points to remind me what i need to talk about so you know basically he's doing the work for me uh what did you guys what did you guys all get up to this last week we'll go with uh we'll start with flippy first for most of these questions so that we don't talk at the same time um i'm not sure dude the last week has been like a blur uh played a lot of rocket league for some reason uh kind of back into that so i'm climbing out of uh climbing out of gold towards platinum that's about it nice uh yeah i've not really done much either this week i started reading a new book it's called dune it's quite old that's it uh myself um we've actually been we've got an offer accepted for a house and mortgage coming through so we've just been in the stages of packing so it's that unpleasant part of moving where you're all just sort of raking through all the stuff and deciding do i need to keep this do i not boxing everything up it's kind of it's not nice work but it's exciting as well for what that could mean so yeah moving into house will be a fun thing finally a homeowner nice that that you know that would be so much easier just gather all my boxes around pay for movers and just do a home teleport and everything just comes with me that would be fantastic [Laughter] moving on to the first question uh so i think this has been the the biggest sort of arrangement of questions you know i'm sure you've all seen it as well um is x content in this area what about this what about that um because the question is asking can you tell us more about what content each region has within it um yes there is going to be a blog coming at some point next week um it should hopefully have all of those interfaces on it that you've already seen from miss still in in the gazette so it'll be in depth uh that'll be great for everyone you guys get to see all the quests and diaries that'll be um sort of autocompleted with each area and you'll also get to point out anything we've missed right i mean we've done a a lot of work scouring the game to try and find things but you guys have already pointed out things with mistleton that we we need to fix right i think a big one was um oversighting that dorkish can requires goblin village quests which we're not auto completing right so we'll just mark off those diary tasks which is great you know there's so many minds out there that just point one thing each and you know we'll have this awesome piece of content going into release but these interfaces in-game will tell you all you need to know including where we have special sort of blocked off barriers um around the game world and we actually have a gif of what those uh those will sort of look like you're interested uh designed by mod west look at that yeah so uh fortunately quite a few of the areas have some fairly helpful natural borders you know rivers uh as you can see it's a fence here but there is obviously still gaps that need uh to be blocked off so you can't escape the area uh this is just an example of the one between uh northern elk grid and just below varrock mistlin uh they'll also be i think there's around seven or eight uh in the end uh obviously you could probably work them out from looking at the the maps that we've just released as wallpapers uh the the i think the largest one is the one between that sort of awkward area uh between mistleton and asgardia that's uh it's got just the north northern part of falador draenor and like the southern part of my brain village but it's not really a path that many people take so i shouldn't really get too much in the way yeah they're all roughly the size uh the design of them i wanted to give something natural that seemed like it could have been maybe like just my magic pulled from the ground so you know it's a rock uh roots and then of course that sort of magical barrier that sort of explains as to why it's not quite accessible at the moment until you unlock it yeah there's um there's also like symbolism on both sides as you can see we're looking from algorithm to mistlin so we have the glowing mistlin symbol there if you would look the other side you'd have the um the desert or the alcorids symbol there so yeah these are the areas that block off each of the regions these are so beautiful and i think it's like so cool that on on all the places where you clearly cannot cross the border anymore it's it's like it feels very leagues the whole thing and it makes the whole world feel united you know in a sense you see these things and they they really stand out from the environment which is a good thing in this case because you're supposed to be able to see that a player is in a different world so i think it worked super well with these uh big chunks of books yeah as well as it used to be as he's sort of shouting over the fence but i was actually i think one of the barriers is really is like one tile off of his spawn point so when i when i was writing the code that would spawn them there's actually a line of code that says move him back to his respawn point just in case we dropped a stone on him um i don't know if there's gonna be any other npcs i can't think of any that might suffer from that but uh yeah and we want you to be able to talk to i think he's ali the leaflet dropper is what his name is or something like that's fun um we were a bit concerned about the bridge the guide down by the bridge between uh kangaroo and framnic but unfortunately uh that didn't come the problem in the end there's also the warning sign in edgeville the wilderness warning sign which is completely just blocked off you can still examine it it's not the end of the world i guess but yeah these will only appear on league worlds naturally so you won't see them in the main game and if you have unlocked the connecting areas you'll be able to click on that glowing barrier and it will just take you straight through uh unfortunately the tech we have doesn't allow us to make it so they just disappear if you have the connecting areas um just because even though we could make the appearance of them look like they aren't there we can't change the fact that they are still blocking and would disrupt like player pathing um so we'd rather just leave it on and give you a click to get through as the cleanest approach that and the last point with this about what content each region has uh part of the difficulty in the in-game interface was sometimes it's better to show and uh not tell no one likes to read a long text list so we took something that mod west worked on in his spare time i believe and put it into the game as pixlr and you guys have seen in the wallpaper command but we can look at that map now so here's an example from the interface first which is um just kind of clearly separating the borders uh this will be in game and you'll get to click on these and it will bring up more information and you can see clearly they're all color coded with their own banners so that's one of the wallpapers yeah that was mine yes this was this one was for leagues it's kind of like i think we've almost adopted this sort of pixel art sort of theme for for leagues like even the relics are all pixel art um areas in our pixel art yeah it's works it's an undervalued art form definitely and then moving on to the next one where we see pixel or in all its glory we've got essentially you explain oh yeah i was just going to say yeah so it's it's initially i made this about a year ago it was in more of um of an 8-bit style color color scheme before and i've sort of adapted it to the old-school maps uh color scheme sort of brings down the contrast quite a bit and it just makes it feel a bit more realistic yeah i think it works quite well it's also obviously had the labels added to it as well so you can easily more easily identify which areas which yeah it's quite cool you have raised a lot of questions with this map i've seen whole whole twitter and reddit have been like what is this dark patch here what is this flag over here what is this pixel here see initially i did um i added i finished off uh manifos because i didn't want to just have this sort of empty void at the bottom there very much based it on what is established in the runescape law as a whole so borrowing from the sort of layout the runescape three used for the metaphors and sort of the area to the east there with the little crocodile swamp and the sort of raised plateau area it doesn't necessarily mean this will be exactly how it comes into the game but it's probably if we ever go in that direction something that we will be aiming for just so there's more parity between the games yeah i think it definitely adds to it to complete it um as opposed to having black boxes like we have in our current world map do you think it is it is um and these are all sick i actually have both of those as my wallpapers one for each different monitor now so nice so could you if you want those type exclamation mark wallpaper in the chat um yeah thank you mod west for being awesome west is best what's this first cool moving on to the next question i'm going to put this towards you mod flippy um are you limiting clues to areas which we have access to if so can i only keep one region unlocked in order to lower the steps and complete clues easier uh no so you can't you can't quite well now i answer no to two different questions but you can't you can't just uh stay in one area and keep all the steps in there we we did nerf clues quite heavily i would think since twisted league obviously you guys have seen some hints of the new relics through the sprites so you can imagine we haven't quite nerfed them down to the ground but uh but you can't change them that way by by only you know limiting yourself to one or two areas uh clues work just like in the normal game apart from the fact that we have disabled all the say a steps um so that's the only difference really yeah i think it would be nice if we did have clues obey only the areas you've unlocked but that would be such a massive job compared to what we did for uh zaya um yeah the scale is scale is huge and we just decided that we'll just leave this be a park where you might pick an area now because it has more clues in it right um and you'll just drop them if you if you can't complete them you know it's it kind of sucks to have to drop a clue but you know i think uh as i said on the flip side as well like it would feel weird as you unlock more areas it's like sort of making them feel harder so it would be weird to have that sort of thing yeah yeah i agree and i always envisioned clues um as kind of a side thing which is always good to do and always beneficial in terms of points but um i never imagined it being you know a main strategy the way it was for some people in twisted league and when it creates really awkward scenarios like in this case if you would only unlock an area and you wouldn't actually want to unlock that second or third area it it gets weird right so i think it's in a better place now because they're worth doing they're definitely worth doing still but not as cheesy i'd say cool um next question then why have you decided karamja should be a free unlock and i'll take this links i've answered this on quite a few different uh platforms like the league's discord and stuff um since it was released um so i think the first of all a lot of the the issues people have had with it was the order the information came out right we originally said on the gazette well when i wrote that i said you were getting mislead plus four areas and then suddenly people who were planning around that had one less area right when we rev when we had hidden the information to give them parameters for free but it's not that we're taking away one of your free unlocks it's that we're giving you an extra one um early on in development we were looking at the map and we were like how many areas should we give because that's a pretty big question as far as the balance of the league and flippy was pushing quite hard for mistleton plus three i was considering whistling plus four but when we actually looked it down and broke down like what you could get with four areas you were getting very close to sort of end game setups in gear in some cases and we don't want to unlock too many areas because it becomes less of a personal thing right now we want the areas to feel like this is your personal set of three areas and they can be different to someone else's if we unlock too many areas it feels more like what didn't you pick as opposed to what you did pick right um karamja however when we went and evaluated it we were looking and saying even with mistleton plus three no one is going to pick karamja right what content is actually on there to do there's the brim haven agility there's the tazars for their drops and onix fight caves and inferno i think just karambon fishing and a few other small things like that but there's nothing huge and when we started making task lists for each area karamja had significantly less points than any other area right because we look at the content and we make tasks for the content that's in the area right and when we were talking about this um we did a big review of twisted league um and what we did right what we did wrong a lot of people just kind of logged in completed a task and logged off we wanted to make sure that we taught players what the core gameplay loop of leagues were so that is um completing tasks to unlock relics and to unlock areas so because of that we thought it was a sort of good opportunity to say let's just give karamja as part of the tutorial so that you as the so the new players like new players to league specifically not new new players um understand how to unlock an area where to get that information etc right it just feels like a more natural sort of gameplay easy gamepl if anything that kind of backs up our choice right we don't want this to be an easy choice we want you to really think and try and weigh up which areas contain the content that you want to do the most you know yeah i think we always like tried to aim for that sweet spot where you wish you had just one more unlock because then that means that you it's not as you know easy to just look at like four areas that are clearly a bit stronger than the rest of them and just unlock them but it's like you really really got to prioritize what you want to do and what kind of playstyle you have and what you and be sure you ambition your endgame account to look like both in terms of gear and skills and tasks completed so it's more of an important choice the less areas you have uh in that sense so i'm pretty happy where we are right now yeah i agree with all that plus also on like the movie side of things like no one could be like oh i didn't unlock cram just so i don't know the fire game like you have to pick people yeah that's the yeah so i i saw a lot of people saying like oh you only unlocked karamja for everyone because you want to see people race to inferno that was a i'd say that was a bonus side effect on it like now we're gonna get there's the sour piss now we're gonna see so many people are actually competing for the cape which is always it's just gonna be great that you don't have to sacrifice one of your unlocks to participate in that uh i think that's gonna be pretty exciting to watch yeah i think that's the thing right it's gonna be more less about like who can get the first infernal kick but people are going to be saying what relics did they pick to get it first which areas did they pick first right how low gear did they go in with right are they going to get desert for the ancients are they going to go without ancients right um all these sort of questions are gonna be quite fun to watch and i think that a lot of people are also i think people would have been in the boat of i'm suddenly way more powerful than i am in the main game with these relics i'd love to try the inferno but i don't want to waste an area pick to do it right so i think this actually is way more beneficial to a lot more people and not just streamers you know if you've ever wanted to try the inferno maybe you haven't quite got there but you know you're going to be um there's a fly on my way like you know you might actually try the inferno now with these really powerful relics and it'll be good practice for the main game perhaps right you know if you if you play the league enough and get strong enough to do that so make more confident with the relics cool um moving on uh mod flippy what led to the decision to stop run energy being a relic choice and making it an always-on active perk um so i think with endless endurance um we've been talking a lot about this whole fun versus strategic choice uh i think that was like the perfect example of something that just everyone should have had from the beginning uh it was fun for the first league but running in in leagues as a game mode makes sense uh to never run out of energy because it's like we're trying to take away all the tedious parts from the game mode that you would normally experience in the main game and that can be really important in the main game as well we're just trying to remove that people have two months to just squeeze as much fun as they can out of the game mode so i think it just made a lot of sense to to give that to everyone as a passive and then give a more you know uh active challenging choice as the relic itself yeah i completely agree with that um and as well like people i think people have said like what's the point in training agility then yes there's going to be less reason to but there's also going to be tasks related to agility things right so trading agility will training agility will still work towards tasks right and there's also some cool shortcuts right that you yeah so here's a big question and i think it's maybe the one i saw on reddit a lot uh on release uh why are you releasing so soon to another major mmo release such as wow shadowlands uh so i could only answer from a developer's perspective here right but the way we end up doing these this work is we say what do we want in the league and we go through and we say okay we need tasks we need relics we start creating these jobs in our backlog right um then we start breaking down the jobs a bit more so okay what are your tasks we want area tasks okay so make a job for each area and we want like general tax involvement and we give these sort of things like rough estimations and i don't want to bore you down with like agile software development and stuff but we give them a rough amount of points uh relative to each other and like we just say okay we don't care if innator is bigger than another one we'll just say it's five for every area first right and we end up with this sort of number of points that represents the amount of work that we have to do until this can be released right um and then we have like uh managers that start tracking these points yeah they say okay the team's getting through 30 points a week and there's 300 points total so the release date's going to be in 10 weeks we do allow like a 30 sort of extra sort of things could come up we could have estimates going wrong um that we do allow for but it allows them to see when it is and we knew like months ahead of time that we were tracking for some point in october more than likely late october release and as we got closer and signed off major milestones we were like internally we'd sort of go around okay our release date's gonna be the 28th october we've known about this release date for two ish months maybe two three months right um we were obviously aware it could change if things got held up on our end right we weren't getting through the work but we are and then obviously wow dropped the shadowline's release date and we're like okay i guess this is happening but we're not going to hold off on giving you guys the lead content just for just because of that right you know you guys want the content um well you guys want the lead content and we're just going to get we're just going to give it to you when it's ready right um whether or not a project gets sort of delayed um because of another big release as well is it definitely not on our sort of decision as developers right you know so that's also we could really comment on it we obviously can't give it earlier because we still have work to do right we're not going to give you a half-finished product but yeah that's kind of the aspect right we just knew we were tracking for that and it's almost inevitable that you're going to release content at about the same time another game company releases content right i think that's just the way the world works you know we're not all going to try and fit around each other you know but i don't i don't know much about shadowlands but is it time limited i think a lot of people expansion right or i might say easy easy decision isn't it i think a lot of people like from what i remember i used to play world of warcraft back in the day a lot of people get really excited around the sort of release of the first raid of an expansion you know it's get ready the first week and and raid the second week but yeah i agree i'm gonna be competing or trying to get the dragon trophy so i won't be playing for sure and i'll be playing leagues and i think players just need to make their mind up right what is what is what is it that they value and want to play more you know no pressure what is it you value uh cool uh next question uh what led to the change to endless harvest being so that it now gives additional experience um this is a tricky one which we're still kind of on the fence about um so endless harvest is um much much better than what was it called before previously um uh hardcore harvester and arcane courier kind of combined yes so we combined those and obviously it's a lot better since it's one relic two relics combined into one uh but we looked at the that relic compared to the other two and um we've been kind of split within the team so um so i i'm a skiller i love afk stuff on the side uh yet i decided pretty early on i would really not pick that relic because it only benefits three skills that are not super crucial uh to the rest of the stuff that you you'll you'll do it's like uh having wood cutting fishing and uh mining is not really gonna you know get you better gear or progress you that much in terms of points um so i thought that that looked a bit on the weaker side because of those reasons uh now uh husky thinks they're that relic in particular is a bit stronger so we've both been kind of on the fence of where to put it and we decided that uh maybe pushing in that extra xp would make it more competitive towards the other two relics now i think we're both open to looking at the numbers specifically maybe tuning that double resources into like a 50 chance of getting an extra resource or whatever really but i think i think the experience should be there um i think it's more important probably than the double resources unless you're going past 99 in fletching smithing and uh and cooking but yeah it's generally just to make it a bit more competitive like production master will really like boost your account in in so many ways both in combat and in skilling skilling prodigy is just an overall super good relic for many reasons not just not just for training skills um so it was just to make it a bit more versatile instead of just being you know it makes these three semi useless skills really strong kind of if that makes any sense yeah i think i was as flippy said there i was a little cautious about just being double xp in these three skills i'm we might still look at that and like for them he said we still want to give the xp for the resource but maybe the resource happens 80 of the time 50 of the time whatever we're going to fine tune it and the reason we give this to the players so we can get the feedback on the first page the first relic pick is super important to players because it's the one they have the least time to think about so buyer's remorse opportunities are higher if you're looking at the future relics while you're grinding you have a lot more time to weigh up what you want to do with full information and i think it's important that all of the first relics are relatively competitive at going for the dragon cup right if you pick a relic and then later on you know change your mind and are like oh this suddenly isn't good for my points an endless harvest felt like it might do that uh even if it was really good for people with an afk playstyle the biggest thing that was off to me is you bank enough fish for like 80 cooking and still only be like 65 fishing or something like that right which it just meant that that the two skills were no longer training at that same ratio they are in the main game we know cooking generally you know let trains faster if you pick everything you fish but it was an even bigger gap and it just felt weird right you'd be 99 cooking and still training you're fishing at like the 80s right um yeah or on the other hand you'd get 99 fishing and you'd have a bunch of food that you know will take you past 99 in cooking and what do you do with all that food to cook kind of unless you're going past nine to nine yeah um and just to clarify we saw a question from the chat um the video how can you clarify how it works the release date video states items go to your bank if the inventory is full while the gazette seems to state it will go to your bank unless the bank is full you want to clarify that or um yeah i was actually thinking about this yesterday so i think in the current format the relic just sends the items to the bank um and i think that's how we planned it as well i think i gotta double check that just to make sure we're on the same page here but yeah it'll be i think whatever was in the first blog i think is the kissing game yeah it currently just sends it to your bank it doesn't wait for your inventory to be full and then send it to your bank um there's advantages to both yeah um another question um how will questing work for quests that require travel to areas that you uh have not yet or you don't want to unlock for example desert treasure requires you to go to multiple regions so you can't complete do you want to take that um yeah i can i was going to leave it open for any of you guys but um uh some quests are also completed with the areas when you unlock them desert treasure is autocompleted when you unlock the desert so you'll get ancients just immediately upon in the desert you'll have to go to the pyramid and change your spellbook but that's how that will work um some quests will just be impossible to complete i think we worked out the recipe for disaster is actually impossible to fully complete we could be wrong but i think you come up one area short and that's fine because we don't make a task for it there are going to be some quests that require multiple regions and it might just be a cool niche that if you unlock those specific ones you complete that quest um a good example is dwarf cannon requires asgardian kandra and we're okay with that um we just wanted to give you quests for significant pieces of content right and not having ancients because you need like three specific areas just felt off and as a lot of people have already pointed out desert is desert would be struggling i think if we didn't make it give you ancients right um we're already looking and we're aware that we might want that like all the areas are about the same amount of points but desert just has the least content for people to do um it's like mage training arena sorceress guardian cal fight queen it has some has like dust devils i think on this list which would be cool and then um like pyramid plunder and stuff like that so like there isn't actually a ton of content but there is some um oh this has been a popular one um are you concerned about overcrowding at places like bosses yes yes we are and uh we're having a meeting tomorrow i think uh about it so this is obviously um a question that has popped up a lot uh for good reason everyone is an iron man everyone is forced to stay uh within a few worlds so it's something we've been discussing here and there we're gonna have a real meeting just dedicated for this question alone tomorrow um and we'll see which approach we take uh after that really we've been discussing instances we've been discussing tweaking the damage you need to deal to to get the drop or for someone else not to get the drop so there are stuff we could look into other than instancing but uh of course we're still leaving that as an option it's just a pretty big job to take on at this point yeah i think the biggest one with instances for me is how much work it is and with a release date already set what would we not do for us to slot in the work to do instances right yeah that's the question for me there's a slightly less good potential for the players but just as effective approach to crashing which is prevent people from entering a boss room if someone else is there although that has other problems because you know you might have someone camping for a very long time with bruce and it might just be annoying to have to wait for a long time for them to finish so we like say we have that meeting tomorrow we're going to look at all the pros and cons we might decide to do instances we might decide a middle ground we might decide to do nothing but we'll let you guys know what we decide um before the release of it yeah i mean it's also worth mentioning that people will be choosing different areas and in different orders as well so that will help with yeah i think we the number of worlds is definitely a tool we have at our disposal to help that right um and it's hard to tell because it sometimes it just depends how popular an area is if like if like 50 of players have picked asgardia god wars is a problem but if like only 20 have maybe it's not right yeah um plus i think something that is easy to forget this like if you take the plows for example is that even how you pronounce it yeah okay good uh the plows and say uh i was super crowded on on launch because of course you get the biggest spike of players the the first few days um but when we're looking at stuff like god wars you know or like end game content in general you'll have way way less players uh getting to that point and people might branch off as well like everyone needed to go to the plows but not everyone will take the pvm route so it's there there are a few filters along the way of you know picking that area choosing that route and and then actually staying in the league for for that long yeah might not be as big of a problem as we think now but we we still need to talk about it yeah yeah for sure i want a team stance that we save the players and this is what we're doing and more importantly why right um cool and yes that was confirmation for chat people picked up on that god wars is in asgarnia we've said that to a few places it'll be in that blog next week anyway but that's what that little tale at the top of asgarnia is um cool um will you be making any significant content changes during leagues that might alter the meta part way through uh flippy uh no we'll try our best not to at least so the only things we're really looking into changing at any point is bugs it's like we we're happy to hotfix stuff that goes wrong because uh we have designed this game mode in a certain way and if uh if we for whatever reason you know either our code breaks or something we haven't thought of is abused or whatever we cannot fix that but general changes uh like we did a few times lastly we're gonna try to avoid this time so we want everyone to kind of start on the same page and uh that's you know that's the rules that everyone will be following throughout the entire league so that we don't come in midway and and tweaks something and and then you know whoever starts at that point uh gets a unfair disadvantage or whatever yeah i think the biggest one people see with this is locked picks and the last one was a big one um i think that in hindsight we should have caught lockpicks before release that it was required for the diaries and stuff and yeah um and after release perhaps we went about it the wrong way of putting it onto scavengers and maybe should have made like the um more in plain spawn or slightly higher rate or something like that so it doesn't change the meta but just there's maybe a bit of an overcrowding sort of measure input in place or something like that um but hindsight is 20 20 right you know it's um sometimes you just need to make a decision and go with it right and i don't think it ended up being terrible it was just that little sort of slap to people i guess that realized that meta and went and trained their hunter and did that ahead of the curve right so we can only apologize more out of principle to to you know set a standard for how we deal with those issues i think at this point we realize that it's better that just everyone has to live under equally unfair circumstances uh instead of making a small tweak mid league cool um next question is it uh is it possible that we might see crutch locations being a problem i imagine a few people want to unlock terran win for zola then realize they need the desert to unlock to create darts so it's absolutely possible that both us developers and players picking an area might have an oversight as far as something we are obviously going to try and fix as many of them as we can ahead of time but some of them are just okay to be sort of the hot like good strategizing and thinking your plans through all the way um even if you did pick terran win and realize the the blowpipe for example might not be as good if you can't make darts it's still a relatively good area right we're still making one of the things people ask is how we balance the areas and the answer is that we're making sure all the areas are as close as we can do without inflating points across particular areas too much that each area has about the same amount of points available right it just becomes what content you want to do um so the zorro darts one is one we're considering the question would be whether or not we give tourist traps as an unlocked terran win i'm leaning towards no but i'm more than willing to have that discussion with um with flippy and the rest of the team um when we get into the balancing part right because that's that's what we're moving on to over the next while coming up two leagues it's all just play testing balancing making these last certain minute decisions and tweaking things right so yeah yeah and personally as well one of the things is desert doesn't have much going for it so i quite like the fact that that is one of its benefits right if there's that cool sort of combo between terran win and desert where you have a blowpipe right and area combinations are cool right if there's a if there's a cool power spike because you combine things in a certain way i feel like that's kind of the point of the league right it doesn't lock you out of the arts completely there are awkward ways of getting hold of some if you really need to do without desert i mean it's also a nice little uh sort of limitation on the blowpipe itself it's already quite a powerful weapon so having that especially when compared with some of the relics probably a good idea and blowpipe isn't required right people forget that right like there are part of leagues is making do with what you've got right so look forward to seeing the matters that come out yeah same next question uh how are you approaching what could be perceived as a bottleneck in content for example if a quest requires an item sold in stores or an item is dropped by very few monsters um there's no one good way to deal with bottlenecks really we're even identifying them which is why we missed stuff like the lockpick or the what was it the battle stops that we increased for photoshop um it's like this time we are planning to increase uh stock refresh rates uh a lot faster the same way we did in twisted league and that's something i think we're doing globally this time around but that's about it in terms of like harsh changes for uh four bottlenecks and it's it's really difficult identifying beforehand exactly where they will appear and how bad it's going to be but we we do our best in that and i think the chop shop changes will make a big difference alone we we have a whole list of items that automatically restock when a shop's opened one of them is blood runes which i saw people type as a concern for for limited we can always add things to that and we may consider adding things like after like the release of the lead and stuff you know if they get really bad but we'd like to do it beforehand and it's wide like say we're going into balancing we're going into play testing we have sort of jobs assigned to ourselves to try and identify it's right we're all going to try and play um like maybe i'll say to flippy hey go and go and play but unlock martini as your first area and tell me what problems you run into right or things you think could be a bottleneck right whereas i'll be trying as garnier as my first area and someone else be trying wilderness as their first area right um that sort of thing uh next question with skilling prodigy will you be able to receive slayer tasks 12 levels above your base level such as an abyssal demon task to kill sire at level 73 uh was with a slayer in particular no you you can't do that you can kill an abyssal demon for example if you boost uh before you hit that slayer level so you could boost with a wild pie for example oh wow okay nice didn't even realize um but you can't get the assignment unfortunately so something like kraken will be locked to everyone and no matter relic until level 87. yeah i did consider it when i was doing the league slayer lists but it feels like just we shouldn't make weird exceptions or around the relics like that when it's not what players expect the gameplay to be um cool moving on to the next question um are you guys able to reveal the do-ability of mahogany homes for example uh are sidious contracts barred will someone with us garnier and kanderin then be able to do them will it assign contracts for unlocked areas um long story short is we don't really know currently uh one of our remaining jobs is to evaluate all content that has come out since we designed the league because at the time uh mahogany con mahogany homes was in its early design so we didn't make tasks for it right and we didn't factor into the area balance we'll eventually go through and decide either we allow it and we make exceptions for it or whatever or we disallow it and if we do allow it we'll probably add tasks for it or something like that and maybe that decision comes down to does that area need more tasks um right now my gut is saying we'll probably not allow mahogany home so that would be what my right now thinking is uh we'll probably just disable getting contracts on on league worlds because there would be a lot of tasks we could do for that and um as garnier is in a relatively okay place and locking it to areas you've unlocked might just be a bit too much qa work coming up to release when we'd rather qa was focused on other things but we can always discuss that later on right i mean in terms of like comparing to the literature rails it would be a lot easier to implement yeah it's the tasks and the other complications that come around with it cool i'll try and fire through these questions quickly if i can so we can move on to some chat questions um will learners be locked only to foreign region or will someone who gains access to dragon slayer 2 and its prerequisites along with the magic cape be able to access lunar spells um i actually had to go speak to the person who made this question hi shardo um they're basically asking mid-skills part of kanderin you need dragon slayer 2 to get access to myth skills so if i got um dragon slayer 2 by unlocking kandrin would i get lunars the answer is no because only fremenik is going to give you the unlock of lunars um so you need to unlock foreign to get access to lunar spell but um but theoretically if another area had given diplomacy it would have allowed you to do it through the spellbook swap we just intentionally made that design decision to make lunars be a benefit of picking fremenik and the same goes for the ancients yeah next question will the drop rate modifier affect theater of blood if so what happens if people in the raid have different multipliers would be uh well you programmed this but i i vaguely remember you saying you made the party leader affect the drop rate so it won't matter what anyone else has apart from the party leader going in to to be [Music] debated hello are we back hello are we back chat i think we're back one two three i'm watching another one oh they've i see a couple of debated so they heard you say that there we go okay perfect cool we're gonna run over for an extra five to ten minutes or so to answer some of your questions uh chat so stick around for that um but continuing from where i was um the question was will the drop rate modifier affect top if so what happens if people on the radar different multipliers um i basically said the party leader is the only one that affects it it's on the martini interface and you won't be able to get multiple purples uh per raid um i tried looking into exhibit fun but it was a substantial rewrite of peter blood's core loot code that just felt unnecessary when the effective thing that was going to happen is i think a deathless rate is somewhere like a one in three chance of getting a purple which is pretty pog i'm being honest so indeed so get yourself a tryhard friend that you can partner up with and do tv yeah so you know we're going to see people with scythes going around as opposed to twistedly where we saw like 20 tebows cool um are any other realms such as the enchanted valley included in mistlin yes any of those strange realms that don't really have a place so they can be easily defined are countless misstelling uh the gorak plain enchanted valley uh the cosmic plane the fairy queens headquarters to name a few obviously fairy rings that go to like an above ground place or a dungeon place or whatever that's already in other areas counted as within that area [Music] um will we get a list of all the relics before trailblazer league starts will be um no is the short answer um i think last league we we did release them around update town time and i think we're planning to do the same currently so in theory yeah uh 30 minutes before or so but otherwise you'll have to wait so what happened last time was they didn't know until the game started then wiki data mined them and leaked them yes so so instead we still put out the tasks before it so yeah people what we were planning to do last league was we were planning to reveal the tasks only at when the news post goes live but it turns out that there was a video that we didn't realize on the dev team that scrolled through all the tasks really quickly and you guys had all were pausing frame by frame to to get them all so we'd already given the wiki team the tasks at this point so we just said you guys just release it now to save players the pain of you know going frame by frame through it all uh we plan to hopefully collaborate with the wiki ahead of time so that they will be ready to release all the relic and all the task information when the countdown begins uh on the wednesday the update starts that is the plan definitely for tasks team might still say no to relics but i think we're all generally on the same page that 30 minute rush of quickly reading up all the relics could be quite fun to those waiting for the um for the update to hit right get that uh get that last second thinking of whether you still want to pick uh skilling prodigy or if you're eventually going to pick production master when you see the other relics you know cool um what time of day will it start um we haven't really announced that yet um we could have an earlier release just to make sure um quite you quite often on big releases uh the dev team stays like starts later and stays back later so that we cover as much uh of the day as possible just in case we need to hotfix anything um so we might start earlier because of that but i don't know um just keep your eyes posted i'm sure it'll be in one of the vlogs or announced on social uh coming up to it [Music] um and lastly uh to you flippy uh will houses default to brim haven instead of remington yes another benefit of giving ukranja for free is we fix the player on house issue we know it's afterwards well we're going to go through some of your chat questions i see about 50 of them 61 now i don't know if we're gonna get through all of them well we're not probably but um we'll just pick out as many as we can um what does it mean by the rewards could help you in the main game i think that's just the way it was worded they'll they'll help you by making you look badass in the main thing you could always sell them for money i potentially sell them for gold because they're all tradable um apart from the trophies um we answered the skilling prodigy and slayer question uh karamja player on how to be the starter we did uh essentially when you buy your first house it'll just be in brim haven and if you want to move it you have to unlock the area you're trying to move it to um will npc contact be able to communicate with npcs out of your selected zones well i mean husky wrote this to me on slack the other day and he was like have we covered this and i think i just replied with a mooncas generally no probably not right i i made a i made a small one point job to just kind of look to see if this would be a problem or not i think the things that stand out are like maybe slayer masters you don't have access to but if they're all doing the same thing does it matter um but if it lets you complete tasks outside zones that we haven't accounted for that could be quite bad right so we'll we'll look into that there's also that guy on the toilet in zeta the players know that i think it was hinted at with the um it's in the sidious region you can go talk to him and assume he has the same chat head fair enough um is it safe to assume that the big quests that require multiple regions will be unlocked from the area we start the quest in i desert treasure to desert kings ransom to kandaran etc for the most part yes i think both of those are correct you i think you get kings ransom but you don't get the night waves trading ground thing you still have to go and kill the knights um and desert treasure is still locked to desert but again you'll get more information on that next week once um once the blog goes out that tells you all the quest unlocks and i'm absolutely sure the community is going to point out and be like should you not unlock this quest or should you you know we'll obviously adjust them before releases neatly um will we get dragon slayer 2 unlocked at tier 6 or something to unlock addie slash rain dragons in mistland in order to kill addy and dream dragons you need to unlock framini to get access to dragon 3 because that autocompletes there and that will unlock the miscellaneous so the place you kill the dragons is counted within mistletoe in as far as whether you're allowed to be in that area um yeah uh and i see a few chat questions about song of the elves yes that's unlocked with um taranmin so as soon as you're unlocked around one you'll be able to do elf city stuff but you'll still need the i think it's 70 mining or something for zolcano maybe 70 mining 70 smithing off top of my head so you'll still need that and gauntlet will still be difficult but low combat lower combat gauntlet with relics should be fun um we covered the tourist trap and terran when thing we'll look into it but currently no um ice gloves for infernal eels and blast furnace um we don't plan to give you ice gloves so if you need them for any activities you'll have to get them but blast furnace there's a bucket so yeah you can use the bucket uh well will diaries be auto completed some diary tasks will be some won't the interface will tell you um we only begin clue steps we covered that um if we complete daddy's home what player and house location will it unlock so that's the mini quest attached to mahogany homes yeah i don't think it unlocks a player on house location right it just gives you money to buy a house yeah and that sort of well currently obviously hinges on the fact that you can't go to garnier in the main game so make any difference um i can't see anyone it does unlock your house [Music] fair enough elena's all said it doesn't lock out if you do construction so we'll just double check that that actually does still set it to brim haven because that would be bad if it suddenly sent it to remington um but we mentioned we would look into that wouldn't we see what it affects yeah yeah i'll uh i'm actually going to take a note of that question and paste that to you flippy so i have a note or i can look at tomorrow yeah i'm always in your notes board i am your noteboard if i'm at the weekend i'll just have someone raise something i'm like here type this to flippy and we'll look at it on monday yeah i'm surprised i haven't started writing stuff down like you know to myself considering having steak for dinner tomorrow we're we're not at that level yet maybe um this is an interesting question you guys should take will the area selection be balanced or do you foresee there being a meta selection i imagine eventually after some time but i'm looking forward to um i'm looking forward to like the names people start giving like the combination of the three errors they choose so i can watch that being quite fun and see how they like naturally develop over time as place big areas and it reflects on each other i do think that people will still go to what streamers pick for some of them um but i think people should consider like luke's will pick an area because woox wants to do the content in that area right like and we all know lux is going to probably go for things like firsts instead of playing the entire league so if he's doing like i don't know like picking mauritania because he really wants to theater of blood but you don't like theatre or blood and you don't plan to do theater of blood then there's probably a lot of tasks that you're just not going to complete in that area compared to another area that has more tasks you might end up completing so i guess the rule of thumb would be pick areas based on the content that you think you were going to enjoy doing for that two months right um we still got barriers from mauritania as well not onto the your blood stuff yeah yeah oh there's definitely a lot to do martini even if you're not doing theater blood or nightmare but there are points associated with theater bloody nightmare and we consider that when we balance the areas right yeah uh cool uh you can't use the same tech that uses the farming guild for the barriers between regions um i think the biggest problem with the farming guild ones is that you can delay the sending you out with interfaces and stuff um it does after you close i think there's like they're not the most secure and it's not the end of the world if they're not for the farming guild but we really really really want to like lock this off as much as we can right it's a bad thing if someone can do something in the area because they stalled or whatever right so we just went with what we thought would be the most secure possible [Music] um i know the new maps over trailblazer can you add the zia content to the 8-bit map so we have the whole world so yeah i initially left it off um during that time i was we just finished doing when i was making the map initially back last year i just finished the insidious rework and i very much had some plans in the works for all the other houses so i kind of thought it would be a bit awkward if i did an entire picture map of the ausai and then and then do another one once the other areas in the future had to get reworked so i'm sort of waiting for that uh which is on the cards for next year so maybe once that's for donald start putting together a pixel that map of them was there as well making a finally ever finalized map but i mean on top of that as well there's also the concern of not having violent finish yet and it would also be nice to not have like a giant like void on that as well or just a straight line where um i could have more men's so yeah things to consider there's another question for matt just a little bit further down is there a version of the map without labels oh uh if on my twitter there's the old one it's a little unupdated uh i did add a new a few the new areas that we added since i made the map uh i put together one layer without labels if that's what you want um can you open up the batteries after unlocking so it doesn't look like they're impassable so there'll just be a bigger gap between the rocks uh i think we kind of covered this earlier maybe it just wasn't super uh clear uh but essentially while we could make the model disappear we can't change the fact the model is mapped down there and because that model has to be blocking on one version of it it's blocking on all of the versions right so we can't make it suddenly not block player movement um so we have to give you a click to go through i don't think it's the end of the world these barriers are in very sort of niche locations that the players will walk through normally i imagine most part you'll just be teleporting to the next area yeah through either your spell books or the interface cool uh i think about five minutes well i just go through these as quick as i can i'm just gonna say regarding the teleport as well i got um this question a few times people asking if there is a cooldown on the on the teleport between the areas and there is no cooldown at all uh we made the teleport really slow it's the same length as the normal home teleport so that acts as a natural cooldown where it's not quite as abusable i don't think any of the locations apart from maybe cannabis is very close to a bank either so yeah it should be fine honestly oh and before i talk about go through these questions because i can i think i saw one asked a lot was how's pvp going to work and we kind of touched on it before but it's changed since then the blog next week will detail it as well but we got a lot of feedback about the whole safe depth and pvp thing because people don't want people grinding max sort of gear for leagues without any risk at all so we've kind of met halfway on that what we're going to do is we're going to treat a pvp death as a pvm death and what that means is that you will get a gravestone and your items will go to a gravestone as normal because everyone's an ironman obviously there's no loot transfer between people so what we're going to do is make you pay your gravestone fees essentially if you die in the pvp death uh but just to prevent sort of people griefing you getting back to your gravestone we're also going to move the gravestone back to your respawn location so it's about saying like yes like pvp will still have some risk but you might run out of gp eventually right so there is a reason to take cheaper gear potentially to pkn and if you take more expensive gear it will um obviously you'll have a bit more costs associated with it but that's the that's the idea we want there to be little to no risk and it felt like we got a lot of feedback that no risk was the wrong way so we went with little cool i'm going to route through this quick as i can [Music] well we need desert to make darts you'll need desert to smith them but not fletch them currently if that changes the interface will update accordingly is taran when going to zalra and wilderness revenants yes how will abyss work are you able to rc the altars themselves uh you'll only be able to access them if you've unlocked the area they're in for example uh you'll only be able to get access to wrath alter if you've unlocked kanderen um will corp go under will the unlock yes uh can you release statistics after the league about what areas and relics people picked yes um will slayer be specific to the area you're in what about slayer monster masters uh every area adds monsters to the list misstelling adds some cramp or get some so you get some from the start and unlocking an area will add another six monsters to your list the area interface will tell you which ones can you complete desert treasure it's auto completed with desert uh it doesn't have access to the inferno for practice under mine part the challenge i don't think so i think infernos can be a very different experience to leagues and inferno's been out for two-ish years now so i think it's it's kind of moved at this point i think that the challenge is still gonna be there but it is gonna be easier in the league for sure um hillary access normal governor's dungeon of ireland framework and not as garnier if it looks the map it seems cut off um you go to the garbage dungeon by going through troll stronghold which is part of his garnier same way in hollywood um well each region have equal amounts of total points there will be a discrepancy but we're hoping to minimize as much as possible roughly 10 is our maximum sort of tolerance um we might have an exception to that uh but that's what roughly what we're going for um can we get something to the poi to put old trophies like a trophy case yes we are adding a player in house trophy roommate past the poll you can check the rewards blog to see how that will work uh gobblers dungeon function any differently um we have a meeting tomorrow to discuss how instances and stuff might work um oh did you ever consider capping leagues with x amount of hours in order to make it fair competition we did it was an extortionate amount of hours for like 16 hours times seven per week but we just felt like that wouldn't feel great as a player and i guess it might be that it might be the case that this person is asking not to combat you know i can't sharing and stuff but it might be you know maybe they were thinking more king of the skill like in terms of capping hours uh and that i am at least pretty or very much against uh like really limiting the hours you can play league um or leagues i should say god i play league of legends i i love leagues i work with leagues so much it happens so many times every day that i'm like talking to my friends or beyonce and i'm just like leagues and they're like listen it's driving me crazy uh question chat which jmod is going to do best it's clearly me um i doubled the points of second place and i was the only dragon in the team so it's been really it's gonna be husky uh how mahogany homes work we covered it probably not going to work and we'll disable it but if we enable it we'll explain why in the interface peaking enabled yes um how will wilderness work regarding looting players from pvp some same iron rules we kind of covered this before i think already um just sort of watch the bot i suppose uh can you transfer pets normal rsrs no i don't think you transfer your pets from leagues to normal rsrs but you'll get to keep them league to leave um will there be peking related challenges i think there's a single task to kill a player and we didn't want to go more than that because it would be very boostable slash paying people to do it for you so yes you have to kill a player if you're in the wilderness and that's probably about as far as we go um can we please get a confirmation that shops will be super bad in the early league uh we're looking into it uh people talking here rune shops arrows and crossbows i think we've covered all those already um lack of blood rooms they'll be refreshed in shops how many worlds they're gonna be we don't know hopefully more than twisted league and reduce it if players drop off um can you implement instances after the league start or add them later i'd rather the leagues were shipped with everything with very little content changes um yeah i'd like is slayer help automatically in blue imbued you need more to get it um yes you need more to get slayer helm if you unlock kandaran you can imbue it we're essentially doing uh you buy nightmare zone points for one coin each uh because we're not enabling nightmare zone we disable nightmare zones so that you can't just afk like your weights like 25 mil combats uh in an instance so we've disabled that but you can still get the points to imbue stuff um what about looks like they asked do you need more tea to get it i don't think morty's got anything to do with that yeah uh what about wilderness how will you stop clowns locking down areas um clans are just going to be a thing in the wilderness potentially um there's not much we can do about it there's a question about it being emerging gameplay and stuff but we're okay with it because wilderness is an opt-in thing and it's like all the areas equal points so do wilderness if you like the pvp's content and or wanting to deal with clans and wanting to go that sort of thing and if you don't then don't do it um it's how we go there's there's there's like little to no actual pvp tasks so it yeah yeah it comes completely unreasonable for for us to look into that problem in leagues when it's already uh you know in one way a problem in the normal game or some players see it as a problem um so anything that is a huge uh fundamental problem that we have in the normal game we will probably never look into fixing for leagues specifically unless there is like a easy fix because of the game mode of course but yeah uh can we have instances um the way people when people check to join us go god works dungeon with bosses and friends um that sounds like a main game question as opposed to a league's question because you wouldn't want to do it with friends and leagues um because you neither of you would get the drop um instances to god wars would be quite big to the economy i don't think we are looking to offer that anytime soon um yeah i think instances would need the right implementation if anything regardless and i can't think what that would be you know right now but who knows um how are you making people start the same but giving people mithril plus lastly bonus to start the league oh you're giving starting items yeah okay we fixed this um you're getting cosmetic gear now instead of you're with stats so we're giving you the cosmetic like the twist relic hunter gear that was a reward from lastly you're just getting that in your trailblazer accounts depending on where you finish in the league uh we also removed the league ranked worlds or making them participation worlds i've seen a few people upset about that but it was a compromise to what we decided to do a few people on the team are not actually happy with leaked league rewards giving any advantage at all they should be more just a sense of progression of your account more than anything so we'll look to that on the next league but yeah they were initially offered before anyone had already had their chance to get hold of leagues themselves and you know have a go player and what it was going to be like and now that people have that experience with twisted league so i can understand opinions changing over time makes sense yeah um where are people spamming if uh they lost their awards okay i thought we were down again i was like oh no we're going to leave the incentive to do well in leagues the spirit of the competition itself and the trophy and we'll we could look at review links league rewards for the third league or whatever right and if if we did that it would be third league going into fourth league and not suddenly retroactively afterwards the trailblazers that you didn't know existed uh we plan to review that in the future uh how will wilderness work regarding looting oh yeah we'd cover that as pvp um you're an ironman there'll be no loot transfer pv it's treated as a pbm death and your gravestone goes to lumbridge or wherever your respawn is um is there going to be a fishing story mistlin or are we going to have to unlock shiloh you have to unlock shiloh there's no fishing store part of the league is having restrictions um or you unlock asgarnia and go there will any more direct information be provided before release yes there's a blog next week detailing each area uh how people reach can't turn whenever they do have kandra unlocked you can teleport through the interface um will you have recycled bombs to shops in mauritania for nightmare good question i don't think we should but that's a good question um we'll i'll that is a question i will paste to the flippy for us to consider because that is literally the trick for the content um are the underground areas available if they connect two areas such as goblin caves coming out to calphyte layer uh the underground areas follow the same restrictions as always that entrance to the calphyte layer um will require access to desert if you're going for the goblin side or technically mistletoe and vice versa but obviously everyone will have miscellan uh can you go to zonara so that unlocking is going to get dram and stuff you get a drama stuff added to your account start and if you lose it you can reclaim it from the league's tutor your trade will still go if you dive off 30 wilderness that's something i've been meaning to taste to flippy for a while so i will review that but i think it's a trap it's a pvm death so i think they're kept it's whatever happens currently in a standard pvm death above 30 wilderness i don't know what that is off the top of my head um can you confirm whether boost stack or skilling prodigy dwarven set takes plus 13 it would not will long diary grinds be helped by relics such as level 5 barbasol or chompy hunting um i can't really answer that without going into what relics would be because if i say no you'll get a gist and you say if i said yes you'll get a gist some relics will help with with some things in the game yes [Laughter] but barbara salt is going to be a thing in the league so that'll be fun for people who enjoy barb assault um have you considered also playing dragon slayer two at tier six to give addy green dragons uh we answered that no you'll need framinic um can you play trailblazer main game in the same account at the same time i personally would like this i feel you losing progress on your main account is going to suck if you're doing that but we don't have the tech to do that currently it's another league first board yes there is they'll have new league firsts um so yeah you'll be able to do those requests give extra xp yes questions multiplied where does your death default spawn you to uh lumbridge um will false island be unlocked for free since bonneville requires there yes you are auto complete bone voyage with mistlin is dwarf cannon auto unlocked nope you have to unlock with kander and asgardia can you explain how essex pouches work and does everyone have access to the abyss to repair them since you can only get them by being in the abyss anyway you'd have access to the abyss to repair them right um and what are your starter relics last question for the team i'm not sure i need to wait for balancing i think mine's more of a question of which one won't i choose because i'll probably play two accounts again because i want to try different things out but um i mean our own between not choosing the skilling the harvester production skills i think yeah that's what i'm definitely thinking unsure about the other two um so yeah i think people are right i think you can get the pouches without unlocking wildy i'm just reading that um so if you can then the pouches will degrade and you they'll be worse you want a pair of patches on lot wilty uh and as for my starter relic i'm torn right now between endless harvested skilling prodigy endless harvest just because i sometimes like to afk things and it's really good for that yeah um and maybe skimming prodigy because i kind of i don't know i i'm kind of trying to work out in my head how much of an advantage that would get me um versus basically guaranteeing 25 mil fishing with cutting and potentially mining with the other one let's disperse the chat is this skill probably actually good it's fantastic right i think people really underplay effects 16 out of the 23 skills you get shortcuts from them and i think luke's sent me a i snippet off the xp per hour for like for example pickpocketing rd nights and it's consistently a 40 increase next week per hour until you hit 95 right it's a really good relate yeah it's a really good relic for anything that requires your stat to successfully experience advice on stuff like slayer anyway that was all 66 other questions gone through quickly so nice thank you all for joining the stream um i don't really know i'm supposed to be the host i don't know how to end
