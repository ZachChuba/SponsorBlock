in what might be my least controversial opinion I really like the Nintendo switch in my mind it's basically a perfect device not because it's actually perfect but because I've had so much fun with it pureeing goombahs and exploring ruins and hearing that sound but it just doesn't matter now though I actually don't know about the switch it feels large unwieldy chunky and a bunch of other synonyms for heavy because I - Sebastian have seen the light [Music] that may be the cheesiest thing we've ever done this is the Nintendo switch light the gaming console I didn't know I needed until I held it in my hands so let's take a look at why I like it so much and also who might be better off with the original version this video is brought to you by vertigo vertigo SPL 4500 RGB LED upgrade kit wirelessly connects to your PC and features tons of color customization options including audio and visual sync and more check it out now at the link below [Music] compared to the original Nintendo switch the switch light is only about an inch smaller horizontally but it's amazing the difference in inch makes it's smaller form factor and maybe more importantly it's lighter weight takes a console that many people use dedicated carry cases for and makes it almost pocketable I mean even if it is an a is that a Nintendo switch light are you just happy to see me kind of weigh the ABS plastic is a little toy like in the hands but at least it feels like a durable toy and the matte finish provides a suitable grip but we basically expected that what surprised us was how the smaller size can change the way that you use the switch on the original switch neither I nor Alix our writer for this video used the touchscreen very much but on the light it's so easy to reach nearly the entire screen thanks to its small size that I'd be surprised if you don't end up using it all the time like we did the reduction in weight as I mentioned before is another big factor here because holding the light in one hand while using the other two touchscreen away makes a big enough difference to actually change the gaming experience especially in a game like Mario maker 2 where Alex has always found the editor extremely slow and frustrating to use but has been having a blast in on the light with the original switch I found that I was only ever truly comfortable in a chair by a desk or otherwise in a position normally reserved for using a laptop so yeah it's portable but maybe not comfortable at least not as much as our merch that's at a store calm the light by contrast is great whether you're in bed laid back on a couch or really just anywhere that your butt can plop down for a little while it's so much better feeling in handheld mode than the original that while we were working on this review actually multiple people in the office and I'm talking people that already own Nintendo switches said that they would be getting one for use on the go but just because I like it doesn't mean the switch light is perfect for everyone or perfect at all first of all the button layout Nintendo gets heaps of points for including a proper d-pad on the left side this time around although on the right they maintained the analog stick directly below the buttons which can be a bit uncomfortable now it doesn't bother me very much because I've already gotten used to it from the original switch using the middle of my thumb to operate the stick while reaching the buttons with the tip of it but I feel like even a little bit of offset could have made this way more ergonomic also as much as I appreciate the smaller size of the device as a whole the downsized screen feels more like a downgrade 20:19 has proven to be the year of high resolution bezel less mobile devices with vibrant color accurate displays a Nintendo seems to have missed every mark here comparing this to this one plus 3t replacement panel for $25 on eBay the poor black levels and the noticeable air gap on Nintendo's 5 and a half inch 720p screen feel kind of like going back in time and its really noticeable at times like in Super Mario Odyssey there are these beautiful sweeping shots that introduce you to the level and if I wanted to see any of the details in them I'd probably need to invest in some bifocals to be clear I haven't run into anything that's unplayable it's just that most switch games were clearly designed for a larger screen or a much larger screen and while I'm griping what exactly is it that a device in the year 2019 does not have Bluetooth support ok sure when the original switch came out wild herds of headphone jacks could still be seen galloping across the prairies but now there's a good chance that your best pair of your buds happens to be a wireless one so when you go out you're gonna need your phone your switch light your wireless earphones and pair of wired earphones adding insult to injury none of the USB type-c headphones that we tried worked either now you can get a USB bluetooth dongle so thanks Nintendo for your standard not standard USB C implementation but given that the Wi-Fi chip said in this thing supports bluetooth anyway it just feels unnecessarily obtuse and we still haven't even gotten to the biggest downside of the switch light you cannot dock it to a TV making it less of a Nintendo switch and more of a Nintendo stuck it just outright removes what made the switch so special compared to an Xbox or a Playstation when we took our family to New York I played breath of the wild on the flight while the kids were sleeping then we docked the console and played Mario Party on the TV in the hotel room it was freakin awesome the switch light doesn't work hooked up to a TV and straight up doesn't work with Mario Party so there as for why they did it Nintendo's official answer is something to do with being focused on portability which obviously didn't stand up to the sniff test so the community had all kinds of ideas like that Nintendo had used lower performance hardware or that they had run into thermal constraints or that they were concerned about basic physical and compatibility with the dock or just wanted to create artificial product segmentation so people would still spend more on a switch that actually switches well as it turns out thanks to the very similar cooling solution and more power efficient processor the switch light performs just as well as the original and gets only a bit warm while gaming and charging at the same time so that wasn't it but as Jonathan Downey discovered there is in fact Hardware component tree that is missing on the switch lights motherboard that would be required for it to output video to an external device leaving this out reduces both Nintendo's manufacturing cost and the complexity of the device making it less likely to fail which is pretty important in an all-in-one because I mean even prepared to the regular switch which you can replace a joy con if you have a joystick fail this is just one things dead it needs to be repaired so then they were actually just focused on portability all right Nintendo fair enough the 35 70 milliamp hour battery which is pretty easy to access for future replacements bt-dubs got us near enough to Nintendo's four hours of life in heavy games and about double that in lighter 2d ones but on the subject of reliability how is that old joystick drift problem coming along the joystick is a new part number but the design looks very similar to the old one and there's already at least one video showing drift on a switch light so far nothing on either of our units but we'd love to hear from you guys in the comments could this be another MacBook Pro keyboard situation which brings us to the conclusion the switch light is awesome there are a few things that would make it better better screen better buttons and the ability to well switch and even if we couldn't pull off those first two I would pay really good money to get a dock for the switch light because as a portable system it is so much better on the go than this one but even without any of that stuff the switch light is still getting a strong recommendation as I said before the original switch was very impressive but its lack of focus did hurt it a little it was super underpowered for a living room console kind of clunky on the go and the joy con controllers sacrificed a great deal of general usability so that they could double as mini controllers compared to that the switch lights laser focus on being a portable device is refreshing I never asked for 3d or multi screen gimmicks and quite frankly I don't miss them at all so the very reasonable $200 price tag coupled with the capability to play anything from breath of the wild to snus classic console games on what is basically a roided-out Game Boy Advance makes this possibly the best portable console ever don't at me the PC 37 X gaming headset off this headset at the link in the video description so go check it out so thanks for watching guys hope you enjoyed the video and see ya sorry someone was waving at me off camera they were miming me waving but then totally distracting me way to go Nick
