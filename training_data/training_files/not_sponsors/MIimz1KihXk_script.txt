in this video raga myself will be thrown into three different locations all that we'll be able to do in these locations is buy from shops skill or pick up spawns with each location we also get a random number of gp to spend in that area who will come up with the best strategy to win the final fight let's find out a massive thank you to and you'll be helping out the channel as well hello bees and g's welcome back to the channel uh just a quick note i'm moving on friday i move into my house on friday um and so i won't have any like internet or a setup you know i've got to furnish the whole like stream room and stuff so we didn't want to start the mini series and then i have to do all of that and there'd be like a break in between so this is just like a fun one-off solo pvp that's coming out it's nothing to do with the uh the mini series is it's just some content for you guys to enjoy um super super simple um you guys would have got that intro and i'm sure uh you know exactly what's going on so you know what we're going to jump straight into it i want to find out where i'm going first we've got three of these locations this is going to be our first one please be a decent one relica slash the lighthouse we'll take that and let's find out how much money we're gonna get to use in relica slash the light that is the big time so guys area one of three is relica slash the lighthouse i have 200k to spend and 15 minutes in the area every area is 15 minutes let's get into this i'm really hyped for that okay piece of geas 15 minutes on the clock 200k relica and the lighthouse is what we have i'm starting in the lighthouse just because i'm going to grab myself a book and then we're gonna run over to relica because there's actually a few good things to buy so here we go starting the clock let's grab the rewards and let's grab a unholy book and let's trade with jostic and i'm gonna grab myself just some tools just in case we like run into anything in the next areas where i'm like i wish i'd brought some tools we'll grab a rope as well cool and i'm gonna run over to relica now because uh you know there's the helm shop there's the warhammer shop there's all sorts of good stuff over there i'm actually really happy with this for a starting point uh the reason i went for the unholy book over like the balance or something is just because this gives attack bonus in everything um so like if we get a really good area and like there's a you know a crossbow or something like that that i think actually i should probably go for that um you know that i've got mage range melee all um covered so that's why we went for that one hey everyone and welcome to today's pvp challenge the pvp challenge where we have three different regions three different amounts of money and 15 minutes in each region to get the best setup very interesting concept let's see where we get thrown first we need some good rng this is going to be very very rng based and we have to spin the region first and then the money i know i can get swordfish from the legends guilds i can obviously buy ranging gear from the ranging guilds i think it only goes up to studded if you want the green d hide you actually have to play the mini game and 15 minutes is definitely not enough time to get that done so let's see how much money we're gonna have in this challenge uh please be a lot i want rune arrows 45k that seems to be like the middle ground ish area you know this is gonna be a really interesting challenge because even though we do have a time limit time really isn't going to be too much a factor at least not in all cases um but yeah so let's start that timer and just see the best way we can spend our money so we do have 45k and we can bring all objects to our next region aside from the money so we do have to spend all the money because we will not get it back that part cannot be transferred over i really wish i could have gotten the ranging cape forgot that was here so that's really annoying i didn't get any of the higher ones um we're of course gonna buy studded we're gonna buy the leather van braces the koi for quaff i think is the actual way to pronounce that and oh god let me actually check here first this is just the ticket merchant i guess i could try to get this stuff i mean i i just don't think it's possible i just don't think it's possible i know we could already buy rune arrows and stuff but i don't actually want to spend all my money just yet because you also have to go to the legends guild and buy your food there which is actually a pretty good um little upgrade i could only get a willow here just gonna pick some flax as well we can pick up spawns we can use things like that so i'm just gonna take a couple flaxes with me it might be possible that we uh we do something pretty cool later on i don't know yes harpoon nice so we're gonna get ourselves a harpoon hit the helmet shop oh no is there just none oh there's none in stock oh man okay we're gonna get an addy warhammer instead then and a berserker helm oh no i thought we were gonna get a rune that's annoying okay but you know what not a bad bad setup at all then we're gonna trade with yeah sir i think um and i'm gonna buy all of these things they all give stats and definitely worth it we're gonna have so much money left over because uh yeah i thought we were gonna get a roon at warhammer we are gonna get ourselves some sharks swordfish and then i'll go ahead and cook them and i realized i just got the uh i had the wiki up which was hiding the timer but don't worry guys it was still going it was still going that threw me massively i really thought i could get a rooner warhammer together but yeah so now i'm gonna spend the rest of the time getting sharks and um swordfish um and yeah we'll just we'll just probably drop the swordfish and try and get a whole inventory of shark but you know what guys i think that's a really solid start wait am i in the wrong one am i the wrong one lobster oh i'm an idiot i'm a genuine idiot that i'm i'm really losing it here i'm losing it okay big net that's where you go oh sorry to all the team links who are screaming at the screen for the last minute or two um so yeah i will keep them just in case we don't get enough sharks uh but we will go ahead and cook these um over in i think there's a fire in this tent okay that was actually not too bad we're about to finish the inventory hopefully with five minutes to go there we go um yeah so we're gonna cook these i will probably drop the swordfish and the tuna because it looks like we'll be able to get a few more sharks together um and i've had a little think about this money um as i was saying earlier with the uh with the unholy book i might as well buy the other helms as well just so that we can like you know if we do go range then we have the archer's helm etc etc um and i might as well spend the money because it doesn't carry over or anything uh looks like we're cooking quite well here if we could burn none of them that would be amazing um so yeah i think i'll buy just the the the mage helm and the range helm as well uh just so we've got them and there is our first burnt shark come on just one burn and i'll be pretty happy oh my god this is no oh no what what do they have here hold on do they sell a maple here or you oh this is bad this is god this is not good okay you know what guys we're gonna go to the legends guild real quick and i can go there without wasting any time i didn't realize this was going to be this difficult or maybe it really just is as easy as buying a willow short bow but let's uh quickly snap her fingers that end up in the legends guild so we're hopping worlds buying swordfish i also bought an attack potion of course all this stuff is off limits it's just this top four items here uh because that's what the shop sells i am going to buy 28 swordfish so i'm gonna buy two more and we also did get an attack potion just in case i'm not gonna bother buying steel arrows here because i could buy better arrows at the um ranging guild although then again i think the best hour i could only use is mithril with willow siegfried we're gonna buy a cape of legends um i mean this stuff is useless to me i mean i know i'm getting a left half myth seeds kind of pointless so we have 38k that we kind of have to spend in the ranging guild because this is all there is to spend money on in the legends so um let's head back to the ranging guild and find the best way to spend this money this is the only other shop we didn't look at these are really bad they give like 36 range strength and have a three second attack speed so i know some people might be thinking going for it the spec on them is atrocious it hits multiple targets and of course i'm only fighting one target so we are gonna have to spend all of our money on like a willow short bow oh my god i can't believe i'm doing this a willow short bow and i guess mithril arrows so we ended up just buying 250 myth arrows 40 rue and 40addy just in case i find a way to upgrade my bow probably won't dude there is no way i'm getting 2 400 in this time there's there's there's literally no way nice very very nice and we'll do the swordfish and the tuna as well again i'm hoping we can drop the swordfish in the tuna but i would rather go in to the fight with you know a tuna than an inventory space left free so uh we are holding on to it for now this flax i might also drop if we managed to get these sharks pretty quickly um just because i don't know how useful this is really gonna be to be honest and the one bad thing about this area is that there's no bank so i'm not able to actually like you know put the flax in the bank then use it at a different area um so that's what this area is a little bit bad for and it means that i have to sort of play ultimate iron man for this whole uh this whole time right now so as i say we are going to just drop them but if we don't finish it off in time then i will come back and pick it up and i'll make sure to pick it up as it's about to despawn so it gets another two minutes etc uh because i really don't wanna lose this food but uh we might be able to get all the sharks in three minutes okay i've kept one flax we don't need two that was ridiculous um and instead of all those inventory slots being used there um i've gone ahead and picked up the swordfish so we've still got them we've got three more sharks to cook but we do also need two imagery slots for the helms so uh if we burn one of these then we can get a helm but i hope we don't i'd rather drop a tuna and maybe the rope as well bastard okay we'll drop that and you know what i think i'm gonna drop the rope i can't see why i'd be using that um yeah yeah yeah yeah okay and we're gonna buy the two other helms i think we can afford the two helms let's have a quick a quick check um the farseer helm oh maybe we can't arch as hell how much is it 78k oh my god okay yeah i probably would have preferred to go for the archer's helm if i didn't there's a room warhammer in there now i know you're seeing the wiki but i've got to check this okay no people are selling it to the shop they're selling it to the shop okay i was about to say can we get a shark and we'll cook it in the next area come on okay it didn't happen but i think that's a solid start guys this money doesn't carry over so that will get wiped and we'll get a new amount in the next area let's go on to number two or three also be the g's can we hit 4k likes on this video i'd be over the moon and smash that subscribe and bell button if you haven't already guys so you get notified about all the videos all right guys let's see where the second place we're gonna be going is come on i have six and a half minutes i can't do anything else though i spent my last gp on nine more roon arrows 10 more adi arrows because of course we can't take any of the gp with us to the next region so if anything we could just drop this because we're not going to need it let's get up the spinner again guys first we have to spin and which region we're going to let's get like a big landmass here no more guilds zaya that is massive that is freaking awesome okay how much money do we have to spend and we could also get a magic short bow i'm pretty sure so 100k literally say less guys let's go run over to zaya and start that timer i literally just got done saying time wouldn't be that much of an issue but i think when it comes to zaya it might be this thing is [ __ ] massive this landmass look how damn big this is i decided to start at this point over here one of the entrances to zaya because it's closer for my plan i spent about five minutes thinking how do i get an axe on zaya and then i remember there's the freaking woodcutting guild that literally has an axe shop so ignore me on that one thankfully that wasn't recorded with me trying to figure that out but long story short we're gonna buy an axe create ourselves a uh magic short bow so i'm really really glad i did buy some rune arrows obviously i wish i bought more now but i don't know i was gonna get handed zaya then we're gonna buy some sharks and then we're gonna try to run to the magic shop and buy some runes after that we have a hundred k so by the end of this zaya chunk wow look i have chunk in my vocabulary now at the end of this zea round i'll call it we should have an upgraded weapon and some barrage rooms which would be really nice so let's start that timer let's get run on first start that timer and start running along let's go to the wood cutting guilds yeah this is gonna be hard with having no run because i'm already out of run and i don't even have my axe yet perry hand me oh which one do i buy i don't want to go incredibly cheap uh let's not even why am i ever thinking this just buy a myth axe so it's not incredibly slow but we don't waste really any money and uh let's go to the magic trees up here we only need one log and then we're gonna run to the general store snag ourselves a knife i had no idea people really still cut magics i guess they're just super chill and the most afk thing before you get to redwoods that's my only guess but uh we might be here for a sec maybe i should oh no just kidding i was about to say maybe i should have gotten an adio or a rune because we have so much money but glad i did it now [Music] oh that's a good one oh we could upgrade our weapon we could upgrade a weapon we could get a good cape um is there any skilling we could do that i don't know but that's a really really good one um we need the gp though if we don't get the gp then it's not good let's see what we are going to get come on at least 50k or something like that please oh my god come on oh the rng is in my favor today all right guys to be honest i'm just gonna go ahead and start the timer straight away um i had a little look unfortunately we don't have an axe so we can't get the the magic tree because we could have then fletched that into a short bow and possibly made a a magic shortbow which would have been pretty cool um there's the rooney rocks downstairs but i don't have a pickaxe um so this would have been really good if i'd had some tools i mean i'm not saying it's not good this is it's still a really really good chunk uh let's just bank quickly but it is gonna be a case of literally just using one shop and and then i'm gonna be done um you know that's the territory that comes with a challenge like this you might not be able to do anything but buy um but i'm not gonna lie it's a uh unfortunately it would have been great if we could have afforded these but they are just too expensive it would have been really nice to have had a shield but we do have this weapon shop available to us now i think the macy's got buffed quite recently didn't they so that might be the way we're definitely getting a dragon dagger although the mace has a good spec on it now as well let me have a little think of this as i say i've got 13 minutes and this is literally all i'm gonna be doing i think uh we will be buying the myths cape actually so let's do that because i know i'm definitely going to be buying that that's going to cost us 10k and is a big big upgrade really really happy with that um and yeah i just need to really think about where i want to go with the weapons here yeah guys it's going to be the mace it's it's now fortic so it's as quick as a scimitar and it's spec its spec is insane if we uh if we equip this 25 it uses and it increases damage by 50 percent and accuracy by 25 and it rolls off his crush defense it's the same spec amount as the dds but the actual weapons just like the stats are through the roof a 74 crush attack bonus it's just going to be so much more accurate i think this is the way to go guys i i'm going to have a little run round and see if i can do anything but unfortunately just as i say don't have a pickaxe don't have an axe would have been so so nice to be able to i know the herbal shop um cells i have newts and stuff but there's no way we're gonna be able to get like uh a guam together what hold on you have to sell a knife here hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on i think i'm just mistaken okay i knew i was able to get a knife here i almost panicked i almost panicked let's craft this real quick we need our flax now pick up one flax and i think we just have to swing this way we gotta go i think it's up here or something hold on i've done this before we're oh right here oh [ __ ] that's such a long walk all right put the flax on the spinning wheel let's spin this and we can get our magic short bow there we go guys looking absolutely amazing probably one of the best ranged weapons you can get i'm assuming this will be a very low defense fight so you can even make the argument this is better than a room crossbow but then again you know he could have gotten like myth skilled with 200k and my guy just went on a shopping spree or something so all right we have to make some room i want to sell it to a shop we have to make some room um oh because it's people buying it out okay oh this could be bad uh let's go to 2k plus worlds let's hope we can get some raw sharks i don't know what the stock amount is if i'm being honest but we're about to find out i doubt 2k plus oh 25 okay um actually let's oh it's gonna be a sin but we have to just drop those i mean we do not is that a bank deposit no it's a cooking chest what the heck is that cooling chest i don't think we'll have enough time to restock on the sharks if we burn any oh my gosh why do i jinx myself okay well we do have four minutes so it's gonna be a case of do i refill more on food we have the swordfish to replace any missing sharks for another but i think magic is just gonna be that crucial guys i i really do think magic will be crucial plus if we do bring magic we can afford a few empty spots on the food because we're gonna need the runes of course and maybe some switches but ah this is bad i'm gonna stop recording this before i keep jinxing myself you know what we'll buy it just in case just in case something crazy happens i will go ahead and i'll buy a eye of new and a violet water as well we'll get a pestle and water um yeah downstairs there's some blue dragon scales but that's for anti-fire we're not going to need anti-fire i don't think um but yeah i'll have a little look but i don't think it's going to happen and of course we can't actually attack anything because it's shops and spawns only um so i can't go ahead and start attacking the dragons and stuff which could have been a bit useful but yeah guys i don't think there's going to be anything else here for me you know what i was slightly mistaken there is a raw tuna spawn down here um and we can just cook it straight on the fire here so what i'm gonna do with the last few minutes is just hot worlds um and yeah just use them like nine minutes here um unfortunately they are aggressive these are these ogres so i do have to go around the corner i can't just be hopping uh constantly but yeah and we'll just get a little bit food together because obviously we didn't get ourselves um a full inventory of sharks so might as well get some food in case we don't get any in the next area uh so yeah that's it really all right guys there we go got way more food than we need now we've got those sharks we had earlier and we've got the uh swordfish as well so we are good to go um yeah i've been super lucky with those first two i'm not gonna lie i'm not expecting a good one on the third but you never know you never know so let's get this up all right here we go oh my god wow my rng has been insane so i could choose any option i want on the wheel so looking at what we've currently got i'd say my food situation isn't too bad at all um i'd say it's okay i'd say where we're lacking is actual like you know armor now we look so bad like if he comes in with anything decent like a like a mace or something he is going to tear through me so we should probably pick an area that uh that's going to give us some armor i think that's probably going to be the best way to do it so what's going to be the best option for that and i think if i was live stream right now everyone would be like take the risk take the risk so guys i think we are going to choose the uh caribbean desert so we got the whole of the desert and let me get the uh gp spinner up if this is like 15k we're in big trouble big big trouble so here we go or make your own money oh that would be awful come on getting that's gonna be enough that has to be enough only burnt four so that's five open spots we have the figure three for runes it might not be too bad then someone's actually buying runes too someone's doing what i'm doing is link doing a pvp challenge we have 10 seconds come on hop hop hop hop hop come on come on we're just gonna [ __ ] buy oh no we're out okay no i'm an idiot there we go guys let's stop that timer very weird how i kind of spent my money on runes the other shop this shop over here sold the death room so i basically just bought 150 50 per world hop came over here hopped a few times i only need one soul rune per blood spell so we only got 20 of those and i just bought 200 water rooms and put the rest into blood runes so i very very weird ratios here but um yeah i'm probably gonna do mostly ice barraging arc i thought he was saying my name for a second dude chill let's see where we are going next come on another really good one this could decide everything morsenia oh god okay well how much how much do i have how much do i have to spend there oh i mean could could it could it be any worse i guess i could have gotten the 15k i i actually had to think about this for a second because i don't know where i spend that money i already have sharks probably top off on the missing sharks i have but other than that i don't really know where i'll spend that so obviously i can't do it now but i didn't have enough time to come over here and buy a staff because i was frantically buying runes and i wanted to make sure the runes were at least kinda averaged out appropriately for the spells i want to cast but we missed out on a staff of water which would have been really crucial i have no idea what i'm going to do i've been thinking for the past 10 minutes trying to piece together some sort of solid plan with only 25k it's pretty hard of course i'm gonna top off on sharks that's the first thing i'm gonna do i drop my axe unfortunately um i don't know if they sell one there but i could uh still cook right here it's fine i could enter there without any ecto token so i can still cook my sharks but aside from that there's nothing i can do i thought about buying the um the evandis flail but it's 40k i can't even get it for 25k so i do not think i can do anything else in this region that could benefit me for the final fight there's no way to get more arrows there's no way to get mage gear there's no way to get more runes without doing combat of course that's easily enough i've been so lucky i've been so lucky oh my god i feel for kins i feel for kins although he could have been doing better than me actually i don't feel for him he's probably doing better than me that's sick okay bees and geez the last area that i have and actually i think i'm gonna have to use all the time here i've got a little plan i don't know if it's gonna work or not it's a bit new content that i haven't really done but i think we might have the possibility of doing something pretty cool um we got a bank right here so i'm going to start the timer 15 minutes i'm going to bank all of this now i am a little bit short i know i was happy with 100k and i'm not complaining because 100k is huge but if we'd had just a little bit more money i think about 7k we would have been able to get full rune from the shop here or at least a room chain uh but we can't afford the room plate legs and that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to buy the roon chain body the green d hat chaps and the green d hide van braces um which then puts us looking pretty pretty tanky i would say that looks awesome i'm gonna drop these for the inventory space and boom i think we're looking pretty solid there actually actually really solid i'm well happy with this um but what we're going to go ahead and do is we're going to run over i'm going to have to go up on i i know we can go over there um and we're going to go down to here oh is it lobsters only oh i thought i was gonna be able to catch sharks let's see let's see um whether that's gonna work or not if not i might just play a game of 10 pros oh dear and we're taking damage now yeah anyway so we're going to go over there i will check out this fishing spot just quickly um but it does look like it's going to be just lobsters unfortunately um and we don't have a lobster pop so that would have you know we wouldn't have been able to go from there anyway so i'm a bit worried i'm gonna die to the desert heat actually guys so i'm i'm not even gonna bother i'm not even gonna bother it says lobster it doesn't say shark i really thought it was shark there but it obviously isn't so we're just going to go with tempros and i'm going to try and get myself a couple kc then we'll open up some crates and see if we get some like food or something um i think you can buy a shanty pass on the door um and we've obviously got the money for that so i think we should be good to get in here if not this plan is completely gone and tempross is fine because it's only skilling xp you get from this so me and ken said we're good we're good as long as you're skilling that's fine you just can't uh get any combat xp so we are able to get it um so let's get on the boat as i say i've only played once so i really don't understand this game that well but i'm sure i can get one or two kc in uh 11 minutes so we'll uh we'll see if we can get anything decent from the crates so i know we sort of harpoon here then we like cook them on a range here or something and some clouds fly around honestly if you haven't done tempros before it's it's very odd it is very odd um in terms of shops this place is atrocious so not too happy about it because i feel like this this whole region's kind of wasted for me um even though i'm like five sharks short of having a full inventory only about two is gonna help me because of the runes in my inventory i came here to buy insulated boots and remember that a slayer staff is a thing that whole staff mishap of course we can't get a benefit on the water rune aspect of it but i'm not gonna buy anything else i don't need it for slayer dart what's the magic attack on this thing 12 it's better is it worth the extra inventory spot if i can go back in time um i don't know but i'm pretty excited hell yeah man okay let's go cook these sharks and then that's gonna be the episode for me because i just can't burn like two of them that'd be really embarrassing if i did and it looks like we're gonna have no issue at all cooking the rest of those sharks i'm gonna give one last scan because i i feel guilty leaving 10 minutes on the clock but there's nothing in here i could do and it would take like four minutes to walk there too but there's just nothing i can do with what i have and we have a staff now which was a very pleasant surprise here is the final setup guys we have just a one-way switch between a magic short bow and a slayer staff with the slayer staphon we have a plus five magic attack bonus if he has no magic defensive armor or if he has runon or something i think i'm gonna hit him just fine in this if he does have studded for example i think it's going to be a lot more difficult to hit because like me for example i'm wearing studded and i have 33 magic defense but if i take this off i do go to plus 14 which i think will be good enough to hit that sort of 33 defense uh when it comes to magic so it's gonna be a case-by-case basis i might keep it on i might take it off when i mage maybe i won't even find myself maging too much maybe he's going strictly magic and i'm just thinking okay let's just put the arrows into him and not worry about it so we have to make up our mind when we are fighting him now in terms of the runes i decided not to bring soul runes because i just don't think blood barrage is worth it i sacrifice an extra shark and i think blood barrage in the gear that i have is going to be much less dps than the magic short bow so if anything i hope to magic short bow him and then he takes off his armor and then i throw in a few barrages or something to you know keep him away from me and then maybe a few heels but i don't want to have to rely on blood blitz or blood barrage to win the fight not in this gear guys hopefully he doesn't have that good of a gear and my magic short bow just rips through him with rune arrows that's kind of the golem so we'll see you in the fight guys and hopefully we come out victorious it's not just me on my own here is it i don't see anyone else in the game i legit see nobody else guys i see no one this cup i can't be just doing this on my own we're in a tempos world oh no does everyone just do it in the american world guys i'm just going to hop i'm just going to take i'm just going to take it and just hot because i don't think i'll get a solo 10 pros oh that oh yeah everyone does it in the american world okay all right ah that's a little waste of time but yeah anyway we should be okay now right here we go two minutes 50 left so if we do get some raw food this would be a perfect amount of time just to be able to cook it all let's see what happens there is the tempros kill two uh casey and i think everyone just goes and forfeit i'll leave uh everyone seems to be doing it so yeah let's do it and let's go and get ourselves like our net or whatever it is two minutes 31 left excellent work cool let's net and see what we get can i have a net please mate give me a nap take that thank you all right let's see what we get [Laughter] oh oh oh what's this oh bloody hell it's all going on is there nowhere to cook is there nowhere to cook oh mate you are joking me you oh wait fire oh thank god you guys would have crucified me if i didn't work that out boom there we go guys uh there's not gonna be any more time for anything else so decent setup really nice food across the board i'll show you the setup so this is gonna be the setup bees and jeez we are going to go with the uh the sharks swordfish as well that we got which was really really nice we actually got too many swordfish in the end with the ones that i got from uh relica and then the ones we got here at tempros as well we got way too much um an 11 prayer bonus so i think i might keep on piety for uh for quite a long time and we'll and we'll sort of gauge if i'll be able to keep it on for the whole fight or not yeah super happy to be honest guys berserker helm mythical k dragon mace rune chain body the unholy book green dehyde chaps and the frame nick and the green d hut bams as well which means if he does go magic we have that 15 magic defense which that's huge that's so so massive to be in the positives there over 100 defense and everything else which is really really nice to see and this bad boy with a 74 crush and the spec i think is going to be so nice so let's get into it kid nice hello hello we got a little bit of an old style today the old vibes you know i could feel the old vibe juices flowing today i won't lie yeah sure man actually not really dude your knees are out it's kind of throwing me off i gotta cover them i try to reinvent myself for summer you know so how did you find your time mate um it so so my plan was pretty straightforward um i guess there's a few things that could have changed about it but i'm very happy with my gear with what i was given right was what i giving good i don't know honestly i did not plan until i saw my region so i didn't do much theory crafting outside of what i could or couldn't or what i couldn't do yeah so i yeah i've got an interesting thing that i wanted to ask you and i don't know whether you want to do it or not but um do you want to say before we do any reveal the total amount of money you were given oh yeah i gotta add mine up real quick hold on we'll be back with you after this short technical break no no you don't have to end it i just had to make sure they were right you know uh no i i think i got it okay yeah no i got it yeah okay cool but i'll go first because i think i think i got really lucky i think i got really lucky with the money like i think i had money left over in every region [ __ ] you not oh there was one where i couldn't buy something that i wanted but you're just flexing at this point i got 500k total 500k my highest cash deck i got was 100k here wow all three and there was a 200k are on there wasn't there yeah dude i spun 200k 200k 100k oh spoon friendling did you have to make your money at all were you all um no they are not i thought some were impossible bro like my first region would have been impossible i would have just been standing there that's not the old vibes that's the old buttons of the videos okay that makes me feel a lot better i'll let you go in front all right now it's just whether or not you've got better regions so let's do let's do the helm slot first this is gonna be very obvious oh my god gee i i wonder where he went so my guy had fremont oh my god oh no he's got magic disaster oh my god okay let's or maybe it was the only thing i could put on my head like okay let's go shield them mate did you get one together i don't have shields okay obviously we're friendly you can light it up okay it was a no-brainer yeah okay wow i mean yeah dude you had a lot of money which makes me think yeah that you probably are gonna be going ela maybe because you can just afford all a bunch of so i actually do i i thought the room warhammer was in stock at relica and it's not it's a night yeah it's a zero stock shop so i was like oh that's sick we're gonna have a berserker helm and the room warhammer and then i was like oh no it's only the addy in there so yeah that was a bit of a because i thought what a place but no okay all right um all right let's uh do cape and this will give mine away let's get mine away as well oh my god oh you had five or i i don't know what amount you got the myth skill but you must uh you had a yeah a bunch of ruin at your disposal [ __ ] dragon weaponry those magic trees there um but dude i had 45k the legends in ranging so i couldn't get the range in cape but oh that would have been a play at a half oh i know not a bad not a bad region though in terms of like unlocks because there's food cape yeah yeah i mean i did buy swordfish and um obviously i mean it's not like i'm giving anything away yeah i would have known that but um yeah i mean dude the best bone in there is [ __ ] willow dude really yeah so i was sort of like maple in there dude i was like how the [ __ ] do i manage my money with what arrows do i buy i'm like i could get a magic short bow in other regions but like what if i don't you know so i bought like 200 plus mithril arrows and [ __ ] and i'll just let you see how it unfolded but that's a [ __ ] match um dude alright so i got relica first then mid-skilled and i bought all the tools i could and everything but there was i didn't get an axe i didn't get a pickaxe and so i went to the mid-skilled without being able to get the rude eye on not able to cut the trees nothing let's go boots all right all right uh pretty standard just insulated that's just from nick too right yeah just from me let's go uh gloves okay okay okay okay um what are leathers from the guild yeah yeah also from the guilds is that from champions guild desert i don't know if desert was on the list on the list correct did you make him or some [ __ ] how did you get him i'll tell you in a minute i think it all got clear very soon okay okay dude that's too much green bro i'm a greedy boy i'm a grady boy i mean i i think the um the the desert also sells green d high chaps so that is why i went with the legs so you were still a little bit between the two let's go body dude my picks were real they're unreal i had such a good like i just had money i had areas it was insane [ __ ] man but i didn't have enough money to buy the rune skirt or legs in the nada shop and so i thought doesn't really matter if he goes magic we got some magic defense here so okay okay okay well i just have a weapon man on go sounds good three two one go oh that's uh that hasn't ever won a pvp challenge but if an updated that [ __ ] spikey ball over there yeah it's now it's now 40. how did you get this together a second oh that's a good one yeah and there's an axe shop dude i spent five minutes planning how to get an axe and i'm like there's a wood putting guild on [ __ ] zaya wow yeah dude and that's i was stressing bro let's just say in zaya i didn't do everything i wanted to do because it's just so [ __ ] big that place yeah should not be that [ __ ] long wow actually that's like i was looking at you before and i was like okay ease win here but that is a weapon and a half like that is a top top tier weapon we've seen that out out do rune crossbows yeah i i i even said that the video i said if he doesn't have a lot of defensive bonuses this is a better uh upgrade than a runecross wow i do have rune arrows because i did buy 49 of them just in case yeah i got um the magic shirt bow so that i made it off range is my lowest defense other than magic obviously out of the lot so it was the combination yeah what is your magic defense it is 15 which i'm quite happy with oh we went slider oh no i didn't why what just the only staff i could get shall we show our inventory oh my god oh no oh no oh no oh no this could be it i would say you get our chaos don't you yeah dude no oh my god okay do you know what i'm happy though i got lucky with the money but it didn't it shows that the money didn't win this challenge this is gonna be close this is gonna dude i'm the only reason you have green d high chaps is because you were too broke with 500k oh okay let's see the uh food off-camera you've just told me that that stuff came from canifis yes i know [ __ ] rufus sells raw sharks oh dude this was poor piscorilius man don't worry about rookie boy oh my god zayn is so op i'm surprised you didn't say oh no he has sharks i've got i fished them in relica because all i did in relico was buy the stuff and then it was just fish the whole time um and then i actually got caribbean desert and did tempros i did 110 pros i got a few swordfish from monica as well but i did 110 pros um and there's you don't get any combat xp it was just straight up skilling um and one of the drops i got from tempross was 11 swordfish which is pretty cool so yeah wow look at that old content but new content all at the same time what's gonna win what's gonna win will my freeze is hit i mean if my freeze is hit i think i'm okay but they they don't always hit guys wow okay all right let's talk to our babies [Music] it is my video so you do get the first hit all right uh i'm gonna give a little spin first for good luck yeah guys this ring chain body gives minus three magic i know a lot of people are gonna be like why didn't link take his rune chain off there's no point there's no point for the minus three magic if i have that off and he hits me with a magic short bow he's gonna cut through me so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it on is the decision before everyone's like why you hit me with whatever you got mate two second warning oh god here we go here we go oh god yeah oh [ __ ] okay okay he's hit he's hit oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] okay all right nope that's fine we we had to find our footing the footing needed the finer footing needed to be found exactly see this is his power play guys i think oh i think he's gonna have us here guys i think he's gonna have us here you are tanky as [ __ ] though i gotta make sure i hit yeah this is gonna be i might have to take off disregarded what i said i might have to take off my armor when i do that oh god i'm just not hitting though come on tank tank tank tank tank test tank test i feel like i'm in the wilby and a clan's found me although you're you're not running for home you're risking your life i want the fight oh my god we're hitting hard i don't i don't have too many freezers so i don't want to just send them but god we might have to you guys uh oh cruelty catches oh what's another oh he's got the blood of course he does course he does oh man actually i don't know why i did that i'm [ __ ] low on arrows already guys not low low but they're all in the [ __ ] ground yeah i bet that's not nice to see oh no he's actually i thought you might even be just out dpsing me here oh come on come on big hits big hits big hits no he can hit a 29. come on oh okay 31. just got it we just got it we just got it oh keep that all agree on keep that augury on oh no [ __ ] lucky i ate get to him oh we hit big when we get to him we hit big when we get to it catch it every time man crazy it's very hard to flick when you're maging and [ __ ] at least for me [ __ ] it guys yeah why aren't i hitting hit come on wow oh my god yes oh my god every time [Laughter] i legit can't afford not to pick him up it's embarrassing bang oh god i'm down put him down put him down put him down we need to hit him so hard catch it catch it catch the freeze come on [ __ ] don't catch it don't catch it i'm low on runes guys i have to be very conservative now on runes this is like for the premise of the video this has become way more strategic than i ever thought it was going to dude my range just doesn't hit yeah it's bad in what the [ __ ] then you hit me come on oh now come on come on oh come on thank you thank you thank you are you joking are you joking thought i'd been recording for a second there bees and geez no i don't know where which way this is going i have no idea mate oh my god oh oh i could have killed you there we could have done it we could have done it i had to go through i need the arrows i'm [ __ ] sorry i was right flicking that i didn't have the chance to hit you i'm wasting all my frozen time eating instead of putting [ __ ] damage on to you gonna risk it oh no go go go go come on and well guys he out is he out of runes that's the question here i do have party on my quick press yeah i do nice still got that off idiot idiot oh 35 spec my range didn't hit yeah my range is not so surprised by that because i'm only like 125 range defense how much food sick sharks oh yeah that wasn't even [ __ ] close wow the last like minute i didn't have any more flicks left because it was very hard to take off my armor put on the prayer and then attack you and then turning off the prayer really quick plus whenever you were just getting those massive hits with me i kept it in because i every time i froze you i would spend my time eating the issue is when i throw a 33 at you you have to eat you can't go for the phrase i made that mistake in a few videos ago with the uh not even the magic that let me down here dude the range just didn't hit the range that's the g's if you enjoyed that there's
