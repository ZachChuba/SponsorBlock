hello everyone and welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is Caitlin and I upload a whole bunch of different types of videos on this channel mainly surrounding true crime and psychological cases as well as a little bit of fashion and lifestyle sprinkled in what I can today I'm back with another case but today is going to seeing what's available on there so for today's case specifically we're actually going to be talking about the death of a young man named Conrad Roy the third and also someone related to Tim who was named Michelle Carter if you aren't aware of the case obviously I will go into a lot of detail continuing on in a bit but the main reason this is in really is fantastic stay so with all that being said we're just going to jump ahead into the actual case and discuss a lot of the information that is also included in the documentary so I can kind of give you guys the whole picture so like I said today's case revolves around to the death of a young man named Conrad Roy the third Conrad Henry Roy the third was born on September the 12th in the of 1995 in a place called Mattapoisett Sand Massachusetts they were said to have been a very very anxious teenager in a number of situations and environments including in different points in his day at school he often worked part time with a lot of the men in his family in the business they owned in the field of salvaging marine and shipwrecks and cargo and all things like that that may have been lost at sea after any collisions or vessels that encountered any form of trouble while on their travels outside of school he played a number of different sports including rowing baseball and he was also a runner and had been an active member in the athletic community within the school at the start of 2014 Conrad began his training to earn his captain's license at the Northeast maritime Institute and then after three long months of taking night classes outside of all of his other obligations he managed to finally gain his captain's license as well as this a few months later he also managed to successfully graduate from high school as an honor roll student and there just seems to be no doubt at all or whatsoever that he was an extremely talented intelligent and driven individual he had actually received his acceptance letters to something called the Fitchburg State University on a business degree course but despite having such a successful experience in his previous academic endeavors he had altima decided that University was just not for him going back a couple of years in 2012 Conrad had actually traveled to Florida to stay just for a short while with a couple of family members of his and it was here that he happened to meet a young girl named Michelle Carter who's also in Florida visiting relatives Michelle Carter was born on August the 11th in 1996 in a place called Plainville in Massachusetts which was just over an hour away from the neighborhood that Conrad had grown up in when she was young she had struggled herself with an both mental illnesses just as Conrad had as she developed an eating order a very very young age and was believed to have harmed herself someone relatively early on and after the pair had initially met they began to sort of grow their relationship completely to an extensive amount through texting emailing and speaking to each other on the phone Michelle was noted as being a good student herself as well as having a particularly charming nature in October 2012 the same year that the pair had met Conrad had attempted to end his life this wasn't the first time I believe in total he had attempted suicide four times it is believed that he intended on doing so for a number of reasons but one of them being kind of the extreme deterioration in his mental health following learning of his parents divorce now at this point when Michelle had learned of his plans to try and end his life she had actively tried to convince him to seek help but it wasn't the answer and she really really tried to kind of get him out of this dark mental place and their relationship continued on for another two years past this and then in the early months of 2014 it had appeared that Roy's mental state had deteriorated once again Michelle had allegedly started to try and convince him to seek professional help following his previous suicide attempt that she had known of as well as his fluctuating mental state over the past few years and then in around May time of 2014 he had started sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy after seeking the help of a number of different therapists counselors and specialists at the time and then on July the 13th in the year of 2014 Conrad's family had been concerned for his safety when he hadn't arrived home the night before and sadly on this day the discovery of his remains were found inside his car parked on the property of a local Kmart store he had ended his life through locking himself inside his car filling it with gas meaning that his official cause of death was actually listed as carbon monoxide poisoning he had ended his life by locking himself in his car and filling it up with gas meaning that his official cause of death was listed as carbon monoxide poisoning the initial team of investigators had found inside his car with him at the time his phone but it was to be completely out of battery but it was later on in the investigation when they decided to search through his phone that they found thousands of messages to one person in particular and this was Michelle Casa and this had at this point kind of been that only hope for any sort of Avenue of Investigation to be searched in order to understand what had happened as they'd gone through the most recent messages of this huge huge chain of conversation really they had come across an open conversation Michelle Carter and a number of the messages had seemed quite concerning in the documentary from a very early point you begin to kind of see the process in which the prosecution begin to approach the trial in which they stated that the Michelle's messages to Conrad had aided and encouraged his death there were thousands of messages with a significant portion of them being related to his unhealthy mental state and the discussion of suicide some even discussing the methods in which he could possibly end his own life in reality the messages were very very completely varying in nature really when you look back through kind of the entire conversation they had some of them were complete declarations of love and affection towards each other while others seemed to kind of seem like she was trying to encourage this act further the pair were very close to the point where they called each other boyfriend and girlfriend although Conrad's mother hadn't necessarily been aware of who she was and the extent of their relationship but she does say in the documentary there's like an interview with her where she says that she was aware that he was constantly messaging some girl as I said previously that's an early point in the relationship Michelle had been very supportive of him and she had encouraged him to not feel down and to seek help and just to try and help improve his mental state and this attempt had not been very successful initially as she was found to have searched up online a number of different methods in which he could have caretake in his own life and he's actually at one point sent her images of all of these different types of suicide methods he made references to the pair being like Romeo and Juliet following which she told him that she didn't want the pair to end up that way so from an early point in their relationship it seemed as though Michelle was healthy for him she was trying to help him as much as she could but the nature of these conversations soon change when her messages followed more along the lines of why haven't you killed yourself yet as well as how he could go about doing it you can find loads of these specific texts online obviously I'm not going to read through them all but there are so many online you can see a whole chain of the messages and the conversations that they had as well as in the documentary as well so I have here just a snippet of one conversation from one day and that the pair kind of shared over text I'll read out to you now just over a week before Conrad's death they had the following conversation over text message so Conrad said hi and the Michelle replied hi Conrad said what's up and Michelle said just woke up you why do you seem so happy haha Conrad said because tonight's the night Michelle said you said that last night and the night before Conrad replied with haha I know but it has to be tonight I will be all alone he then continued mum and Bryan are sleeping over at friends house in Rhode Island and she replied with so yeah tonight seems like the perfect night and she then continued like you have all night to try different things and he said yes Lowell Michelle said do you think tonight really is the night you're gonna do it and he said I think Michelle said there's a difference between saying I'm gonna try to commit a suicide and I am going to commit suicide and Conrad said well I'm going to try the Michelle then said so you don't want it bad enough you already know you're gonna fail because a part of you wants to fail she continues just saying he just says yeah she says yeah what and Conrad said it's just hard Michelle and she said I know it is in other conversations she would say things that seemed as though she was trying to make him feel Miss guilty for not going through they're almost coming across pushy and kind of oddly enthusiastic about it and then on the day of his actual death Michelle had texted him just hours before his death she had asked him if she had deleted all of the messages that had been shared between the pair of them from his phone as if he was successful in taking his life she didn't want anyone finding the messages they share as Conrad had sat in his car as it filled with gas he suddenly decided that couldn't go through with it then he jumped out of the car he immediately rang Michelle and this is known as it shown through the phone record that they had a conversation at some point during this time and the exact conversation that the pair had had at this point isn't known obviously because it was a phone call but it is suggested it stated as you'll see stated by the prosecution in the documentary that Michelle had said something to him that had encouraged him to get back inside the truck that was filled with poisonous fumes you were also then told that just shortly after Conrad's death Michelle had actually texted her friend Sam saying that Conrad's death was her fault after the news of Conrad's death had spread Michelle had immediately taken it upon herself to play this part of the grieving girlfriend she's even referred to in the documentary as being a young black widow as this was how she was seen she had started as texts all of the girls that she had known at school who hadn't previously been that close with her about her boyfriend's death and how heartbroken she was about it and obviously as you'd imagine and expect they all suddenly began to share so much sympathy and attention all these people to reply to her facebook messages about her her recently deceased boyfriend and she suddenly get all this attention Michelle hadn't been the most popular person in school at all she really had didn't have a lot of close friends and after Conrad's death she was suddenly able to get all this tension and all this sympathy from a lot of people that she hadn't been given previously she had also been messaging Conrad's mum and sister even though she hadn't actually known them to are tall nor had she even really met them in person and she'd even gone as far as to ask his mum if she could have part of his ashes to keep for herself which at the time probably did seem quite strange in the documentary it is virtually made clear that the prosecution side is arguing that Michelle had intentionally convinced him to go through with his suicide attempt in a forceful manner however as you watch on you learn that the defense began to kind of paint an entire different picture to the story and this picture kind of suggests that she wasn't actually in the right frame of mind to be able to determine what was right and what was wrong the basis of this argument stood on the fact that since she was young she had been put on ice a form of medication antidepressant medication although the expert they'd introduced in the trial said that she should never have been put on this medication at such a young age due to the extreme side effects that can happen when you're so young during her relationship with Conrad her medication was then switched and this is why the defense argued that she had such a sudden change in perspective towards his mental state and towards his suicide attempt so obviously at the start she tried of actively encouraging not to take his own life and then suddenly she switched and she seemed like she was being quite forceful and this is why the defendants kind of suggested this occurred the expert they called upon had argued that she had been in a state of involuntary intoxication due to the combination of her medication and it being changing and it was just an incorrect one for her and this meant that she was in fact cohesive and she was completely making sense but her innocence of what was right and what was wrong and what was a cycle and moral was completely skewed and this was the main argument that they made which introduced the thought process that what she had done wasn't moral or ethical but in a legal sense she may not have possibly been able to be held accountable I found myself throughout the entire documentary being extremely extremely conflicted kind of at every stage because it's been carried out so well but it obviously clearly shows two completely vastly different perspectives of the story Michels behavior around the time of Conrad's death regarding her messages to her friends and seemingly using Conrad's death as like a source of tension is very clearly supported but one thing that struck me majorly towards the end of the case was the sheer fact that there is not any physical evidence for existence of evidence for certain parts of the prosecution's argument including the fact that she'd allegedly told him to get back in the car the conversation while Conrad had gotten out the car during his suicide attempt and I've gotten cold feet had occurred over the phone and so there is no physical evidence of exactly what she had said to him there was also no evidence that she actually confessed to her friend Sam that she had told him to get back in the car and it was this fact that changed my opinion entirely so ultimately Michelle was found to be guilty of involuntary manslaughter and was given a two-and-a-half year prison sentence with only 15 months of this being mandatory but this case remains a huge huge discussion point to this day as it's at a precedent for future cases like it it continues to divide people extremely as to whether what she did to be seen as legally wrong legally criminal I think that there is no doubt that what she did was immoral and I think anyone really disagrees with that but as to whether it's criminal I don't know I think this is the whole discussion this is the whole difficult thing about this case one thing that is explored in the documentary that is definitely worth considering is that Michelle Carter seem to have this really romantic view on life on her relationship everything really but in particular her relationship with Conrad so she kind of had it she had it in her head that it was this huge romantic like dramatic movie type teenage love and she even had a known obsession with the show Glee and she had a tendency to quote things that Liam Michele's character would say to coy Monteith's character and there was this whole thing where it just seems to be that she had this sort of huge for a man to size view of their relationship but it may not have been reciprocated and honestly I don't even think I can do it justice without sitting here and reading through all of the text messages that were shared between the pair because it is so complex and it's so deep the way that both of them seem to have their ups and downs and their phases of being negative and almost bad for each other I don't know I really do highly recommend watching this documentary honestly one of the best well-done documentaries that I've watched in a long time and obviously I wouldn't tell you guys that if it weren't the case I would be very very interested in hearing your guys's opinions on this case it was obviously a hugely publicized case I'm sure a lot of you do already know a lot about this case it was literally everywhere like I said it was the first of its kind it set precedent for so many future cases and a lot of people have a lot of strong opinions on this case I would be very very interested on seeing your guys's discussions in the comments to love because it's just like this YouTube channel but on TV so that is everything I have to talk about today please please have discussions down below this is one of the most fascinating cases that I've seen in a long time I'm so interested in hearing your guys's opinions because it seems to be that everyone has such extreme different opinions on this case and let me know your thoughts down below thank you guys so much for watching I hope you found this interesting and I will see you guys very soon for another video thanks for watching bye
