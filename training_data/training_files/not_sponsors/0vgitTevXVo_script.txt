hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today I bring you loot from 1,000 barrels and these are the barrels that you can find in the vy y LD caves apologies if i'm mispronouncing that and these barrels can be found during or after the legends quest and if you smash these barrels inside of them will reveal either a random item a random monster or both released into the game august 20th 2003 this is all about the legends quest which was released on the same day obviously and it was the fiftieth quest by order of release date so this is really old and as it goes for the required items in order to get to this location and do this activity or whatever you want to call it you are going to be needing a pickaxe a lockpick and unpowered orb and also all the runes that you're going to be using for the spell charge earth orb as you can see in my inventory at the very bottom right i pretty much add all those items there and of course the Kurama gloves for faster teleporting since shiloh village bank is the closest bank to this location and also one of the closest teleports and there they are the barrels that this video is all about and they seem so close yet they are so far away anyone familiar with the legends quest or anyone who has done I believe the master cool scroll step that's in this location definitely knows all about the journey the very long journey that it takes to get here whether you're having to use a lockpick on a door or smash a lot of boulders or of course open up the gate and run through all the bats and then jump through all the shortcuts in the walls and you can imagine that all the running that we had to do in order to get back and forth here was gonna make the banking for this video very annoying and I will say that's probably the most annoying part of this video is just the run to get to this location and once you get to this location you simply use that earth spell on the door every single time make sure not to forget your orb and you will be granted access you'll basically be flown right in now the idea for this video came to me via email late yesterday morning and I thought that it was such a great idea that I was going to pause my video that I'm working right now loot from 100 jad and i was going to do this video right away so that's pretty much what started this and if you guys ever have any suggestions for videos check out the description make sure to send me a message on snapchat or just send me an email and I will always take it into consideration so just putting that out there so as you can see on screen the fun has begun and we are starting to smash 1000 barrels and pick up whatever they may have inside to them except one item that I pretty much avoided the whole entire video I think I only picked up two of them and that would be the basic rock I'm not too sure what this rock is you know used for this game it's literally just called a rock it's not a stone it's just a rock and yeah I would never pick those up and I would say that maybe thirty to forty percent of the time you would just get a rock and nothing else and that kind of ruined all the other drops that we could potentially get but that kind of benefited me at the same time because that would just mean less banking so I would just say ignore the rocks they're really not good for anything unless you're Dwayne the rock so lame joke but anyway yeah other than the rocks you can get a lot of different items and on top of that a lot of different monsters can potentially spawn I mean just look at all the monsters in that one area and this is multi - so like I don't know maybe this could potentially be the next best afk training location the 2003 edition of Nightmare Zone and in our very first inventory we did actually do 44 barrels and if you're curious how I was able to keep track of every single one of them basically I was just counting out loud or just counting in my head at first I thought it would be easier to kind of just use my keyboard and every single barrel I would smash and open I would just type 1 2 3 etc but that got really annoying and it was honestly just such a fast-paced thing that counting was much easier so every single inventory that I would teleport out the number that was last said either in my head or out loud because I'm a weirdo when I talk to myself well that number would be written on a notepad document which you guys will see very soon and basically I would just put inventory one this many barrels inventory to this many barrels so I would just do that until I reached 1,000 a very memorable of the wise old man task video you know it's kind of what I did for that as well because you know you can't keep track of everything even with rune light rune light doesn't even keep track of these barrels how to make that an update or something now it is important also note that the monsters in here are not the only things that can damage you you should see throughout this video a few occasions of me trying to open a barrel and getting damaged usually with a splintering piece of wood as something explodes and you will get hit for I think anywhere from 8 to 15 damage off of that so that's usually how I would lose most of my health there would be also things like dark wizards that can spawn and use magic attacks against you but I think everything else for the most part just uses melee so you can bring food here if you're a lower level I never personally needed it but I would always bring a super restorer just in case I would use like the redemption prayer or something to help me out in which I did I think maybe three times so for the most part these are such low level monsters and the actual complete list of everything that can possibly spawn here the monsters are Black Knight chaos dwarf dark warrior dark wizard deadly red spider death wing which is a bigger version of a normal bat giant bat giant rat giant spider hill giant Hobgoblin Moss giant mugger scorpion skeleton and zombie so I think out of all those monsters the highest level one would definitely be the Moss giant in the hill giant I didn't really try to kill any of them for this video although maybe if you guys enjoy this I could do 10,000 barrels next time and also kill every single monster that spawns but I think the only thing that would really be beneficial off of that would be the mosh giant and he'll giant loot from the other monsters I think the best thing you could get maybe would be a skeleton or zombie champion scroll so other than the barrels you know the monsters really aren't that popular and next we move on to the very long list of all the possible items that you can get because my goodness look at that Bank tab I mean there's just so much of everything I wouldn't say the problem is the quality I would definitely say the problem is the quantity there's just not a whole lot that you can get amount wise of all these you know somewhat useful and somewhat useless items but a lot of these are actually pretty cool items and although there's way too many items to go over every single one individually I will say the rarest or at least the most expensive item that you can get from these barrels would be a prayer potion sip one and that is valued at 3k exactly there's also occasions where you can get a lot of different fish including raw shark and cooked shark and those are noted as well as all the other fish that you can get and I think the most expensive item out of all those fish would be the wrong sharks which is it gonna be just about 2.5 K of course you will have your selection of runes darts pickaxes knives a lot of materials ores logs and bars and of course some random items for example bowstrings caskets tinderbox torches and there are two untradable items that you can get from these barrels one of them being snake weed which was actually released into the game a year before this October 23rd 2002 and that item is used in jungle potion and also Legends quest and the other untradable item that you can receive from these barrels would be a para Mya ticket which is basically a ticket that allows a player to spend the night in the dormitory of the para Maya n and if you're really confused right now it's because its main use was in runescape classic any Classic players know what I'm talking about because I sure have no idea this is when players had to sleep in a bed to reduce their fatigue so they could train their stats those without a sleeping bag would have to buy a para Maya ticket to use the bed in Shiloh village so yeah quite the story behind that I'm definitely never gonna get rid of those I never knew that coming into this video and according to the wiki this ticket was actually made untradable on January 22nd 2007 because of the players who were using it to scam other players I guess in the trade screen somehow now getting back to the barrels it is important to note that just about one year after these barrels were released into the game with the legends quest there was a new barrel released into the game just around September 20th of 2004 and this would be used alongside the regicide quest as well as mourning sins part 1 you can also find a barrel in the tourist trap quest and overall it really just seems to be a quest item I think these are the only barrels in the game that although they are involved with a quest as well you can actually get something from them even afterwards and according to the wiki as of today still there's currently a glitch that will cause a player's cannon to disappear if a barrel responds on top of it that's actually kind of a silly thing because the barrels can respond anywhere in the room so you'd have to place your cannon and be very patient but yeah that can happen as well and here we are ladies and gentlemen loot from 1000 barrels has been completed and oh what a strange video it was but overall this video only took just about four hours to complete so if you enjoyed it and you want me to do a bigger number of barrels just let me know maybe I can switch it up for next video this is kind of just like that 1000 unclean fine video and what I mean by that is the loot is definitely going to be underwhelming but I think the variety and the story behind it makes the video worth uploading overall so yeah anyway let's go ahead and do this price check price check number one this is all of the fish all the pies the pineapple the cheese and all the coins from 1,000 barrels you get just about eight hundred and fifty-four cheapy a couple potions as well in the overall price check for that is fifty point five K and now we move on to the second price check these are the expensive items the prayer sips overall we got 19 of those 23 rune knives small amount of darts and we did get some uncharged orbs back but overall the price check from that is a hundred and 5.7 K and those prayer potions did account for almost half of that so those definitely added up over time and I had one item remaining I couldn't fit it in there and it was just the iron bars and we did get an extra 1000 GP from that as it pertains to the untradable items we did get 22 para Maya tickets as well as 11 snake weed I did also include the 12 ship tickets in there but those are actually tradable I mean they're not worth anything but you can't trade them so yeah guys that is just about it we did receive 14 caskets and I did decide to open all of them just because they're only 600 GP so what's the worst that can happen you know but overall fifty point five plus one hundred and five point seven plus an extra one brings the overall amount from 1,000 barrels to 157 point 2k and had we not included the barrels that have nothing in them or just rocks then obviously we would have a lot more to show for this but then it wouldn't be 1,000 and there would be no way to track that so yeah not exactly the best money making method in the game but in 2003 this might have been good this may have been something that you know someone did at some point I'm really not too sure I wasn't there and I wasn't playing around those days but I'm sure those days were golden you know 2003 I think that was a year when the world was a lot less complicated than it is now but anyways guys I hope you enjoyed the video thank you so much for watching I hope you learned something new if you guys have any questions just make sure to leave it in the comments section below and until next time mister sleep out
