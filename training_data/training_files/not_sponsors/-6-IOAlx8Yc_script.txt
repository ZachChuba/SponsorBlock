recently jagex has added a new game mode to old-school runescape called trailblazers the basic idea of trailblazers is that you start off in one region and you perform a wide variety of tasks to earn points and then once you earn enough points you have the ability to unlock relics as well as unlock different regions so you can explore and expand the idea of this league was briefly touched upon in a news post back in may with them mentioning gridlocked by name back in april of 2019 i started the gridlock series where i locked myself in a certain region until i achieved a goal within that region and then i was able to move on to the next region so basically what i'm trying to say here is that i made this okay let's get started so just as a very quick summary of what relics are they are essentially a very powerful buff that is applied to your account i'm going to choose the endless harvest one which makes my resources gather from fishing wood cutting and mining all be multiplied by two as well as the experience gets multiplied by two and all of these supplies that i get from this are banked automatically if you want to know more about all the relics i'm going to link the otrs wiki in the description anyway i'm an idiot because i chose the wrong relic i probably should have went for the skilling prodigy which boosts all of my non-combat stats by 12 permanently and that would have helped so much in early and late games so yeah i'm dumb gotta get a million agility xp please great is that is that song guy right there what the hell okay that's 30 agility blap guys that's 50 points earned let's grab that 10k please tell me no one bought a little staff of fire guy now i want to get a knife and a spade while i'm up here give me so i'm going to buy three minor in packs and six errant packs that should give me enough rooms for a little bit nice thing about this league is that the fairy rings are all unlocked so you can just use this right away so we pretty much have all of these teleports around the map like right off the bat come here attack that guy and these guys have a bunch of decent drops i can get right away the main one i'm gonna go for is the runex and some nature runes and look at that second kill adam and x nice i gotta ruin axe baby let's go that's a freaking nice alk dude let me see what the low elk is for this yep i'm gonna do it dude that's so nice this is so good for money all right well i got five acts guys let me go buy some more runes do a little agility and come back here because i think as of right now this is probably my best money making method to do fine fine i'll complete literally every task in the entire game you don't have to keep begging me please guess what agility level i just got three no apparently this is a task right here yes it is that's 40 thieving so i might as well do cook's assistant too while i'm here all right we gotta pickpocket this guy twice one i actually might only i've only needed to do it once all right so now i can get my next upgrade or my next relic out of all of them eternal jeweler makes the most sense because the other one just teleports you to the last location you're at and then the other one you can teleport to any fairy ring but we're doing this let's do it baby yeah dude that's awesome man there's so many more teleports now oh it's trailblazer i'll trail bazer thank you for making this for us man that's so kind of you trailblazer oh my gosh so the rewards you get from quests are actually multiplied too wow all right 25 slayer 2500 from that that's really nice so i'm going to be working on a few tasks right now because i have 25 tasks left until i'm able to unlock my next area so originally i was going to be going into the wilderness but once i saw the relics and i saw what areas i could unlock and what content i could do i came up with a much more fun idea ultimately my end goal is going to be doing theater of blood and potentially the inferno i have to see the optics on that one i don't know them yet but the path for me to get there is going to be a good one so i'm choosing this route oh my god you know how it's a 1 in 42 chance of getting a freaking chef's hat jim i got it on my first drop so i'm just going to do as many easy tasks as i can oh that was 50 points wow oh my god oh my god yeah four thousand yep so i got oh my god we got 40 attack from that don't you guys something to show me mandy that's right you have a quest complete screen and nothing else give me that thing that's 50 big boys right there i got 19 construction from all of that i didn't realize this is really nice and that's one task come here oh my god i paid him again come on league task baby there you go break a farming patch four more all right i think this gives me a few things i get an assignment i get a spiny helmet that's another one and then i buy a gym and that is four tasks so i can now unlock the next freaking area kanderin unlock confirm here we go here's the sick animation with this guy ruining the shot perfect yeah i'm not fighting you dumbass i'll see you later oh my god i'm i'm spawning many they didn't fix this they didn't fix this look look at this they didn't fix it i thought you guys would have fixed this by now i reported this book like a year ago what are you doing come on guys there you go get on out there this is actually kind of unfair man the quest guy said i only have to fight one of them but let's look at the xp drop dude it should be fatty [Laughter] that's so good and that should be waterfall quest done and we got 58 attack and 50 strength again everything is times by eight right now under the multiplier that i'm at plus i have a nice high up with the myth c second high outcome for 120 each once i get 55 magic look at these pathetic losers look at 416. look at these pathetic losers this guy this guy this guy is cool but look at our general direction man 57 000 fishing i love that that's really good don't know why i didn't record it but i got the already easy achievement diaries done so i got the cloak and a 16k xp lamp and there we go 15.3 k cash deck so this is the process so i have my four oak planks i teleport to my house in karamja with the free obelisk since i did daddy's home the subquest or the mini whatever i have a free house on here built a workshop build one upgrade build two and now we make our clock works crafted my birdhouses and now we set up our birdhouses and pretty much every 15 minutes we get at least 18k hunter experience so it's gonna go up very quickly all right so thanks to the help of settled we are about to get a lot of tasks done so i think the only thing i really need algorithm's saying to me right now rune axe yes let's freaking go dude that's also a task if i just equip it let's go man that is a nice milestone 55 magic now i have high alk get points from that do a little bit more smelting because i have to get myself 30 smithing give me from 25 to 29 from 29 to 32 from 32 to 34 and from 34 to 36. these are really good i only got one seed that's a maple seed that's actually pretty good that's actually a pretty good seed so i could be doing these every 15 minutes and i can get my hunter up that quickly good luck dummy 50 points for a willow short bow so temporary money making method that i'm going to do is make maple longbows and then high elk them i'm going to use 30 nature runes and that should get me at least 10k all right now i'm gonna get my 10k 39 41. this should be a task two yep 200 points on my next relic and that's 10 points let me in turn that's another 50 points right there that's not like 10 points right there no no no no that's got to be a safe spot unless this guy gets me oh my god you have to be kidding me you have to be kidding me bro no visit that's the main that's a that's a task i'll take it that's big brother bobby's uh friends that's 42 hunter and that's 45 hunter and that should be a medium task for 50 points done right there and that's a walker canoe which is 50 points 50 more and i have a new relic that's 10 points right there 10. come here dummy that's right get right in there man and that's 50 points and that is a new relic unlocked and we go for fluid strikes which is going to be the attack speed of all melee weapons is halved rounded up as in it's two tick there's 25 accuracy 15 less damage overall and i gained four hp instead of one every minute that is incredible confirm that fluid strikes come here charlie how many 2 000 experience 20 000 experience 48 hunter i can also do a little hunter run now and that's 50 hunter hey reach level 50 combat make a elemental mine help thank god 50 points and what is that 46 smithing and 47 crafting there we go first 70 combat 100 points earned from that 51 hunter from this birdhouse run dismantle 20 field birdhouse runs 50 points that's cool and there we go that is the easy karamja diaries done now can go and get myself free herblore xp and that's from 4 to 25 herblore now i just got to get myself 30 so i can then use this lamp on it but for now though i'm going to catch a few lobsters just so i can have better food yeah i got a renarchy guy okay so that should be a task right there 50 points and now i need to also pickpocket him like 50 times i think that night this might get me my 30 herblore 28 ah so close oh okay i just missed it but there it is pickpocket a night 50 times i'll probably only get 5300 this round smell the steel bar 50 million guys and 19 farming to 25. all right we got a decent bit of money but more importantly we got ourselves 117 total nature runs again 58 hunter 48 crafting a very good reason that i went the hunter route aside from just money is because it will help me get my range level up very quickly since i have monkey madness 2 auto completed in this region and i'll be able to go and hunt myself a lot of chins and chinning is going to be ridiculous xp because i can chin the monkey madness 2 caves and it's it's going to be no time once i actually get 65 range to go right to 99. here we go yes that should be my 30 herb lore perfect and now i can use this on herblore beautiful i've been waiting for that man i have just been waiting to get rid of that freaking genie lamp from my inventory and that's the last one 65 hunter we can now catch magpie implings you have some spare canoes so i should get seven right off the bat toggle implying view what is this here's our first one here's our first one come on yes there we go first one three power amulets already in the freaking money that and that's my freaking amulet slot sorted oh so if i give him one unknotted implant i get three jars that's perfect give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me oh no oh no yes uh no yes get stuffed buddy there we go new best in slot gloves 50 points so many people are going for magpies right now i actually might need to get my hunter level higher but i need cash because i need to start training everything else so you know what i think that i'm going to fall back on my backup money making method which i'm glad that i did yes yes yes last one for now oh yes yes no okay you know what that made me enthusiastic i'll go for one more yes yes yes yes yes get screwed over that power enemies you know what for now i want the money 28k so while i edit this video i am going to be working on my backup money making method and next video i am going to have a power spike in gp and all of my stats i've got big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big plans
