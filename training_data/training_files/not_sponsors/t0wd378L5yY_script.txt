the following video was commissioned as an advert for prosperous universe but that's a pretty cool game and i think this is a pretty cool video so you should stick around check the description for more info on the game and i hope you enjoy the video hey everybody i'm daniel from space doc have you ever considered what it takes to build a spaceship i mean sure we all know that the yt-1300 series is made by corellian engineering corporation or that the enterprise d was built at utopia planisha fleet yards but those are just the manufacturers what actually goes into building a ship who makes the engines where do the materials for the hulls come from who's responsible for supplying all of those self-sealing stem bolts to patch the thing together if you've never run a business or worked on producing a product on a large scale it's hard to grasp just how much any given project relies on third-party services and retailers to get off the ground and that's something that very much holds true for engineering projects as an example some of you might have at some point heard or read somewhere that even if nasa wanted to they don't know how to build another saturn 5 that it's become a sort of lost knowledge that's incorrect but there is a kernel of truth to it nasa still has the plans for the saturn 5 and knows exactly how everything in it works and why a lot of the plans and design documentation are available online for free on their archive websites but even with all that nasa still wouldn't be able to build another apollo mission from scratch for a simple reason a lot of the components used in the saturn 5 or csm or lem aren't manufactured anymore as an example the saturn instrument unit which controlled the rocket during ascent had as one of its components the launch vehicle digital computer which used a random access magnetic core as its main memory this kind of storage device fell out of use by the late 70s even if ibm decided to go ahead and build a new instrument unit to fulfill a nasa contract they'd have a hard time sourcing this one model of memory core that's been discontinued for the past 40 years and that would hold true for almost every other system and subsystem of the saturn v it's entirely possible that a kind of screw used in the rocket structure might not be manufactured anymore if one were to be built today they'd either have to somehow find all these components or change the plans to use modern equivalents but at that point it simply becomes better to design a new rocket from scratch this is the reality of every single manufactured good they don't exist in a vacuum but in a vast ecosystem of goods and items built and supplied by different companies and retailers building upon one another until they reach the bottom of this interlocking net at the raw resources used to make them now if this kind of logistical thinking interests you it might be worth your while to check out prosperous universe the generous sponsors of this video it's a browser-based space economy mmo developed by simulogix so in prosperous universe you assume control of a company on one of the many planets settled by humanity after its diaspora from earth operating in this newly opened frontier it's up to you and fellow players to build the infrastructure basis upon which humanity's expansion into new worlds will be built when you join the game and register your company you can select any of the currently settled planets for your starting base and one of the base job packages that provide you with all you need to fulfill a needed economic niche the game is played using the in-browser apex interface which combines a streamlined visual style with the flexibility of line commands that allow you to customize and tailor it to your exact needs for running your company as you see fit with the ability to save multiple layouts so you can quickly swap between a general view to say a market view or a finances one one of the game's highlights is how it takes a very sober stance on the realities of living in space and space exploration as a whole leaning more into hard science fiction than other similar games any given planet's temperature atmospheric pressure and gravity influence the amount and kind of construction components needed to build bases and structures there for instance bases on high temperature rocky worlds would require thermal shielding and mineral construction granulate whereas a base built on a frigid gas giant would need instafoam and aerostat foundations to be held aloft with natural buoyancy on the planet's upper atmosphere not only that but all items track not only their mass but their volume having different densities which directly impact how they can be shipped orbital mechanics also plays a key factor in the time of flight and fuel consumption of ships during interplanetary transfers as the planets revolve around their stars in accordance to their orbital paths of course some liberties are taken in the name of gameplay such as ftl drives and the highly efficient sublight engines used by ships but the entire game is full of details and choices informed by reality making it a fairly solid near to mid-future setting in many ways prosperous universe follows in the same vein as the x-series or eve online but somewhat closer to more tycoon style games such as the anno series or tropico like in eve online the game's massively multiplayer nature makes it so its market behaves in a highly dynamic and realistic manner our supply and demand are entirely created or met by the needs and products of player actions but prosperous universe issues the other snazier aspects of eve or x such as space combat and focuses entirely on base building production and business management this also set it aside from the other competing browser or mobile games as you don't need to be constantly worried about losing all your progress to another player's sneak attack while you were sleeping or otherwise busy carrying on with your daily life prosperous universe allows you to play exactly as much as you want at the pace that you want if you're a small peaceful wittler on promotor growing your crops and manufacturing basic ration packs you can easily manage your company logging in for less than five minutes a day or if you're a metallurgical baron on moira and vallis supplying all of the aluminium in the system you could very well have 50 spreadsheets and spend many hours micromanaging your shipments and contracts and updating buy and sell orders on foreign exchanges to maximize your profit margins the game gives you all the freedom to play exactly as you want as much as you want and it doesn't punish you for doing so i'll fully concede that prosperous universe is not exactly a game for everyone even simulogix themselves are willing to admit that with their honest prosperous universe trailer which is very good you should check it out but if this sort of logistic systematic thinking interests you or if you have a fascination for economy but have been thus far put off by say eve online's addiction factor or x's price of entry do give prosperous universe a try the game is free to play so you can create yourself a trial account which lets you test out all of the features of the game and see what you think before committing to it if you do like it you can keep playing for as long as you want with that trial account or if you're truly invested in it consider upgrading to a pro account which opens up a few more advanced features and perks that allow you to take your business to new heights the game is constantly receiving new free updates such as the recent ignition update that lets players design and build their own spaceships which is certainly one for the space dock audience and there's a lot more coming on a planned road map once again thank you to simulogix for kindly sponsoring this video thank you all for listening please do check out prosperous universe this is daniel from space talk signing off you
