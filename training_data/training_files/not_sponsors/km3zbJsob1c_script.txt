hey they're loyal viewers as you can tell there is a reservoir of TV movie trope that you can draw on for your game that's that briefcase went one movie the pulp with the pulp magazines right pulp was called remember from the other intro we were doing that that's the one right yeah that's a smart eye there Magnum I'm Cooper from you know top hopper from Hawkins there's strange things the one I'm John wick okay it's TV movie tropes on web DM this episode is brought to you by the link in the description and comments all right Jim TV tropes and how to use them like when when did this start or is this just like human nature thing of just of paying homage to things that came before I mean this is like nothing new right no it's not really anything new you know from the earliest days of the Hobby there were people standing up all their favorite literary characters there you know their favorite figures from mythology there's that famous article from Gygax in an early dragon magazine we're sort of like tracks Conan's stats and levels and we see for the first time that it's possible to lose levels and stats as like you get older and sure right it's not like or you know it's not like a ratchet effect where you these levels are permanent they that you can lose them the experience necessary for them you know will atrophy and so that kind of like taking figures from medium whether it's a literature or TV or movies or whatever and being inspired by them letting them guide your character creation process or taking elements from them and using them in your own games is like like if you deny yourself that because you're like oh I can't it's not original or because we're gonna find out or whatever then like you're robbing yourself of a whole source of inspiration and like how you have learned about this a storytelling techniques what makes for an engaging narrative beat like what makes for fun villainous schemes and then personalities for antagonists like if you don't draw on that then you're not using the store of knowledge you've built up here yes it's like studying for a test and then saying I'm not gonna use any of that for this test right yeah so it's I see it though but because people are served like they want to feel like that they're being original that their ideas are creative and inspired and they're not just ripping off something or copying it especially like in front of their friends who they might be worried about you know would you know disapprove or make fun of them or or just you know think that it was lame or something and I mean that's a lot of pressure put on yourself you know I don't know when you when you distill your experiences and your your input yeah and and and kind of mix it up though I mean that's that's the original type your rhymes you're not like wholesale just like I'm gonna take this whole thing yeah yeah and just change the names and change the locations but it's the exact same set up it's the exact same scenario well yeah you're gonna get called you know the point of it is and hang up how you have fun with these things is to take those or take those original ideas be inspired by them right like you know you say oh my god this this character from this movie or this character I just they're compelling there's something about them something away the actor portrays them or something about the you know the costume design or something that that's inspiring but the point of the arc you know of RPGs and how you make something like not just a ripoff but your own is to like give it your own spin and the fact that you're playing in a different setting a different world a different you know environment maybe you're taking a you know a modern-day character and translating them to you know fantasy medieval world or a sci-fi world or something you've already begun that process of changing them of taking this narrow development and making it your own just go a couple of steps further and add in other things and you can kind of avoid the awkwardness of like oh yeah I have been inspired by this thing you know like yeah I just saw this movie and it's like really cool and I want to do it well that happened to me accidentally like in Starbound with Halley X fear and de cools whole like family thing yeah I originally the the set up that I had and ready to go I thought was awesome until I saw the movie Aquaman and then I was like this is literally it's not beat for beat that's four out of five beats sure you know and I'm like well now I got it now I gotta change this changed a few things and I started thinking about Hamlet wow this is son coming home things are a missed something something smells in the state of Denmark or whatever yeah and so I added that wrinkle to it but then changed a few of the beats inside of it and so then it became a thing where I was combining kind of Aquaman and Hamlet and whatever and it it became its own thing but I purposefully left some of the names very similar to Hamlet just to with the players in the way that Marvel screws with everyone and there are citations yeah sometimes that's fun to do if you know your players know something have the appearance of something else just to kind of mess with their expectations yes now that can be kind of dangerous it can be but I'm annoyed some players but it's a fun way to do a little bit of a head-fake yeah yeah player knowledge versus PC knowledge certainly especially stuff that you know that they can't they're not gonna like be able to separate out you know and you just know like either it's a you know something that they're you know well you know well studied in or something or just something really into yeah like yeah they're really probably not gonna be able to like separate themselves from this but you can use that to subvert their expectations make sure you keep them on their toes I'll tell a personal story of mine where I where I was sort of inspired by another piece of media and and it didn't necessarily work out although the campaign end up working out players had requested a lowdown you know just like gritty low fantasy style yeah campaign and y'all it all wanted to roll like 3d six in a row third edition yeah we wanted old school but third for 30 days right yeah and so we're like yeah okay we're gonna make use of those craft and profession skills and you guys are villagers and craftsmen in this farm and and dealt with sort of like local problems in turn around the the community and I forget what level it was probably before fifth level or so your third or fourth level one of the players at the table goes this is quest for glory the Sierra games adventure games if I remember correctly we were interrogating a guard the Baron as his daughter had been kidnapped yeah it was a Minotaur guarding her and there was like just a lot of little markers and for me it was like I I the campaign is sort of like grown up and developed over the course of a couple of sessions and so I was like oh you know I've been it's one of my first video games ever played they've been forever since I'd played it so you know I wasn't quite clear on all the details just like I'm gonna be inspired by this thing I didn't really do any development of it you know I didn't really change things I didn't really make it my own or like take the the seed of the idea and let it grow in the soil of my imagination there's like proper transfer of the tree into your work yeah and one of the players was like that this is and and it's a moment where and you'll have them as dm's where a player will say something or do something and you know that you face a choice and it's like you can deny backpedal no that's not what this is whatever try to massage things back on track you know don't know it con your own yeah you know you didn't look behind the curtain or you can say yes and you try to salvage from there and so like you do these sometimes when you accidentally kill a PC right like and you look at the dice and you're like that's way more to hit points and they probably you know or something you have a choice you can not reveal that that's the die result that you rolled and pick something that won't kill them or you can go with it and see what happens it so that was mine I was like yeah it is and instantly was starting to change or make adjustments to what was going on in the game world so that number one this person who'd also played these games a lot didn't like have a an unfair advantage over everybody and the other party read the cliff notes right it's not like anybody was mattering thing he's kind of like no we all had that he was like hey it's not really what this is it was like awesome I love that game yeah no I remember it led to like a like a 30-minute a side where we always talked about quest for glory and I was just like I've never played this is a great game and ever since then I just know if I'm going to take something from a video game from a movie from TV something I can't assume I'm the only one who's ever experienced this and that was maybe easier to do back when I was a kid and like nerd was not as common but right now it's one of the things where I don't want to make the assumption that I'm the only one who's experienced this thing so I don't want to just present something that's been undeveloped I want to I want to make it fit be inspired by it to create something new just like rip it off one one thing that I always tried to and we've talked about before is like like the rule of three ah I try to draw from three different inspirations sure yeah because when you take three inspirations and weave them together that's you're creating something new right yeah I mean you know in a sense it's just like baking just like cooking anything else yeah but like the way you prepare it you like there's a lot of different ways to approach that right like two complementary and one sort of contradictory yeah sort of influence so that it creates a contrast and adds something new I think there's multiple ways to implement it it could be just like oh I really like the world from this one movie but yeah I like you know the villains designs in this other one you know I like the social structure from this other one and then when you kind of mesh them all together yeah I mean you know people can be like oh I see where that was inspired from I love that too right and it's a it's a kind of a cultural touchstone so certain things were you as you described them and people kind of pick up on it at least now you're in the same kind of headspace yes with general descriptions number one being in the same head space is really is important for a lot of people particularly those that like really immersive styles of play staying in that headspace where you're making decisions as your character and thinking like your character then the more evocative to the other players at the table can be the more they can contribute to building up of that immersive space and so like thinking about the sorts of things that you're including in your game how they're gonna fit together especially ones words like I've been inspired by this and if you're not really thinking it through you might just try like one-to-one translation now you have a chance to sort of like let it marinate and sit and pick things that are going to be inspiring not just to you but your players and say something about the world and game you're trying to run another Avenue kind of staying on the diem side of things yeah are of course NPC inspirations will get to players and you know if everybody wants to make make whatever carry a number one proponent of that sure yeah no I make all my characters but NPC inspiration since I've started like DMing a lot more is like oh yeah and for me it starts with just like a character in a character's voice right right I absolutely love like the freakin Godfather the day of my daughter's wedding you know and like like like I had to have a character like that of course I made him a gnome sure and like a title but he's just as dangerous don't sure yeah coffee homeless with them you'll end up in a tiny tiny grave they only build great you know sighs and you're gonna Duff you in yeah you're gonna fit one way or another but I also like have a beholder bartender that I wanted that I wanted to be basically Sean Connery right yeah because the rock and all that station is gonna be in some bad straight seem they're gonna need to break out of there yeah they're gonna need to break out of the rock like but that's the thing I knew that that would happen eventually and that is precisely why I put them in there yes because eventually they're gonna need his help to break out to me I want one line to hook them yeah and then input and yeah that one catchphrase to hook them and then the info is to seek the hook sure I am now now when it comes to character inspiration ah yeah this is an aspect where I like I have always I'm gonna make every freakin Clint Eastwood like gun slinger yeah but and you know D&D but indeed II sure whatever we finally got to ever on and I finally got to make it right stuffing down the crossbow expert not yet fifth edition it's coming don't want you this is where you can you can play your heroes this is where you know yeah change the name you know do whatever but you know like if you like that thing in that book see how they play in another scenario take you know Aquaman but give them Wolverines backstory have you become a fish while you was experimented on maybe for some people if it's like that then playing just their actual influence you might be handing them the perfect character we had this for personal you know a friend of ours we used to play with that that game where it was like sort of the low magic and then y'all got sold to fret on the city of brass and off to dis you know we sat down with this one player or just like hey man like you really seem to like this style of play you know you're kind of favorite movies all have this certain style of hero the very irreverent 80s action movie style in like why don't you just play this person the name and everything just play them and and like I would say in all the that I that I was able to play you know with that particular player was probably the most fun I've had with him in a game it felt like that they were being honest about what they wanted out of the game and and how much enjoyment they were getting out of it you know if you have one of those players where it just seems like they can never find a character that matches the tone of the game or that matches their play style allowing yourself to be inspired by characters from the media you you enjoy which are already being inspired by whether you know it or not it's already influencing you like being explicit about that can sometimes be a big boon yeah it was very freeing the range of characters I've played after that yeah nuts yeah it's almost like it was it was like it finally freed me I was like okay I'm finally I finally did it I finally put a pin in that yeah that idea I don't know sometimes it's fun to really lean into the tropes like one of my favorite trips leaning to is the constructed weapon that escaped oh sure yeah right I don't know it's the River Tam uh-huh what like one of my favorite characters ever tk8 away constructed by lipids to be this bad ass and she escapes and goes in exacts revenge I mean like it's 11 from stranger things yes yeah I mean this is replete you know you know they'd be careful what you you know what you create cuz it might come back to destroy you Frankenstein's monster that will always be a trope that is worth playing picture classic some things are classic and some things until until they're completely out of our real world yeah they will always be in our in our media I'm much the same way it took me and I easily for 10 years I played the same character really didn't to play that off done and so every time I did be like I want to play the mysterious power-hungry magic user right like that's a that's that's a trope that's a an archetypal you know character that I want to portray in these games but every time I would sit down to play we weren't running the game where a powers be a mysterious power we weren't playing ARS Magica we weren't playing you know magical gathering or not Mexican during the mage the ascension we weren't playing any of those other kinda back right yeah it sounds very wisely yeah you were playing it but it is right like I found like that Raistlin I preferred you know Raceland over elminster and and didn't really get some edge I mean I'm sorry yeah but you know it took me playing a character in a D&D game where I was a power-mad you know you know scrappy kind of wizard and had a good time with it even if I didn't get to like the heights of Knight level spells since then I played fewer and fewer mages and every time I do I'm more and more just kind of like done this already like how many times can you cast this spell it like it doesn't change that much between additions you know most of the same thing every time charm some buyer put him to sleep or zip around a battlefield or something before it's like you want to try something new I was inspired by historical figures not necessarily literary one since I'd be like oh this Renaissance mercenary captain behaved like this you know this is how they acted this is what they were like well let's make character based on them that's my personal journey so oh I love it so you can get tripped up on on being too overt with the cliches oh sure or whatever so how do you do that or subvert the cliche you know if you're a long time you know veteran of fantasy RPGs or just role-playing in general you probably know what these cliches are but they're sort of like you know a manichaean black and white world view which good and evil are distinct and and separate forces that the place where you know Warriors are good noble and like and the violence and injustice are these you know kind of like rare blips or aberrations in the social order like what you can do with like avoiding cliches in those situations is is just to be familiar with the kinds of archetypes that are there and if you want to say avoid the cliches of being like say goodie you know do good or 9:00 signing armor or something like that yeah or a power-hungry wizard who is selfish and doesn't think of the rest of the group like just being aware of them will help you avoid them being aware of them will will help you understand the parts of the cliche that you can take and change so maybe you're playing a half-orc and you don't want to play the cliched I come from a broken family you know where one of my parents assaulted the other and now I'm product of rape and violence and fear like that's a pretty tired and quite frankly problematic trope you know so you could take that and say like well maybe my characters not maybe they're from a different part of you know the world where works and people works are people and works in humans you know treat each other differently maybe it's completely opposite and I you know my orcish mother and human father loved each other very dearly and ya know I'm seeing like bordering kingdoms and the parents were alike part of an arranged marriage or you do the noble background with her half floor because you're  Prince yeah you know your mother was a was an orcish princess and your father was a you know barren desert gasps Duke so that's one way of like avoiding them or subverting them is to just be aware of them and then take select pieces that you think are either uninspiring or unoriginal or you don't necessarily like them and find something else orcs and Knowles and goblins and everything they are people they have a culture they have you know moral agency but the conflict is not one of good and evil black and white cosmic kind of stakes it's they want something different than us negotiations have broken down and we are now at war with the orcish peoples or the goblins are fleeing something even worse and initially we fight them because you know that's just how we roll you know where they've been our traditional enemies for centuries but this time feels different and oh crap there's something worse and now we have to both like you know make up for you know these lost times and try to heal some kind of you know the great wounds that exist because we face this existential threat you know you've complicated things in a way that's added something to the story it's a long tradition and RPGs to take all kinds of things and mash them up and throw them in a blender the classic model for a hex crawl is to you make a hex map and then you pour through your dragon magazine collection your your collection of you know slim staple bound modules your big hardcover stuff and you just go like all right the Temple of Elemental seals here the village of omelets here this is where they keep on the borderlands is we're going to do against the Giants over here this is where whatever is and like with the explosion of content on the internet like most of that can come from say the multitude of free one page dungeons that are a fear or you know the other kinds of you know quality adventures that people are writing either on blogs or or places like drives or RPG or other content sharing sites it's like you have a multitude of things to be influenced by so it's a good idea to like learn how to develop those influences into something that is uniquely yours yeah and that's that's good times if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and subscribe web

be-all end-all like number one inspiration from anything I've ever watched it grew up watching mash just the idea of pierce his irreverence you know his absolute oh yeah intellect intellectual like fortitude is always you know just just you Authority but he's gonna do the right thing no matter what oh yeah yeah he's gotta you know he's a boozer and a womanizer I mean he's not that the thing is he's not a perfect character that's what I love about him is there's there's many aspects to him but like being able to play that in a Call of Cthulhu game cuz it was the whole thing with mash was just like what do you like this is how you like insanity either you know you you make fun of it or you go crazy and sometimes you do both at the same time
