were all the same. So, I need to study it! Miyeon's Selfie Signature Pose This pose or this one all the time. Guys! Give me some ideas~ This one? (Somehow, it fits her well) Recently, NEVERLAND says
Miyeon is so funny. (Tough-looking)
Who and which NEVERLAND said that? I've never been funny. But if you keep saying I'm funny... I feel burdensome
that I have to make you laugh. (Don't try to make us laugh
because you're just funny) It means you like it, huh? If you like it I'm just satisfied with it. Give it to me! Suddenly, a Skit Begins (Giving the apple) It looks yummy~ (Having a bite of the apple) (Hmm? Strange taste?) (Collapsing) (What... Acting Snow White?) You can't say it's acting. It's rather a gag! She Said She's Not Funny Character
