the video [Music] well i don't know nothing about nothing but i want to learn something about something and that's ranching i see all these people riding their ponies around the parts and that ned kelly armor causing more chaos than a wet head well that's what we wanted to do so i set about getting all the necessary bits and bobs for a little start and that brings us to here the humble beginnings of tumblewood ranch [Music] [Music] ah we got our start beautiful let's make three furnaces but this isn't the place we're settling into by the way guys i've already marked where i want to settle and that's up there i'm starting to ranch i want to ride around on the horse i want to focus on the horse i'm not focused on a horse yet well not really anywhere i've never made horse armor i don't think i've never made horseshoes saddle bags never ridden one in a super suit i think being a horse lord could be dope so i wanna i'm gonna explore that even and with a battalion like riding behind me as well like oh that'd be crazy just a bunch of people on horses but we need to get everything sorted and ready and set to go so i know we need 200 metal frags off the bat just so i can put some honeycomb into this seal up the rest we're gonna need to go buy more wood i reckon this is a trough seven hundred [Music] [Music] [Music] all right the base is honeycomb the starter got plenty of loot room now it's time to fill it up we better make a bag for in here actually put these away we're gonna get a stone another oars all right let's go get stone [Music] so i got these nice rolling snowy mountains over here perfect for the view of the ranch i mean well the ranch is going to be up on them but we get some nice views up there anyway which is good i've already got perfect spot marked beautiful spot amongst the trees and stuff let's go get some stone so we can buy some wood no way ease [Music] look at that this is the spot i have a ranch amongst the trees and stuff it's gonna be beautiful yes beautiful a lot of metal man come on hopefully the wood stacks as well god damn it i hate this new [ __ ] 33 33k wood on the way let's get more g'day good day how are we doing good it's good we are not building here okie dokie then creating team just let me make you later who's that hello tuesday do you have a hatchet so that we can destroy my bag [Music] no i don't have a hatchet sorry man well i'll show you the bag it is give him the tool hammer yeah take this and then you can pick it up and give it to them i'll check it outside oh i got it i'm sorry this guy's asking for our names in case he kills us and puts that stuff back worth it i probably just want to know who lives here to be honest yeah well essentially anyone that's got ptt in front of their name is part of our plan the [ __ ] too we have face uh did you hear 35 wait 35 what they have 35 players 20 reckons [ __ ] they reckon he reckons they're 35 deep just to get rid of a dog they play this one they play the server just get rid of a dog and there's 35 of them i feel like teaming up with half the server there you go i feel like that's uh exaggerated surely surely that's like [ __ ] 8 16 24 31. it's half the server it's about [ __ ] five teams what the heck i thought it was crazy with a little over two yeah well he reckons they're based up near stone quarry so be interesting to see what their base is like yeah well i want to build uh where i've marked 09. oh close up near them yeah nice well we can let them know and then they won't destroy us if they're 35 deep maybe they're 325d yeah might be worth offlining them building build out wonderful dog spaces got anything left over is that his base down there yeah the big decayed one he said that's that was his base a compound that's the king oh there's a someone around three hundred look semi-kitted yeah i'm not sure if that was a sneeze or you're saying okay i have four crossbows why do you have four crossbows i'm gonna

constantly i can make one gate so far i'm coming with three yeah it's five i just used five all right we got two boxes of stone um it's just about time box of charcoal all right [ __ ] it shall we go up there and build this base that's good what do we want me to bring stone as soon as we get tumblewood ranch like kind of a set i think i might jump off a beer okay good that way i know what the plan is yeah sweet that's good i might have to rate this base to our [Music] left [Music] so [Music] i really underestimated how thick this base was yeah that's wow it's got one layer of extra underground yeah good night hello everyone hello wait this mustn't be you you didn't join and say hello [ __ ] yes sir i i've got one extra slime find something the character wouldn't run i don't have that one

run up to me shot me all right i'll go out there do you see him no but i see dad's boy so i must have before it went straight over me uh yeah i'd seen from us uh 180 yeah he's only got he's got a short name you say 180 from us from us go right more he ran down that way right well yeah went that direction just got a kill locked on this thing well he was shot by ak but now he's using yeah like a tommy or something oh he's in he's in the bush with ak in the bush [ __ ] three times three times on the rock with the little [ __ ] i don't know he must be right near our base yes should i run out with a sword like a double barrel not true he's trying to he's trying to get out of there yeah look he's like just [ __ ] around with me just running out of the rock and running back in he's running he missed everything wait a minute i've hit him twice again he set my mouth for you let me mark where he would be probably there last time make his shots when i feel right here hit him again hit him again he's low you got a push i'm down you got a creep on him lock do you have a db i see him but he sees me run away recalibrate if you can loop around and come under the rock lips and [ __ ] like that and get close to him that'd be good i see a good way to get to it he's running he didn't have his ak out i've got it unless he's got a second one but i didn't see he probably wouldn't i hit him when he was running so he started okay get inside blocky come on i'm going to go and go i lost the star but it's good i'm inside him inside has is that has he doubled yeah that's a shot me i think it might not be so don't rely on it being him i hit one with devi it was stein got me with an lr i picked up a tommy [Music] [Music] yeah i don't know because he sounds kind of australian but sometimes not right now bro will be later though so it wasn't him no um everything i got is in this bottom left box oh jesus oh you didn't grab everything did you because you died oh yeah there's tommy on the

have been screaming if i had no r okay the only thing i got was a fancy hatchet i must don't put anything in these front boxes because i must have um i'll place some probably i can't fit furnaces in there for some reason you could just upgrade the walls to shoot that one in that one experience so you mean okay i don't think we're going to be able to get people on to build their own bases and [ __ ] so i guess we should start walling off just we'll do it just in a big area and then we could make the windows with uh external tcs they had a did they have maybe they didn't um turret at the other base put down oh yeah i bought that over well i'll make 12 tcs actually no i'll make eight those jump into yeah um have we got a dedicated weapons box or anything yet no you'll be upgrade guy i guess spooky let's get back a second aircraft [Music] so [Music] oh this is different geez quite the shooting floor indeed yeah how the heck do you even get in there's a doorway under a staircase that i
