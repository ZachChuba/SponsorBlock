and then we can give you notes like we did last week for you Dropbox if that works oh I did not get those notes oh I didn't get any notification about anything we left so many oh my god are you serious yeah I've taken literally a whole day I think it was like 10 hours or so a huge huge chunk of time fortunately we were able to move past that one pretty quick but when it comes to design the struggle is real they're ready guys episode 2 is happening right now welcome to design from scratch okay let me back up and explain how we got here in the event you don't know who or what the future is we're a group of creative professionals on a mission to teach anyone willing to listen the value of design more specifically how to bridge that vast gap between design and business and yes that means how to charge more money to design logos but it's bigger than that the future is about changing the way we learn our goal is to teach 1 billion people and it all hinges on how many subs our YouTube channel kits just kidding kind of hello friends and welcome to episode 2 of design from scratch if you somehow missed the first episode do yourself a favor go back and watch that right now because you are missing out on some fantastic drama there's a link to it in the description below don't worry I'll still be here when you get back Oh while you're down there look for a link to our sponsor web flow and yeah contractually I have to say that but keep watching the series and you'll see how amazing web flow really is no joke ok let's do a quick recap our web site is long overdue for refresh so we're burning down our WordPress site and rebuilding it in web flow but as it turns out even as professionals designing for yourself is super challenging and conflicting opinions amongst our team is not helping you know we've had around one a design what was your gut reaction to I hated it oh my god ok my feedback at this point would be to start over from the ground up coach ouch the stakes are high but to quote one of my favorite metal bands we didn't come this far just to run away it's time to start designing we have a designer working on the whole website design so when does this design is finished we're gonna develop it ourself using what the law for this website our big goal really is to host all of the different types of content that we make in a well-designed way we've talked a lot about how we think the design can help users find the information they need and and so that's you know like that's the main user goal my biggest concern at this point is to make sure that the thing is usable because if people don't know where the Buy button is we're gonna have a major problem we have another meeting today it's our sort of weekly design review so Jamie's gonna come in I think the real goal for that stuff is understand the decisions that are being made look at the designs together if there's any like big questions or things that's like no but just doesn't work get that out in the air and discuss it face to face so that you know nothing is kind of left unknown as we move another week forward in the design process we don't vary the weight of any of the type or at least not in a significantly noticeable way I'm not saying we have to you but we can I had this thing I like stripped out most of the different weights of this huge type family and in favor of going with this regular weight which which was very clean and crisp and like a little on the lighter side and it felt really refined to me so I'd kind of said like we're sticking to this and now I think we're feeling like it's kind of missing one level of hierarchy I was hoping to achieve enough contrast just through scale but in the back of my head I was like at some point they're gonna ask about weight the font weights thank you I don't know I I don't know I think the regular looks more polished but I'm willing to throw another weight in there if you want to it's kind of like the you know admitting that you were wrong as it is and you know I was really tied to it it's a little bit of a pride thing you know if it helps the website then then I'm on board in the end like I said it made a really positive difference and I think kind of transformed the look of the site overall but it's it's really hard for me to let go of decisions that I've made that maybe the rest of the team hasn't I think when I was staff I like I really took everything personally like I think it was like design his life kind of mentality for me and it felt like I had to be right like if someone disagreed with me I felt like it meant that I was wrong and then you know peeling back the onion layers and therapy you know you finally get to like I am not worthy I'm not good enough and that's you know even though it's usually like buried under all those layers it's it's kind of a tough thing to even acknowledge but hey I mean I think I'm I'm kind of getting there and I'm just accepted that I'm not gonna be right about everything I mean a if you like this team is a bunch of really really smart insightful people and you know everyone has opinions that are valuable not just me I think since becoming a freelancer it's it's gotten a lot easier aesthetic decisions like I don't take personally if people disagree with me and I'm if you like I'm much more willing to try and to to change my mind Jimmy brings up a very familiar dichotomy that I think a lot of us creative folks experience it's hard not to put so much of yourself into your work and then when that work is criticized it's especially hard not to take it personally we talked about passion and attachment in the last episode but even with that in mind sometimes those can get under your skin and that's okay not everyone's is great at giving feedback either if I could offer any advice to those of you writing this particular struggle bus it would be leave your ego at the door and try to learn how to disagree without being disagreeable speaking of disagreement when I first saw the design I loved it I know I'd really I really liked it I can see it as an evolution of where we had started Jamie took that and and then refined it I did not like it at all I mean it's kind of nice like a bit usually with web it's very easy to identify patterns and with this design that we have I was struggling to identify patterns I couldn't really tell what was supposed to be the headings in order I couldn't really tell what was supposed to be the body copy because there are several different sizes and it felt like it was more expressive than functional because it doesn't conform to any of the standards that I've worked with in the past then it was color color threw me in a major way the white on red is gonna like really hurt I know we said no white on black the white on blue is worse either be yellow or read you can't have like the red yellow and black together cuz it's like oh the Durban flag you know cool it down you know like whoa it's too much I kind of hope to move away from that in this in this new website but we've just embraced it completely so although it's still colorful that colors were kind of toned down a little bit in general I really like the direction that that it's headed this that's fine and I like each section that's cool that's a great but uh sorry Jamie we put you in a tough spot why'd you hate it i I just I did not like it at all just working with our brand the bright primary colors the blue and yellow has been difficult for me since day one I hear you been I help the people understand this is kind of something that you know as a designer you have to be able to do you have to be able to work especially as a creative director you have to be able to work with things that you don't like when we talked I said you know this is personal preference could be perfect but because I have such a distaste for it I don't know Ben is spot-on and how about that self-awareness impressive now I hate to break it to you but not every project you work on is going to be your favorite in fact some of them are just stinkers but the way you handle those situations is what will make or break your value to the team when I find myself unhappy with the way a project is going I take a breath and then I try to find something else in the creative process that I can get excited about in this case been focused his efforts on the UX and UI and I am so glad that he did so it'd be great to like be able to filter speaking engagement care that goes the speaking engagement page a curriculum content in an accordion makes total sense to me my role in those meetings kind of took the form of a champion for the user are things easy to find are the interactions going to be simple to work with now this is all stuff that we're gonna test at a later date but at these early phases I was really focused on the usability overall user experience is one thing business goals are the second and when those two align they're fantastic so if the user wants to buy one of our products and it's really easy for them to do so that's a beautiful thing the way that we're going to test this obviously we're gonna sit down with users and interact the site with them but we're also going to be measuring the data that comes from the new website and comparing it to our benchmarks from the old site as we're measuring and collecting the data on things like conversions and bounce rates the beautiful thing about web flow is that we can make these small incremental changes very very quickly a designer can go in there in a couple of minutes and completely change the layout of a page in order to test something else to see if that page works better so by using web Flow it's actually gonna save us time when we iterate on the site later having a complimentary perspective really helped with the design process now I feel a lot better I'm still not fully satisfied with with where we are but it's a personal aesthetic decision versus something that I think is like a UX UI okay as far as like where we're at with the overall UX usability I think we're there so we do mmm I'm into it I feel really good about my part I think we all did our best to get to a solution that everybody was happy with for me it was really nice to be able to do a site that that was type centric and and a lot of the you know clarity of design came down to how well the type work together design I really like it I mean I already know Jamie personally and her design aesthetic over the time of like I think five weeks went to the direction that I think I really wanted her to make like which is very design heavy and simple and with really fun colors which is she used it's very elegant we've done I'm pretty happy to see her design I think like looking back on that and where we ended up I think the design is great I do think it's unique it's it's it's different but yeah it's not out there yeah Jamie is a fantastic designer she's incredible type I'm thrilled with I think this is our last design meeting like official one right go team go yeah it's weird like after this this final design meeting that that we had essentially like wrapping up the design I had this thought and I always kind of liked to hold this story to myself it doesn't matter if you're making like a website or like back in the day I you know we're making commercials with short films and animations I would say most projects that I start I really don't know what's gonna happen I'm not sure what its gonna look like but I'm 150% sure it's gonna work figure it out and I've gone into every project of my whole life is thinking that and it's really scary cuz sometimes you've you bite off more than you can chew but even if something is unknown I always like to tell myself like don't know what I'm doing here but I know by the time we finish it's gonna be great and it's gonna work yeah and then we're gonna move on with our lives - is it me or did I almost sound like Michael Scott there somehow I managed one last thing and the the future yeah anyways links in the description you know the drill see you next time on the next episode of design from scratch we are headed to development ville we're saying is the mayor and the sheriff and City Council and will are you gonna it's all in in now I'm kind of scared because I didn't the one have to build oh my god oh my god I think I need support Oh alright what I do what are the am I doing this right I don't know bro if it doesn't turn out well it's all me what what did you say
