squarespace need a domain or website you can make it with squarespace okay i'm about to commit film snob heresy by saying this but i'm going to be honest i've never liked silent films yep yep i know chaplain keaton and loyd are movie legends and i know you have no business calling yourself a student to film unless you're willing to kiss the tramp's ring but i just didn't get it alright way too many repeated gags surface level slapstick storytelling long stretches where nothing really remarkable happens and wildly varying run times made it really hard for me to ever get into them it's not that i didn't have a healthy respect for the classics i did i just you know didn't think they aged well in today's modern filmmaking landscape i'm fully aware that at the time they were developed the silent film classics were technical marvels and created the foundation for the entire industry that we enjoy today as a practitioner of film i studied and dissected city lights metropolis and a general these films helped me understand the medium and become better at the craft but mary was their area lazy friday evening when i sat down in the living room with a tub of popcorn and said to myself you know what i'm in the mood to watch le voyage dolls there's a sci-fi flick that'll get my heart pumping point is i watched them academically never recreationally but ladies and gentlemen boys and girls i want you to know that after this month i have both literally and figuratively changed my tomb because it turns out it wasn't that i didn't enjoy silent films i was just watching them wrong we live in an era of home movie entertainment but in the mid 1890s to the late 1920s motion pictures were a purely theatrical experience film started off with no synchronized sound this meant no pre-recorded music no audible dialogue no thx logo coming at you like no big flashy just the moving pictures but that by itself is mad boring and totesma goats awkward to sit through in a crowded auditorium so in order to pump some romp and circumstance into the flicks theater runners had to do it all practically while the movie was being displayed on the projector a pianist would sit off to the side and play the movie's soundtrack live see back then distributors they would send the film reels to theaters packaged with the accompanying sheet music for an in-house musician or musicians to play large enough venues they might even employ a small orchestra so that the theater goers could enjoy the movie's music to its fullest extent ironically so-called silent movies were all about music people would travel far and wide to attend screenings with the largest accompaniments in many places going to the movies meant going to a concert charlie chaplin's flicks were never meant to be watched alone on the couch in the dark in your living room these movies were meant to be watched in front of a live orchestra in a crowded theater full of energetic patrons willing to have a good time considering this made me at the very least entertain the idea that i hadn't been giving silent films a fair shake maybe if i could somehow watch these old reels in the original setting in which they were screened i would look at this whole thing differently but let's be real how could i ever hope to recreate an experience like that today well wouldn't you know it there are people out there right now trying to make a living by doing just that springfield missouri is home to the goloys theater a historic site built in 1926 on the newly announced route 66 it was originally a hybrid theater that hosted both vaudeville and film presentations it eventually closed but was restored and reopened in 2006 and it's played host to all kinds of concerts and events in town ever since earlier this month i went there with a few friends to see or rather hear the petrine ragtime society orchestra they're a group of musicians that travel across the united states recreating the syncopated stylings of ragtime theater and dance music and their show masters of silent comedy underscores classic silent films with an authentic recreation of the movie going experience during the show a small theater orchestra plays along to three well-known silent films buster keaton's one week laurel and hardy's big business and charlie chaplin's the adventurer in a manner such as you would experience during the movie's original screenings during the show they play off of authentic original sheet music for the films and many authentic original period instruments the ragtime society made these silent films of yesteryear come alive in a way i didn't think was possible this mix of live performance and film projection it's something i haven't experienced before and it added a completely new dimension to these works that so many including myself have written off from time to time as antiquated and even boring i genuinely enjoyed watching these movies as the musicians played accompaniment to the images giving them emotional depth [Music] i was on the edge of my seat as the drummer juggled seemingly dozens of different instruments to generate the movie's sound effects in real time there's really nothing quite like this [Music] watching silent films in this context made me not only appreciate but actually enjoy the medium's peculiarities without dialogue silent movies rely on visual communication through facial expression body language and the occasional on-screen graphic this isn't new information to you i'm sure but it cannot be stated enough just how easier said than done this actually is it's hard for me as a filmmaker to convey stories without spoken words i would not have worked well in a time period without them to tell stories before the invention of talkies meant mastering the art of minimalism how do you convey exposition and dialogue with as few cutaways as possible leaning upon text as a crutch via a constant barrage of title cards would be dull and tedious for an audience to sit through so often a silent film's on-screen conversations are distilled to only the heaviest punch lines or the most profound thoughts most of all the live orchestral element made the theatrical experience thrilling again see when you're attending a live concert there's an element of suspense to everything will the musicians hit their cues will they flub a sequence well the various sections of the orchestra harmonize correctly what if an instrument breaks or something technical falls apart it's a high wire act the whole way through and the audience is along for the ride in a strange way having the musicians in-house occasionally improvising here or there with the crowd reacting to every tonal decision they made felt way more exciting to me than watching a blockbuster flick filled with highly perfected and precisely edited sound and images stories told in this medium in this way they don't need modern technical innovations to entertain so i'm not ashamed to admit that i've been wrong about silent films watching these movies at home during my film study days felt like a chore sitting in a beautiful theater and watching them like this felt fun and after all isn't that the point of the majority of this era's films bring people together give them a few laughs and maybe make a dreary evening a little brighter austinmcconnell to save 10 off
