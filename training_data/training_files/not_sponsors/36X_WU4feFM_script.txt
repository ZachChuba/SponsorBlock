I got eyes this is Wayne with the Tesla way I was just coming to you with the new update of the 2020 Dodge 16.2 that one wanted to show that to you guys real quick here so what's new in this update they've made some adjustments with the Tesla toy box the toy box has been redesigned to make it easier to view and play simply scroll through the toys and adjust these associated controls as before access the Tesla toy box tap the toy box icon from the application launcher I'll show you guys these things here as well nearby charging station so it'll let you know if they're fast charging gives you the I guess the speed of charging that they'll display here to you so that's good we didn't have that before they didn't have the speed notification there we have dashcam improvements dashcam is now easier to set up or erase after plugging in your USB Drive tap control safety and security format USB device so that is really really nice that they have added that for us because before you'd have to take it to your computer and then you would have to update it that way so now you can do it all from the car you can format it here so you don't even you know once you get a thumb drive you could just go ahead and throw it right in there and format it right here there's some backgammon improvements I personally don't play backgammon but my wife does playing get backgammon against your Tesla has now become more difficult so I guess the level has become a little harder for you difficult level has now been trained with twenty plus million games so as everything with Tesla it's learning from the AI from playing with us and driving with us so that's kind of nice then we have our previous release notes you know now that they have these stop one stop lights know that I'm gonna do it and drive and test that out as well dashcam viewer so they've also allowed us to start viewing the dashcam from inside the car so I'll show you guys some of that stuff as well alright alright and we have the out of order super charging stalls so that's nice as well alright so let me go and do a couple of things let's turn that on safety and security just go and show you guys where you can format it now so here that is I won't be formatting at this moment but that's very nice that you can and then the autopilot let's go and turn this back on here gives you that disclaimer that says it is beta alright we'll see if that changes anything and we'll also see if the visible visualizations have changed before I get to driving let's go and play around in this toy box here so let's see if we can still access it this way nope there's no drop down anymore so you have to go through here and then go through toy box here oh wow look at these and then you got I had it on Ludacris parts instead of alright let's go back to I'm so ready just in case so we have that there we have track still alright we have the romance mode still let's get cozy for a quick second let's see if it's gonna kick on my heater when it's warm outside I hope it doesn't pull the kicks on the AC so far the air are still kind of cool that's nice alright sketchpad still have Mars still have Santa mode and Rainbow Road so we can drive with the road being rainbow alright to get it into that you got to push down there stock down four times quickly when an auto steer is engaged and then it will turn the road into rainbows alright I won't turn on the jingle all the way I don't feel like hearing that song at the moment let's see if they did anything different with our entertainment nope no that is still the same um one thing I didn't notice is all the games that we had so how do you get to the games now so I think in my updates I've lost some of the games let's see here oh we go to arcade sorry so we still have all these great games super breakout is always one of my favorites let's open up backgammon real quick just so you guys can see if it's changed any I don't know if I'm playing against the Tesla it is allowing me to movies [Music] I'm not a very good backgammon player all right so let's get into the driving all right run my road right here let's see Oh can't kick an autopilot on my road because there's no second lane here [Music] but I'll go ahead and turn around so we can get to the main road [Music] let's go this way so here's the stoplight let's see if it's gonna stop for us look the people's feet are actually moving now guys that's kind of cool before they were just stick figures just scooting across now they're actually moving across walking across even gets the person across the intersection here Wow very nice see if is gonna stuff my turn yellowest we're coming to it I wanted to see if it was gonna go through the green light or not so the light is red let's see if the stock whoa all right they made that improvement so you can't go through a red light with the stock what about what the gas pedal nope all right so they made those improvements guys so I might actually use this I wonder if I can increase the speed you know so you still can't go five miles an hour over the speed limit that's good to know [Music] all right so I kicked the gas pedal or the accelerator sorry the habits die hard [Music] so I'm stopping at this green light as well so I'll press the stock down so we can go through so you still have to press the stock even before green lights but at least it won't go through the red light now when you press the stock before it would that's nice see if they'll turn left okay don't get Avenue help us out here with some driving just curious to see how the navigation will work in city streets all right so card stock should stock down one thing I'm waiting forward to learn is to slow down for dips right here is a dip coming up so let's see well let's slow down because of the light but not because of the dip I was about to university feet turn left onto Topanga Canyon Boulevard now turn left onto Topanga Canyon Boulevard so it panics right there because it saw them to light had turned yellow right after I initiated going through so that's good that it gives you that ample warning really loud warning as well and I have it in gel mode imagine if it wasn't in Joe and Joe mode is a setting to have the warnings at a lesser dust below [Music] really liking this stock thing much better than I did the first time around wonder if it's gonna stop here what the rule anyway thought it would his top 20 and saw that it was actually ran but it's good to know Oh I know for the campsite of people walking next to the car yeah it does very nice you've been inquire had of us and still captured it that was great [Music] don't let your back into the night mode here it's not what I wanted just me [Music] bringing up Chester tap it for you guys I'm gonna go ahead and make a left turn here it really breaks aggressively when cars turn in front of you because it doesn't know if the car is gonna stop in front of you so it wants to try to make sure that it gets you to safely so I hid their stock down as I'm slowing down to see if it will resume automatically or if I'm gonna have to hit the stock one more time I'm gonna have to hit the stock one more time so that is also an improvement before I would be able to hit the stock and then it would stop at that stoplight one more time after the cars have accelerated through so this time I was able to three or four cars back there hit the stock and it went through the life as well along with the other cars that was nice can I turn on some a/c here just a little bit we gotta hit the stock so we're getting closer and closer guys to the full autonomy I'm getting very excited about it actually I can definitely say that you know this car has been really really cool because just a few weeks ago I had a couple of updates and now here we are like a week and a half later and I got another update so this car will continually improve itself which your standard car definitely the day that you buy it off the lot it is the most advancement you're gonna get unless you do any modifications yourself you'll never see that the that they deal with that their manufacturer will send you an update all right you may in the future just not currently so it's definitely a.m. and welcome to experience so there's a crosswalk coming up here I wanted to see if it was going to stop for that this time it didn't it's not bad I've been in some areas where it would just stop like the crosswalk no matter what I'm with the previous updates I'll have to try those areas out again and I was always I will do some driving videos to see if the auto pilot will improve on certain roads so send their lives and share those with you guys as well yes this car in front of me doesn't have automatic headlights because their headlights are still off and the stock so we can continue hunter I can also hit the accelerator just so you guys know it's just much easier and much more relaxing for me to keep my feet still and use my hands since my hands already on the serum right there so I hit the accelerator now and see if it will take or if I need to do it again once the cars move did it under something that's nice as you can hit it beforehand so when it begins to initiate slowing down at these of these lights and taps the brakes a little bit too I guess to kind of remind you that hey it's going to stop at the stop sign or a stop light for you so that's kind of nice as well so it'll give you a little hint saying hey or a little reminder saying go ahead and hit that accelerator I'm going to take it out of autopilot I need to make a right turn here [Music] all right once again this is Wayne with the Tesla way please like and subscribe linked down below thank you very much have a great night guys [Music]
