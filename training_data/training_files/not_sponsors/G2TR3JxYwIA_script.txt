[The fan signing event of SinB for EVISU!]
Hello~ I'm now at the fan signing event for EVISU! I'm having a solo fan signing thanks to EVISU. I'm even wearing a shiny pink jacket today. I'm here. Not any more. Me.. it's me!! It's me, it's me!! It's me!! I'm here as well! I'm here as well. I'm everywhere, everyone. Right!! My contract with EVISU was extended. I had my contract renewal with EVISU. Please continue to love EVISU. And see you next year as well. Hello, everyone~ Today... wow~~ Hold on. Now! The fan signing event for EVISU is finished! Now I will go for the next schedule. I don't know if I could have another fan signing next year, I hope I could have a solo fan signing next year as well. If I could have a solo fan signing next year, I kind of expect my members to come for me, and I hope they will come if they see this behind the scenes video. So it was such a meaningful and precious time to have a solo fan signing event. And I was happy to see my dear Buddies, after a long time. See you at EVISU next year~
