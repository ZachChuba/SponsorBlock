i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you good luck until the only restriction left is that i can't die with the completion of dragon slayer 2 in the last episode we now just have one task left before we go back to wilderness slayer for our second piece of dagon high and that last task is to get one unique drop from zara before the western elite diaries this also means that once we receive the first unique drop we can't go back to zara until after we enter stage three before any of this though we do have an accumulator to unlock so it's time to go and get vorkat's head some more dragon there it is we got so lucky on that forecast head there it is the ava's assembler and finally we can get this step and complete it ruin heraldic shield and i also have a few stalls that i can use here we go yes that's it that's one of the hardest items to get with the dragon black mask obtained there is now only two items left that are somewhat difficult to get from clues and that is the bando's cloak from medium clues and the zamorak full helm from hard clues if i'm able to obtain those then realistically even with master clues i should never have to drop another clue 79 herb lore very nice and there we go another task finish that's now 650 kill count at basilisk nights doing some more steel bars for our cannon ball making we got 75 smithing there's 83 slayer yes there we go another zenite we've made up for our huge blunder and we can now make the ring of suffering so since we made our gigantic blunder of making another anguish you're going to have to buy an extra onyx which is basically minus 3 million gp on the account and there we go firing yet another onyx we cut the zenite good and we make the zenite ring okay there it is and we've got it ring of suffering no way don't die i can't believe it i'm so damn lucky here and there is 88 two more to go for that tormented bracelet and there we have a 90 crafting we can now boost for five levels in order to make ourselves the bracelet of torment nice first boost and enchant it there we have the tormented bracelet this will be a huge help for zara and there it is 83 herb lore a very important level as this means we're now going to easily be able to boost and make ourselves anti-venoms for zara there we go the first kc yeah yes that is exactly what we needed 10 antidote plus pluses we just had run out of antivenoms too these kills man they're pretty damn fast probably because the msb oh and that is an interesting drop a torso seed 20 adamant bars and of course the elite clue scroll and what do we receive oh a top hat everything else was pretty much garbage but we got a top hat i was praying right it was on this day that peepee was stacked out by the goddamn little shits that indeed was a chance i was 33 hp and i got hit off prey by a range which can hit up to 41. so it was a pretty hard chance too i realized at this point i needed to make a change at this point i was only using flames of sami manually casting it which wasn't working because i was focusing too much on that and not prayer switching so i decided to go and get the void knife mace and also the guthix cape imbued so that i could get basically the same amount of damage but have to worry a lot less about the whole manually casting all right and there is gethicksonvuedcape and just to add to the collection there's the sarah dominion viewed cape and we just got enough points here to get the void knight mace there it is we can now auto cast claws of gothics and that is 100 kill count it had been quite a while but there's the second elite okay can we channel our inner tedious and get some third age no we can't there it is oh that's that's not what we wanted but it it can be used as our last onyx to make the last dynamite but we won't be going for that for a long time oh and as soon as we get that we get another elite clue scroll third age that's terrible and there is 90 magic another elitely scroll why would you look at that well we got the split bart legs and we also got a hard clue scroll to go along with it an elite and a hard what do we get uh not much there and yeah well i forgot to record it but we just hit 200 kc the journey continues well it doesn't get much closer than that i survived but on one single solitary hp zalra's absolute max was 41 damage and i was at 42 hp so while it technically wasn't a chance i could have very easily died if the snake link just hit one hp higher when it damaged me a couple of seconds prior to this i have decided at this point to take more tickets and also more food in general so that this doesn't happen again well i finally decided it's time to make an alcohol of these battle staffs that i currently have so let's finish this and there we have it a solid 2.6 mil from that at this point it was time to take a bit of a break because zara is all i've been doing for the past few days i had a community channel point reward on my twitch channel for doing song of the elves and the channel point reward was met so i got 70 construction my last requirement and i started song of the elves there we go after a very very long time we've got the puzzle finished there we go and we got him fragment of sarin dead and there it is song of the elves is done so this is the number one reason why i want to do song with the elves these divine super strength potions keep my strength level boosted all the way up to its max level for five minutes at a time this will be great for slayer because this means i will always be doing my best possible max hit at all times well unfortunately i wasn't able to catch the recording of this but i decided to do a little bit of thieving at the elves and within 100 pickpockets i already had gotten myself the enhanced crystal teleport seed and since i was wearing rogue's outfit i got two of them so i traded in one for 150 crystal shards and i should be able to make this unlimited teleport seed i just need to plus three boost for my smithing level to 80. and there we go and another elite blue scroll how cool is that the first elite clue after we finish song of the elves and we get a step in pristineness that's almost poetic we've been getting very lucky not that many wilderness steps recently this one pest control teleports nice and there's another 1 500 bloods i believe at this point i have spent 4 million gp on blood runes alone really hoping we get that drop soon oh my gosh it happened and it's a tanzanite fang oh my goodness yes well i gotta say getting a tanzanite fang this late in the kill count or going this dry has given me a nice pool of zola scales to work with however it will not take long for me to run out of those but there is the toxic blow pipe made we've already got a good amount of adamant darts to use it on probably going to use this for shamans i don't think i'll use it for wilty slayers i will be using a cannon and melee most most likely okay that's 5 000 adamant darts we fill her up there it is you cannot be serious how and we made it nice there should be casket here and it is what do we get press control teleports and the first task of many is dark warriors so a huge problem arises when uh when or if the engineer finds me on task he finds me on task i either have to skip the task or find a way around it oh there it is there's our first laryn's key of many there's the first task done there it is very nice there it is laryn's key number three oh learns key yes two larynx keys that's uh that's five laryn's keys now asking you shall receive [Music] and nice this is where you die goodbye hardcore peepee goodbye holy crap this guy is insane [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [ __ ] no no no no no no no oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my give me alchemy oh oh my god 21 hp this is just about as close as it could get i had no food left in my inventory whatsoever and i even got chance on the last ags whack even though i was praying melee it can hit up to a 30 so i was very lucky that it hit a zero also the combat level of c engineer's account was 105 combat while mine was 108. so once i got to level 2 wilderness i was all right and that saved me from another ags whack which could have killed me there were many many mistakes with the tank test itself and also my inventory as i was too lazy to go back and fill my entire inventory up with bruise which would have saved me a lot of heartache however i would say that this tank test has vastly improved from the tank test that i had back in episode 2. final point remains i'm still alive and we're ready to take on more wilderness layer if you'd like to see cc engineer's side of the perspective i'm sure his video will be coming out in a few days and the link to his channel will be in the description you can look forward to the next episode being a bare minimum of 100 larence keys so until next time stay high risk and oh i must be getting a call hello hello hardcore peepee are you there yeah i'm here who are you i don't have time to explain just listen i'm a hardcore iron man just like you but i play on pvp worlds see engineer lately he's been taking us out left and right we don't know if it's because of scouting or some special method but he knows where we are at all times you can't go for that second piece of dagon high he will kill you i don't have much time left but oh god no no no what the hell is going on what's happening you're next
