largest collaboration of history channels on YouTube today 17 other fantastic YouTube channels have released a video on this collaboration on naval history a playlist of which can be found in a link below after 24 years spent in the court of Kublai Khan in China an aged an immeasurably wealthy Marco Polo returns to his native homeland in Venice he finds the city's marshal banner raised at st. Mark's lion holding a sword instead of a Bible Venice is at war polo is captured by the enemy Genoa and from his prison cell he writes of his adventures in the Far East [Music] [Music] Italian history cannot be fully understood without talking about the maritime republics whose contribution to the economy and politics of the Italian peninsula was almost immeasurable chief among them were the megalithic trade rivals Genoa and Venice and here to help me talk a bit about this topic is blue from overly sarcastic productions say hi blue hey everyone and thank you James for having me on the channel although I have to ask where's my mouth no problem at all can't wait to get started and sweet Viennese pastries what happened to my arms blue we'll also be doing a video on Venice and how it became an unrivaled maritime power I think of I'm not really sure how I got here why is everything so colorful James I'm freaking out man please be sure to check out his video all about Phoenician history if you haven't already done so the city states of Italy were birthed by warfare the struggle between the Byzantines and the lombards for control of Italy meant that the coastal trade cities were left to fend for themselves more often than not building high walls to protect them from mainland armies and large navies to protect their trade networks from Muslim and Saracen pirates the Byzantines granted self-governing status to a Melfi Gaeta Venezia and Cunha and also eventually Ragusa while the Holy Roman Empire did the same for the cities of Geneva and Pisa war is not good for business so Overland trade routes were pretty much defunct at this point allowing for the growth and prosperity of the ocean-going trade routes you'll remember from the previous episode that warfare was so widespread that it even features in the founding Legend of Venice these cities were called republics because they elected their leaders such as the Doge a Italian foot Duke who was usually under large influence by the heiress to Craddock merchant families as time wore on two of these Republic's would come to dominate their rivals for trade on either side of the peninsula Genoa and Venice now Venice was of particular importance to Italy as this floating city water fortress became filthy rich with trade as well as with her exploits during the Crusades to the Holy Land but if you're wondering how this tiny speck of islands became so fabulously wealthy in the first place then we've got to talk about the unique brand of that Venice was famous for and it comes down to three main factors the first is geography as Venice and Genoa set up the far northern edge of the Mediterranean meaning they could get goods far into Europe without breaking the bank on slow expensive and dangerous Overland transit the added benefit to Venice here is that they were able to dominate the narrow Adriatic Sea whereas Genoa was just facing out into the open Mediterranean by controlling those waterways Venice took nearly half of Italy out of competition the second factor is trade partnerships as Venice and to a lesser extent Genoa too was tolerant and cooperative with merchants in the Muslim world even during the Crusades in addition to that since Venice was a direct offshoot of the Byzantine Empire the two were buddy-buddy from the very start Genoa also had these relationships but it always played second fiddle because it was smack in the middle of major European powers and all of the wars they fought with each other making Venice the safer option to bet on with regards to trade the last factor and the one that really puts it over the edge for Venice was their governments even though both cities were run by a republic generous economy operated through private merchants and banks whereas Venetian commerce was coordinated by the government itself but here's the kicker the Grand Council was overwhelmingly made up of merchants so when the state dictated travel itineraries and shipping manifests or subsidized the construction of a public merchant fleet it all worked because everyone knew what they needed to succeed and on a more individual level the government provided loans for up-and-coming merchants as well as commerce insurance it's honestly a little shocking how many modern sounding instruments of economics and trade were invented by the Venetians in the Middle Ages so if we look at the whole picture Genoa fell just short of Venice in the cases of geography and partnerships but on the subject of government the Venetians blue general right out of the water and every step Venice works together to achieve an unfathomable level of economic efficiency from this it's easy to see why these two cities are Rosa's the powerhouses they did and why Venice went on to become the unchallenged economic champion of the coming Renaissance hey thanks for your help blue anytime talking about all this venetian history helps justify those years of suffering in economics classes now if you'll excuse me I need to go find my arms later so why a Genoa in Venice so important to understanding Italian history firstly they became the economic powerhouse of the eastern and western Mediterranean respectively subsuming the influence of the other republics until they eventually were butting heads with each other they were also the go-to shipbuilders for Crusaders meaning they had a huge impact on the campaign's to the Holy Land only further expanding their influence the trade networks were so vast that it is thought that the Genoese trading station of kapha brought the Black Death to Europe and the rats that lived in the hulls of merchant ships Genoese bankers became the most elite in Europe and even became a pawn for the ambitions of other states for control over Italy including most famously the house of Aragon and France arguably the most famous Genoa was Christopher o Columbo a sailor and navigator who pioneered the use of a navigation technique called dead reckoning to try and find a Western route to India eventually discovering the new world previously unknown to Europeans Venice on the other hand had fared much better in the Middle Ages the Venetian merchants agreed to participate in the Fourth Crusade which ended up never reaching the Holy Land and getting disastrously involved in a Byzantine succession crisis but after not getting paid by the Baroque Byzantine Empire the Crusaders and Venetians sacked the city of Constantinople and divided the empire into a series of successor states with Venice being awarded many new colonies in the Aegean the continued presence in Greece allowed them to become the main connection between Europe and the Middle East which set up the highway for intellectual migration of ancient Greek humanism that would lead to the Renaissance these trade routes were largely kept open when Constantinople fell to the ottomans and the Italian city-states started taking in thousands of intellectual refugees from the formerly Roman territory these very important links would help birth the Enlightenment as Venetians establish connections with Persian and Arabic scholars and scientists something that was sorely lacking during the previous centuries of crusading zeal the growth of the Ottoman Empire eventually led to the Venetian monopoly on a lucrative spice trade in the Far East which would directly result in a stimulus for the Dutch Portuguese and Spanish to seek new routes to in and the accidental discovery of the new world between 1256 and 1381 the Genoese and the Venetians had fought four separate Wars for trade dominance usually involving the crumbling Byzantine Empire the dominance of these Republic's would eventually come to an end when the Atlantic powers basically put them out of business but also during the period of the 30 Years War and the Italian Wars which effectively destroyed mainland markets especially for Venice as said before war is not usually good for business Venice and Genoa would both be abolished during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars when they became dominated by the rising European powers of France and Austria in 1797 this video is part of Operation Odysseus and you can find a playlist link to blues video on overly sarcastic productions on screen now or you can keep on the
