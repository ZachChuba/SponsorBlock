now it's no secret that I fix it has been a longtime sponsor of our channel and we use their kids for all kinds of things from repairing phones to building computers - I mean I'm sure someone in this building has picked their nose with an eye fix-it kit that doesn't necessarily mean that an eye fix-it kit is the be-all and end-all of tool kits in fact some of you have suggested to us that you can actually build your own iFixit kit for much cheaper on Aliexpress so that is exactly what I tasked Anthony with this is what we're calling the eye Foxit kit we changed one vowel and we're gonna walk you guys through how it compares to the brand name iFixit kit for half the price mac use a fur coat tectus 22 get 20% off at the link below [Music] okay so let's start with what's in a typical iFixit protec toolkit you got a few of their astonishingly bendy like fried tools you've got one of their suction cups you've got an ESD wrist strap you've got some ESD safe tweezer like reverse tweezers you've got a couple of little grabber tweezer doodads you've got ah these are great so these are their sputters so these are Price lash poking tools you can use these to like pop off a Wi-Fi antenna or whatever else you've got this metal pry tool you've got there I forget what they call this something knife with Jimmy Jimmy yeah Jimmy tool and then you get their 64 bit driver kit which has the extension the driver handle and then a whole bunch of different bits that we've used to take apart everything from a Nintendo DS to a computer monitor pretty much you name it you can take it apart with one of these and a guide on ifixit.com but the thing is that none of this stuff is really that unique oh I miss the guitar picks which are literally guitar picks except blue with an eye fix-it logo on like you can get a lot of this functionality elsewhere so let's try to do just that Anthony hit me with what you found alright well the screwdriver kit is obviously the most important part for what most people would call the most important part and this here is the it's called Alouette the Alouette so you know what this actually reminds me a lot of the older iFixit kit so it's got these little rubbery bases that all of the bits go into like that it's got a really different looking extension and the driver itself is quite different from either revision of the iFixit but feels okay the rubberized grip is not bad this isn't metal this is plastic so it does feel a little less you know the quality but is this a ratchet I can't really tell I don't know this is you know you wanna keep yeah ah Oh interesting so there's a couple cool features of this guy then now this won't necessarily help you get into some of the tight spaces that I've had trouble right it's the iFixit kit because the way to it the only way to extend this one out of the box anyway is to take the hex driver that's just the same size as the as the Pitts and then you can get a little bit of extra length now one other thing that they actually removed that they used to have on the old iFixit driver is this hex hole through the top that you can use to jam something in it and then get a little bit more leverage if you if you don't have enough from the rubberized grip they removed that from this revision and that is something that I missed from the old one now the last thing that I'm not that pleased with is the variety of the bits here there's just not nearly as many bits and some of the really obscure ones like security Torx a--'s are simply not present so for those of you not familiar as security Torx has a hollowed out middle so that you can use it to remove security Torx screws all right so that's our screwdriver oh wait hold on I want to see if there's anything else interesting here three Torx is up here with the to try wings and then a like a Phillips a female Phillips with a hex on the end that's kind of interesting so you can use your screwdriver did something I guess there's one pentalobe bit that I can see the the springy thing here it actually works at the like very extreme angles so like you can actually do like 180 degrees here that looks like a much smoother action there much smoother or it's cross-compatible these use the same diameter I believe how handy so if you like certain components of a different cater you just needed a top-up of bits or whatever else yep alright so you're saying this is by far the most expensive part of our DIY kit how much is this yeah it was about twelve thirteen dollars oh that is called the Jake me I like this and I actually like that it's a little bit longer and doesn't taper quite as much it feels a little more sick in my hand so how much is it Jake me so Jake me costs two dollars and 42 cents us great value recommended cordless wrist strap be a bro wear an anti-static strap so basically as we conduct to the metal screw that's in the top through the resistor we will we will dissipate some static buildup I really wouldn't count on this though so the few things that I've seen that actually test these out ya show that is basically no different then if you're not wearing one so the iFixit spudger actually doesn't go quite so thin at the tip this one's a little worn but that's not the entire reason why it's so dull at the end so I'm gonna pick a spot okay got my spot and I'm gonna just bend it back hopefully without hurting myself so I can bend that back 90 degrees with my hands spudger same spot not a freaking chance like this I don't care how much it cost I wouldn't try something with this because I'd probably end up hurting myself you know I'm gonna give a pass to the screwdriver set because I think it's a great value it's not about fixes kit but so this is I fix it this is the off-brand one and in terms of strength I'd say not quite but the blade is a little thinner and there are times when that might have actually been handy for me it's nice that I get all these other options now I don't typically like to use metal tools for prying because you tend to leave marks in the casing of whatever it is you're trying to take apart but this curved one here it's got quite a lot of strength to it you can really get some leverage on that depending how much this whole kit is even if I hadn't I fix it kit I'd probably run out and grab one of these just for this guy and then these are there similarly bent ones you got a nice wide one here and then a more pointed but but wider like really strong tip here that you could really put some force on I really like these extra ones that come with it yeah so this one cost $3.75 u.s. for those strong strong recommendation for these ones by the way policies so I've got the iFixit ones in my right hand and I've got our off-brand I fix it in my left hand here and you can see that I fix it includes this sort of broader tweezer that I actually find myself using an awful lot just to pick up a screw that I have dropped that's non-ferrous or whatever the case may be but really my main criticism of the iFixit angled one is that the tip if you try to do any real grabbing or prying anything forceful with it they do Bend quite easily and so that's you know where these can really stand out to me yeah my I fix a kid at home I ended up breaking off the tip of the angled ones because they're a little bit you know less sturdy now it's not a direct replacement for a broader grippier like more of a grabber and I still want one of those in my tech tool kit but I'm liking these yeah these get a pass how much are they a dollar eighty one heck yeah next round let's go for these are suction cups these are garbage okay I actually had an off-brand suction cup I lost my eye fix that one that's from my kit a while back so I was using an off-brand one to try and pull this graph it unless you have a really good suck you you can't apply enough force to lift up the adhesive just for your reference though those suction cups were a dollar fifty five four fifty cool not even worth it as for the rest of the stuff in here first we've got our off-brand pry tool now these are really really impressive I absolutely love these I think they're one of the highlights of I fix its kit and this one is not now the handle itself seems fine but there is no way I'd be able to snap one of I fix its pry tools Bend yes break absolutely not these things are fantastic and this is no substitute I can't believe I forgot to talk about I fix its lifetime warranty though so if your spudger from them did this then they'll send you a new one and that's something that you won't get if you're ordering random stuff off Aliexpress so I think the conclusion then of this video is something I wasn't really expecting there's not a clear winner here what we do know is that piecing together your own electronics toolkit could yield actually better quality than what you get from I fix it at a similar or even better price but the other thing that we've discovered is that unless you can find lots or very reputable reviews all the things you're buying it's quite likely that even though you're paid half the price half of what you ordered or more might not actually be usable or of sufficient quality compared to what you're getting from the name-brand toolkit that's a real roll of the dice okay I was sort of expecting a more clear winner or loser but we don't have that so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video anyway you'll find links to where to buy all the stuff that we feature today in the video description but the only ones we're really recommending are the tweezers if you need that kind of tweezers the screwdriver kit if you don't need all the bits that are included with the iFixit kit these pride tools and the Jake me these ones I really like these are absolutely going in our workshop immediately today's link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the links in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one LTT store calm and our community forum which you should totally join we don't have shirts like that one anymore unfortunately unfortunately this old-school yeah did you just pick that up out of like the swag pile founded them like the walk the we were hosted something I thought you're gonna say in the washers I I originally was going to say the washer and I don't know why um quick question though yes if you could tell I fix it to copy any of this what would you say to copy this guy for sure a greater variety of prying tools in general is something I think they could improve on yep and it's not really any better here but a better suction cup is another thing that I'd really like to see them improve overall though I mean we've worked with them for a long time that's not an accident I've been using iFixit tools since before they were even a sponsor and I really I like their stuff because there's that consistency yeah whatever it is that I need to do I know that the tool they've included is good enough maybe it's not the best but it's definitely not just complete garbage the spotters are supposed to do that
