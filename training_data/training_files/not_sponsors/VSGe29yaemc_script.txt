hey guys what is up my name is Thomas Park welcome back to another video today we're talking about anonymous ways to pay for a VPN now when you're using a VPN a lot of people are looking for a nonentity basically they are looking for a way to hide their traffic for them ISP so they can't be snooped on they're looking to protect and hide their IP they're looking to stay anonymous while torrenting ie not send information to copyright troll companies so they get in trouble for torrenting or maybe even just to remain anonymous to Netflix so netflix can't tell where they are a lot of people are skeptics of the nomina t-that VPNs provide but as examples I just listed they do provide an immunity in certain ways or another so when you're paying for a VPN another way that you might want to be anonymous is not giving them your payment information in terms of credit cards and stuff like that so today I'm gonna be talking about the most anonymous ways to pay for a VPN provider and which ones could be the most anonymous anyways guys let's get into the video hey guys if you haven't back to the video links down in the description down below so guys let's go ahead and take a look on some sample options you may have when paying for a VPN provider now might operate a VPN on the channel is tor guard if you want to see why check out the full tour guard review if you use code Tom spark you can get 50% off at that subscription but today we're not talking about the price we're talking about the payment methods and so our guard VPN is just one of my favorite VPNs in terms of how you can pay for it that's because they give you a lot of options you do have some very convenient but not anon options like Amazon pay you could just connect this to you Amazon pay account and pay for tor guard pretty well you also have stuff like coin payments which is gonna give you options to pretty much pay with any cryptocurrency you have stuff like visa and debit cards and stuff like that as well now if you want to use debit card for tour guard there are kind of semi anonymous ways to do so you have stuff like privacy comm which is a website that doesn't really provide you an immunity from them since you're gonna have to connect your bank account in order to make cards but what the website does is it creates a non-unity between you and your account so basically what that means is you do not have to give every one of these websites your credit card this is very useful because you will very effectively pause delete and control the credit cards themselves since they are digital not only that but you do not have to provide your real billing information or information associated with your credit card so it's going to give you that a nominally there and that you do not have to provide real information whereas with a real credit card you have to provide specific information or the website will most likely to client due to fraud so there are semi anonymous ways to pay with traditional payment methods like visa and stuff like this but I want to talk more a little bit about some other methods like cryptocurrency like bitcoin and litecoin coin payments and stuff like gift cards as well now stuff like bitcoin and litecoin admittedly might not be truly anonymous in that the FBI and other spy agencies kind of kind of tracks Ann's actions around if they want to through the blockchain blockchain itself with Bitcoin stuff like that it's a public ledger so the entire idea behind it is not really an immunity but more full transparency which can sometimes be very useful when tracking payments and seeing where they're going Bitcoin it wasn't really necessarily designed to combat police forces and make them so they couldn't track money around if anything it was to fight decentralization and the power of banks and provide more trains pairen see on where money is going so it's not so much about privacy per se in terms of where money is going but more about the centralization of that you know money but however besides this bitcoin and litecoin we also have other options that you could find through coin payments which is kind of like a payment processing center for cryptocurrencies you have stuff like Manero which is very anonymous and it has various technologies that kind of hide payments and stuff like that so they're not kind of public you also have other things like like corn which are developing kind of anonymous ways to hide transactions and stuff like that like stuff like nimble Wimble and whatnot however I don't know if it's quite there is yet quite anonymous as mo narrow however we do have some other options like gift cards which might be a more easily read about easy way to provide anonymous payment options - you know these websites a lot of people who are purchasing VPN could be under 18 so sometimes it's hard to get access to cryptocurrency maybe they can't sign up for something like coinbase which in itself is not a very anonymous website since again you have to pretty much connect you know your real life information access to use that website um so what people can do instead if you want you can go to your local grocery store maybe you'll have like 20 bucks in cash you go to the checker and you buy let's say 20 bucks to Amazon or maybe to Walmart or some popular website or kind of company out there you get this credit card you go home and then you can pick this option on towards website as well as some other VPN providers I stuff I think stuff like private Internet access supports it not every VPN will so you can then use that gift card you bought and kind of trade that as a subscription for the VPN service effectively that means you would be buying the VPN with that $20 cash if you want to take it to the extra level I mean if you want to make it even more anonymous you can maybe wear sunglasses or some kind of mask which is definitely more socially acceptable right now during the pandemic this is a pretty good way to pay for VPN anonymously and you can even give an his payment or information when signing up you can make a fake email you can make a 10 minute burning email you could use some kind of private email if you want to on a website like toots and notes uh there are ways to sign up and pay anonymously and people who say you can't just aren't really considering all the different tools and tricks you can do so I do think that paying with a gift card is probably one of the easiest options one of the most anonymous options to pay for VPN but you do have some other options as well especially if you want to experiment with cryptocurrency stuff like Mon Aero is a good option as well however that said not all VPNs are equally anonymous in terms of how you can pay for them some upian providers like expressvpn are pretty big and very popular they do provide some options like Bitcoin and some other kind of like Eastern friendly options but they don't provide gift card as a way to kind of trade and get that VPN subscription so what do we learn today there are various ways on various levels of course of a non amenity you can use to buy a VPN provider you can use something like privacy comm which is primarily for US citizens but you can also use other services in the EU to make kind of digital credit cards these will let you hide your billing information and control the credit cards themselves more effectively you can also use crypto currencies like mon narrow if you want to buy anonymous VPN anonymously so if you're looking to get more narrow it's a little bit of a learning curve for sure you're gonna have to get some crypto currency probably Bitcoin and go to a website like Quimby Pro or something like buy Nance or be Nance however you want to call it you're gonna have to transform or shape-shift or just kind of trade I guess your Bitcoin in the Monaro once you have that one arrow on some kind of wallet you can then send it to the VPN itself it's a little bit more of a hassle I think but it's gonna arm an anonymous option you also have finally stuff like like I mentioned before the gift card option which i think is actually a pretty easy option the only downside is not every website accepts them I do think though tour guard VPN being the top-rated VPN on the channel that provides so many different payment options you're gonna be pretty much set depending on what throughout you want to go anyways guys let me know down the comments down below if you have any secret anonymous ways to pay for VPN and I'll see you again on the next video very soon
