[Music] uh oh yeah sure shout out to the guy who said i'd be going on like a 10 000 kill dry streak trying to get the next one yeah this one was for you everything i do is calculated you guys need to learn this are you [ __ ] kidding me what what is happening what is this ring of wealth it's [ __ ] spoon time baby how how and why i'm never getting a rare drop again i just used up enough ring of wealth rng charges for the next [ __ ] decade i am miserable 69 slayer baby three more skills left i think it's bird time there's 59 one more level please yes thank god and thank you bird this bird's like [ __ ] you man i don't want to catch dogs anymore i've just had these gold bars in the bank and i was saving them for when i was just at my lowest point and here i am clawing and scratching for any xp i can possibly get because all i'm about to do for the next seven years of my life is buy buckets of sand and soda ash from the charter people but i am having a great time and this is fun and also i cannot lie i'm incapable of lying so i've gone so long without grinding any runescape at all and grinding some of the most tedious skills in the game back to back to back to back i was not mentally prepared for this oh we got 70 crafting how do people make entire progress series doing just this kind of thing i don't know what even know what to do with myself when i have to commentate this last thing i got to do is unlock the gnome stronghold balloon transport system route so i need 60 fire making which i'm nine levels away from and then we'll be ready to start this thing up fire making the next runescape esport it would pop off dude trust me i think my favorite part about video hey what's up yeah i'm still here still fire making my fire making level was not 60 before but now it is as you can see on the screen i was gonna fix my armor but bob wants to put me in a debt i'm just gonna have him repair the essentials i'm so [ __ ] poor man i'm gonna be doing a lot of running so i'm just getting some mort meyer fungus no staminas for me just the good old-fashioned super energy bringing you twenty percent energy back since two thousand something five months of procrastination has come down to this moment right here and there we go we have completed all of the things on the task list for the quest we can officially start monkey madness 2 by release is back baby let's do this [Music] that was the last quest i needed until i was able to get my childhood go go go go [Music] [Music] [Music] a very high combat level would be beneficial uh we'll be fine i'm sure well it's been a while welcome everybody it is may 6 2016 and we're off to do quest 129 monkey madness 2. we are officially in old school runescape three years into it to be exact and this is the first quest ever released from the old school dev team and it's a big one we're back in gnome stronghold we're going to be talking a king narnode showing our face here for the first time in way too long i'll be surprised if he recognizes us there he is the legend himself good if he just stopped by a human i feel like human is a little derogatory given how much we've been through they locked gluff up after that stunt he pulled trying to frame the humans and start world war eight or however many there's been in this lore we stopped him and then they jailed him here in his apartment and he's gone and now it's my problem even after nine years all the npcs and factions in this game they all just still have no idea how to do anything control anything manage anything it's all me i do everything this is no different this is still what i do so let's go investigate this whole glove thing huh i'm gonna be looking for things and i'm gonna be stealing things find nothing perfect chest is locked i remember these putting the sticks on those trapdoor i can investigate the tree we're gonna do that i find a handkerchief this handkerchief has a a embroidered into it i'm gonna take a wild guess and say it means anita the girlfriend from the last quest we'll go talk to her and see uh why she owns one of these i don't know who owns handkerchiefs let alone embroids their initials on one or is that just like an 1800s thing and why am i down here and the ladder's broken i love this last time i was down here they thought some human was tampering with the branches destroying this entire tree it's gonna look really sketchy when i come up from the basement what are you doing down there i went down a ladder by accident that doesn't even make any sense oh my god he's already down here he still thinks i'm an idiot that has no idea what i'm doing so he's not suspicious at all and how is he up here already is this your handkerchief what a weird thing to walk up and say to anybody what's wrong it's glove i fear for the worst he might be seeing someone else probably he was about to start a world war i don't think he draws the line at cheating on you last time i helped you gluff lost his job what the [ __ ] did we not fill her in on anything she started climbing up to the top of gluff's house but her agility level isn't high enough don't worry i'll go see who he's cheating on you with ah here we go the secret top floor now i steal everything investigate candles apparently i think that investigating means palming a lit candle hello quiz guy yeah i'll do a quiz show right now i'm not busy always pick the mystery box this time i know what it does turn the statue clicking sound i find a book on spy tactics this entire book is basically telling me to squeeze lemon juice on a note put it over a fire and brush over it with grape juice to reveal hidden words since i found this note over here with this conveniently placed spy tactic book i'm gonna guess that gluff is in fact communicating with his friends through fourth grade science projects that made us feel like forensic investigators [ __ ] this treehouse is so stupid i just grinded the lemon up squeezed it all over the note i'm gonna try not to burn this paper i'm gonna crush the grapes up use the grape brush on the note to reveal everything and it is in the [ __ ] gnome language that i don't understand yeah i didn't keep that known translation book but king arnold has a spare copy so that's incredibly convenient for me so i'm trying to decipher this message i have the note pulled up going back and forth and i there's not many translations here there is like seven [ __ ] words in this book and none of them are on the note that is exactly what i'm telling the king actually he agrees that the translation book is incomplete yet he had a copy of it so whoever made this translation book made multiple copies of an incomplete translation book just finished the thing first and then make the copies and you'll never guess who wrote it hey anita just got done watching gluff [ __ ] a lot of gnome women can you translate these notes for me since you suck at making translation books thank you it took some persuading but the monk has finally shown me the route at dawn we head to dot dot dot you know it probably says exactly where they're headed to but anita didn't write that part and i don't really want to talk to her anymore so i'm just gonna go show the king so the gnome hot air balloon pilot was replaced le smith we're gonna talk to the replacement pilot and uh see what they know what happened to le smith they just told me i have to go speak to august this gnome knows nothing they just accepted their job didn't ask any questions so we're just gonna go to august august you're about to start [ __ ] wars why are you telling these gnomes how to fly anywhere they want why is he giving me the entire spiel about balloons have i actually not talked to him since i did in light of journey so i guess this le smith guy was begging and pleading to learn how to go to apatoul and august was like what no there's monkeys with swords there are you kidding me but they just begged until he told them so we've got problems we were foolish to allow him to stay here after dismissing him from the glider regiment you were foolish to let him stay alive what are you talking about what does it take to get the death penalty here i must hereby reassign you to apatoul well i guess it's time for some guerrilla warfare i gotta go uh-oh it's freaking monkey time we've arrived to apatoul and i am looking handsome i'm meeting up with our old pal garcour who is still in the same spot nearly a decade later he's got to be out of his mind at this point garcour has spent way too much time here doing reconnaissance to know absolutely nothing so i'm going to talk to king of guy to see if he feels like telling some random monkey all about his top secret diabolical plans i'm here to discuss military strategies ah what it didn't work that's crazy i guess all the monkey messengers are busy so he's entrusting me to go seek out a military commander named crook and let him know that he's supposed to be at a meeting right now garcoy isn't going to be too happy when i tell him about this what was that i said garcour isn't gonna be happy when i tell him about this oh garcour absolute genius he wants me to simply kill the commander cruck guy and get a grigri made so i can become crook very simple stuff good idea except it wasn't simple nor a good idea see we're about to go into crux dungeon if you take the monkey madness tunnels the underground pass and the light temple and blend them together into one big area of [ __ ] you get crux dungeon so we've got two options tank or agility no matter which option we choose to do all players have their own unique path for both of those options so it's essentially trial and error until you find which path is yours tanking will give us a long route lots of running past melee and range enemies lots of prayer potions lots of food for a crazy amount of time agility is the much shorter route confined to this area here but when i say shorter i mean shorter in theory you can fail obstacles both due to agility rng or finding out it is not your path every single rock you can hop on ledge you can hold on to and rope you can jump is failable all of which can reset the last five to ten minutes of your agility success when i first did this quest in 2017 i took the tank route because i had some really awesome gear and i had the ge at my disposal to get supplies whenever i needed to but i've got about eight prayer potions to my name right now and no stamina potions so today we're gonna be doing some agility i'm near the entrance of the city i've gotta find crook this monkey archer said kruck isn't here and he's been disappearing from his post a lot lately they don't know where he's been going or what he's been up to so we've gotta figure that one out oh there's some footprints here these have to be crooks because they have to be the tracks end here at this trapdoor it's time to get stably and mental [ __ ] my life well let's get going first up this thing i'm pretty sure i just step on like the smooth looking path yeah we're good this is easy our first jump okay so it's the first fork in the road so if it's not the path on the right and i try it i fall if it's not the path on the left i take like five damage so i'm gonna try the less shitty side first that's right we go north each of these little pillars is available by the way so these can easily bend me over at any point [Music] so i think this hole right here is our first checkpoint so if we fall we'll end up right at this spot [Music] which way do we go i'm thinking right right is good yeah oh no these are the mornings and ledges i hate these so much but we're the best so it doesn't matter how have i not failed an obstacle yet this is a good sign i like the way this is going for me i don't even think i'm going the right way i gotta go in this little crevice first because there's a key i need in there got it oh no that is a lot of stepping stones no god damn it what do i even pray here i thought there were rangers i don't see any rangers melee okay [ __ ] man we were doing so good we're so far back man damn it hold on kevin and seth want to watch me do this i'm gonna regret this but i'm gonna let them watch your chance of falling here is 63 i want you to open that door like you've never opened a door before wow i like to go up i like to go right that is up oh unfortunately that was the correct path is that bad this is definitely an annoying path because of these i kind of like it every one of those has a chance to fail yeah i'm deep laughing all of those [ __ ] paths suck i kind of want to fall here to know that this is not my path thank god we might want to pray i'm running so far back this is the path all the way to the beginning no it's not i can't wait to hear you i know where i'm gonna end up there's gonna be a metal door behind me yeah yeah you guys wanna watch soup do the cinnamon challenge from nine years ago yes put a pop-up in your video of soup doing the cinnamon challenge okay right now what's up man it's up put it away now it's gone now put it back up but put the part where he's like oh that was really easy uh you could do anything you want prove that you guys can too if you guys want to only if you want to dude i'm editing this not true okay i'm not having all this nonsense fine you don't have to do that but you actually should and you should also put it a third time but you should put like a really like [ __ ] up version of his face on the screen from that video i'm gonna make it over this rope and i think it's the next checkpoint yes i just need to not [ __ ] this up i'm the best yeah i think this little web right here is where the tanks would come in so i think that's the end of the agility route so we're actually almost there who are these [ __ ] yeah you can't jump over here can you see you later idiots funny what that literally is your path so like you have just gotten the longest possible path thanks man no way you love this [ __ ] quest i do you're gonna fall on this one there's a 96 chance how did you crunch those [ __ ] numbers it was very simple four percent holy [ __ ] you're insane this is it please yeah baby top 46 bar release moments number 37 that i geared up just to get to this spot safely not to fight crook i'm gonna go get different gear also what if i investigated this wall here so i don't have to do that again so i think i'm gonna arrange it because i heard you can do it like zilliana and just kind of run around and tag it so i'm going to try that well it's your video not mine why don't you believe in me put on another quest guy from sue do you think three prayer potions is gonna be enough no what more you're not gonna complete it so now man what are your stats right here yeah good luck buddy i think i can do it i have experience to back up my beliefs maybe you're just bad at the game i'm gonna try to arrange him if i go in there and he's a little too lunatic psycho crazy i'll come back and i'll get geared to flinch you're literally wasting your time right now whatever oh i'm trying it in your expert opinion look at jimmy's stats look at his inventory and you come to the conclusion that i did let me see the inventory i mean i haven't even set up my inventory yet you're [ __ ] [Music] i'm confident in me that's your first mistake where the [ __ ] did this idiot just take me uh-huh it's your boy uh-huh it's your boy dude i look like i'm walking to that beat uh-huh it's your boy uh-huh it's been a long time crook let's see what you got first we announce ourselves every hero has to do it and then we keep our distance not quite like that idiot i guess some distance on this guy you're in track in high school you got this man oh how's it feel kruck how does that feel those broad bolts actually be hidden i'm surprised yeah i'm actually really surprised that it's going this well oh wow yeah you're really surprised you should chug those shut my mouth holy [ __ ] this is actually working i let him touch you one time at least give him a real chance holy [ __ ] it's called being better you know jim you may as well face thank him at this point you have more than enough food it was funny it is pretty funny well let him be funny yeah what if i oh my god take your prayer off man you don't need that [ __ ] [ __ ] you you're good man and he's down good try croc all right i got his paw i gotta talk to the monkey child because he's gonna give me a grigri for free no i didn't bring the amulet monkey man is 2 is far from over and i have never had to split a quest into two episodes but there is so much left and i don't want to rush it and cram it all into one episode so i'll see you guys really soon with part two because now the quest actually starts [Music] you
