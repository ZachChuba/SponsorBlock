yo guys you'll never guess who this video sponsored by so the other day I was chatting with my friend and he was like yo dude you live downtown is still really dead or there's some businesses open now and I was like I don't know I said what do you mean you don't know you just look out the window and I was like no I'd get glare on my monitor and he just kind of stared at me thinking hey that's pretty smart it was at that point I knew I had to make this video and share my accumulated knowledge on the subject now when you first start working from home it's very important you set up an organized workspace so you can actually be productive which means you have to eliminate any potential distractions so only refresh the world ometer coronavirus stats once every 15 minutes limit yourself to just one sourdough recipe a day and absolutely no YouTube videos not to brag but I've managed to make it 3 months without relapsing the next thing you have to do is set yourself a strict morning schedule because there's not gonna be anyone else there to keep you accountable which is why I advocate for the following routine wake up at 9 a.m. you're at work so just remember that your motivation is gonna wane at some point and this can hit some people especially hard you might notice that your male co-workers have all stopped shaving and have resorted to cutting their own hair so make sure you show them support by subscribing to their Cooking Channel similarly you might notice your female co-workers have all adopted a perma bun and switch from full face makeup to 360 P video you might also not notice this because you only ever look at yourself a big change you have to get used to is that there isn't gonna be anything to talk about because office drama isn't gonna be what it used to be in fact the most interesting moments are gonna be when someone's cute dog walks by in the background or when Jessica from accounting gets new webcam and you're like wow nice quality is that 4k and she's like yeah I've been doing a lot of streaming on the side and you're like oh nice what's your twitch and she's like what's twitch now with everyone being cooped up at home and was so little going on it can be easy to lose purpose and fall into a downward spiral this is why it's important to balance the tedium of working from home with a fulfilling hobby I remember getting frustrated reading the news the other day and thinking these lockdown protesters are idiots they could save tens of thousands of lives if they just stayed inside but instead of getting angry I decided to go jogging for the first time now even if you've enjoyed your time working from home all good things must come to an end I'm of course talking about your marriage because never have people been realizing more that the only thing holding their relationship together was their time spent apart but not to worry because as we're opening up so too will we be opening up as single people emerge from their abodes starved for affection the homies can finally meet their animal crossing' GF in real life Sam gives you my switch back and dating will flourish with everyone getting drunk off one sip just keep in mind that with lonely people lowering their standards worldwide be sure to wear protection because this increases the odds further meanwhile employers have to make the hard decision of either bringing everyone back to the office because they weren't doing any work at home we're letting everyone work from home because they realize no one was doing any work at the office either if you do get to see your co-workers in person again you'll quickly figure out if they spend their stimulus on an ab roller on a breadmaker we're on options contracts for the sp500 nevertheless we can all hope things go back to normal sooner rather than later and the good news is that we're finally starting to outsmart the virus as you can see by the data you can't have a second wave if the first one never ends thankfully with the way this year has been shaping up there's a good chance we'll get distracted by something else in the meantime as an example where was this picture taken Australia Luhan Italy New York and to prove my point I had to go and rewrite this part of the video because now it's just Minnesota so long story short if there's anything 2020 has taught us it's that the best way to get over a small problem is to have a bigger problem so I'm not gonna sweat it by the way in case you're wondering this is just Armageddon from the Book of Revelations so this is where a smoothly
