this is me attempting to explain how the internet works before I started research for this video I think it has something to do with sending signals or information through the air maybe by electricity and pretty sure there's cables and phone lines maybe included in there somewhere not my proudest moment by any means but I thought it was so crazy that this thing that we use every day that takes up so much of our lives is still an enigma to a lot of us so here began my quest to understand the Internet it was an uphill battle at first it seemed so vast and daunting and I had no idea where to begin so I started where anyone would Google of course there was so much information to sift through and it was difficult to know where to start I went from web page to web page trying to get the overall gist of what the internet looks like in a big picture sense surely it didn't really look like there's messy glowing spider webs you always see such a complicated piece of technology must have some structure to it here are my findings the Internet allows every device that's connected to it to communicate with every other device that's connected to it this is usually represented as a big interconnected graph which spans the entire world so in this sense those glowing web pictures of rights but it does this through an extremely ordered hierarchical structure at the bottom of the hierarchy are your individual devices like your personal computers laptops and mobile phones these are all connected to a local area network which is a computer network that connects devices within a limited area this means you can communicate with other devices within your local area network without being connected to the Internet the local area network could just be all the devices within your home connector through your router the local area networks are then connected to the Internet service providers which are your local telephone or cable company these are organizations which provide access to the Internet at the moment in the diagram your computer is only connected to devices that are under your local or regional Internet service provider so then to connect to the rest of the world the Internet service providers are connected to the next link in the chain the network service providers these are basically at the top of the Internet hierarchy the network service providers connect to other network service providers all over the world and it's at this level that your device has access to any other online device across the globe this highest link is often referred to as the backbone of the internet because it's what makes global communication possible and is effectively the gateway between all devices so if I were to send a message to my friend Sophie in the UK it would have to travel from my computer to my home local area network then up to the internet service provider then to the network service provider where it would be transferred to another network service provider and then travel back down all the layers until it reached her computer so that's what the internet looks like but how does it actually work so there are two main components that make the internet possible the hardware and the protocols the hardware are your physical things like your computers your phones the wires that connect these things and the protocols are kind of the way that all of these things communicate with each other so the way I like to look at it is that the protocols are kind of like the language of the Internet and the hardware are the tools that allow you to execute the language so that's the big picture of you now it's time to get out our magnifying glasses and start zeroing in I had a bunch of directions I could go from here but I thought the best thing to explore would be the hardware as that's what I'm most familiar with and what I had access to around the house there were so many different pieces of hardware to consider modems routers Ethernet cables computers phones telephone wires how was I going to learn about all of them and how they worked one by one seriously it was too complicated to know how they all worked together without knowing what each one of them did it was like trying to read a sentence without knowing what any of the words meant it was like trying to cook lasagna without knowing each of the ingredients it was like trying to play a song without knowing what any of the notes were he get the idea so I googled football separately it was much easier to fit them all back together after that but the great thing about studying the hardware was that I actually had pieces around the house and so do you you're watching this video on the internet right now right so I went and tried to match what I'd read with what I could see let me show you what I learned so now we're going to investigate the home computer and see exactly how it connects to the Internet so this is it right here and if we open this guy we can take a peek inside and this here is called an network interface card and every computer needs one of these if it wants to connect to the Internet so the computer is connected to the loop local area network through this card which is connected to this cable here which is called an Ethernet cable so if we follow this guy we will get to where all the magic happens this box here which is the router okay I don't know if you can see it says router if my camera will focus no you so this box lets all the devices in the house connect to each other so at the moment it's connected to the computer by the Ethernet cable but it's connected to my iphone my iPad the printer all wirelessly but the router actually doesn't connect your devices to the Internet it just connects them to each other so to connect them to the Internet we need something called a modem so let's take a look is the modem well actually this is a modem as well it's a two-in-one a lot of the time modems and routers are sold as a single entity because you need both of them to connect to the internet and it makes sense that you would want multiple devices to all connect to the Internet so now how does the modem itself connect to the Internet well if we take a look at this wire here and follow it to here um this actually branches off to the phone line so the set up at your home might be slightly different it might branch off to your cable company or something like that but the idea is the same so the modem branches off through the phone line and goes to your internet service provider so then what happens when it gets to your internet service provider well this part is actually really interesting hundreds of thousands of miles of wires or wireless towers are laid throughout the world mostly underground and underwater they range from phone lines to fiber-optic cables to microwave towers single lines can spend thousands of miles like the underwater transatlantic communications cable that connects various parts of the US and Canada to Europe now that we've got a pretty good idea of the hardware and structure of the Internet it's time to look at the other main factor the protocols how exactly does my computer in Australia know how to get to Sophia's computer in the UK how did the text from this message travel through these wires why can't I just do this the answer is protocols you're probably familiar with the word protocol as a set of rules to ensure that things go smoothly every workplace has a different protocol for when there's a fire the protocol at my university was to blare the fire alarm really loudly while everybody sat around waiting for it to stop including the lecturer the protocol for sending a letter in the mail is to write who and where the letter is addressed to stamp it and send it off sometimes with a return address the internet protocols just ensure that all the communication between devices goes smoothly there are actually so many different protocols that make up the in because it's so huge and complicated so we're just going to focus on the two main big ones the transmission control protocol and the internet protocol the transmission control protocols job is to make sure that your message gets to the right application on the destination computer if you are sending an email it would make sure that it ended up in whatever email app you use most of the time the message you want to send is too big to be sent all at once so the transmission control protocol breaks the message up into fragments called packets it assigns each packet two pieces of information a port number which tells it which application it needs to go on the destination computer and the information of where it belongs relative to all the other packets so the message can be reassembled when it reaches its destination in a physical letter the port number would be kind of like when you write a single person's name on the letter so you know who it's for once it reaches the house the packets would be as if you cut the letter up into little more manageable pieces and the reassembly of information would be well the reassembly of information my best analogy I'll admit but when you send a letter you can't just track the person's name on it and expect it to reach them you need to write their address this is where the Internet Protocol comes in when the transmission control protocol is finished splitting your message into packets and assigning them all port numbers it passes it over to the internet protocol the internet protocols job is to make sure all the packets get to the right destination computer but how does it know which computer to send it to out of all the computers in the world well how does the delivery system know which house to deliver your mail to every house has a unique address and likewise every device connected to the Internet has a unique address this is called an IP address and it looks something like this the device you're using to watch this video has a unique IP address the Internet Protocol encodes both the destination computers and the source computer's IP address on each packet so now that each packet has the address of its destination computer and what app it needs to get to its converted from alphabetic text into electrical signals to be sent through the phone line here it starts its long journey through the internet I often get taken by this org slash up and Assam link is in the description I hope you enjoyed the video are there any other things that you feel like you interact with on a daily basis but you have no idea how they work if there are let me know in the comments until next time bye [Music]
