this video is sponsored by audible hi say I want to talk a little bit about hand hygiene why we do it how it came about and should you do it so while working at a maternity clinic in Austria in 1847 Semmelweis introduced hand washing with the chlorinated lime solutions for interns who had performed autopsies this decreased the occurrence of pure peril fever from about roughly ten percent to one to two percent in the early eighteen hundred's diseases were just attributed to various different or unrelated causes including something they called me asthma which they just said that it was just something in the air that was causing the diseases so Cemil vices hypothesis that the diseases were being caused by not being clean was considered extreme at the time and was pretty much rejected due to his ideas he was fired from the hospital and harassed by the medical community in Vienna which unfortunately made the poor old boy go a bit mad some of Isis ideas were finally accepted only years after his death when her favorite Mike Ramon Louie Pasteur developed the germ theory of disease which gave a theoretical explanation for some of Isis findings but pastor was not the first to propose the germ theory but his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that Oh is true the germ theory of disease is the current accepted scientific theory of disease it basically just states that diseases are caused by microorganisms but Pastores main field of research was in fermentation and he showed that the growth of microorganisms was responsible for spoiling beer wine and milk from this discovery he invented a process where liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100 degrees which kills most bacteria and moles already present he painted the process in 1865 for the application of wine and the method became known as pasteurization and was soon applied to beer and milk too this all led Pastore to the idea that microorganisms could infect other organisms and cause disease but he wasn't the first to propose this idea so many intelligent people had similar theories including an Italian shop known as deer Alamo Frank Castro who in 1546 proposed that diseases were caused by tiny particles or spores that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact or without contact at all he wrote an essay called this in 1546 about his theory of infection a theory that was influential for nearly three centuries before being superseded by our fully developed germ theory also quick fun fact the name for syphilis is derived from from Castro's epic poem which was in three books called syphilis SIV morbus galakras which was about a shepherd boy named syphilis who insulted Greek god Apollo and was punished by Apollo with a horrible disease anyways let's come back to slightly more recent times pastors work was later extended by Robert a German physician and microbiologist he discovered the causative agent for anthrax and then went on to identify the causative agent for TB which he then won a Nobel Prize for in Physiology and medicine in 1905 and then he went on to work on cholera cause you know he's just a beast there is another great man I'd like to give a shout out to and that is Joseph Lister it was a British surgeon who was around in the 18 / 1900 s using Pastores research he promoted the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic which became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery despite the work of Semmelweis and others hospitals practice surgery at the time under unsanitary conditions and took pride in the stains on the unwashed operating gowns as a display of their experience gross so while Lister was a professor he read about some of pastors work and he confirmed pasteurize ideas and findings with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds to experiment with this Lister applied a piece of lens dipped in carbolic acid solution onto the wound of a seven-year-old boy who had sustained a compound fracture after a cartwheel had passed over his leg that actually sounds quite comical I didn't I didn't so after four days he discovered that no infection had developed and after six weeks the boy's bones had fused back together without getting you know fussy and gross his findings are published in The Lancet in 1867 and then after that he tried spraying instruments the surgical incisions and dressings and wounds with a solution of carbolic acid and he found that a reduced incidence of gangrene and in 1868 he published a paper in the PMG on his findings so after that he instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wash their hands before and after operations with 5% carbolic acid solutions instruments were also washed in the same an assistant sprayed the solution in the operating theater won her there's additional suggestions was to stop using pores natural materials and the manufacturing of handles of instrument of medical instruments and things improved from there also fun fact on top of that he also developed a method of repairing kneecaps with metal wire and he improved the technique for mastectomies and Listerine antiseptic which was first developed as a surgical antiseptic but nowadays is known as a mouthwash was named after him and also Listeria a bacterium that causes food poisoning was also named after the chap so at this point we know that germs can cause disease and we know that being clean can prevent diseases so what's with all the controversy there seems to be a viewpoint recently that having bad hygiene will make you healthier in the long run because it will boost your immune system by exposing you to more germs this saw process is wrong completely wrong although it can be traced back to a kind of principle that's true so vaccines work on the principle that if you expose your immune system to a certain germ it will learn to recognize and build up an immunity against that germ that lasts for years I think that that thought process therefore arose from the idea that having bad hygiene is like giving yourself many vaccines and will boost your immune system making you healthier in the long run this isn't quite how it works getting sick from warm germ a microbe on your unwashed hands will only boost your immunity against a specific germ but there are thousands perhaps millions of different types of infections terms the common cold alone can be caused by over 200 different viruses to become immune to the common cold you would have to get sick 200 times with each different strain of the virus even after doing that you would still be not protected because Durham's are constantly evolving when your body becomes immune to that certain germ it is only developing immunity to that version that has infected you later versions of the same germ may have evolved into a different enough organism that your immune system is not able to recognize it and that is why you get or should get a new flu shot every year but again flu shots can only do so much as a can protect you against all strains of the virus as it's constantly evolving into new strains vaccines consist of germs that have been altered to provoke the desired immune boost without giving you the disease in comparison germs on your unwashed hands have not to create a vaccine scientists take a germ and alter it so that is weakened in one way or another when the altered germ is injected into a patient its molecular shape is learned and remembered by your immune system through the production of antigen specific antibodies but because the germ has been rendered non-toxic the patient reaps the benefits of immunity without actually getting the disease in contrast the germs on your unwashed hands are fully active unable to cause disease you may develop immunity to a particular hand borne pathogen but you may also die trying so if you want to a free book go to audible.com for
