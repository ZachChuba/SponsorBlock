hello this is chef john from food wishes
comma with tuna noodle casserole that's right i'm gonna show how to make
what I consider the king of the comfort food casseroles now counting mac and
cheese of course and what I love about this recipe besides that it's simple and
easy is that it doesn't require the traditional can of cream of mushroom
soup but don't worry despite the fact we're
not using any processed food in this we're not gonna make it too healthy and
this will still have the appropriate amount of creamy decadent goodness like
every casserole should so with that let's go ahead and get started by
saut√©ing some onions in some butter set over medium heat along with of course
the traditional big pinch of salt and what we'll do is cook these stearing for
about 3 or 4 minutes or until they just start to soften up and turn translucent
and no we normally don't use a whisk here but since we're gonna be adding
milk and eventually whisking this into a sauce a whisk does make sense and then
what we'll do once we feel like those onions have sauteed enough is go ahead
and stir in some flour to create a roux ro UX which as may know is a paste
made from butter and flour used to thicken a sauce and we'll want to cook
that stirring for about three minutes or so just to take the raw edge off the
flour and we are still on medium heat but if think need to turn it
down just a little go ahead since we really don't want this mixture browning
and take it out a lot of color so adjust that flame down if need be okay that's
just cooking and then what we'll do once our onion earu is cook for about
three minutes or so is go ahead and pour in all our milk and no not gradually
while whisking and that's because our roux is hot and our milk was very cold
and as you've probably heard me say many times before cold milk hot roux no lumps
which means we can just dump it all in and then start whisking and you'll see
by the time this comes up to a simmer and fully thickens it will be
beautifully smooth and lump free or your money back
oh and speaking of bringing this up to a simmer once we add the milk we want to
crank this up to medium-high and we will cook it while stirring often until it
comes up to a simmer and generally when you're working with a roux based sauce
it will be as thick as it's gonna get once it starts to simmer which is what I
was looking at right here and as soon as that happens what we'll
do is turn off the heat and whisk in some shredded white cheddar cheese
alright maybe something a little bit on the mild side but of course as dealer's
choice and that's it with the heat off we'll just stir that in and believe it
or not our very simple white sauce is done
and we'll simply reserve that until needed and move on to our ignorance
which for the hundred and fifteen year in a row has won the award for most
beautiful noodle thanks to their beautiful sunny golden color and what we
need to do is boil those and some generously salted water for 5 minutes or
1 minute under whatever the cooking directions on the package are and then
what we'll do once those are almost cooked is drain them very very well and
we'll transfer those into a nice big mixing bowl and we will transfer in our
still very hot sauce and we'll give all that a quick mix before we add the rest
of our ingredients oh and the reason that sauce was still hot is because
we're pretty good at multitasking so we had our water coming up to a boil while
we made our sauce and then what we'll do once we've given that a quick mix let's
go ahead and add our tuna which for me was three five and a half ounce cans of
tuna packed in olive oil that I crumbled up and yes that is kind of a lot you
could probably do this with two cans but I'm on that new high carb high protein
diet so I went up with three and then we'll follow that up with a cup of green
peas which were previously frozen but then thawed and very well drained and
then we'll finish this up by seasoning with some salt as well as a few shakes
of the cayenne and a nice big pinch of freshly ground black pepper
and then last but not least a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and then we'll
give that one final thorough mixing and if that mixture looks a little too thin
to it's not okay if your mixture is thick now by the time bake it it's
gonna be way way too thick so I really do think we want to start out with
something that looks like this and then once that set we'll go ahead and
transfer that into a buttered baking dish your standard nine by 13 inch
casserole dish to be exact and once that set we are down to one optional but
mandatory component and that would be making our crumb topping which for me
will feature some bread crumbs a whole bunch of freshly grated parmesan
plus a couple tablespoons of olive oil or melted butter okay whatever you're
into and we'll take a spoon and give that a mix and we'll keep mixing until
it sort of looks like wet sand and once that's been mixed we'll go ahead and
dump that on top and spread that over nice and evenly and I'm using bread
crumbs here because they usually have those around and I usually don't have
potato chips around but if do crushed up potato chip crumbs might just
make for the best topping for this but anyway decide I mean guys are
after all the Sally Bowles of your casseroles and since life is a cabaret
get to use whatever want but no matter what use once those are
spread over I like to poke them down just a little bit with the side of the
spoon and that's it our tuna noodle casserole is now ready to transfer into
the center of a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes or so or until the top
is beautifully golden brown and we can see a little bit of bubbling going on
around the edge and that's it we should probably let that sit and rest for about
10 minutes before grabbing a spatula and cutting out a nice square and just to
make me feel a little bit better promise me you'll have this with some
kind of green salad on the side but anyway we'll serve that up whoops I lost
a noodle don't worry I got it and then once we have that plated up I like to
garnish this with absolutely nothing okay just grab a fork and dig in to what
I think is just an absolutely incredible profoundly comforting and very very
satisfying casserole okay it's kind of decadent without being too heavy and
because our sauce wasn't too thick when we put this together I think the texture
on this is just right and speaking to texture having all those crispy cheesy
crumbs on the top doesn't hurt but anyway that's it
my very basic straightforward take on the tuna noodle casserole and earlier I
said this was the king of the comfort food casseroles
except for maybe mac and cheese but know what if give me a choice
between the two I'm gonna pick this one every time right basically this is mac
and cheese with benefits which is why I really do hope give this a try soon
