platform to build a beautiful online presence guys if you're like me you avoid debates like the plague it's just not worth it especially considering our current political alignment like suppose someone says something you disagree with shocker for a conservative that might be something like this I'm voting Democrat because we need a return to civility or perhaps you're more of a lefty you might be triggered by this I'm voting Republican because so you've just heard something devastating something you absolutely disagree with you may want to debate confront stand up for what's right right make sure that your truth is heard but the question is what cost like even if you wanted to defend your position someone could bring up some fact or statistic you've never heard of that could completely destroy your point of view 80% we were really thinking 80% I thought it was a lot lower than that though right no it's 80% and that must have been marked as fake news on Facebook by the suck no no it's real news okay when I based every single part of my life on that I thought it was 2% but I got to go Google I just destroyed his entire world he really games or on the flip side you can come across too headstrong and potentially hurt someone's feelings I don't know the problem is then you have to worry for the rest of your friendship that you made things weird hi oh hi are we are we good yeah as far as I know okay never should have said what I said two years ago it's like 80% eight zero actually I think it's like only like 2% okay all right yeah let's let's check this out yeah see right just 2% whatever whatever me and I really like that friendship but what if I told you I've discovered a workaround it's a movement I'm starting a movement designed to ensure that you never ever lose another debate ever again my fellow Americans I asked you to join me today in solidarity we will not be silenced and we will not listen to criticism because those who criticize us do the exact same thing that we're being accused of that's right this is the YouTube movement and the way it works is very simple if someone is critical of something you believe in figure out some way that that they're being hypocritical you do I know this is complex stuff so so let me explain further suppose someone is criticizing a politician you support how can you support someone who uses such angry rhetoric whatever happened to civility oh you're gonna get this guy real good can you believe this guy up on his high horse like his side doesn't do the exact same thing come give me a break time to hashtag you to this clown Oh hate to break it to you but I've actually seen you tweet in support of a candidate who also uses angry rhetoric I guess it's not so bad after all right oh shut up well done well done look here's the hard truth maybe the person you're talking to has a point maybe they're even right but that's the beauty of hashtag you do because at the point that you've proven their hypocrite it doesn't matter what do you think all that matters is that they're wrong - well you didn't care about this stuff when immigrants were in power but now all the sudden you have moral Libya well when Democrats were in power you hated what they did but now it's fine when the Republicans do it uh-oh you're many what the Democrats did was wrong oh so you're admitting that it's wrong what the Republicans are doing now huh oh right one more important thing hashtag you to works best when only one side utilizes it if both sides join the movement it kind of becomes a mess the rhetoric good day it becomes very uncivilized look we're not gonna agree anymore okay those days are gone fairly well so you may not win anyone over but you could still win and winning is all that matters really and if anyone tells you otherwise and just remind them of a time when they want and felt really good about it that's called winning at proving that winning is a win guys the of a website or domain that squarespace.com slash cow ad I thought it was a lot lower than that nope it's 80 percent III base everything I believe on this one value do not take it what article disprove it was it was it labeled fake was it labeled fake by the suck well we in time who've been labeled thickness by the suck dude oh so you're immune Oh
