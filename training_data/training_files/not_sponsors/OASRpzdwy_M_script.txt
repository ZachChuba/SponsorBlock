you really don't want to be there you really don't want to be there you really don't want to be there trust me today is a day where we lie to our friends and that is about it that is about what we do sorry for the interruption but recently i realized a large percentage of my viewers aren't actually subscribed i know there's a good portion of you guys that are but if you enjoy the content and want to see more of it it helped me a lot if you could just check i'm so yeah i'm super excited for that like you guys have no idea you guys have no idea all right i'm making sure i'm muted good um i'm just gonna go to o2 tree nope nope we'll do water wheels nobody goes to o2 so i'm like maybe [Music] i i've killed steve twice and i'm [ __ ] please i was dead first that doesn't make sense wait that doesn't make sense though okay so this is this is what happened right he was on garbage here set the scene as i crossed by here not amy go on wait wait file do you see the body no i left steve at garbage shoe and now he's dead okay i'm guessing he's dead at dead uh death valley node this is what i see steve literally died i would shoot last week he's not in death he's not he's not death he's not in death valley no because that's where i'm heading and i don't have the report option okay i left him but you're headed there too well no i left steve at garbage shoe and then i'm walking out of o2 to death.ally why are you going to death valley because i'm doing the weather node okay i'm so [ __ ] peter you haven't no no no no i i'm so confused okay i i finished upload i finished upload i finish upload as i'm walking out i see five up uh walk up towards death valley node and then i see i see report button flash and i double back to uh report um i'm like let me see i could see weapons on my right and like uh water wheels on my left so i'm pretty sure the bodies in death valley where else would it be because like as soon as i got closer to o2 the report button disappeared so are you guys accusing each other oh no i mean i don't know i'm kind of confused where this body is start death valley uh because i didn't i've been pre-running to what's it called electric chlorine there you go yeah i mean i just did it this time uh peter i saw steve so he entered o2 went on the garbage truck as i was leaving who did steve the first the thing that confuses me is that uh when i got closer into o2 the report button disappeared all right we salvaged it we salvaged it a little bit i guess um uh [Music] what if i just go here um maybe weapons nope well now i can guard the body no amy you really don't want to be there you really don't want to be there you really don't want to be there trust me right taking out the brains so all we've got is bronze eh tina you have neither so uh okay let me just can we take one second i know we're on a time clock but i figured out how to get out of the office and then i found a body and i couldn't find how to report it yes and i thought i was gonna get accused because i was standing next to the body for so long before i was able to record it wait where was it or was it just as you get out of that office area into the wide open finally i was free and then i saw the body so dk was just chilling on medbay scan so left side or right side yeah it's on the left side or right side of office uh as you go out of the right side of office and it all opens up it was just like by the like the lava yes like yeah okay okay uh someone is an o2 with me right now that was true okay i'm touching you touching dude i swear to god i'm just watching i just don't see you spotty was this whose body was this sorry half of it i get it i'm so forgettable for you peter i get it man i saw nobody say to you yeah do we know what dk's what you was a question oh no i'll ask you a question you know i scanned first and then i saw he did the walk after so i know dk was clear but we you were in you were the closest to us really you were in repair yeah yeah yeah i went over to med bay to see because i thought you were a little moving a little bit sassy sus so i went just to check on med bay obviously dk was chilling there live and then i'm on the way down to specimen um and you're the only person i left there though so okay peter for the previous round the body 100 was not in death valley because i was heading up there and i didn't have the option i guess for me i'm just [ __ ] confused because when i went deeper into o2 the report button disappeared so like i don't know where else the body would be yeah i had to double back towards that where you were yeah you're making me nervous which is why i'm trying to think about it [Music] i'm gaslighting him so hard no for peter i am gaslighting about beyond belief okay this is there please please watch out oh this is this is the second body you walk away from this is the second body up this is the second body walking away from oh okay this is tina's body this is tina's body wait you saw five up twice walk away okay okay so this might okay sleepy where are you i'm uh the node in the bottom left of the map that was a really groundbreaking answer i guess below everyone's like okay um i'm inspect i'm not sure if there was any like desync there me and peter were on bottom deacon time originally that you saw you just disappeared so no yeah i i i was didn't want to go into school here's what i did all right i did you do i did o2 canisters with thea and then i walked out five up give me a name you think it's theo um no because thea do you think it's me uh i mean do you think it's me self-reporting twice it's me well i know it's not thea so because the united garbage are not garbage we did um the o2 cancers and then she walked a garbage chew as i was walking out and the lights went off and then i was gonna head up five up is saying it's not via this is between five i've been sleepy for me then um the thing is i don't think well you don't know where the body is do you well why last round whenever the body was on the right side of the map body wasn't over yeah i mean the thing is i think it's always obviously the last one is right by trash information that i withheld from last round wait body was found near lava and i saw five up running into lab like on cam's i i don't know if you like him from la la i fixed the lights i fixed the lights on that and then randall abs wait where's the body uh uh this body is uh right beneath trash you know two five of the last person i saw walking that's why i'm confused yeah like i know it's not you what that's what i confused i'm confused yeah just what that's what i'm saying i think it's a self report because i'm voting i'm gonna vote peter oh god i don't please please just button and vote f5 up after because you got this wrong [Music] i don't think i necessarily think she will uh they're taking a little bit of time to fix this so i kind of just kill them well this is interesting this is a weird round what a weird round this one is what a bizarre one [Music] you like three i gave you i gave you my hats we did it though i didn't know i don't know what to do like i literally okay i'm just i'm a lying [ __ ] i guess i'm sorry i was with you till the end peter even though you didn't believe in me i believed in peter i killed and then walked into you twice i believe that you at the end because like you were in weapons i saw you walk out of weapons and like why would you do that so that's why that's why i believed you and whatever yeah they played already well that was a really good report that was a really good summer for me yeah no no it was the other imposter but it yeah i mean i was yeah can you protect my other impossibility i don't know who five of people i warned you guys i said when you told her about self-report it was going to be our own device good luck good luck everyone good luck so many doubters the back-to-back wrestlers let's go i like this i like this a lot yeah so today we played amongst the professional wrestlers this is how it went oh this is yeah on the node right outside of storage i walked by here but i don't know who was with her someone was on top of her yeah i i'm pretty sure i did that note and i saw her and i left okay so i mean yeah i think this is a bit of a cheeky self-report it's a bit of a cheeky self-report it might be a cheeky word for i don't think i'm killed here if it's off cooldown okay i don't think this is sleepy i wish i could say the same thing a little bit closer to your mic but i don't know because you guys closer to my mic again can you press your lips against it just give it a second this is what you [Laughter] why tina i don't know i i was i just saw her i remember using orange so i mean i i should be suspended yeah i'm in lab i saw ellen we both walked towards um lab at the same time he's i've been doing the drill or whatever and i'm getting a telescope dk where are you like between cams in the light like in the hallway going under uh amy where are you uh straight down from where we where they dropped me off all right i'm sorry tina i'm sorry i guess that wasn't a good i thought that was a really good self report but apparently it wasn't i thought it was a really good play but i might have been wrong people have developed trusted issues with me it is not good oh god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] this isn't good i can't help but feel like this is you five up um again is that no twitter what exactly did you do yeah it's in water wheels uh i did the o2 canisters and then i did the damage and then i walked out i'm just about to go there i'm so confused all i know is uh five up was just leaving o2 i walk inside do trash and then i walk down to water wheels and uh i can't say that there's ellen was in there also [Music] the door was already open and then i thea ran past me and that but that was the only person i saw in this round okay well can't beat them you guys have seen so i don't think it's you guys um peter where were you i'm currently in lab right now i could see the entrance into the node switch thing inside of lab boring sleepy where are you that's the rage i mean this is between five up myself and ellen yeah yeah yeah yeah ellen didn't just walk in because i saw him after i finished my stuff like that's not it what did you finish in there me i told you two characters and a download you did the download and tree mm-hmm i did the tree and that's where you saw each other in tree well i saw him passing like above the thing so i don't remember seeing fireball myself but i mean like i'm also part sometimes blind in these situations so little europeans well let's just remember this for later you guys one of the killers has to be between five up and ellen so yeah well it could be you as well could be a cheeky little did make a comment where she was surprised that ellen was able to see her so it was possible that we his imposter vision got exposed shut up stop it don't pervert shame you [ __ ] sorry brother so you think uh are you one of the imposters peter yes and are you backing up or backing up also yes i mean i also think finally i also think finally might be one so i didn't get a report but that's what i'm curious today is a day where we lie to our friends and that is about it that is about what we do oh amy hopefully sleepy goes right here ideally i want sleepy to go up here um so sleepy's hiding in storage we know that one um that's probably not good hey i saved the game um thea is for sure one wait for sure oh yeah you just you just walked away from buddy oh and where i just came out of decontamin there's no body in there which way which do you can well d contaminants oh um no like i when i came out there was nothing there ellen is in spec so i just yeah i'm in stress yeah unless he killed behind me there's literally no way i could have done that well i mean i i literally came straight down i i've the thing i'm confused about is that i literally just walked past you and then reported popped up wow falling or was it like downloading well the thing okay to be fair i didn't actually i didn't actually i didn't actually see the body so um well there's one between thea and peter i think amy is good so elm is just always one but we knew this from the previous round too no i'm not i'm not listening because you're in special you're also close to it as well like unless you're falling behind not killed kind of close not really though like i literally went straight down to space so like i know we both did yeah like i was already in there i did the one two three four five tasks and then i was leaving i saw you and i left and i passed peter but that was it i mean i think this has to be thea here i i can't see who else it could be like you literally yeah just from the way from the paul thing peter said well i mean uh it's literally j uh do you think i'm self-reporting no but i think alan was just always imposter and i'm a little bit worried i preferred about but at the same time like i had passed amy yes all right no am i stupid yes yes the back to back with the wrestlers we did it i like how a five-up can just kill in front of you guys and walk away dude i only connected it on the end like walking away from my body every time he it's not even a good kill he literally with like two crew in the room and you guys are like oh i haven't run on him he killed me self-reported yeah i thought it was a self-reporter i don't believe it's too hard because i saw you and i walked away and then he he killed you hafu and then walked out of the room and then stevie just left it's because he uses the meta against us because we think there's no way he could do a kill that bad there's no i can't believe this let's talk my way out of it you're gonna have to start like sabotaging his reputation in your mind he can't keep getting away with it you're bad five up i believe imposter one in this lobby wasn't nice [Music] you
