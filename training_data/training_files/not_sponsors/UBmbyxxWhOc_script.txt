[Applause] [Music] time to go see Buddha [Applause] [Applause] [Music] we just arrived to buddha eden which is a crazy sculpture park I think it's about an hour and a half north of Lisbon and we're gonna shoot a real film today on my Canon a1 I think it's fuji superior iso is 200 on there we're gonna get started we're gonna walk around take pictures there's like beautiful sculptures everywhere it's really peaceful here and the Sun is still shining and that's really nice in this exact moment two things went wrong first dana opened an old roll of photos by accident thereby destroying all the undeveloped negatives and to make matters worse our video camera stopped recording audio for the next hour of footage the last film photos are particularly heartbreaking because dana shot portraits of all our friends in lisbon so a month's worth of images just disappeared in an instant it's one of those mistakes every film photographer makes once and then hopefully never again moments like these are part of learning to shoot film but it's equally possible for your hard drives to get corrupted or your website to crash which the link below if you're interested [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] blue yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] oh man nope no more so this time I'm gonna wind it while Dana winds up her room offer good to get 10% off your first purchase that was really fun time to head home and good thing our home is just in the parking lot
