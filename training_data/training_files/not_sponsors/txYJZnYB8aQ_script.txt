[Music] hello everybody my name is jensen and welcome to old school runescape challenges episode number 154. greatly greatly help me and dave out now moving on into the challenge this is the money smuggle challenge david now brunt the chieftain and relica wanted to meet for a quick meeting dave he did indeed he said to us that he is owed 40 million gp from the duke in lumbridge duke her crasher hush the [ __ ] duke jen yeah the duke here brunt told us that we need to transfer 20 million gp each from lumbridge all the way back to him in relica why does the juco the chieftain 40 million gp bomb stuff they definitely do bomb stuff the main thing to note here dave is that this will be done on a pvp world which adds a layer of danger they do call me danger dave good because there will also be multiple hunters dotted around the world actively hunting us for this gp we have on us hello the only rules for the hunters are they can't attack us in lumbridge and they can't attack us when we enter relica sounds good to me we'll have an hour to smuggle as much of our 20 million gp as possible and the person who managed to smuggle the most money to relica will win you also don't necessarily have to transfer all 20 million gp at once you can do it in small batches might work better for you sounds good but wait there's more before the hour starts you can use as much of your 20 million gp as you like to buy food tank gear and anything you think will help you smuggle the money but the more you spend the less money you can smuggle which could be a downfall so choose wisely are we allowed to teleport good question david no teleporting is allowed during the hour only to return to lumbridge once you've smuggled money into relica however you can use alternate transport eg ships canoes you name it ready to smuggle let's [ __ ] right lads so in terms of my strategy i have gone for the budget cheap approach i don't want to be spending a lot of the 20 mil because i've got a feeling that we're going to die a lot so regardless of the gear i think we are going to struggle uh for that case right i've got about 17 mil i'll do the examiner now so i've got the official total 70 and a half a mil i've got to to transfer i've literally gone for diy at the end of the day what's the worst they can do they'll chuck a few ballistas at me probably they'll chuck a few uh barrages at me the ads good enough as long as i get my praise right i'm sound got a bit of torah in there as well for for any range or melee action couple brews some nice food some extras just in case i die uh also a nice little tour girl as you do i've got a rune axe in there because i want to use the canoes so that's an option and as an extra uh this might be a waste of money but i just thought it's a fun item to have i've got the ring of stone which turns you into stone mental i know and i might just use that a couple times just to kind of throw people off it might be quite a fun item to use so boys i'm gonna go to lumbridge now seven and a half mil let's see what we can do with that ladies and gentlemen boys and girls here we have my setup pirate some smuggler you know what i mean black d-eyed ancient stuff di shield if we go over here we've got a mage defense bonus of 121. not too much on the rest but not my set bonus as for the year the money we've got 19.4 million left of our initial 20 mil light work should be alright with that um and then in the in here four teleports along bridge for when we actually get there i don't really know how much to go for we may have to try and stop by the ge at some point to buy more parts but this is what we've gone for obviously we're gonna bank it and uh we've got a little loophole so obviously me and jen can not teleport that is a rule the way i'm thinking is if we're out in the open we're gonna die if we've got nowhere to teleport to or nowhere to hide like we're gonna die we're just gonna have people on us right i found a loophole some of you might think it's against the rules i think it's clever ring of life technically i am not teleporting myself but if i am about to die this is going to teleport me to ardy right hello we're there a little bit of a last minute change we've uh we've gone for some amethyst arrows and we are gonna buy last i thought i feel like i am capable of doing so many pk and i really am confident in the fact that i reckon i could probably anti-pk someone dragon dagger magic short bow you know what i mean i keep forgetting like we can keep three items so i'm just gonna go with the torah because it's sick right ladies and gents we've got 19 million in 7k this is what we've gone for boom boom crossbow dds one mil to start with let's see what guans all right boys we've gone for 1500k the timer has started i'm buzzing for this boys there's gonna be so many man them i'm trying to figure out where to go though right we're gonna take the glider um we're gonna glide it over my thought process is if i run most away i'm going to avoid a lot of people so if i can glider over to the tree i can then walk manually over to the lighthouse go through the lighthouse and go through relics the back way because i've got a feeling the hunters are going to be guarding the pathway from camelot um all the way to relica because they know that's the end spot we're off we're away we've got one mill in the kitty and just to be different i'm going to go to this side i'm hoping i'll run into someone because i'll be able to anti-pk and i'll smuggle their loot to the lag as well let's have a little nosy here then birth up that's that's good one there go go over the tower that'd be good i should have brought all my money i should have done it in one this is high pressure this is high octane pressure i'm just gonna just gonna walk slowly they're not they're not gonna think of this way like the thing is as well the hunters have had time to think through their strategy and where to place people so oh boys no one's going to find me look at me go down the back alleyways i think dave might have bought the bull walk that's what i'm thinking as well also i know what dave's like dave thinks he's got pk he's not he's absolute garbage i think he's going to try and epk and i think that's a bad thing to do all you're going to do by trying to any pk people first of all it's a waste of time you're wasting time where you should be getting money on that relic table another point to make if one person sees one of us they will all cluster to where we're at so uh he'd be stupid to do something like that right i'm pretty sure no one's gonna have come to lighthouse i can almost almost surprise [ __ ] run run run don't catch their freeze don't scratch don't catch their freeze don't catch the freeze this is easy this is fine he's got a dog bow run run run run run i've just got a gap i've just got a gap more gaps than a year at school he's fine he's got [ __ ] gear he's got [ __ ] yeah i can do this all day i can dance with you all day buddy i can sit here all day boom have some of that sunshine there's loads of trees there this is fine there's trees right there's an entrance over there so the idea is we do a backdoor entrance here lads jen's recruited a lot of [ __ ] stupid hunters that's the stuff that's the thing right they they think i'm gonna walk through the main entrance are they dumb [ __ ] he's got tracking [ __ ] claws he's got dragon claws i want to fight back but i can't right now oh [ __ ] i threw this back off i threw a speck off no one's opening still no one's helping him are they on gin then oh no oh no no no no no no no no no no boom one mil in the kitty all right i've lost them i've lost them i'm going to go round around the edge so yeah so as long as i try and avoid the main path as much as oh where we can go pray nice is that hallie what are you doing this is fine this is fine i've got gap on him there's lots of trees i've got enough food just like that boys it's easy it's easy oh well that he's getting bj'd see you later mate boom okay we're a bit confident we are a bit confident so we're going to bump it up to 2.5 mil right now the tricky thing here listen up listen up here's the tricky thing i'll let you all in a little secret now they're gonna expect me to do the exact same thing or at least try to get through the side so i ideally need to do is potentially possibly maybe enter through this side here hey up oh my god oh i thought it was like a war going on but then i remembered the [ __ ] wilderness don't get updated sorry where the [ __ ] am i lying on the wrong way see i'm secretly clever right they will think dave's not stupid enough to be lost on the the white wolf mountain hello right i've got three mil this time i'm risking it i'm pushing the boat out there a little bit more i'm gonna try go for um the same route i'm hoping they won't be there now i'm hoping they might have switched over to david to worry about dave they obviously have no idea where i am hickton remember getting 99 my first 99. oh what a day what a day fun fact for you all when i got 80 fletcher and i printed it out and stuck it to my wall so it's my first 80 skill [ __ ] built different right they're not gonna be here again are they right let's just let's let's blend in quickly before we jump let's blend in quick oh do you know what i mean like i'm just not as if mean hunted oh my [ __ ] god just let just choose let me cross oh [ __ ] does he notice me [ __ ] no oh my god there's no way i've been duped into the same thing catch me once shame on you catch me twice in the same [ __ ] rocks shame on [ __ ] me oh my god fly don't let fly on me do not let fly around me oh dave's here with me they don't even have anyone waiting they just all committed to [ __ ] i can get attacked in here good way lads oh [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm going for it more hunters in world of warcraft boys get dave dave's last steve's god oh my god oh my god i nearly killed him oh my god i nearly killed him i nearly killed him he's panicking dude he's got him on the ropes they've got him on the ropes go go go they're not going to catch up with me they've all they've sacrificed all the most that most the resources are area one of them can easily yep there it is they can easily just do a home teleport teleport to relica and i'm in this right situation as i mean now this is not good i've now got a cow following me they're taking turns on me it's like a pawn up scene go and have your way with me lads go on good work team don't hit me they're all on gender committed jen [ __ ] off dave good good work team get on dave think the juggalos lose them in the trees fly they're committed to jen jen's pissed them off and i've run straight through i'm away here oh you are oh my god you are joking me through the trees jensen through the trees oh yeah of course they catch their freeze lads i'm telling you now this is not this is no bueno this is not a bueno situation to be in boom 2.5 mil secured i can i can i i've got like no food i've got some brews left there's the dds eat there i'm through here this is me i'm gone the walls are running the walls are pj'ing please please yes i'm quite confident with the performance there i'll go for another 2.5 because i feel like i'm doing quite well we're safer in long beach the only problem is if suga's a lockout then uh he'll literally say dave's in folly and they're all gonna come follow me and just [ __ ] send me i can't lose him boys go this way we i need to stay as far away from the teleport spot as possible look at him trying to put me off here we go right he's caught he's caught i can't get rid of him boys get rid of him okay he's gonna be right behind me but i have a plan on my sleeve and it is a very big sleeve he won't expect me to go in the wilderness i don't think i don't think anyone else will expect me to go in the wilderness just gotta get okay no purple thought no purple part okay right the scene dave seems to have clicked onto the lighthouse roo also served the hunters so i'm gonna have to try and switch this up a little bit should i use the canoe right let's canoe over to edgeville edgeville use the tree um who is this guy waldo well i [ __ ] found him in the wacker [Music] right let's take the shortcut avoid the this was a bad idea but you know what i've got a pair of [ __ ] cajones on me we're going to travel to the rd right now we're in rd what we'll do is we'll run around the back past the rangers guild pass flax fields and we'll go up to relica that way i've gone for the three mil again just to play it safe we're not quite on like the last stages we're about halfway through at this point so i'm still playing it quite safe at the moment shrek and the hunters would see me if i was here do you reckon they would i don't think they would you know you see i don't think they're going to expect the simple strat just running up cammy the thing is they've got a lot of people count around the lighthouse so i'm hoping they don't anticipate this if we manage to deliver this as well that's seven and a half mil we've got 10 mil left we can deliver so uh with the time we've got left we can easily split up into two or three chunks if you want as long as we keep getting past them but i've got a feeling sooner or later we're going to get to a point where they might um they might just get some lucky specs off go on can you get all these [ __ ] i think we're about half an hour in i'm already halfway through my time and i've always done three and a half mil i've been playing slow and steady since the start i know i've got a feeling i got a feeling i may have to switch that up jim i died though are we in business where the [ __ ] am i can i get over here i don't know lads i'm a bit i'm a bit stuck here i think there's only one way i can go don't [ __ ] swap me cobb [ __ ] it we just gotta go for it last we gotta go for it we don't have a choice we just got a tank okay okay call your [ __ ] buddies do what you want thing is right if you fight back you'll [ __ ] panic won't we give him something think about and then he won't know what to do he'll get flustered look he just had to eat and he wasted a waste of time and then dave loses him with the [ __ ] treat [ __ ] think about this think about this brittle line of sight lovely work there dave lovely work there dave keep going keep going you are the smuggler [ __ ] youtube [ __ ] [ __ ] youtubers [ __ ] i've not seen a single man i've not seen a single man jen's toying with him jen's toying with him boom they surely must be on dave they must all be on dave and they've left one person to defend and they've just they've just not been able to hold down the fort brunt three milli that 7.5 million you've got now sunshine right lads we've got six million coins we have done a grand total of seven and a half mil take 12 12 gp so if we secure this that's 30 and a half mil we've probably got time for another two runs i'm thinking the only problem is these are my early staminas left so i'm gonna have to go to ge and buy some staminas now i think if i make this six mil i'm just gonna do the remaining one thing jenna's not thought of is fighting back if they're on you and you're hitting them back they're not just focusing on killing you okay i've got myself in a bit of a predicament i need to lose this man there he is following me lose him in the crowd steve lose him in the crowds losing the crowds losing him in the crowds ready for this lads he ready for this [ __ ] unreal he's gonna teleport edgeville he's gonna be waiting this side and he's gonna think i'm gonna run into him and i'm not i'm running [ __ ] south boys mind games come on dave you just don't see it cause we lost both of them is this man clever enough to realize that i ran south and then into bear thought is he gonna think that right isn't in the rules right but i've got some entangle runes so i'm gonna try find dave i'm gonna try like entangle him so i can if it if me and dave are running there right there's no one quite on ours and we're both next to each other if i just shook an entangle in that can completely [ __ ] him over completely we're also going for the five mil now which means if we manage to deliver this that means we've only got another five mil to go the time is getting a little bit edgy we've not got that long left but i should be able to do it providing there's no little upsets on the way i'm kind of [ __ ] myself is the is the three spots of food worth it really do you know what i mean ah yes right prey we're good here thank you we're good here tank and we're fine he splashed it he splashed it i am the tan man that man is my name i like climbing mountains that's all i've mastered beatboxing the little zip tie yeah put your hands together so again you know what i mean he's just gonna do anything am i just good or am i just i'd i'd love to know how jen's doing there's jen there's jen she didn't get anyone on him wait come on jeffy we've gone under the right aria you're [ __ ] joking i didn't even know you could go i thought you had to follow the track come on jen i've gotta follow him i'm gonna follow him oh my god there's dave there's dave you ready just [ __ ] entangled me that's a mistake that's a [ __ ] mistake i'm him wait what is going on here wait i've got six mil on me i can't afford to be doing this a single combat so i shoot jen they can't attack me straight through the front [ __ ] door boys straight through the front [ __ ] door see you later mate if someone comes and kills him six mil there you go chief wait i could potentially have just done myself if jen's finished and they're just going to target me now right lads i've got 5507k left if i do this i've done all my money this is the final one i think jen's done i could be wrong but i think jenny's done bit annoying i could have done all this in one trip man i think we go the same way again the top right's been working very well for me though maybe i'll just stick with our so dave what have you been doing uh 24 years old you know in your free time well basically i've been running from uh one position to another multiple times on the game the secret path call this dear the dirt track actually on that sign over there as a actually there's a name it's called jen's mum in jen's mom's dirt track what am i on about what am i doing i'm going through the main entrance i'm actually going to go for the main entrance confidence brills through me i am walking into relica do something he's even look at them all oh jordan look at them all your [ __ ] [ __ ] lads your [ __ ] right lads we are now done with the hour of smuggling our gp across david fine it was all right um a bit shaky stop or after that plain sailing i thought that he was it i went away where i thought no one would find me and then straight away there's two people so i kind of [ __ ] my pants a little bit but he's right in the end right dave so i won't support the amount of gp you managed to smuggle in the hour now i mean obviously if you've died that's kind of [ __ ] it for you but it's going to massively depend on how much you overcompensated or how much you spent on gear that's going to massively affect how much money you could have smuggled out of the 20 mil you know what i mean so yeah you ready dave yeah i'm gonna do the countdown three two one go oh how have you spent two and a half mil on a gear setup well have you spent tuna [Laughter] i'd give you the win just for that sick that's actually sick well i used it did you of course a [ __ ] news day it's a mill that's like that's that's too clever for us that's class clever that's it that's [ __ ] clever with it that's actually funny yeah that's good that that's good i usually wear a pirate because i was you know why i went you know why i went i did that i thought you were going to overcompensate for the guess or i thought you're going to buy a bull walk or something like that i i was going to see so and then you should you didn't say we could sell it back so i i literally declined as soon as you said that i went for this i went for this instead after you said that the thing is i got caught in quite a few tight situations and if i didn't have the gear i had for example then i would have probably been dead so i'm glad i got it but at the same time i think the ring kind of [ __ ] me yeah see that's me yeah yeah jenny you know you know what you you should have done you know what actually i think saved me what fighting back mate see i said you'd fight back but i said that it was a stupid move because it wastes time if you're sat there fighting not a stupid move jen because if you fight back you get them panicking because they wouldn't they won't protect they weren't expecting a dds big dds they panic gives you time to run off ladies and gents since i lost the video i'll be doing a forfeit now i've let dave decide what forfeit i'm doing um david why are we at the dual arena well jen the reason i've told you to meet me the old dollar arena is uh 20 mil a lot of money's involved i figured you know why not just go for the obvious route 20 mill stake yes so if i win am i giving you the money as well no you're not because last time i did this i got abuse you might not even win so you know what if you win it you keep it all oh beautiful god then god dad all right come on jenna come on jenna oh i can see him he's in the corner what the [ __ ] is that in his hand oh my god he's got a mace
