website or online store make it with Squarespace the Stanford band for example is a bit unorthodox technically they're not even a marching band they're more of a satyr band with their members running and screaming out onto the field in various formations and while they do play music it's not the center of their performance that's reserved for the humorous themes around their formation college football prides itself on tradition the first college game ever played was in 1869 and right up there with the history and the pregame rituals is the university's marching band some of the best bands in the country are actually quite entertaining to watch the uniformity the visuals it can all be quite the spectacle and it is a nice way to fill the halftime slot then there Stanford's band now the Stanford band has been silenced KPIX 5 Jessica Flores explains how some members are fighting back against a ban by the University Stanford's band is truly one of a kind some of their outlandish ideas have really rubbed people the wrong way and they're no stranger to being in trouble in 1986 some members allegedly urinated on Washington's field during a game which later led to suspensions in 1991 versus Notre Dame a band member dressed as a nun and conducted using a crucifix as the baton which also led to suspensions in 1994 some of the band members skipped rehearsal to go play outside of OJ Simpson's trial members later drove a white Ford Bronco around with bloody handprints while Stanford was playing USC because it was OJ's former school whether the making fun of Mormons at BYU taking jabs at farmers when Iowa played Stanford in the Rose Bowl or openly mocking residents of Texas at the Alamo Bowl in 2017 you get the point they've been doing these types of things throughout their history and it doesn't look like they're going to stop anytime soon but nothing compares to what happened in 1982 Stanford versus Cal they call it the big game should come as no surprise but we have a sellout here at Memorial Stadium 76,000 they're the two biggest football schools in Northern California it was the final regular-season game both teams weren't great but that's the magic of rivalries if you beat them at least you get those bragging rights for a season there was 53 seconds left in the fourth quarter Stanford was down by two points with the ball but they were all the way back on their own 13 yard line they'd put themselves in a do-or-die situation if Stanford loses it'll be the last game John Elway ever plays for them fool for the Hey which back they went way down twinkers being properly with eight seconds to go morning Stanford somehow did it Elway just let a miraculous drive with only four seconds left Stanford's about to walk away victorious they just got a kick it short play it safe and make the tackle [Music] deep trouble [Music] no decision yet everybody's filming around [Applause] [Music] total pandemonium let me show you the insanity of this last play after the second lateral this was the most critical part of the play five dudes surrounded number 42 once he got rid of it it turned into a major advantage for cow now this guy just blindly tossed the ball back and luckily his teammate happened to be there it just makes me wonder what's going through these players heads when they look up and notice the sea of red that's pretty much blocking off the goal line this raises a very obvious question why was Stanford's banned even on the field the ban was already at ground level just behind the end zone and they planned on playing a song and walking on the field the very moment the game ended going back to the third lateral you can see that this dude put his arms up in celebration this seemed to be enough to trigger the band to rush out on the field and begin playing Stanford alum claims that there was either a forward lateral or one of these players knees was down before he pitched the ball wait a minute it actually does look like his knee may be down here a few days later The Daily Californian which was cows college newsletter revealed this story the NC double-a was apparently awarding the game to Stanford they decided to take away that crazy touchdown at the end cow students were in shock how could they possibly reverse the decision of who won the game it had been three whole days turns out students who wrote for the Stanford daily had published a fake version of Cal student newspaper they had distributed over 7,000 copies across cow's campus just one year later Stanford's head coach Paul Wiggin was fired after going 1 in 10 apparently the play had a big effect on the program according to Wiggin some people did blame the band and on top of that their former athletic director took a shot at them later on saying quote it was typical that they would have been in the wrong place at the wrong time for the next few years stamp band members had it pretty rough but let's be real no one had it worse than the dude who got ran over in the end zone he was completely blindsided so I gotta shout out to Squarespace for sponsoring this video I'll see you guys next time [Music] [Applause] [Music]
