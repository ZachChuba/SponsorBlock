platform to build a beautiful online presence guys I think maybe there are only two kinds of people at this point type one those who get caught up in the anger and outrage of the Internet these are people who get angry about stuff online all day long I for one am shocked by the controversy that has arisen over the last two hours it's even more shocking than the controversy that was from yesterday and it's the most shocked I've been since last Tuesday's controversy which was for my money one of the most shocking outrageous in months and it's also the people who get angry at the people getting angry about stupid stuff everyone just inside of this anger bubble people getting angry all the time over the dumbest stuff honestly it's kind of an outrage if you think about it it makes me mad every single day hey you why don't you get out of your parents basement and do something with your life I will never ever be lectured to by a troll fool stop Lord grant me the grace and patience for those who tweet . on ironically okay so that's type one and then there's type two the rest of us and we're all just sort of like I want no part of this I just let me know when everything has calmed down I firmly believe that most people in this world are the second type of person God please I hope it's true they're scared of what they see online they say people constantly arguing on Facebook or they see a really alarming tweet getting retweeted a lot of times how is it retweeted that many times am I the only sane one left should I be hiding in a bunker somewhere swell know that maybe everything's okay I mean it's not but it at the same time I have to tell myself it is because guys the Internet it's not real I mean it is real but at the same time it's not let me explain what I say the Internet is not real what I mean is you can't just live online and stop existing in the real world but you can disconnect from the internet didn't still live a relatively normal life at least for now anyways we need to turn back while we can like in the same way that a TV show is real but also not real it might somewhat reflect life in to a degree but it's still just it's a fake version of it that someone wants you to see so the big news no she's not pregnant we're getting a puppy I was supposed to say that no I thought you were gonna say no I was gonna say this is my channel you never know this is my channel I I need to say it everybody's expecting me to say hey guys are the big news so you might get online and feel inundated with horrifying people and you and you think oh my gosh this is just this is what society is now but I would humbly suggest it's something you might call a vocal minority and it's something that we in the entrepreneurial space call a niche niche it's the idea that you don't need a lot of customers to make a business work you just need a few people that are really really passionate so for example if I sold t-shirts with you know pictures of goats in funny hats I might actually do this I don't need millions of people into this idea I just need to select a few people who would love goat snacks here's the point of this example you wouldn't look at how well my goat business is doing and think oh my god she's making so much moola everyone must love goats in funny hats no my success does not reflect society as a whole it only reflects the really few strange people who are dedicated to goats and funny hats and the same goes for social media the people yelling and screaming on social media all day that's all of them it's not like there's more of them who would like you'd be yelling and screaming if it was easier to do it social media is this this place imaginable to do this to rejoice everyone is here and that's that's really my point people do and say things online that they would never do or say in person oh I was sending you a treat you know it it doesn't really translate into reality well I think the emotional weight of what I have to say to you is best felt with the written word and in solitude so send in real life you you don't dig into someone's past trying to find something bad they did once so you can spread it far and wide in real life we call those people gossips and busybodies and nobody likes them so why do they have power on the Internet why I don't know I don't know I'm just asking the question really think about it has life really changed much outside of the internet I mean aside from the fact that anytime there's a lull in the conversation you start to gingerly reach for your pocket and grab your security blanket and also your phone which is in your other pocket and why is that because social media is designed to keep you engaged these social media companies they're either stupid or they're really evil and they might be both they don't care if it's good or bad they want to keep you engaged or keep you angry or keep you scared because that keeps you engaged it's not healthy dude I got on Twitter this morning what my job is terrifying I didn't even say the bad part yeah no you definitely have how did you get manipulated by the algorithm fist outraged sensationalism clickbait social media knows that people have to click to see the the trainwreck more twisted in this way and the internet exploit sit let me tell you I don't watch NASCAR but I will tell you right now if there is a car wreck no I'm not gonna watch it so help me Gordon Jeff Gordon look guys the internet cried you think about it it's a great place it doesn't have to be like this so let's take the good parts of the internet communication friendship knowledge the ability to make a living doing just about anything and let's let's leave the bad stuff the anger the yelling the algorithms I don't know how those work but they seem bad all the things that lack compassion and empathy and the next time you get scared because you see a bunch of angry people on the Internet I guess just be nice to them God knows they probably need it stay [Music] sooo the big news is that we've bought a piano and I'm gonna learn how to play I'm super excited ok no no no you didn't know he never listened I'm doing it now and then
