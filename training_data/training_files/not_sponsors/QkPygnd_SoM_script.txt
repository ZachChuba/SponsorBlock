video [Music] beyond video [Music] original [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh how's your mental health been if you like me have struggled with feeling low lately you're not alone over half of all americans say that their mental health is suffered due to the pandemic and as the weather gets colder and the days get shorter many of you may be feeling especially down but sometimes a mood change with the seasons it's not just an ordinary shift it could be a particular kind of depression known as seasonal affective disorder or sad man the psychologists are making dad jokes with their acronyms now also known colloquially as seasonal depression or winter blues seasonal affective disorder is a mood disorder that starts and ends at more or less the same time every year if you're like most people with sad then your symptoms begin in the fall and they continue through winter although there are some folks who experience seasonal depression that starts in the spring or summer though that is much less common now seasonal affective disorder is technically not a formal diagnosis in the dsm which is the diagnostic tool that american therapists use instead it's labeled under major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern and that makes sense because it shares a lot of the same symptoms as non-seasonal depression like having low mood or feelings of hopelessness or feeling lethargic or fatigued all the time or a loss of interest or pleasure in activities even suicidal thoughts but there are some symptoms that are more characteristic of the seasonal pattern like sleeping way more than usual and a craving for carbohydrates which leads to overeating which leads to weight gain of course most of us probably feel a little bit down and eat a few more carbs than we should during the winter season but seasonal affective disorder is different in terms of its intensity and persistence it gets in the way of normal functioning and it sticks around for a really long time symptoms typically last around five months and subside only when there's a change in the season so for winter pattern depression you might start feeling bad around october or november and then feel better around march or april and of course in order to get diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder you need at least two years of that season to identify a pattern but isn't this strange why do so many people feel depressed only during winter there must be something more to it than just dreading the holiday party with your second cousin twice removed we think part of the problem is light see during those colder months you're probably getting less light exposure on a daily basis because you spend more time indoors and because the sun spends less time in the sky and although that seems like a small change in the environment it can have a huge impact on your biology see a decrease in sunlight can impact your circadian rhythm which is essentially your body's internal clock i don't know about you but my mood changes pretty drastically when it's only 4 pm and the sun is already setting or when i wake up in the dark i just i don't feel that great compared to when i wake up to a bright sunny day so this decrease in sunlight can really throw us off and lead to feelings of depression also darkness and low light can trigger the production of a hormone called melatonin you may have taken a melatonin pill as a sleep aid because well it makes you sleepy melatonin regulates our sleep wake cycles so when the body starts producing more melatonin we feel tired and our mood may change to reflect that feeling additionally exposure to sunlight is thought to increase the secretion of a different hormone called serotonin so serotonin is the neurotransmitter that boosts mood and helps a person feel calm and focused so it's thought that without enough sun exposure your serotonin levels can dip making you more prone to depressive symptoms that said there's not really enough evidence to support this claim and vitamin d falls into this camp too vitamin d is called the sunshine vitamin because the body produces it after exposure to sunlight some research has indicated that you know if you don't have enough of it that may make you a higher risk for sad but more evidence is needed at this time regardless it seems like more sun equals less sad and in fact we can see measurable differences in the percentage of people suffering from seasonal affective disorder based on how close they are to the equator so people living in places like florida or southern california have seasonal depression rates at around 1.5 percent but in alaska or finland where they have fewer hours of daylight in the winter rates jump up to 9.5 but don't worry you won't need to move to ecuador to get rid of your seasonal depression and even though your symptoms will go away eventually when the season changes that doesn't mean that you need to wait for months and months until spring finally hits either instead you could check out light therapy which involves sitting in front of a light therapy box for at least 20 minutes a day now this isn't just your average light bulb these boxes emit a very bright light that mimics natural outdoor light without any uv rays it's surprisingly effective most folks report improvements within about a week or two of treatment if you don't want to buy a fancy light you could achieve more or less similar results by increasing your time outdoors in the sun or even adjusting your workspace to spend more time in front of a sunny window and if you're looking for more support talk therapy and antidepressant medications like ssris have been shown to effectively treat seasonal affective disorder as well beyond this just do all the things that you know that you should be doing but maybe aren't so get regular exercise and eat healthy meals and stay active maybe even try learning a new skill you know like me you could you can learn how to speak french mind i know that i'll be spending a lot more time indoors this winter and with the pandemic ongoing public health officials predict that people who have never experienced seasonal affective disorder may start to have some of these feelings this year due to increased stress and changes in our lifestyle that keep us inside so take care of yourself get some sunlight reach out if you need help maybe learn something new if you feel up to it until next time [Music]
