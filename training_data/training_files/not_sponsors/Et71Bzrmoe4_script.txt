I’ve been doing study videos for years but
not all the tips I mention are equally effective so here are my top ten study tips that have
always worked perfectly for me. 1. Simplifying notes: I learned this way too
late in life, but simplifying notes not only makes them more effective in how they structure
relevant information and key points, but the act of using less complex means to write notes
boosts your attention in class, allows you to write more and summarize as you go. I have a full video on how I now take simplified
notes. I’ve been using this method for almost one
year and I never had batches of notes as good as these. **(clips do video simplifying notes)** 2. Making study guides for dummies: a study guide
is a life saver before an exam, but a study guide for dummies is even better. These are notes that only you are going to
read. Simplifying the language, inserting obvious
references and ridiculous examples will improve memory retention and create connections between
concepts that otherwise would be too obscure to explain. I like to have one document per topic to individualise
different segments of lectured material and then go through them during revision. **(study guide video)** 3. Finding a study buddy: a study buddy is that
person you can rely on to exchange notes, discuss a difficult concept or practice mock
up tests with. It’s someone that will accompany you through
the studying process and will have your back during those crucial weeks before finals. Even for the most introverted person, finding
a study buddy will help you through your class or who know, the entirety of your college
years. 4. Simplifying your planning system: this is
another thing that I learned late in life, but having one thousand apps doing the same
thing or changing between five different planners will do you more harm than good. Make sure your planning system is only divided
into 1) events, 2) tasks and 3)long-term planning and chose the appropriate tools to prevent
you from deviating and getting more planning tools than you actually need. **(clips do video simple planning)** 5. Finding a distraction-free environment: a
distraction-free environment can mean different things for different people, but the goal
here is to avoid the things that prevent you from being in a focused state. For instance, I can be perfectly focused in
an environment with a lot of people and noise but I can’t, for the life of me, stay focused
if I’m feeling the slightest bit cold. Find the factors that impact your concentration
levels and try to reduce them as much as possible. 6. Going beyond usual study materials and getting
involved with the topic: this is one of those study tips that not everyone has the time
to do (because sometimes life is just hectic) but if you do have the time for this, I can
guarantee it will help you in a way that almost no other study tip will help you. Conducting research on a topic in your own
way, creating your own methods for investigating a certain question or concept, finding articles
and textbooks outside of the traditional scope will enhance your learning process a lot and
create a whole background for the things you’ve learned in the past that you couldn’t get
any other way. 7. Mock presentations before tests & exams: these
can take a huge chunk of your time but they probably replace two or three revisions. Doing a mock presentation on a subject or
pretending like you’re explaining a topic out loud to a friend forces you to process
information in a completely different way, using less formal words and sentences and
most of all, connect the relevant information to convey a message or an idea instead of
memorizing for the sake of memorizing. 8. Create reading reports - a so called reading
report is basically a summary of the information present in a book, article or other document. It allows you to focus on the most important
ideas and arguments outlines by the author and draw a conclusion. For classes that really heavily on reading,
this is a great way to create a review and your own interpretation of the lectured information
and have everything neatly compiled in a folder. 9. Prepare classes with the expectation of being
called: preparing your classes believing your are going to participate is a great way to
make sure you’re not forgetting any of the essentials and delve well into the topic that
is being lectures. I tried to do this as much as possible back
in law school and those were definitely the classes where I had the best results in my
final exams. The amount of active preparation throughout
the semester ensures that all of that material is consolidated by the end of your term. 10. Start studying for tests and exams two to
three weeks in advance: studying one or two days before an exam or an important test was
a sure way to have a mediocre grade. I tried as much as possible to organize my
study and using a calendar to divide chapters per days or weeks and cover all of the information
calmly before my exam arrived. There are many ways to learn more about new
study techniques and methods and if you want to take advantage of the holidays, you can
get your hands on titles like How to Become a Straight A Student, 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People or the Power of Habit and you can listen to all of these titles with Audible, who is
