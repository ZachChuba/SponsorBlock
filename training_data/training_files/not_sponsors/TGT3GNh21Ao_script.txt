hi guys my name is grace I'm back with another video and I filmed this already but my phone died while I was recording so I'm so sorry um as I don't have a make Wow I don't have a mic right now because my phone is charging so hopefully you can hear me I'll try to make this as good as possible but today I'm going to be reacting to hit the stage momo and mina doing crazy and love or momo following four dangerous love for some reason and that only put Momo's name in the title of this shady m-net as always but yeah let's get right into this like I said I reacted to this already but there's a lot of technicalities in this one so I'll do it again okay and let's get into this right now so right away this is a very contemporary modern piece of choreography something very different than what you see from them normally in there twice work I also don't get it okay don't understand what's happening um but Nina gets locked in a box by Momo whatever also the acting from both of them you know like scared mama looks crazy they're on top of it ah okay so I talked about this in my deleted video and I will preface this by saying this is not a a comment on Momo's body in particular this is going to talk about dancing bodies in general so I noticed that here Momo's legs look a little thicker than how I am used to seeing them from her twice I've got promotion promotional periods and stuff like that they look more muscular and this type of body is more along the lines of how a modern or contemporary dancer would look ideally they're different from the typical ballet bodies classical ballet bodies are longer and much thinner they're for long lines and long thin lines where everything is much more upright in ballet and in modern dance there's a lot more energy from the ground it's a very grounded style of dance so you'll also be doing inversions where basically immersion is anything upside-down handstands cartwheels rolls anything lifts it's a much more I don't want to say physically demanding because ballet is incredibly physically demanding and so is modern dance but they're physically demanding in different ways where I think modern dance could be considered much more weight-bearing than ballet dance so that's why you see more must muscular legs on modern dancers because they're much lower to the ground typically like literally lower to the ground like you see Munich Momo here doing so it's just very interesting that here when she's doing a modern style dance you can see that she has a more muscular thicker body than when she is promoting with twice when kpop idols are trained to have skinnier bodies I also have never seen her do modern dance that's a beautiful attitude that bent leg around the back is an attitude that Archer show us they're gonna do they're gonna do some moves and when I was filming this and the deleted footage I wasn't sure if you guys recommended this to me so I could go through and like name all the moves they're doing I don't know if that's what you want but I'll do it so she shanae's over Shanae is French for chains and/or chain of turns you can do them in succession so she's scheana's over Momo does Nina does she gets up so she Nina as Momo is shining' over puts her leg up flicks it in you saw and then she goes into an arabesque behind her we a and then kicks her leg up into that beautiful scorpion-like position where it's above her head she's got nice long legs for that line and she's flexible so it looks very nice on her and then Momo does another Shinae a fan kick with a bent leg a fan kick is this thing she did and that's a jazz class classic then she does a Bop ma with a bent bottom leg it doesn't look like she's doing a forced arch she just has a bent bottom leg which typically Bop moms are done with a straight bottom leg it's hard to do to do it with a straight bottom leg but with a bent bottom leg a bent supporting leg you can get your leg higher because your little hips automatically go forward and you can see her back is not completely straight she does have a more concave position so her hips are going forwards her laking it higher and then she I watched this already she this isn't difficult what she does here yes so she has her she has her front leg I was gonna see if I should talk about body facings because there are specific names in ballet for body facings according to the room so she was facing across a quasi and her front leg was kicking and she swiped it back so this is her front leg she swiped it back and on her supporting leg she jumped off the ground straight out of the kick that's something very difficult it takes a lot of strength tion a fan but mine jump straight to the floor - and Mina's body neeta's body line looks great that's a beautiful arch she does up from the floor oh and they took over they didn't film it I don't know why they didn't focus on mo mo for this part but she when we cut back to her she's coming out of what looks like a fish flop that's a another jazz class classic but it was either just a regular backwards roll or fish flop and I think there's footage of them teaching idols or trainees how to do it in produce 101 / Purdue's 48 but it's a backwards roll and you basically do like you're like straight in the air and you kind of do a split sort of thing but you can see you're coming out of it but they cut to Nina and that roll over her Momo's roll over the tops of her feet that's a very competition dance style thing also just to note um the backup dancers I know y'all came at me Shana doesn't like her dancers being called backup dancers I know whatever so don't come at me for this they're traditionally called backup dancers what can I say but in this case the dancers that are not Momo and Mina and this performance are used more as props than to create substance on stage and that's not necessarily a bad thing it's not a good thing it's it's an it's just a choice that the choreographer made yeah it's just a choice the choreographer I also don't understand someone's gonna come put paint on her face and I don't get it and I love this transition to the black/white aesthetic the lighting on stage and the floor they have the cool lit floor it's not a dance floor that's traditionally used we we traditionally use Marley floors and if you can't get Marley wood floors which are terrible in every sense of the word but I love the black and white with that red color that red pop and then she gets paint put on her face for some reason and then everyone walks out in line and she joins the line yeah so yeah that's that perfect Boop everyone's gonna clap for that yes so you guys have been asking me to react to hit the stage for a while and I only reacted to tens devil performance or whatever but this is very interesting I've never seen Nina and Momo dance this way I knew Nina was flexible I knew she came from a dance background but I've never seen them go fully into this style of dance before and it was just very interesting I wonder who choreographed it because it's really cool hey I don't get it I don't get the storyline I don't get the the I don't understand it so if you guys know let me know yeah so what do you guys think about this performance let me know in the comments down below and I hope to see you guys the next video bye bye
