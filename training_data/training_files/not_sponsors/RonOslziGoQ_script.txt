all righty ladies and gents welcome back to another episode of RL crafts zyne has been hard at work since last installer oh it's up now no big news everyone that's very exciting all right well you have been hard at work though so what's been going on I for one I got tired of evil things coming up from the the creepy crawlies good call good call so I've put you know I've put doors and stuff for things and kind of made it made home a little bit more home you know and then I went and rated that you remember where that place by the tree that we found the villager settlement you mean that the place where there were skeletons and yeah the outputs with the skeletons and stuff yeah we not we did that well we did but we'd left torches we didn't know those torches were good torches okay so all the torches there I'm sure I should have given you some of these I mean I knew you had some on but it's I I have there's actually nine in there okay fair enough so so anyway we got like real real light in here this is exciting it's not gonna expire that's pretty cool and I lined a lot of the paths down with real light too so that keeps stuff in so that we can go down without being attacked immediately look at that and real torches that's exciting dude that's what I meant okay and then we came up here oh and I verified nothing grows in here it's a it's a it's it's I don't think it's a temperature think so I put lava in here for a little bit and there it's just some kinda they needs actual sunlight in our out craft or something like right so drag some cows back now that they've been particularly useful basically just looking for ways to earn XP oh wow it's very chilly out here right now it looks like yeah it's winter time and let's see so it does look like you got a creepy boy following you Wow okay and fire it as well alright he's he he burned up those crops real nicely good get dookied on there we go we're all good it's all you get him oh I got it don't you worry got him you know what I did I just before we started recording I got my gathering up to 8 so now I can use this sweet efficiency to iron axe and just fell trees like in a nobody's business awesome spider well I couldn't really see him he was obstructed by the trees so you know it'd be would it be dude is there another thing that's inside of the volcano now there's the fish that's gone in there it did a fish spawned in the volcano yeah there's you can see one poking out right there I did I mean I would not have realized that that's a fish but I just wish okay I just spawned the efforts of course let's see and then I found out like the other than just working on the crops and so you know I mean I didn't I wasn't going for like progression or anything I was just trying to kind of get established and stuff but I found out a couple things one is there is a dress if you if you look off in the distance kind of towards that waterfall you can see a mountain behind the mountain right and I see a mountain me on the mountain yes that there's a dragon that lives on top of that okay on top of that mountain and he's a he's a dick oh just ya know like totally it turns out that there's dragons not far away from us all over really so company so come over here we come up here how did we manage to not see any of these dragons previously they're kind of on the top of stuff and so do they inhabit a particular area and kind of stay within that range yes okay yeah they stick to their spots and then if you go into their spots is it a very bad time I mean I I'm saying the one that I saw that killed me I saw it I turned and ran and I was dead oh I don't why can't they hit act there we go hold on there we go we're good we're good oh did you build these little stairs up oh this is your observation point is it yeah okay I don't know where he is right okay but I want it and these yellow things here are our dragon oh there's gold right oh I see this this looks dragon II so they're not all under around there are some above ground spots so where's the man's over here also I am very cold currently he was flying all around I'm not that cold really I am I am a snowflake so no flake bears you could try oh I just went snowflake I wonder if this makes me warm yeah you don't know but I'm gonna I'm gonna get down off this mountain right now because it's it's going poorly for me and my entire vision is going very fuzzy okay it's increasing that's that's wonderful I was looking through that it was you know springtime and and the dragon was flying all over around there and just like you know beating his wings and stuff like that so it was it was very scary things like rarr but that's not the one I never fought that one it was the one over in the on the mountain behind the mountain that like give it to me in one shot now that's about it okay so you know how the one underground was sleeping is there a way to bilbobaggins it uh so I don't know in this one it turns out I actually yesterday play it was playing a different mod pack and it has the Dragons mod but I I know it's not quite as updated or something so I don't know if there's differences but there were things going on that I kinda had forgotten and I feel a little silly and maybe people are yelling I didn't see any but in Minecraft things just because you hit something doesn't mean that it will attack you you need to be an aggro range and we weren't an aggro range so we might have just been rain arrows down on it and it wouldn't have done any bad maybe but we actually have the arrows that widget yeah or it might have started flying at which point we would have died it could have gone either way okay all right good question good question we like the winter thing is not not ideal happy yeah and then everyone's like hey just make cooling clothes and make warming clothes and stuff like that and I don't know what they're smoking but that stuff's expensive cool is it called cooling a cooling coil yeah the heating GU needs magma blocks which we don't have access to unless we take magma creams and convert it up the cooling we've started a little bit I've got six of the the liner material but because I can borrow ice cubes but otherwise how do we how do we get the ice itself ice ice cubes you just like because it during winter the pond freezes over we just go and we just break the pond and then put the water back okay so ice the ice isn't that hard but we don't have any really good way to get eating stuff so so what is the ultimate gear called that we're looking for well I know there's like liners like a warm and like if you search warm there's also wool that will keep you warm but that takes a lot of wool which we don't have so can we so it's heating is it called cool what's the okay it's cool liner I see it oh boy so we need ample amounts of slime balls too and do we have a mean Jack getting those easily we like all the things get dropped occasionally by stuff we kill so we've picked up a little here in there like I've got some magma creams right now but it's not it's III wouldn't say we have a farmable source you know right there is any like you can get magma blocks spawning in ravines like under the ocean you can find on the on the surface let me tell you about the ocean okay don't don't do it no no he goes poorly when you go on a boat oh my goodness I was on the the I was on the shoreline gathering sand and a crustacean of some sort in the water like starts like flicking at me but it wasn't hitting me so I was like nananana and I was sitting there and I was stabbing it from the shoreline because it couldn't come into a haunted land and I was like I kill you I kill you and I was a hooker and then it grabbed me did it like it hook it you blinded me oh and the next thing I know it had like I was teleported to the bottom of the ocean blind with it still attacking me as I'm trying desperately to swim to the surface fight it off without being able to see and at this point I don't know where I am and so that's the story of how I lost all that stuff that sounds like a good time all around if I had to say don't go in the ocean oh man it's bad but wait you know if we find a ravine great yeah great time all around okay by the way did you want the backpack we forgot to showcase the backpack I've just been holding in my inventory but we do go back now right so I had a zombie just drop it oh what is this that you're wearing I'm wearing wool oh so that I'm assuming doesn't provide any protection though no not much protection but a little bit of heat which is kind of like on the one hand I think it's just supposed to be the liner but it kind of looks like you're wearing like a vest and your belly's kind of sticking out when you wear that okay let me see so all right do we have the means of making more of these pretty much all of art well we have a little bit of wool so I can make me a chestplate but they do wear out really fast Oh from getting hits yes these are not strong items okay I mean we do have a little bit more string somewhere I think but we know I just barely converting into into it so that's a bummer so yeah we're pretty low on wool and we both have hello you have okay cool but we do have that which would warm us up before just out and about we need to yeah for a second yes I mean that's all right things could be worse and then the other you know like ultra minor but I did make a compass and a season clock so that we could see we were dealing with okay so cool but we have I should I should do a compass actually so that I can track my position well a little bit easier we should look at an atlas Oh nobody I mean just so I can I can see my coordinate make that and then let's try making an atlas because I think that works kind of like the old tiny map from septic but what allow us a little bit of space and understanding of what's going on alright let's see we got here antique atlas and oh it's like one of these sorts of fairs now do we think these up I can't remember there was something in SEMATECH about syncing them together or something like that yeah I mean we only have one right now but or did you make one oh I have not made one no yeah so we don't we only have the one right now okay I assume that there's a way to sync them up I can check into that the other thing that we should look into is a blast for equipment Forge okay well that allow us to do fancy customization on things start using that like night stuff that we find like wills and things it's just a wooden and wooden axe in the crafting table so it's not terribly difficult to MIT together okay I think I feel like we can we can meet that criteria sounds good I also needed to like wait what are you doing here increase weight increase I just wanted to do the level ups on the things that wait no increase done I want to do the level ups in the L that reset every time you do monetize so that doesn't reset okay but you need when you do it you need to do click increase and then you have to click done to apply it and you'll see your levels go down you have to apply it yeah so but those don't think crease in fact those are better skill ups because they actually give you benefits then the the normal ones we've been using because the normal ones just unlock stuff the week they like items and things you have to do that but those actually give you that benefit okay so I see yeah I like why did sometimes didn't finally I realized I was escaping out of the screen after doing increase what I need to do increase then done specifically okay and then life was good makes sense so these are just your experience levels yes okay cool good to know oh so that you this is a level 2 this Forge can be used to create new equipment from level 2 or below creature body parts higher level parts will be downgraded if possible huh okay let's put it there and see what it do so sorry he likes Vento Raptor skull level 3 so that would get downgraded to a level 2 level 2 and you can start creating stuff with it how good what else what else goes into it so it looks like it has the sideways cross with a blue like thing no idea what you mean here I should search at like a knight and see if I can find any weapons that like put these things to use oh oh there's only one page of like a knight stuff so I wonder which none of these seem like actually yeah don't make me yeah okay you need help no no no it's fine there's a there's a purple mob out outside this door right here and he's he's not he's not happy about everything alright I can help you if you need there's certainly guys that you need to go kill out there okay all right oh this looks so happy Wow happy chick that's a happy chicken I've ever seen is it outside the main door no oh I see this this story here where there's a fiery there yes oh he's he's got your weaponry now so that's that's good times trumpet that's up oh that's a fast trumpet boy bye bye oh by the way okay oh my god dude what the heck oh it was a light one got it I see yeah well it's chilly down here you know so yeah that was fun just just a quick little double-check on how everything's going and it's going well did he uh did he drop anything cool why is the Enderman wait wait oh the ndreds not mad and it was not matter it is I can't tell but it's just okay good good good he's just doing the static effect which trips me out they always do and that's the inner man that actually ended up killing me oh wow yeah I might have accidentally picked up all the levels from that mob how W and and I appreciate I was level 25 but now I have enough levels to be able to use this I guess that helps because you can give me advice but what okay I think I was just grabbing my stuff and I gave it all to me we can if there's an SP tome something like that that I can give you my levels and that's useful mmm XP tone okay so it's slimeballs in the book cool we can make that okay huh we have all that do we have slice do we have a bunch of slime balls we have a couple I don't remember where or maybe I use them all for the winter stuff or maybe they were ender pearls there's a lot of different options you okay I'm very I'm very I'm a busy man dude I'm just not seeing where you actually make weapons that use light like night stuff how it works either well what I did see is there's a thing to that we could use this for it I kind of want to just try it I don't know if it'll be a cool thing but it was your crafting table for it I'm gonna try to make a like a nice thing that I just saw us before a scorch fire scepter okay I just put all my levels in that if you can figure out how to get them out of that thing right right-click to retrieve all XP sneak right-click the stores might okay so I can just right-click it and let's see Oh 1980 yeah wow that's pretty cool yeah that's pretty there you go that and I got my two so that I could use this say yo I just dropped it back on the ground and let me see should I do what ones are you focusing on under the L thing I wonder L yeah I'm stone cutting five prospecting's pretty cool that gets expensive real fast I'm two of five on that okay and then you'll need combat stuff no I went mining specialization I think you can't like I kind of suspect that we can just switch over and do all of them but I've only been been leveling and mining so farts randomly doubles damage output for direct axé 5% chance per level and melee damage let's see I'm gonna increase this and then melee damage increases direct damage output plus 10% damage per level whoa not bad yeah that's that it's pretty cool okay and then why can't I guess I don't have level cost 11 but I have 19 levels oh but I need to hit done then it takes them and that I don't have 11 levels left over yeah okay ah let's see what this does yeah those are just throwing charges right oh you made the wand yeah that's pretty cool oh I where did my uh where did my so many wand goer did I lose that last time I can't remember I probably lost it yes oh yeah yeah that sort of saying those are cheap to make another one it's fine summoning staffs we need you what is ender pearl bone and gold my junk no no I'm so sorry I'm so sorry my okay my Jane koozai they've state I didn't think that was gonna happen because if something the staff was messed up and then all the sudden it just spawned every Jane goo on the planet I'm so sorry I'm so sorry yeah you're good I think all right well that's me summoning staff I mean another one oh cool oops bad Jay who's buried of janggu every now and then the bestiary won't load right and then I have to disconnect the Rican okay be right back it's it's a fun time and I did have once where I had to do it twice okay BRB I am very very disappointed though like I was able to just throw out Jang goos dude I was able to throw out Jang goos and now I can't throw at Jang goose whoa it's really that's bad weather I don't like this weather dude you know what's which direction you want to go I can show you a giant cave oh I like giant dragon a dragon came out of but I didn't I didn't see whether there was still a dragon there oh shoot I forgot delicious by the way to you torches I have 23 all right cool I not a fan of the snow we should stay out of the snow like like the actual falling snow you know yeah I feel like that cave good call definitely good here this so this looks to me like a dragon burst forth ah because this thing goes down Oh like I did I went nope nope nope nope nope and turned around as I would add about the point where you were I wish this fog wasn't here be a little bit easier to see what's up it's very foggy exceptionally exceptionally foggy there's a and not only that there's a lot of fog that makes it hard to see yeah yeah you're right about that do we want to just take a trip down the aisle water we can do that wait see yeah here's here's chard but it doesn't look chard like down there oh hey definitely a dragon base because it's got the KaBlam rules okay so that is a that's a tree yes dragon base is definitely a dragon tree so but I think this dragon is left like I think that's why the whole is there is that he he nope doubt I shouldn't win somewhere so I don't know the man's - oh yeah oh the creeper is uh climbing there's definitely things coming up at us yes out that alright it's fine that didn't actually generate any damage for me so that's good news okay I just it's hard to tell like oh oh oh yes that is in fact a dragon base but the quite the true question is is there a and there might not be surely nothing could go wrong if we go down here what the hell is it oh my god I was a troll oh it's not a dread dude there's no dragon ah oh my god we might be you that's a giant troll - I know but it's like stuck in the water so yeah get rekt get rekt noob but got it yellow creeper creeper boy creepy boy carefully creepy boy nice nice nice brah we're getting free reign over Dragon's nest nothing can go wrong with this plan we just need to light it up we just need to light it up no no he blew up the chest oh wait oh this little gold pieces that's cool what do we got skeletons called gold is another creeper another creeper okay okay you got this Oh careful yeah yeah don't you want it you only a head shaft so create a special creeper special creeper is a special I think it's it's a webbing creeper yet no it's though he throws wedding yes he's done he's done he's done we out here okay so we don't like there's not too much to clear fortunately all right why don't we have the mining fatigue though oh it's it's nice from the rent they used never before as a mod pack made me so worried about just a basic skeleton just everything yeah ow you frickin you're done you're done it's over dude we out here we did we have the high ground oh I had the high ground Anakin yo okay nugs I don't know what the gold nugs do if they're worth anything but yeah I didn't know if they were like I don't know different in this mod yeah okay this cobwebs that's always nice yeah look some college instalments more bones bones are good I like the sound of walk ooh oh that's nice got a bunch of iron ingots out of that chest yeah I got a couple there I don't know what a manuscript is but iron sword iron helmet and more iron leggings just some spare sets worth worth keeping the diamonds you'll love to see a would there be any reason to take the skeleton skulls I don't know okay you know oh we got a creepy boy over here who's a fancy would see I been poisoned for 40 seconds oh that's way maybe I should just take him out long poisoned he's like might as well Oh My lordy he is just web slinging and freakin doing it he's a special boy I know like the special are you have you summoned your people who help you I should do that I forgot yeah you are likely to be eaten by a grue are you kidding me get out of here I know I don't have any more torches the problem I lit up this whole place dude alright janggu boys let's do it my frickin janggu is seriously as he stuck it on please stuck in a web good job bud good job you did great freakin duty yes like thorns and yeah that's why I just blocked him in it was like I ain't dealing with you vengeance quick Santa suit wait did I get him I think I actually got him oh yeah oh yeah I did yeah I did get him wait always no space in my inventory yeah the backpack is back home glowing ingot huh no I didn't bring the backpack because I would have to wear it in order to do anything with it and I don't want to do you monetize so yeah I just looked up and your janggu was attacking something and I was like oh because it's just I just see something coming down at me I got you it's it's scary time to be here straight ahead let's see I can barely see in front of my breath but yes there's a diamond there alright that is another diamond down I got one diamond then I wasn't there okay you got that one I think we're mostly emeralds and I'm still other than villages not entirely sure what those are oh wait yeah you can't get emerald armor except doesn't show you the crafting recipes when you like click on that stuff so it's still a little confusing to me well pretty good pretty good haul I'd say yeah there you go drop this off and then we can continue further west now that we've explored this abandoned dragon cave why the dragon abandon it I don't know yeah what an idiot dragon I think it's the dragon at the top of the mountain oh but I don't I that's speculation you know previous tenant break you doesn't he know not to leave his cave unattended but some people are just gonna go loot it like Tommy do you wanna do you want to lose your stuff to bandits because that's how you lose your stuff to bandits I know if there's anything else we need to take but uh yeah alright let's dip on Ellis good times I guess how we get back quick and which one was it is it crucial marriage okay don't you have a third one oh you did cool yeah I would probably need to go to it in order to activate it yes it's not far it's just by the where the observation dragon was okay God gotcha you mean the dragon observation chamber yes the the this is the observation dragon it observes it doesn't try to attack it observes it observes many things you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna level up my attack by one and now I have six skill points so I can do the battle spirit which means that I will get a strength buff every time I do monetize a monster Oh sounds okay how do I I have six skill points why can't I do it what do I do to activate it do you have all the requirements Oh what are all the Oh attack 1600 attack has we 16 dang it oh boy defense 16 as well and agility 12 whoa these things are steep man can't you just give it to me when I asked for it my god I know right ridiculous okay well um in that case I guess oh I want to see actually if I can make some arrows and once I check that we can continue the exploration perhaps those are probably torches out there on that Duke oh dude there we go that's what you like to see that is 32 arrows very nice very nice yeah I'll just we'll go with that wonder if that can make more if I need to but means I don't like that'll help significantly against skeletons I think there's also the option that we always ignore that irritates people that we can do which is fuel oh yeah yeah I guess we couldn't do that that is an idea and we do always ignore it well okay before we do that though sorry we're we're using Hal birds which are two-handed so we can't we use a shield with it or we'll get the mighty okay so for Stella tunes we could just swap out maybe yeah people will refer we're recommending the rep year oh really as as the soup du jour okay even better I like the reach of the halberd but you know if people are recommending something else then by only a bit can give it a lot of let's try it so that's so that's the the one-handed option that we could looking okay so to iron a rapier coming right up and we'll give them we'll give them a shot so here's the yeah yeah yeah so the math is halberd one point two attack damage rapier double that kind of here this rat doing it's like all the time but we get the 200% attack damage buff on no are more settings of actually being oh I need to make the handle thing okay okay one the moment do we have more of those handle things I don't know yeah not that I know I know I made some spare ones I I ended up not okay make one so perhaps they went to bye-bye that is a totally finally hit leather for it so if there's a no prep this rat is driving me insane so my observation okay it's cold up here do I when you say nighttime you mean I guess I guess it takes both doesn't it out don't don't get you monetize that would be bad news you don't want it you don't want it you don't want it okay okay so handles are in there all right I got a shield and alright theater for you if you would like to have them yes and I guess I'll put these two things back because I need to free up inventory space and yeah dude alright ready for you let's go over sleepy time I'm gonna hand you this stuff and then we will go on little adventure that are you are okay very nice and this is the food chest that I've created up here it's very very fun place very fun time to be here alive and not monetized by monsters okay yeah okay the healed chest got the food chest got to figure out what we can and can't use dude I'm ready - I'm ready to go and use this thing I feel like there could be a better way to manage the cows potentially I I just wanted to put him somewhere yeah I got just stuck there you know oh there's a Flying Spaghetti Monster over there I think he might have seen it he does have you many eyes we haven't tried the beholder my okay hypothermia why am i I both Arabic okay I just tried to put down water and it froze the media okay I'm gonna I'm gonna put down lava maybe right over here stand next to it kind of hope for them okay he I think he does notice senpai is noticing maybe he's not okay alright alright now that's that's not aggro I wonder if I shot him from like really far you know you're talking about the aggro yeah yeah you might want to do that before he gets over here missed I got him okay you hit him yeah I saw it got him I wonder how many it's he probably has a lot of health though I bet probably a fair amount of health but it's hard to do Oh buddy let's check out what we got node oh man dude we Oh is an eye of ender wait do you I've gotten one eye of Enders oh is that from did you take one of these down before no no no oh no that's pretty slowly out Oh get that prepped my man okay I might need to put down lava again like he's freaking cold I don't know why it's so cold winter I know but it's like what's the difference between spot yeah this it's a good good place good time to be alive okay we're gonna get where did we I was trying to remember do you know where our original house was because there was the thing underneath it our original house yeah we built into the side of the mountain right here no no no no no no we actually put up doors okay where that is yeah yeah yeah I know where that is it's no big deal if there was there was all the there was all this stuff and then there's the battle tower yep so what was it that you were trying to got us to right now nothing I was just saying we had indirection oh I thought you had a particular thing in mind no no I did that be crazy I'm not that put together okay dude we haven't been this far in this direction before though or have you new to me okay I usually I like I didn't I kind of oh there's some cheap though if you want to get some more real quick so that you can not you know have a sleeping bag sleeping bag hey there is it there is a way stone over here though so that's exciting good that's good okay Mars slammer Plains ago Mars slammer playing yeah dude the marsh slammer Plains bro actually let's just go real quick though oh is like the entire interior Sochi the mono far I've got a lot wow it's getting really cold really fast there we go that'll screen or Unni let's see where the Oh as you go down I just as a queen here wait these are iron blocks oh no that's andesite okay oh wow this did become very very chilly yeah just like right in that spot was like you shall now be cold wow I'm going back into Mars slam bummer dude just said like go to Chile there anyway that was like an ice cube over there okay so I mean man we got it I just know there's so many mega mega cool structures and stuff that you can find but I'm like okay really really be shaken out here so that's what we're doing well we do have this it looks like you can do a ritual here yeah all these things seem like they should be a thing but I'm not seeing things inside these things where was Marcela met was it was it to the west of us um I actually screenshotted the location but yeah it was over I can kind of point to it it was uh back yonder back over there just have west southwest yes okay Southwest for Mars lamellae I've I've learned to start paying attention to which way the Sun is rising oh yeah that definitely does help yo we got a house over here though that we can check out something of interest which is exciting something of interest yeah maybe seems exciting it looks like there's smaller in here it's farm where oh in side of there oh you're gonna break it though yeah cool it's the proper way to handle a spawner is bring it I got you rapiers are a disappointment on cobwebs unfortunately you don't seem to behave like so we're halbert's those sort you know not really much in here though Oh other than a fancy permit torch though so you want that hey you want to go down the deep dark scary pit holy moly I see nothing wrong with going down the deep dark scary pit don't you old are you did you go down no no not yet not yet but it's very yeah okay good thing I brought this lava I got my forces yeah I I'm almost unfortunately my pickaxe has leaked what look one durability that's no bueno so we might not go down the oh I actually have three iron ore you probably have a lot too I have a lot of iron ore I don't have anything to like everything coal at this point nothing wait I need to put torches in somewhere I hear a trumpet boy I'm really worried to go down this final little leg here there are boys there's a few boys there trumpet boys though so oh there's many many men's many man's many men have oh god I don't know we can handle that many man's at once okay so why did they break the torch yeah yeah nobody broke the torch wait what they can break the torch I the skeleton dududud a creeper which then got mad at the skeleton which then blew up and ha ha there we are here we are well let's go oh yeah we need to dig down like an observation area where we can just I can shoot people oh hey buddy I see the spawner it might actually be able to oh I got the spawner down nice that's how we do you're doing you're doing so well I'm so impressed with everything right now I'm so worried that one is just gonna kind of poke its face through the hole that I've dug out and just had had me just just end you oh my god dude wait no no no no no no no you absolute fool it's on that torch and I did not mean to do that Hey took out the creeper good you sound like I'm trying dude I'm trying I'm up here goofing and you're just like I got this don't worry oh you know like oh man if I hadn't had items drop already it could have just incinerated some dudes with just dropping lobbying on them all right I could have done the old Yule lava trickery did so there's some stuff on the ground problem is like I don't know if I want to go in there all the way yet and there also might be more spawners there's probably a symmetrical one on the other side definitely guys that came out when I when I revealed myself when you revealed yourself yeah like I just killed the a bad guy I dropped down and oh you did you actually went in yeah I mean I literally drop down and then block right back up and out okay

laggy right now I don't know what's going on but there must be so many entities around here it's just causing my client to lack I don't okay it's fairly clear here but there is oh there are actually like there are a ton of rooms I think oh I think that's why it's lagging is because of like how many rooms there are to this and we have just merely scratched the surface out there whoa what is that whoa I don't like it don't like it that's trying to grab what was in that chest which looks pretty pretty chill yeah yep emerald ring bandages for diamonds oh yeah for diamonds in that chest good okay ah but I feel like what we should do right now maybe is call it here because we need to sort out whatever is causing it's just too many things for the lab things yeah yeah good we need to figure out how to get out of here and stuff oh my god yeah that's the easy part just just dig up so yeah most of the stuff I had was gone but that's okay oh you know it was it was my own doing to some extent and I apologize for stabbing you you know I I feel like on playback it would you would be surprised at how difficult it was in the chaos to identify but I understand this it's a little frustrating when you're like I did it splat hey hey hey that's me little money everybody wins and also in that same description we'll have a link to the play list so you can catch up on any episodes you might have missed anything you want to do other than my emerald ring is a quality horrible and when an offhand negative five projectile damage negative five attack damage negative five magic damage sounds like you would enjoy it nailed it at times my my potion ring is plus three magic damage so I am slightly better they're cool but we'll see you next time everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
