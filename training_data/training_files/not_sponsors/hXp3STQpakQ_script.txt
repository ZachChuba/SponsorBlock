welcome ladies and gentlemen it's time for the wind Show when show kind of when show wait what do you mean the fourth one we filmed today we filmed for last week we're not gonna have to film a win show for like two months yeah this is gonna be great minutes it's just lucky that we have such an accurate crystal ball because otherwise we'd be in real trouble like two months from now when you know like in videos launching something or whatever and we're not talking about it because we're on top of it because all the hardware so cyclical anyways that we just guess what it's gonna be yeah pretty nice enough we just call everything rumors we say everything's allegedly yep yeah we just move on allegedly is the key word that's the perfect word all right guys we got a great show for you today you got a lot of great topics that's kind of a lie we don't really have a ton of great topics we definitely have the one about people setting fire to 5g towers because because people are special so that's that's great we're gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about the PlayStation 5 controller actually you might have some stuff to say about PlayStation 5 controller I suspect you will I have intentionally not looked at it because everything we were gonna talk about it we're gonna get that raw reaction ladies and gentlemen yeah also got Apple and Google teaming up to use your data and the fight against coded and 800 gigabit per second Ethernet spec has been announced yeah it's super that's a boring topic we might not even talk about that but also Amy's fourth gen rise and desktop chips are apparently set to release in September 2020 that's a bit of a more fun - why is that under rapid fire I don't know that's sort of a big topic but you know as far as I can tell the difference between main topics and rapid fire is that someone flipped a coin and it landed on the right side or the wrong side they didn't have a ton of notes for it so yeah just like up yeah you know how you know how it is you know how it is so great great great show for you guys today we're gonna have a lot of fun and we're gonna roll that intro I promise we're going to you just wait it's gonna happen wait for it here it is it's coming now YouTube's not intuitive way for a streaming thing to work oh shoot I forgot to put the I in order to reuse the same stream key which is how I would expect it to work that's how it works on Twitch so it works on floatplane basically everywhere else you have to like kind of copy paste your last live event that used that same stream key so what happens when you copy your last event is it also copies all the characteristics of it including the title and the fact that it's public so immediately it sends out a ping to people who follow you like we're going live and I'm not it would be great to have a second to say you actually know I would like this to be unlisted or private for now while I get everything set up because you never know it might not be perfect immediately when we start but no no that's not how the interface works and so then what happens is I go in and I set it to unlisted that's the first thing I do so that it's not just like spamming people with this event that doesn't exist and then what I then do is I forget so I press go live but it's still set to unlisted but then there's all these people in the chat so I'm like ok everything's working normally but they're only there because it was temporarily public earlier on yeah it's just the dumbest thing ever and I I'm the only fixes for youtube to fix their interface or me to become a super genius who can remember all these ridiculous steps oh that's fine let's just so you know as well apparently teams does have some auto game features so I think that's more what we were running into apparently it does because we were definitely running to that like when I was taking so we did a pre stream testing over on Twitch and floatplane and when we were trying to configure Luke's audio to get to the right levels no matter how much I tried to boost him on my go XLR mixer thing he wouldn't get any louder and this is a dynamic mic yeah when I got further away I stayed the same volume yeah yes like really weird so what would happen was his voice wouldn't get any louder but I could hear like the cars driving by on the road which with a dynamic microphone should absolutely not be a thing like yeah it must be taking just this like tiny waveform and then just be like yeah that's exactly as important as the person talking right so we might I don't know we might have to switch to a different voice chat app for next week but the thing is the video quality on teams is reasonably good as long as you you know upgrade your camera at some point what cable is it that you need can I just send you a cable is it like a special cable Luke I think so it's just like a micro HDMI or something isn't it I bet it's just a micro HDMI cable that I found that and we could still hear you we could still hear you yelling from across the room just fine like I could hear you still so bizarre that should not be how that works so I have this guy which should be pretty good for the stream mm-hmm yeah it looks pretty good handy it looks handy I don't remember what the exact model is I'm sure I could find it somewhere I can see RCX 900 and I have the micro HDMI it's not even mini it's just freaking teeny I found that I only have one of those and I found that but I can't find its DC in which is super unique oh there's your problem yeah that that's not working that's not working what you're doing but that's fine I understand I understand yeah it was it was worth it it was worth a try yeah okay so there's your problem yeah that's like that's like an eBay that's like an $80.00 eBay special right there yeah yeah and I've somewhat given up trying to find it here I checked every bin that should have cables in it and it wasn't there and I've checked places where I don't normally store cables and didn't find it there either so of course the specs on B&H just say power cord yeah aren't you glad that proprietary power connectors are going the way of the dodo right now yes because it's super net and this is like particularly an annoying problem I remember and this is the frustrating part I have one of these micro HDMI but I have two power cables for this because when I bought it I knew the power cable is gonna be annoying the second I looked at it I was like yep that sucks so I didn't buy another like wall plug power cable I bought a USB to this proprietary end thing and it worked I've used it but I don't know where that is either oops I just shared our chat history on the stream because I went to send you a message and it still captured that window hopefully we haven't been talking about anything incriminating lately because that's out there I'm old but oh it's all butts I mean that's that's pretty much a given let's just see uh uh yeah everything looks pretty good other than that tool is shared with me that we probably don't need the entire internet having access to what about the stream key was that shared no okay cool good no we're good we're good all right you didn't see key in there no no it's all good yeah it's only 15 bucks I found it 15 bucks us so that's like 30 Canadian dollars now by the time you actually get it shipped up here but that's doable one thing you should make sure of though before you even do before you even spend $15 on that thing is make sure that it's got a clean HDMI output cuz I really started with that it does okay I've dreamed with this before it looks really good I have yeah alright I use this before all right I mean I'm hardly a streaming expert to be very clear like I shouldn't be the one advising you in fact I pause Vox watched my streaming setup upgrade video and basically tweeted at me he's like we should talk you should why didn't you talk to him first I'm sure no no I think I know what he was upset about and the thing he was upset about was a total like accident so I was using this like super cheap b√©renger XLR interface on it and basically it was like a $30 interface on like a $500 microphone and a total mismatch everything else about it I think is is pretty fine like I'm using those Elgato lights and like an elgato arm and I've got a rebel t6i camera that honestly I think looks pretty darn good now and then I've got like a stream deck and it's all pretty standard stuff except for that interface that I was using that was just a total mismatch but my intention was to swap it out basically immediately for a go XLR because I really like being able to say words like and it's on stream so yes don't worry it's all good it's not good some bleep was like oh no no no no no it's fine it's fine that is the biggest reason that I like it so anyway I have swapped that out I actually recorded a video clip today explaining that it has been swapped out so hopefully hopefully it's all hopefully it's all good oh okay hold on a second [Music] oh never mind okay let's move on to our let's move on to our first topic then shall we should we go with the the 5g towers sure you're gonna have to solo this one a little bit because I have to do something very quickly yeah that makes sense that you would have to do such a thing so I'm gonna go ahead and actually know what I'm gonna do more boring topic first then Apple and Google team up to use your data against the against coded 19 so this was posted by Phil 104 on the forum and the original article here is from the BBC so Apple and Google are jointly developing technology alert people if they have recently come into contact with others found to be infected with coronavirus this is some incredibly big brother' stuff right there they hope to initially help third party contact tracing apps run efficiently so this would make the apps interoperable so that contact tracing would continue to work if people traveled overseas and came into contact with people who are using a different tool altom Utley they aim to do away with the need to download dedicated apps though baking a toggle switch into the OS isn't that kind of terrifying like having how easy it is for them to turn on an app that basically catalogs everyone you've come in contact with like that took we yeah the two companies believe that their approach designed to keep users whose participation would be voluntary apparently okay so that's good I guess anonymous would help address privacy concerns about this so so here here's how all that goes shakes down participation is voluntary you don't have to participate users are anonymous some how I mean there's a so they're anonymous in the sense that I guess your your like user token would be like like like randomized like it wouldn't be your name but it wouldn't be anonymous in the sense that you couldn't like it okay if I worked at Google or Apple and I was to have your token number and I could see everyone you've come in contact with I could probably figure out who you are eventually by going to places that you go on a regular basis and being like sup what's your name cool and then leaving and then I would be able to match a token with the name now obviously that's a pretty that's a lot of tin foil hat kind of thing in it and that means that the database wouldn't be searchable the other way like I couldn't just enter a name and then see where that person is gone I would have to like find random tokens and then match those two names so it would you know be a one in seven billion shot to you know have kim kardashian's you know who she's been in contact with pokin you know what I mean but it's still I don't know there's definitely a lot of people out there gonna make pretty uncomfortable so the way it tracks your location is it uses your phone's Bluetooth signals to determine who the owner has recently been in proximity with for long enough to establish a contagion risk bluetooth that's actually a super kind of clever way to do it so it's not GPS because as soon as you go inside a tall building or whatever you know GPS isn't going to be accurate to within the six feet that you're expected to maintain from other people for social distancing it would it would be far less accurate than that but if you're using bluetooth it can use GPS as like a sanity check I mean I'm guessing I'm guessing it would do this but it could use GPS as a sanity check to go okay yeah these guys were in approximately the same location and then Bluetooth to be like oh yeah they actually were near each other I guess you wouldn't even need the GPS that's pretty good no pretty cool that's kind of smart um so then you wouldn't know where people are going you would just know who they've been in proximity to okay that actually that does help my privacy concerns a little bit look it's got its own issues Luke I see your face I see the face you're making I'm not saying it's perfect I'm not saying that's amazing and I feel like you know we should just turn it on all the time I'm just saying it's better than having GPS tracking on all the time it's definite it's definitely an interesting tool in this time dick whoa so much inside of me is like oh you missed one of them I guess but that was not that big of a deal okay anyway so yeah okay tell me tell me how you feel tell me how you feel I don't know I these things are always funky because there's always the like I mean it's opt-in right yes so whatever but there's been a lot of things that have been opt-in that that turns out they're just like you can't even if you don't opt-in you can't opt out yeah who likes doing that kind of stuff I don't know I mean I think I usually like going with the like no protect my information thing in this case I would probably sign up for it that's due to like people that I'm close with being high-risk and wanting to protect them as much as possible and if I was able to know that I was near someone that was infected so that I could not be near those people anymore I think that would be very highly valuable so I would probably turn it on myself you know it was interesting is we actually talked about a very similar topic and you said the pipes thing the know that smart toilets one I'm saying yeah oh the Adult Swim meme is that it's pipes oh okay smart pipe yeah so so smart toilets that would basically evaluate your health based on your your X your excretions you said no for that one and I I think I had said something like so you wouldn't turn it on to save your life but then I guess the question becomes would you turn it on to save your dad's life yeah it's not mine I think that's like a big part of the change right is that like that's me putting the value of my own information over the potential lives of the people that are close to me and that starts to break lines for me because that's no longer the consequence isn't on me anymore right or not as much yeah I mean it could be who is yeah definitely but anyone there does also other heavy consequence on other people you know yeah so I think that changes my stance on okay so tell me this then because really the the sort of the Utopia you know outcome of the the smart toilet thing is that collectively as a species we become healthier and live longer because we learn far more about the effects of our and our activities on the human body and we're all able to collectively be healthier now now but it gets more specific than that because let's say that some of the information that they collected about what puts what's higher risk for you like what you're at risk of let's say that knowledge could be used to say okay so there's a hereditary risk factor for Luke here it came from somewhere and that ultimately comes back to someone like your parents or your brother and they could use that to proactively even though they don't have a smart toilet they could know oh wow well this guy got it from somewhere now what I think in this case I know that the person / people that are at risk would much rather that I had the app installed it's it's not coded like and yes I wouldn't even have to ask they right they would very heavily insist that that was done right so if the toilet thing came around and my I like family and people that are close to me were like hey you should get this thing because of me I would be like I would I think I would be much more heavily convinced if that makes sense right but as long as there's a watchband show and they don't learn about this toilet then you're good all right all right got it it's it's it's what I think it's it's one thing to be proactive on your own and it's another thing to deny someone else's concerns if got accents all right so in current stance on that it uses the Bluetooth signals that so it uses the Bluetooth signals alright it's officially the Boomer show now it uses Bluetooth signals to determine who you've been in proximity with and if one of those people later tests positive for Koba 19 the owner of the handset that's gone near it would get a warning okay so this is right in here no GPS location data or personal information would be recorded and records of the digital IDs involved would be stored on remote servers but the companies say these could not be used to unmask a specific individuals true identity be interested in what the war is or would be because for instance there there's a there's a concern that's affecting us right now I won't entirely go into it but a bus driver in British Columbia that worked in and I think I think it was the Surry area yeah they won't specify what route contracted kovat and died but they want but they won't tell anyone what route yeah that which like counterproductive seems counterproductive but apparently it's because they're worried about like witch hunting on his like family and other stuff like that because there's been a lot of negative reactions like people attacking there's nurses and doctors and stuff like that I haven't heard about this this is a new one for me that's I don't know how common that is in Canada but I've like yeah I've seen I've seen video stuff of it online I think the big concern and the reason why people are doing that is due to them still wearing their scrubs and their medical stuff on the way home and they're worried about them spreading it oh I see but I do know I mean this whole thing is very weird right now probably seems be ditching that stuff at the hospital and leaving it air to be cleaned that's yeah that's a fair point but I also you know they might not have the facilities for that right now or something because it might be over capacity I don't know all right but yet they won't release like what the route was which seems I don't know I'm not a fan of that personally but alright apparently so like so basically what I guess I would say is like would they say where or just you have been near someone no no I don't think it would even know where so the contact matching process takes place on device rather than centrally so it would be nice of you to if it told you the time then yeah the time would be pretty nice but I think because there's a difference between like if you're somewhere and you're being extremely careful versus yours and so like you you probably didn't get it even though there was someone within Bluetooth range yeah or there somewhere where you your defenses have to come down a certain degree for a certain amount of time and if you knew that was happening so when you said Luke interrupting tipsy I'm sorry if you knew that was happening it would be nice to know like oh I was somewhat compromised at that time that's not fair I concern level goes up but I think the issue is that they want to take as little information as possible to to get you sort of the basic they want to take as little info as possible to get you something actionable and the actionable thing is hey you need to go into quarantine yeah that's it yeah that's all there is to it you were exposed that's fair get into quarantine because it's so contagious that if you were in a close proximity to someone who has it for some period of time that apparently it does require you to be in contact for some period of time so it's not enough to drive past someone on the street is what I'm assuming they're trying to avoid then you just you just kind of need to because it can be it can stay alive on surfaces people can kick off into the air and the the particles can be inhaled so it actually seems like I started out really skeptical about this but it seems like the way that they're going about it is mine's a smart and pretty reasonable so they're saying they will openly publish information about their work for others to analyze and the European Union's data protection supervisor said the initiative will require a further assessment however after a quick look it seems to take the right boxes as as it pertains to user choice data protection by design and pan-european interoperability all right Lala good good luck in other news this is what you signed up for it will I sign up for sure yeah yeah I don't see why not I mean right now I I basically haven't left my house other than to run to my local grocery store grab a couple things wipe down the boxes with Lysol wipes when I get back to my house and that's it that's basically all I've done in the last like two and a half weeks so if I'm in quarantine I don't think I'm gonna bother to put the app on my phone but if I were to go back to the office like I've been I had coughed twice today so I'll have been symptom free for 72 hours by sometime next week and I would like to go back to the office so that I'm not setting every shoot by myself right now like I or like I am right now and so if I were to do that yeah I think it would make sense for me to have an app install at the very least and I'll probably switch to wearing masks except when I'm like the moments that I'm on camera and recording just because it muffles the audio yeah yeah in other news Phil 104 on the forum posted this this is great some people believe that 5g like like for cell phones started coded and those people need need an education because that's really not how viruses work but 5g towers have apparently been set fire to in Birmingham are you are you trying to tell me you can't send viruses over a network okay well I think I think you're intentionally trying to misunderstand me sir sir sir I'm gonna have to ask it sir okay sir sir now that's now sir that kind of tone is just simply not accepted sir uh uh you're definitely misunderstanding me on purpose I'm saying that no no waves through the air cannot cause a virus to infect human cells they're that kind of virus there's my third call for the day off you you basically you basically made me sick by pretending to be that stupid gave you a virus 5g towers have been set fire to in Birmingham Liverpool and Melling and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it is just nonsense dangerous nonsense as well because people seem to be setting fire to these 5g towers in order to stop the spread of kovat now I do appreciate people trying to help you know that's good taking the initiative is good and you know working together as a society to make ourselves all safer and healthier that's good too but but diseases are not caused by 5g and setting cell phone towers on fire during an emergency a heightened heightened level of emergency State which we're in is especially stupid because they're needed for people to call emergency services so we really do need cell phone towers working and not on fire so if there's anyone in our audience which I don't believe to be the case I actually do like to think that our audience is a bit of a cut above the average YouTube viewer if there's anyone in our audience who is out there part of a vigilante group that is you know taking it to those those corporations that are infecting us with covin with the 5g towers I would like to ask you to stop to please end it now yeah - please stop setting fire to the towers because we do in fact need the towers thank you very much good run yeah you know what I'm not gonna ask you - yeah I'm not gonna ask you to damasc yourself and admit that you were involved because if I was you I wouldn't want to admit I was involved in something that ridiculously down the either so that's fine don't say anything but just please stop setting fire to the towers and thank you and if you if you can if you can if if those people are reachable you know like some people are not reachable I don't know if you saw that clip of the lady who is covered in Jesus's blood did you happen to see that one yeah yeah I saw I saw that too some people are not reachable so if if you're if your compatriots are are just not reachable you know I don't expect you to convert them to not believing that 5g causes kovat because there's just you know there's nothing you can do at a certain point but just don't be involved in it you know and maybe don't talk to them anymore because they're probably you know not the kind of people that make you a better person that's all I'm saying yeah that's all I'm saying it's all I'm saying all right David shook says my ancestors burned witches alright that's fair that's fair that is actually fairly that's a good parallel odds evolve and grow past things actually I think this topic is basically all the evidence we need that they don't well you can't touch me because of kovat I think we're okay gonna be hard to get people to burn me at the stake if no one is gonna come near me yeah all right cool soft xa says no one really believes 5g causes coronavirus are you sure people are concerned with 5g safety and privacy consequences oh and the message is gone now yeah you still shouldn't be lighting the things on fire that's definitely definitely the wrong SuperDuper wrong approach also I think there's a lot of confusion about what exactly 5g is because many people and I saw this in the comments on those both of the videos actually in spite of the fact that explicitly in both videos I explained this 5g is not the same as millimeter-wave there seems to be a ton of confusion in the comments on those videos across the internet in general where people are like 5g is dangerous because of the high frequency of the waves or because of the high speeds it operates at or whatever whatever whatever whatever 5g is not the same as millimeter wave and millimeter wave which we also demonstrated in both videos is so Pinner that it can't even get through a piece of paper let alone penetrating your body and mutating your cells so 5g millimeter wave is definitely okay it's definitely okay to be a superhero enough and now so to supply enough okay so 5g millimeter wave is is 5 feet just Wi-Fi no no no Rob no it's not Wi-Fi ok 5g is just the fifth generation of cellular technology that's all it is it operates a cross dance it operate it operate you see use for generation it operates across multiple not not just multiple it operates across the spectrum okay so you can have 5g that's based on low band so that's your long range low speed waves okay you can have 5g across your mid bend so that's your medium speed medium range and then you can have 5g on your high band waves so those are your high frequency high speed but low range waves okay so there's a bunch of technology built into 5g around the way the signals are processed that it makes it fifth-generation is it fairly iterative actually in some ways yes and for G long term evolution 4G LTE I think some of the marketing around that was like this is gonna be the last one and then now they're turning around and they're going oh five g 5g now and so I think there's a lot of people upset about the way that 5g has been marketed but that doesn't change what it is what it is is another evolutionary step forward in the handling of wireless signals over cellular networks that's all it is now if you want to talk about millimeter wave we can talk about millimeter wave but that's a separate conversation that's it yeah yeah pretty much not something light fire to rebook bus oh three says you're giving a very cut version of the scientific explanation well yes this is a tag podcast what do you want if you want to explain something you better do so with full displays and all information without bias what bias waves traveling through the air don't care about your bias that's it that they don't they don't go through stuff that's all there is to it it's if you want full-featured full-fat scientific explanations go look them up leo Key says 5g towers are radioactive so is the the glowy man oh yes so this is a banana the ocean so is the glowing face on your watch and you wear that on your wrist and yet somehow we don't have you know a rash of wrist tumors just because something is radioactive actually doesn't inherently make it going to kill you like come on guys please please please okay all right look you know what let's just let's just let's just talk about sponsors that'll make me feel better top seven radioactive items in your home Brazil nuts bananas your own body smoke detectors granite countertops your grandma's dinnerware and cigarettes [Laughter] that's great this video today is brought to you by displaying oh wait you know what no let's summarize let's summarize first please don't light cell

about the PlayStation 5 controller yes okay alright bring it up bring it up so the original article is from the PlayStation Blog okay and it was posted by soft 0:06 on the forum sony has released images of the final design of the dual Sense controller dual sense duel so what's duel about it other than like what's duel whoa well well Indy brah well you get this on screen yeah it looks like it has like it looks like it's wearing like a super suit like it looks it looks like an older playstation controller that like put on like a skin-tight suit okay can I stop you for one second here chat is still arguing about 5g Oh anyway go ahead we're wondering if we're concerned about 5g there's your answer it looks interesting it doesn't look crazy different I was saying this is the one okay I mean this is a fairly station doesn't change much so given Playstations controller changes maybe I think this is pretty dramatic for a PlayStation controllers raishin changer cuz later look like my biggest issue with PlayStation controllers is not actually like it is a problem for me but my biggest issue is not actually the fact that the joysticks are not not uh the the joystick and d-pad on the left side I like them to opt like the controller yeah so they're it's symmetrical that's that's my that's one of my big issues with it but my bigger issue was that I just don't find the lake the like knobbly handles I don't find them very ergonomic they're not contoured to my hand like what hand is that designed for well are you saying where the joystick has a dimple kind of no no that the backs like the handles oh yeah like on the older ones this new one looks way more ergonomic to me so I just looked up a picture of a PlayStation 4 controller yeah and yeah I think I think I saw the new ones handles and we're just like yeah that's obviously how that should work but yeah the previous one has like rounded sticks yeah like it just it never made sense to me whose hand were those designed for like it's it looks like a game controller it doesn't look like something that fits in a human appendage you know what I mean yeah I know I've never personally liked PlayStation controllers I even when I started trying to play horizon zero dawn on a ps4 I went out and figured out how to like USB adapter and program in an Xbox controller to be able to play on the PlayStation and it was worth it in my opinion yeah I just I I've spent so much time on controllers with offset joysticks instead of inline joysticks it feels really weird to have my hand held like that I have relatively big hands I know other people that have relatively big hands and like PlayStation controllers but it feels it feels too cramped for me everything's in and I have to bring my thumb's in I just don't like it this looks a lot better like that basically like I still don't I still don't prefer the inline joysticks but the the ergonomics of the backing of it like this is the biggest change for sure since going to dual analog sticks on the PlayStation 2 it's been pretty pretty iterative since there K little touch panel here a little you know light there and you share button there or whatever whatever that button was called oh yeah very much like the the design idea of the PlayStation 4 one is like kind of fixed shapes like the d-pad even though it's a d-pad it has this ring on it and the ring is kind of the same size as the one 4x Circle Square triangle and then the joysticks both have their own little rings then everything else is like there's two sticks shoved on the side and the touch pad is a block yeah and this new one is much more sweeping yeah like it's curved like for like the humans like for softer things to touch it I'm actually I'm surprisingly into it you know every once in a while this happens on on tech linked where I am reading a news story and I haven't actually seen the thing I'm talking about so I think I made fun of the PS 5 controller on tech linked when I shot it on Wednesday this week but yeah cool looking at this I'm like ah you know what I think it looks pretty good I mean yeah there's still things I would change for sure but this is the kind of improvement that could make me not immediately discard a Playstation controller and go look for an Xbox one I'm still not I wouldn't buy what like if I wanted a controller for my pc like some which is all I really use a controller on I don't actually own a console well I do I have a switch but if I wanted to to just use a controller on my PC I would still go get an Xbox controller instead of this if I had to buy it but if if someone handed me this I wouldn't be like you of girls you and use it yeah this looks a lot better some interesting features they've adopted haptic feedback so you'll feel quote the slow grittiness of driving a car through mud adaptive triggers for l2 and r2 so you can feel the tension of your actions like when drawing a bow to shoot an arrow that's actually pretty cool okay change the angle of the triggers made some subtle updates to the grip that doesn't have subtle to me at all it looks way better I think they mean like the texture oh okay like the actual grip of it not the shape or anything I don't know cuz that looks like an extreme update to the grip and like in a good way maybe they call it a subtle update so that they don't have to acknowledge how bad it was before like maybe someone came in and was like you know we've got some fresh blood in or something or like you know maybe one of the executives that's just you know all business and no gaming you know has a kid now that like grew up and is like you know 22 and started at the company and there's like a bunch of nepotism and this this kid you know has way more say all of a sudden than any of the other people that actually know anything about gaming and came in it was like yo we've been doing this wrong for like 25 years can we please finally fix this and they're like oh yeah okay yeah sure no problem no problem sir we got this and and made me a this is totally hypothetical I don't think that's actually how it went down but it just seems like why did they not fix it for so long and then now it's just like immediately yeah subtle changes way better I haven't actually held it in my hands yet so I don't know that it's that much better but it looks that much better it does look a lot better we'll have to see till yeah hands-on with controllers is so important but well it looks better there's also a built-in mic in the controller so that's probably horrible it might be all right like microphone just mean because I usually honestly don't want to hear anybody okay but that's a separate conversation yeah I jumped into some VR game at one point that I didn't realize was gonna drop me straight into a multiplayer arena like I was doing the tutorial which it turns out takes place in a multiplayer accessible space and your mic is automatically just on and open when you launch this game I forget what game it was it was horrible it made me not almost immediately and anyway just the amount of just other people shrieking and I couldn't figure out like why they were yelling at me or even what they were saying because it just sounded like nothing because it was just clipping and super high pitch do you know how it is anyway the quality of the mic might not necessarily be terrible Sony does know a thing or two about audio and yeah good go to Ray mics these days can be shockingly good like the mic I get so many comments about how good my vr stream sound using the built-in microphone on the valve index the index yeah the indexes mic is is very surprising I will definitely shockingly god-tier like I couldn't believe it yeah but I yeah my biggest complaint with that is just the like barrier of entry for people being able to put their voice in your ears right it's nice to transmit voice to you as opposed to just owning a controller yeah which like came with the console right so like literally everyone will have access to that you play with anyone on PlayStation they will have access to it unless it's backwards compatible with the ps4 controllers I guess but yeah I don't know looks cool excited to actually hold it my hands I hope it's a step up because then if I ever have to play anything on PlayStation I won't immediately feel quite as horrible as it currently does I'm just not into those kind of controllers and the thing is like sometimes you might feel like you have to play something on PlayStation because there's like some good games over there they have a lot of really good exclusives you know what this is not a news topic for this week but I feel like I need to talk about it the number of comments like fanboys drive me absolutely crazy the number of comments on my review of the s20 alt for this week where the title was please don't buy the s20 ultra and the reason is that as far as I feel okay and this it's my opinion you watch my videos so you can get my opinion okay that's the way it works it made no noticeable change to my life compared to my two-year-old note 9 that I'm still daily driving because I can't use the fold cuz this YouTube stories feature is broken on it and I need that for work I know it's the stupidest thing ever I love the hold and it just it was working for a bit so I went back to using it and then it just stopped working again I tried a YouTube app update today just to see if it's back it doesn't work sorry I know this is not it's just not there yeah I contacted Samsung and like the rep that I talked to had no idea and then I contacted top creator support and they were like oh yeah it's not supported on that device I'm like why and then I don't know that I ever heard back I don't know that I actually sent an email saying why because that would have you should try um pretty obnoxious you should try just getting the apk no I tried it oh really yeah no it didn't work yeah it didn't work so really frustrating and then I think one of the Samsung people I talked to was like oh yeah it's working on my phone my fold I'm like oh that's nice but like I need it working on mine so that I can use this device and then I'm not sure that we ever found a resolution to that so anyway what I was trying to say was this is a fourteen hundred US dollar phone that as far as I can tell does not justify its price in any meaningful way something like the note 9 my justification for why I recommended it at the time in spite of the fact that it wasn't I think it was $1,100 for the top spec or $1200 for the thought it was also a very expensive device but it had everything no other device ever has had everything the way the note 9 does it has a headphone jack it's got expand storage it's got IP water-resistance it's got a serviceable camera yes it's not as good as some newer phones now for sure but it's still better than like your your your typical Chinese phone or like a value phone so it just it had everything it had the stylus I don't use it that often but sometimes it really comes in handy it's really nice and it didn't have a a hole punch in the display didn't have a knotch it was just I was like okay everything came together for this device it's worth paying a premium for and to me the s20 ultra just didn't do that at all it's it's it's another phone okay yeah neat I guess that's fair I think we're starting to run into that more and more unless you have like drastic features like folding so anyway though but that's I mean that's exactly it is I'd also I also said I love the fold but anyway what was what was really funny to me about this though was the comments on that video particularly after the like the first wave where it's our subscribers watching so once a video does well with our subscribers YouTube will algorithmically start to serve it out to a broader audience right and it is full of people just sort of bashing on me for just being an iPhone fanboy and looking at this like what are you talking about Justin says just say you're biased towards iPhone man cuz we all already know this is two comments later derp CSR says you are a fan of Apple in all caps oh no I got a scroll a little bit further down to find another one I'm trying to figure out how and why someone would come to that Kingdom because the only reason to say anything negative about a samsung phone is if you're a filthy Apple fanboy because I didn't even I didn't even say you know the iPhone is the greatest phone on earth in that video I just said that this phone is more expensive than an iPhone and definitely fall short of it in certain ways like don't think I don't think it justifies it that's all I said you're an iPhone fan it's like a perfect way for me to filter through comments and determine who in fact does not watch this channel at all and yes it's way too expensive these days phones in general seem to be kind of the new AMD versus Intel from like a fanboy flame war perspective like I don't remember the lot even like Xbox Playstation I don't think maybe I just don't participate in that community as much but I don't think I've seen nearly the same level of toxicity in the last I don't think a few years I don't think the console fanboy wars have been very hot for a long time that might be because it's been a long time since we've had a new one yeah but a new launch when the new launch happens we might see once people are actually making decisions with their money again and like voting with their wallets and it's like you know like that South Park episode though the I think it was like a Lord of the Rings spoof they did where they were deciding which consoles to buy and they like went to battle or something with Black Friday thing whatever it doesn't matter the point is you know once people are getting into arguments with their friend group about like which one we should all invest in yeah all play together it might heat up a little bit but right now it feels like no one cares you just if you want to play say when when like you want to play with your friends but you're you're like dad is gonna buy one of them regardless because he probably wants to play with his friends or something yeah and like you try to push your friends to get that one and then maybe in other factors just how prevalent cross play is becoming outside of exclusive titles and first row titles it no longer matters that much like David and I can argue about you know Xbox controller versus PlayStation controller he likes the PlayStation controller yeah exactly well I wouldn't call him a noob because he can tell yeah pretty much he's a pretty good gamer anyway but like we can argue about it without it really matter and so maybe part of it too is that we're at the point now in this consoles life cycle we're buying the them is not completely unattainable compared to when they both first launched you could probably buy both of these consoles used with an adequate amount of accessories compared to buying one of them back when they launched and the accessories that you need because accessories in particular are so much cheaper to get secondhand so so maybe it's not it's not not as much of like a cost barrier plus you know if you're people like you and me you know what I always used to do was wait for something to be a little bit older I would buy it secondhand and then I would flip it six months later still secondhand basically losing nothing and in some cases being up on the deal so if you really want to play the exclusives one way or the other by now what are we like five or six years into this generation of consoles you could realistically have played through all the exclusives on both of them flip them and just be sitting on your money waiting to pick up the new one when it comes out yeah because like a lot of a lot of games are gonna come out in the next little while we'll probably be on the next one anyways and if I remember correctly the a the next one is gonna be fully backwards compatible so if a game comes out in the interim you'll still be able to play it it doesn't doesn't really even matter that much okay okay Mike says you said Apple in the s20 ultra review I know I did but I didn't say that you know the iPhone is God's gift to phone users I just made a comparison which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do in a review of a device that's all okay and this is a fair point JC says if you go on Twitter you can easily find talks at console fanboys that's true but if you go on Twitter you can easily find funds like anything yeah like I swear to you you could find you could find fans like toxic fanboys of particular types of mousetraps on Twitter and you they'd be at each other's throats even though nobody else literally nobody else in the world cares at all yep what other topics we got for today team thousand percent in March that makes sense yeah yes AMD fourth gen rising desktop chips number 2020 this is a rumor I was originally on techpowerup and Tom's Hardware sources at motherboard Maker's this is in Council allegedly you know are apparently reported that AMD had rise in 4000 series codenamed Vermeer desktop processors that had wait I know that they will arrive after August or September this year supposedly they were supposed to launch at Computex in May but that's been pushed to September Computex has been pushed to September so these are the successor to Matisse and I could actually see like AMD postponing a launch you know two years ago that was not going to be a thing the instant they had chips that were even sort of like we saw this with the first gen rise and launch the instant they had something serviceable they shipped it you know memory controller issues be damned you know BIOS updates that were coming after the launch reviews no problem we got this we got to get this stuff out the door we need people buying stuff we need money that's the state they were in they're a very different company today obviously they still like money who doesn't like money yeah no one put up their hands literally no okay but they're not in one person watching this it's like dude yeah they're not in they're not they're not in such a dire situation now at this point AMD is competing against themselves so there's nothing wrong then with stockpiling some more chips for the launch you know sitting on it for a bit and launching a little bit later now I think that's the kind of behavior that turns at some point into complacency but these are extenuating circumstances the show they were planning to launch the bloody things that got postponed because of a worldwide pandemic so I'm not gonna do you think that is these days we've seen a lot of companies start start stopping to show up at shows starting to launch things that their own events or online events or whatever because of the general progression of the internet so how important do you think it is to actually launch at Computex I think that I guess to me if I was Andy I wouldn't be super concerned about combi Tex maybe it's bigger in me because I know Amy's been been doing really really well in the enterprise space maybe launching at Computex is more important for enterprise launches I wouldn't say that I do think it's fair to say though that industry shows are as much about getting together with your partners to to do things together as they are about just launching a product and that's why I think we've seen this pattern where both Amy and Intel have used Computex as a springboard for new products over the last couple of years and there is something to be said for having all the pertinent media in one place at a time focused on you know whatever the biggest hottest thing during a show is that that splash is something that to just buy it online would be very very expensive I mean Google Facebook all these companies that focus on online advertising have done a great job of commoditizing eyeballs in such a way that there's there's really no way to get them for nothing whereas when you show up at a show it's not for nothing there's a cost to attending a show but it's a finite cost and the return on that investment if you have a great exciting product that people really want to hear about can be much greater than if you were to just try to buy ads online it's also nearly impossible to measure the return on investment which is like seen as kind of a good and a bad thing oh yeah if I was a show organizer I would see that as an awesome thing oh yeah if I was a brand I'd be like sorry what is it we're spending over a million dollars on this show and we have no idea what this could mean there is no trackable return on this yeah apparently a child popped in behind me the dog yeah I didn't actually see it but I the door is popped a little bit and it wasn't before so okay yeah that's fine apparently she escaped all right so what what are what's the rumor mill say the successor to Matisse will be socket a.m. formal chip module okay that makes sense up to two CPU complex dies all right based on the Zen three microarchitecture which is supposed to be five nanometer no expected to be fabricated on a newer 7 nanometre class process by TSMC so it's the return of the pluses ladies and gentlemen and there will be an i/o controller die okay so this is not a lot of detail I have heard some other rumors that it is going to be a significant uplift in performance and that could make Intel very very nervous at this point we shot a video today comparing Intel to AMD at about the same price point but like the very top of the stack so we didn't go with AMD 64 core thread Ripper we went with their 32 core because that's where Intel has a price comparable product and I think we're going AMD for our trans code server oh I'd be a spicy video yeah so that's I it's coming it's coming it's coming man my whole life is going AMD like like not gonna like when I saw this in the doc I was like maybe that's my maybe that's my new setup maybe that's it cuz you're already having trouble sometimes with straight playing certain games right yeah and one of the things that AMD does really well even since gen 1 risin is handle multiple tasks extremely well and that's that's honestly I'm screaming that's that's probably the main thing I'm looking for in my processor right now because I'm very rarely doing like one thing I'm extremely often doing a ton of things at once so being able to massively parallel eyes things sounds fan-freakin'-tastic so yeah I mean you could probably upgrade now but if you wanted actually you could have pretty gown you're like 59 60 X aren't you yes yeah you could definitely you could definitely upgrade now you know what you should know when you're probably gonna upgrade you're probably gonna upgrade when the new ones come out and the LTTE the the linus media group store staff only store I see okay so you're gonna go third gen Rison but probably probably when the fourth gen ones come I or yeah yeah when the first German ones come out that makes sense that's a Luke move all right yeah I get it I get it I'm on to you all right oh I sold my pixel too you know yeah I know I know we've got some LTTE store updates do you mind pulling that up there so the folding at home limited-edition shirt is now our most successful limited-edition shirt ever that's really that's cool so thank you guys so much for your support and get this remember how I said that Intel was going to match the money we raised so the money that we raised we are using towards filament and a person to run our print farm so we've actually shifted we're not printing face shields anymore we're printing shoot Colin put a post on the forum with with a great update about what we're doing now unfortunately I don't remember exactly I don't even remember his his username on the forum unfortunately but it's like ear something's or something I'm going to buy this I get I get a lot of shirts from work cuz like I'm supposed to promote it on my inch or whatever but I'm gonna buy this I want this shirt I think it's cool I think the QR code thing is cool I think what it supports is cool all kind of stuff I'm gonna buy one myself the QR codes actually a little smaller than that is less interested yeah yeah and a little lower as well I think so yeah that's just um yeah I think it's more where my little aimer is right now so it's our most successful shirt ever for a limited run shirt we've raised so right remember how I said that right so what we're using the money for is funding our print farm which is producing coded related stuff if we run out of a need for that then we'll just find a cause related to Kovan and we will just donate the rest of it and wrap it up at that point but for now the print farm is is definitely valuable and there's you can you can get updates on the forum our Colin's been posting about it over there but there was also the donation that was going to go directly to folding at home where Intel said that they would match the money that we raised to directly to folding at home and to a maximum of 40 grand we have raised over 35 grand so far so we are getting super close to Intel writing a $40,000 check to folding at home because of our community's support through this shirt so super cool really proud of you guys really proud of ourselves obviously we helped a little bit this was actually I don't think she's off her probation yet so I can't give her name yet but this was actually whipped up by our new designer so it was kind of gold stone it was based on Lloyd's sort of aesthetic sensibilities and similar kind of color palette but yeah she she did this one up for us and I think it's really great she's got some she's got some cool stuff in the pipeline that's gonna be coming and hopefully I'll be able to talk about her at some point but I've had a lot of people question me but why it is that we keep people anonymous for the first three months of their employment so BC has what's called a probationary period which means that if you decide that it's not a good fit as the employer or the employee if either of you says you know what this really wasn't the right move for me there's a no-strings-attached period of three months 90 days where you can just walk away so there's there's no requirement to give notice to the employer from the employee side and there's no requirement to give severance from the employer side so that is intended to be used as as a trial period to make sure that everybody's happy with this new relationship because leaving a job and dismissing someone from a job are more complicated both of them are more complicated after the probationary period so it's best to sort those things out early on in the process so the reason that we don't mention people is because when people become public facing members of the limas Media Group team all of a sudden they start acquiring like this following and people get attached to them and we've had instances where things have not worked out and the last thing we want to do is create this expectation with our audience that this person they've developed an attachment to is going to continue to be there and then they get kind of yanked away so we we try really hard to vet our staff and make sure that they're a really good fit before we go public with them that's that's basically why and part of it I would argue is you want them to be able to see and get used to what what I guess it means to be in the public eye and kind of decide if that's actually something they want yeah it used to be something we required it used to be a requirement to work here you just had to have a public Twitter and when we did credits for example or if you were on wine show that had to be accessible there had to be some way for the public to talk to you because I considered it just part of the role of being at a social media first company like Linus Media Group nowadays I think officially that is still the policy but it's not really enforced anymore so if people want to be more out of the public eye we we respect that it was just when we were a really small team it would have been - yeah what it would have been complicated to kind of kind of have to keep people secret like we tried to do that weird thing with the nicknames but that was dumb that was my dad I liked mine Slytherin year it like sort of broke down after that yeah it's dead now it's dead now people just use their real names so anyway we're gonna be closing sails on the folding at home limited edition shirt this Sunday night we can't just keep taking orders for it forever because we have to print them and send them out at some point so if you want one you got to get your order in before the end of this weekend Pacific time also we just got a resupply of lanyards both black and orange are back in stock and we've got more stock of CPU hard drive and GPU t-shirts all sizes are now available we have stealth hoodie in stock we're finally starting to starting to come out of that supply interruption that we went through so guys you can pick up all your ltte store needs make sure though the highest priority is the folding at home shirt so make sure you got one of those in the cart there's really no drawback to ordering that one now especially because it's not going to delay your order because we're gonna go get those printed next week so it should ship in the next couple weeks or so the mystery meat shirt has become one of our most popular items which is HIGHlarious so people there's a lot of people evidently that just don't care what shirt they get they just want a mystery meat shirt well it's also really crazy cheap for the quality of shirt it is and this is like I'm completely detached from this whole situation but that's like nuts I don't think I've ever seen a creator merch I don't think you rarely see creator merch where it's $20 a shirt let alone creator merch where they're like I don't know which one but it's only 13 but what if it's like an ugly one that you don't like what one's ugly well yeah I mean none of them are ugly per se well okay what if it's one you don't like there you know what if what if pink doesn't go well with your eye color I don't know it's $13 clearly clearly you are the audience for this truth 100% yeah that's the one I would get along with the folding one how is the Linus shirt doing uh I actually don't know that's kind of a good question for Nick that was that was a Nick initiative he was like oh should we do like a hashtag Linus shirt and I was like yeah I guess so sure why not if that it's just it's the kind of thing people are gonna show up like six years from now at LTX 2025 or something I don't want to use and they're gonna be wearing this shirt and it's gonna be like heel classic right like it looks like they've never worn any other shirt like the text is all like cracked and faded now like it's barely even black it's like gray now and they're gonna be like I believe still you know hashtag Linus you nerds I love it I love it I love it but you nerds alright apparently we've sold a couple hundred lionesses there you go so it's actually it's gonna be a very exclusive club that's that's a pretty low sales shirt compared to the folding shoulder like so we raised 35 grand that's not including like the costs shirts okay yeah it's also just a cool shirt like I really like it I like to design a lot my personal favorites right now I think are that one GPU I'm still really into I love the purple on GPU stealthily obviously I love hard drive hard drive I really like hard drive hasn't been as popular as I feel like it should be a ram has been super popular I think CPU is number one though I think CPU overtook constellation at some point constellations is probably my number one then it would be processor and folding at home like trading off for two and three depending on how I'm feeling I think processor goes really well with stealth hoodie though like I really like the way that the the Diamonds the top of the diamond comes up through the with stealthy anyway we should do we have any more topics no I think it's due other topics that are just oh we could talk about the Intel XE HP GPU 500 watts so at CES we saw the low powered X CLP but now there are leaks for the high powered XE HP so the TDP is expected to be 500 watts at 48 volt what does that even mean it's expected to have a chip lit design so there's gonna be multiple dies kind of like Zen and it'll use tiles of execution units each one with up to 4 cores per EU this could end up very interesting because Nvidia seems to I mean we don't know much about their upcoming as it ampere I think is the upcoming one but they still seem to be pretty on the monolithic die bandwagon and this chip late-- approach could be disruptive it feels like the future man so we could potentially have specs like this so Intel XE HP 12.5 one tile GPU sorry what is this 512 execution units that would be 4096 cores 12.2 teraflop wait a second HP 12.5 to tile would be 300 watts oh so the first one was 150 this one would be 300 and that would be what assuming 1.25 gigahertz 20 point 48 teraflops that would be pretty good and then a four tile version 36 teraflops lower clock speed to save some power 1.1 gigahertz at 400 to 500 watts oh I just loved that 16384 course yeah it's unclear if a for tile version will show up and if it does show up it probably won't be for consumers but a 2 tile a 20 teraflop could end up being actually competitive so the 500 watt and when is server only and that's the one that requires 48 volt power oh my goodness okay well we'll see good luck Intel this could be this could be finally the thing to come in you know knocking Vidya down a peg which to be clear I'm not saying NVIDIA makes bad products they make great products and they in the absence have come in the utter absence of competition they have still like made new products at least but boy have their prices gotten out of control one concern that I have though is Intel really gonna be the one to bring in videos prices under control or they just both gonna be expensive I think they're both gonna be expensive that would be my guess with that said if Intel's hungry for market share it's not like they can't be aggressive they have been aggressive at times in the past sure I it doesn't feel like the current Intel if you know what I mean but current Intel is undergoing a bit of a culture change right now I'm willing to bet sure yeah I think that would also be fair I don't I haven't heard anything about that but I wouldn't be surprised if that was something they were very actively working on because they probably kind of need to yeah is that it super chats yeah super chats I think we ended up with quite a few super chats today so I apologize in advance but I don't think we're gonna be able to get through all of them thanks Robert male you sent a super chat like every week what are you doing Liam Kelly scrap your drawers idea ultimate work from home setup but only one person from the team can be outside at a time kovetz style and they can be only be outside for an hour okay I've never heard this guidance only one of you outside at a time for only an hour I don't think that's how the quarantine works okay like neat idea work from home setup but I don't think we're probably gonna do that anytime soon thanks is just a cheaper streaming setup yeah basically like honestly I have ever since the the streaming upgrade I have streamed a couple times from my desk but I have mostly used it for making video calls quickly and easily like I can just whip my mic over here and I'm ready to go it's been amazing Rob he wants to know if there's any flow plane updates you can share asking Rob P [Music] let me just give me one second yeah take a look status dot flow plane comm should I go look at it now - sure everything's that we new this is a new thing need it's been kind of in the works for a while so your software plane comm was was up and working a fair while ago but this is a much better version I believe this time it's kind of here to stay so if you're if you're into the kind of like stats for nerds stuff there's a little bit of that here and if you if you're just interested in like oh I'm having an issue with something or whatever else you can you can take a look on your own you can also contact customer service do whatever else you would like to do but you can also peek in here and there's the past incident summary thing which is which is interesting a lot of these won't really affect anybody but you can see the the type of stuff that we may or may not be working on and they may or may not affect you but yeah that's a that's a new thing worked on by one of the newer but at this point he's been on the team for quite a while so I wouldn't really say new member but yeah it's cool there's also you to let creators you're interested know we are reopening the gates in terms of recruitment we paused there for a little bit and where we're reaching out to some Korea right now to get things kind of moving again but if there's anyone that you think would be a good fit on floatplane I we would we would love to talk to them so you can also just contact customer support and be like hey I think this person would be a good fit for these kind of reasons and maybe we'll we'll try to reach out it's a dub session says who that well hold on hold on who the buyers LTT underwear that's like for nerds it's really comfortable it's great it's probably the best underwear I've ever had and I have also heard that from a lot of other people again I'm technically impersonal here Jamila asks is the beard here to stay no I'm definitely gonna show you what's the cutoff date this is my 40s the cutoff point you know it's the whole time you're going to yeah so when I go back to when I start working from the office again I am going to clean myself with a razor all right carp Whisperer says first live show I got to give that money to pay respect to the very good-looking limas beard wonder how the life he feels but actually she didn't like it for the first like four-five days when it was still really prickly but she but yeah it's getting a lot softer now and she actually doesn't mind it that much all right she has asked if I'm keeping it but she was asking not like you're not keeping that are you like it was you know different different tone you know David says what has been the benefits of staying at home now the benefit was that I was coughing and I shouldn't be at the office asks how many little LMG staff watch the live streams they're not supposed to it's not considered work so it's a day off I know we're in office today we have Monday off oh oh yeah we never do Fridays off because when show and that is legal in BC you can substitute a stat as long as there's yeah you're allowed to move stats around so we never take a Friday stat okay Europe just does both so that must be nice how nice for the Europeans too bad we're not European Luke yeah I I'm not complaining I didn't stuff today I did work today and I'm working Monday you know roller says love both of your beards and AMD loves the ten nanometer process okay I have no idea what that second parts about but thank you all right Ryan says why teams are not slack I think with LMG it was because we already had office 365 anyway and then teams was like another couple dollars a month to add to it flow plane does not use teams and I mean no offense to the teams team but after the limited amount of use I've had to have for interacting with - media group people I think we're probably gonna stay that way yeah yeah I probably would do that if I were you ah jay-z super great if it didn't sign me out of everything all the time yeah yeah that's pretty annoying and random note Jason sent it sent a hundred dollars to ask me to move the wind show title bar to the bottom of the screen there you are sir now I'll move it back you just got trolled you got cold you don't got trolled Jason how hard did he get trolled pretty hard pretty hard yep pretty hard I did it and then I undid it dang ouch apparently I look like I'm trying to cosplay as Luke thanks Ellen you apparently need ridiculously longer hair I need a haircut so bad it's actually here I wonder if wow wow are you just gonna go full Thor at this point like and just use long hair like there's technically two options I could do that or I considering I have no access to barbers my girlfriend will attempt to shorten it and then attempt to shorten it I like that that's nice I don't I don't know what we would do from there but if it got screwed up just buzzer down it's kind of its kind of one of the two directions I think if I wanted to go for a long hair now would be the time but I don't think I would work that well with it personally you don't think so I don't know I I think it could work for you I the whole like Norse God look could be all right I could give it a shot I don't know maybe we should strawpoll it it takes a long time to give something like that a shot but then the worst case scenario is at the end you just donate it yeah though yeah I think you would take such poor care of it that it might not be donatable I'm not kind of judge I'm not trying to be judgey here I'm just I'm just making an observation the fact that I don't know what taking good care of it would mean is probably enough well Tichenor would be a start I don't know if I've ever used that the I intentionally I'm sure you haven't looped I'm sure you have accidentally because I'm like what is this and then I realized what I did because I got the wrong bottle yeah that's that's the thing all right a girlfriend's yelling at me what apparently she buys my shampoo with conditioner and says that she takes care of my hair because of that so okay you can tell her is her name in public now or no is your like a book streamer now hey is she likes dreaming right now that was very delayed yeah her name is public okay all right actually I think she might be screaming I'm not sure okay whatever it doesn't matter the point is you can tell em Meyer she doesn't know what she's talking about because the combination shampoo conditioner is not a substitute for actual conditioner and she I'm sure she knows that she's got to know that she might be taking care of you but she's not doing a very good job Luke so you tell her I said oh no you let her know what does that because she knows I definitely wouldn't use two different things so she might as well get the combo one it's probably the best she can do yeah she's probably right alright the more the more turn chris says a hello from Denmark people are stupid 5g is fine okay PS Luke you should buy astro a40 headset no I don't think he should um yeah long as that headset existed the a40 like forever like a forties been around for an insanely long for 1,000 years and in that time human technology has improved a lot and the a40 headset as far as I can tell has not the same I remember that from like some of the first packs as I went to like this is this is a very very long time Christian Jones says rich due to buying stocks and crypto during the downturn just bought two diss plates here's the money I saved from the coupon code thanks brah also says hopefully LTX 2020 still goes on tickets bought flight TBD so you can expect some kind of news about that from us within the next couple of weeks where we're still keeping a very very close eye on things I had to make a channel to comment says you should review the pine phone from pine sixty-four when it's out we probably would like to have a look at that actually that's it that's a good idea so yes we will we'll probably do that playing phone put on tracker yep all right duly noted thank you what else we got here probably only have time for a couple more thanks Gregory Reid thanks kenetic any chance we could eventually get a limited run of hardware shirts and a light color black is not as nice to wear in hot climates that's fair black is the easiest color for us to get good supply of that's the main problem we have been hard at work on sourcing an equivalent quality shirt at a fair price from a factory that doesn't abuse its workers and we're having a hard time there you go that's the that's the 100% honest truth for why we don't have other colors it's hard for us to launch a shirt when we don't know that we're gonna have regular supply of that shirt and the distribution for our shirt partners in Canada has not been consistent enough constellation we've pulled off all at times we have at times we've been out of stock but we've mostly pulled it off just because we order massive quantities of it because it sells really well and we just stockpile it and we just kind of eat that that that cost of inventory all those shirts that's really the only way for us to do it so when we want to try to experiment and just kind of do like new and interesting stuff or like limited-run stuff it's easiest to do it in black I mean I've wanted a wider color palette for our shirts for a long time just because wearing black shirts and the thumbnails just makes them less I pot I catching and so I would like to have a more colorful wardrobe but it's just something we haven't really been able to pull off so far what about like the really light gray that seems that it's a relatively popular shirt color I think we'd um yeah we'd have to look into it yeah I mean that's more of a question for like Nick at this point I don't sure yeah yeah yeah JD Haag says there's not a console flame or right now because Sony destroyed Microsoft this generation also kind of true also kind of true if I was a Microsoft fanboy I'd probably be just kind of I'd probably have my head down for the time biding my time it look of it so far is that the new Xbox is gonna be pretty crazy okay my hunch leans toward Zimmern last Super chat from mark precision do y'all think the PS 5s five point five gigabit per second SSD will actually make a difference in game development over the series X there's a gigabit or gigabyte must be gigabyte can we kick a bit that's not fast no why would it like loading a game from a ram disk is still like CPU limited at this point even on very powerful computers like yeah having a having fast storage is like good and for certain types of games like where you're streaming data off the SSD as you move into new environments and stuff like that you might see less hitching but in terms of like changing the way game developers develop their games I kind of doubt it I mean unless it's used as like a flexing demo of some sort that Sony like tries to support yeah you know I mean because ultimately any game asset that is rendered on the screen is gonna be have to be there's gonna have to be loaded into GPU memory that's where it has to come from so that just comes down to how quickly you can move things in and out of GPU memory yeah yeah alright that's it for the show today you guys thank you for tuning in we'll see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel buh buh bye okay i'm gonna end the YouTube stream here we go trying to do things in the right order for a change I've left the YouTube stream like the event live while having also stopped OBS and it just like leave this empty event on yes genius so we'll end that
