hi there hello there this video is excited to be collaborating with audible like it's really cool but let's go ahead and start this painting while I give some recommendations in sentence this is going to be one of the paintings that is in my gallery show I'm painting it on a canvas that's a bit different than what I normally paint on it cuz normally I go for a tank a l'heure shape and this is a rectangle but it is a longer rectangle so different and the reason this is we are painting a parrot my gallery show is jungle and surprising so you'll be seeing a lot of animal paintings coming up soon the reason I chose this canvas is because parents emigrated in a bit of very along those tail Belize very very on what to do while you're painting to entertain yourself painting I am or neon today is in the cop and I've tried doing different versions of this parrot but I really wanted to do a proper one and oil paint background is still acrylic paint but the top coat is oil oil to splint nicer faceted a bit airbrushing of the paintings just to kind of soften the tones in the background that acrylic paint but the top coat to the parrot it's an oil paint I did do an undercoat yep acrylic I tend to do this because painting to look better with two coats of paint but with oil paint if you did two coats and oil that's gonna take months that's good absolutely take months well paint does take about a month to properly dry three months before you should really varnish it the reason for this is even if oil paint feels touch dry in that three months it still could shrink a little bit and if you varnished it and it starts shrinking underneath the dried varnish and it's going to crack aside varnish this painting is technically three months away from being fully finished I will varnish it then and then all the acrylic oil paint will look consistent I do love painting parents parents and tigers are probably my top two picks they're colorful and they're dramatic they're very dramatic pieces and I like working with colors I'm a painter parrots are a really extraordinary because they do contain the primary colors so there's a lovely level of vibrancy that comes along with them right now I'm keeping a very simple where he's on a mystic branch that's floating for nothing style a painting that I tend to choose in surrealism where I have a realistic element to I twist it in such a way that's not realistic I might spend more time on the background on this one later some more blades of grass and things until that varnish is on that painting is fair game [Music] so here you finished a parent painting the oil part of it into the shiny part the not shiny part is the acrylic right now I haven't painted the edges yet because I haven't decided what color I want to paint them I never the artist has their own preference I tend to like to paint yeah just because I feel like it finishes out the painting somewhere does make a point not to paint the edges and that's how you like to do it it just haven't painted it does look more painterly also if it is going into the frame there's no point to paint images I didn't go for more about when I was a gold background so this has been my description and all of the free trial coated things I do have my golden pin giveaway if you'd like a chance to win depends and they think nice comment down below we are halfway through the year and at the end of the year that's when the golden pin changes yes so if you'd like it please leave a comment I look forward to hearing from you and I love your comments thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you guys next time bye I suppose advice goodbye [Music]
