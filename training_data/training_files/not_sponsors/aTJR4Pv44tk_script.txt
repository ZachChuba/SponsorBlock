nick come over here to my cozy corner let me turn on the fan it's a little hot shooting a fun little video pretty soon here um really excited about it every once in a while we decided to shoot something a little bit different a little more a little weird this fall we happen to be doing just that in about two weeks from now we're shooting a video tentatively called a sam's spooky video [Music] no no it's every time halloween comes around and we're like hey we gotta shoot something that's scary because it's that time of the year same spooky video brace yourselves this is a tangent among tangents no it's not that long hardcore history great podcast dan carlin's hardcore history listen to it it's on podcasts listening to this little one he has called king of kings it's all about biblical times the greeks and the persians fascinating stuff a couple hundred years bc there's a king belshazzar 539 bc all right we're we're going way back for this story then what i think it's he was at a great feast king belshazzar surrounded by all his people this mysterious hand of god comes down and writes all these ancient glowing symbols on this wall and those glowing symbols tell him that he's about to lose everything he's about to lose his kingdom he's going gonna lose a great battle basically the words spell doom for him this story is actually where we get the phrase the writing on the wall reading the writing on the wall like the really obvious apparent stuff that you should take heed to you read the writing on the wall the point is is that this small story was in the context of you know all the tumultuous stuff that was happening in these biblical times but the thing that really stuck with me was this idea of this ghostly hand coming in and like scrawling something and then disappearing and i was like i gotta make something up about this that's cool so we took it from there and we made sam's spooky video definitely a little more of an expensive video than what i'm used to but time to splurge a little bit maybe on a video make something that's original not branded not having in anything to do with video games definitely a little bit of an exercise as a filmmaker here i'm pretty pretty excited about this dude i'm just i'm gonna wait for the first one you ready okay what just keep it's the biggest helicopter leasing event in the western hemisphere since 1997. anger man my mom and dad step brothers hey yeah here we go go where's my mom and dad jumanji [Music] keep playing it keep playing the rest of the movie i don't know dude i know

right well looks like niko's the winner then boys [Music] [Applause] [Music] a scholar of cinema that's me definitely watched all those movies that news names are shouted out it's not my cursory knowledge of them from like the edges of pop culture not that at all very interesting very very interesting but i feel satisfied that was a good challenge i was aimed for that from the start i didn't want it to be too easy i think we may have gotten a little too far into the obscure category so i'm a little sad about that but i think there was only a couple that wild drums i think if you guys would like to see this as categories like christmas movies or action movies or sci-fi movies or movies from a certain year who wants to watch movies let us know in the comments and we'll consider doing this again that was fun that was fun i'm down to do this again
