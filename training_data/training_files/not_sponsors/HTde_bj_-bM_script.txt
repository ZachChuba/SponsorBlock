so what if you could make a Pixar style film by yourself what look at the lineup of successful 3d animated movies and it might seem impossible Toy Story Finding Nemo The Incredibles up Despicable Me these animated films and others have solidified their place in popular culture as the technology is improved companies like Disney Pixar and DreamWorks have been steadily releasing computer generated 3d animations that have captured the attention and adoration of kids and even grown-ups everywhere consider that in 2018 alone CGI movies brought in over two billion dollars in box-office revenue and that figure doesn't even factor in the new wreckit-ralph which released to huge numbers this week plus a new spider-man flick due out next month these two could potentially draw in well over another billion not to mention the unspeakable amount in home movie sales toys and merchandise and you know the occasional Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade blimps point is 3d animated movies even the not so good ones rake in a ton of money and they're here to stay and while making a live-action independent film isn't too out of the question these days making a movie grounded in CGI appears at least on the surface too much for the average creator to handle traditionally the biggest hurdle to making animated movies has been that compared to live-action they take a much longer time to produce after all you need a skilled team of animators working for a long space of time and the technological constraints to rendering quality images means your production schedule will undoubtedly take several years longer than shooting a film in the real world and traditionally speaking CGI films can only be made by successful animation houses with top-notch talent think of all the complicated action motion capture set and character design and the time needed to render every frame to perfection do-it-yourself Pixar seems like an impossible dream right well what if I told you that all of this is changing you're probably aware that live-action films went through an independent revolution when the technology needed to make such movies became available to smaller teams and eventually individual artists nowadays the average American walks around with a phone in their pocket that has way more capabilities than film cameras head during Hollywood's golden age modern platforms like YouTube have made it to where essentially anyone can become a filmmaker if they're willing to learn the craft but you might not know is that over the past decade the same revolution has slowly yet surely been happening for 3d animation the technology needed to produce CGI films previously kept out of the hands of the common creator is becoming ubiquitous it might sound crazy but with every passing day it's becoming easier and easier to create your own animated movie we can lay this DIY revolution at the feet of three main things improvements to hardware software and the development of online communities in terms of hardware you don't have to have been alive for too long to know that home computer specs are continuously improving becoming more powerful and affordable day after day the hardware used to design many popular 3d films is becoming more powerful and affordable as well with more bang for your buck technologies like facial and body motion capture are now available to independent creators tools that at one time were reserved only for top-end Studios can now be picked up for the price of a buy end DSLR and used by anybody even something as seemingly complicated as a render farm a high performance cluster of computers meant to print the fully realized frames of each animation can be rented and used for a relatively low cost there was a time when this type of hardware was only available inside of a Hollywood studio but now if you the indie creator want it you can get it we live in a world where even cell phones have enough processing power to create three-dimensional computer-generated imagery you can literally make an animated movie in the palm of your hand these gizmos and gadgets they'll only continue to improve as the years go by and this is a win for every DIY animator out there when you couple these innovations with the advancements in animation software the possibilities branch out even further 3d applications are cheaper more powerful and more user-friendly than ever big-name software packages like Maya Max and cinema 4d are no longer reserved for multi-million dollar movie studios even more affordable options like iclone Daz and poser are these days bundled with third-party applications that can take renders from these packages to the next level and there are plenty of free options as well source filmmaker blender and even plot agon if used right can produce stunning images and powerful stories there was a time when animation technologies like ray tracing hair and cloth simulation accelerated global illumination and subsurface scattering were simply unheard of for a one animator production but now if even a low-end animation application lacks any of these things the animator will shake their head in disappointment the fact that this amazing animation software is available for free is astounding for me to think about I mean even complicated technology like facial mocap can be found on an iPhone my assistant and I can put computer-generated emoji over our faces in real time during our weekly production meetings things have come a very long way now factor in that each of these applications has spawned their own dedicated communities geared toward continually pushing the technology to its absolute limit you'll start to realize very quickly the potential obviously online distribution platforms like YouTube Vimeo and other video on-demand services mean that getting your CGI movie in front of an audience is easy-peasy but the real benefit comes from the countless amounts of fellow animators that now band together over the World Wide Web CGI communities share assets tips and tricks and work collaboratively to produce high-quality projects if you aren't a modeler for instance there are plenty of online services that can provide you with cinema quality characters and scenes for little to no cost maybe you aren't the best animator no worries readily made animation packages can be easily poured it into rigged models and within no time at all you'll have a fully realized 3d animated character before your eyes and there's an entire community to help you every step of the way for those who prefer to go it alone user generated online tutorials are readily available for practically any kind of hardware or software related question one may have the point is getting into 3d animation is easier than ever when I started the educational literature was extremely limited practically anything I wanted to do I had to learn through trial and error often that meant learning how to do things the wrong way today if you need to know how to do something in a 3d program you can check extensive software documentation plug your question into Google or if all else fails just hop on to an animator forum and straight-up ask before you know it somebody will put you on the right track and you'll be one step closer to producing your masterpiece all of these factors mean that when it comes to making a 3d animated movie it's no longer a question of how much money is in your pocket but instead how much time you're willing to invest the next great generation of animators is out there they're working from home honing their craft slowly yet surely plugging away and creating beautiful works of art that could only have been dreamt of just a decade ago and the good news is if you want to join them you don't have to go looking very far these days they're only a click away
