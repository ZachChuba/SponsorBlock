so the next few videos are gonna be a bit different if you've watched my channel or followed me on social for long enough you've probably realized that I don't really like making music lists there's a whole host of reasons behind that but that's not what we're here for we can get into that some other day we're here because I'm gonna make a list kind of we only end a decade once every 10 years so when it comes round it creates a time to reflect on the years we just experienced together so I'm gonna use this opportunity to create a list at these times a lot of people like doing rankings of best albums of the decade or things like that and that's not what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna do a kind of more personal subjective list it's gonna look at five artists who define the 2010s in my mind seeing as the decade encompasses my entire adult life the 2010s were kind of a big deal for me they saw me graduate high school graduate university start a YouTube channel have that YouTube channel become my job move across the country and get engaged naturally I have some thoughts on the music that was the soundtrack to all of these events and I would really like to share that with you so over the next five videos I'm gonna discuss five artists and how I think they define the last decade this isn't necessarily to say they were the greatest artists of the decade nor is it to say they were the only ones that were important it's just a list of five artists that I thought really changed the world over the last ten years so here's the five artists in question David Bowie Taylor Swift Kanye West Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar over the next five weeks I'm gonna release a video on each of these artists explaining what I think they meant to the decade if you want to contribute I'd love to hear what artists to find the 2010s in your mind honestly I think will be awesome to turn the comment sections into a collection of your guys thoughts on the ten years we just made it through and if you want to chat more about it you should join the polyphonic discord I'll put a link for that down in the and I hope you're enjoying it and there's one more thing that I wanted to tell you guys about I've started making art over October I did my own spin on inktober and released a bunch of digital artwork pieces on my Instagram I've been really enjoying making this art so I'm gonna keep posting new art on my Instagram at watch polyphonic this is pretty much completely unrelated to my youtube channel but it's a ton of fun and I'm pretty proud of these visuals so check them out if you like cool pictures I guess so that's basically it for this video but before I go I just want to thank you all so much your guys support lets me do fun weird things and it really lets my channel keep growing I especially want to thank my supporters on patreon and those who have already signed up for nebula working with music on YouTube is an endless uphill battle I think it's really important to use clips of the music that I'm talking about in my videos but that usually means that Sony Music Entertainment or Universal Music Group claimed my ad revenue even though my usage of these songs is pretty much the definition of fair use sometimes they even claim the song if they don't have the rights to it like the public domain recording of the Entertainer that I used in my Scott Joplin video so because of this my Adsense revenue is pretty limited which means those who support me on patreon or Nebula really go a long way to helping keep the channel alive and tune in next week to see why I decided to include a man born in 1947 in my list of artists that defined the 2010s thanks again I guess by I'm really bad at sign offs in these talking type videos
