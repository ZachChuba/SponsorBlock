hey everybody I'm peanutbutter gamer and I decided to branch out so welcome to my new cooking show now welcome to my new show where I take pictures of animals I love animals now welcome to my new show about hunting now I'm doing a swimming show except that I forgot that I don't know how to swim video games oh wow the top 10 weirdest spin-off games hey mega man soccer dr. wily and crew are up to their old evil tricks again and mega man's gonna stop with soccer it's the perfect plan I've always loved this game even though it's not really very good the coolest part of the game is that when you beat a team one of their members joins your squad they all have different strengths and weaknesses though it changes up the somewhat dull gameplay of it why there are eight mega mans and eight fire man's running around on the field I have no idea and no it doesn't explain itself don't bother asking but who cares I'm in the final match versus dr. wily there's only a few seconds left and he's up by one how will I ever pull this out Oh with a last-second goal what a brilliant finish and then we beat him in the penalty shootout 42 what an amazing come from behind victory that's it this is not good he's been affected by the evil energy die soon [Music] poor cry three Blood Dragon far cry 3 was actually one of my favorite games that released in 2012 I love the environments I love the palm trees the beaches I love my sharks my alligators I pretty much love freaking everything about it and you know my favorite part is that one part where you shoot guns that was a pretty cool those are pretty good one that is a good part of it far cry 4 on the other hand was pretty disappointing them it just felt kind of uninspired and rushed except for the helicopter thing that part I liked but you know what didn't suck Far Cry 3 blood dragon you know the game I was talking about a minute ago but then instantly stop talking about in lieu of my sudden desire to complain about Far Cry 4 with that game okay I'm getting incredibly off track here Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon it's an 80s action movie inspired spin-off of Far Cry and it's weird and also awesome uncharted fight for fortune oh right an uncharted game I love Uncharted running around shooting people climbing on stuff explosions yeah oh it's a car game for the PS Vita okay pac-man one of the most successful arcade games ever made so where do they go from there oh I know let's make him walk around and do chores that's fun right well it actually is kind of fun assuming you have the patience for it back man to the new adventure starring pac-man the super cool hero of this game and you know he must really be cool if they had to specify it via text that man may have appeared to be pretty capable and on top of things in the arcade game but in the new adventures he's anything but those things you know in fact he's kind of dumb if you want him to do something you're gonna have to spell it out and sometimes even manipulate him into doing it but honestly it's hard to even want to help him at all because he's kind of a huge jerk he steals things damages property and kills people sometimes for no reason at all and without you telling him to do it and he even verbally abuses his poor little dog but uh-oh pac-man Karma Yoshi's Safari for the Super Nintendo is a game that utilizes the Super NES superscope yes and yes his version of the duck hunt gun the game consists of Mario grabbing a bazooka hopping onto Yoshi and shooting the crap out of people that's literally all you do in the whole game next is playing video games just a little too hard then I have the perfect thing for you Wow pokemon channel thanks so much yes pokemon channel the game that really isn't a game at all some Magnemite delivered me my very first Pokemon Channel TV and I just can't wait to play and by play I mean not play anything and instead sit here and watch the TV anime all the way through thanks professor Oh after 10 minutes of some Pichu anime Pikachu joins you for basically no reason at all as far as I can tell and you continue to watch more TV that is the whole game there's a quiz channel that you can't even participate in a news channel hosted by Psyduck and me ever seen Wow Meowth that was a really good job and a workout channel with Smoochum [Music] [Music] and you can also buy stuff on the Shopping Network and collect cards nice cards are very nice yeah again thank you professor oak for the help and yes what a nice card it is I especially like how there's no background he's not centered at all and his face is being covered up by his name and those completely unnecessary white lines that look terrible really add a lot to the niceness as well yes very nice just kidding it sucks House of the Dead is a game where you shoot well dead people I actually used to play it all the time in arcades and bowling alleys as a kid but then they made a spin-off of the series for the Dreamcast called typing of the Dead yes typing you kill zombies by typing at them and they even walk around with keyboards and Dreamcast strapped to their back but as ridiculous and hilarious as all that is the most entertaining part to me is the voice acting thank you for rescuing people of the AMS I am Goldman I don't want to die my god Mario and Sonic bitter rivals since the early 90s but they were destined to finally meet in the ultimate crossover game that everybody I mean nobody asked for Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games the best video game ever made let's go you can do it Ouija you can beat Sonic at a run all you have to do is believe in your heart and soul you're supposed to play as characters from either the Mario or Sonic universe but it looks like you can also play as a meet and I know which one I'm picking come on bro Jared you can do it just try a little harder than that alright you got it ah so close better luck next time man I guess you're just not as good at video games as me none of the minigames are fun at all and that's not a good thing considering that's all there is to do do you like pressing buttons quickly how about waggling motion controls no well that's too bad let's take a look at the ping pong minigame Wii Sports Resort ping pong game is somewhat intuitive you can control where you want the ball to go the speed of the shot and you can even put a spin on it in Mario and Sonic you can do none of that it doesn't even matter which direction you swing is that very good what [Applause] probably the most fun game to me was skeet and it was also the only one that I had any difficulty with at all although I've got to say the image of Luigi angrily walking towards me with a gun is not really something I needed in my life and oh yeah the game also wouldn't let me name my safe file Pheebs because it had the word pee in it I just thought that was worth mentioning dance dance revelution mario mix waluigi i mean i wonder who it could be stole some music keys or something stupid like that and only mauro the dancing feed can save the day probably or Luigi yep let's just go with him Mario was busy doing something I don't know more important than dancing we've got to save the world but oh no the rivers blocking away how inconvenient for us but according to toad if we do a little dance something might happen and we can cross the river or we could just get on a boat which they literally end up doing anyway so what was the point of the dancing [Music] wait everyone's watching me I gotta say this is a pretty creepy thing to hear especially when you're playing a dancing game by yourself in your underwear you know it's hard to look at the screen when you're actually playing and focusing on the arrows but now that I'm looking back at this footage Luigi's got some pretty sweet moves all right Luigi dance yeah I'm feeling you just envision yourself as a gif on tumblr you're doing it man you're gonna be it's just too bad that while playing in reality you look more like this and at number one tingles freshly-picked Rosie whoopee land yes out of all the characters in zelda that could have had their own spin-off game they chose tingle but believe it or not it's actually a pretty fun game i've known as tingles rosie rupee land for a good while now but seeing as how it never released in the US i didn't know too much about it i used to think it was just a puzzle game or something like that but it turns out that it's a lot like a normal zelda game well a normal zelda game where do you play is tingle Navi is a purple cloth fairy with big boobies and you fight bosses that look like this but other than that it's basically the same thing the whole point of the game is to get rubies basically everyone in the game is obsessed with them especially the first character you meet uncle Ruby who's just a giant skin color droopy with a face and a body he convinces you that it's your destiny to go to Ruby land a place that's virtually paradise on earth but in order to do that you've got to give him lots of money okay sounds super legit totally not a scam at all after you beat the first boss and give him 1000 rupees he goes from in the clouds in his underwear to in his own room and fully clothed hmm suspicious even the fairy lady makes a point to tell you that you look so cool when he's the rubies into the pool oh yeah you just keep chasing your rupee land dreams tingle I sure it's all gonna work out great this below and thanks for listening bye bye hey everybody again thank you so much for watching it really does mean a lot to me if you want
