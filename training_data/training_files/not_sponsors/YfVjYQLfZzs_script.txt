up until the mid-1800s most people thought that when you made babies the babies received a blend of characteristics like say if someone with black hair and blonde hair had a baby then it would have brown hair this was known as blending inheritance but blending inheritance was and is observably wrong but luckily Gregor Mendel who is known as the father of genetics came along just in the nick of time to investigate inheritance by carrying out breeding experiments on peat plants he found that characteristics were determined by factors that were inherited which did not blend together Mendel discovered that when he crossed white flower in purple flower pea plants the result was not a blend but rather than being a mix of the two all the P plans were purple flowered when Mendel fertilized those purple pea plants he found that out of every four flowers one was white what he called factors we now call genes so Mendel also found that there are alternative forms of factors that account for variations in inherited characteristics and those alternative forms of factors or alternative forms of genes are called alleles so one form of a gene or one allele of a gene will be for white flowers and another would be for purple flowers so both genes would result in a color but which allele is expressed is what determines which color it will be for each biological trait an organism inherits two alleles one from each parent you always have two alleles for each gene these alleles may be the same or different so you would have inherited two alleles for your hair color one from each parent but how is one picture over the other alleles are represented by letters capital and lowercase and the combination of alleles present in the gene or the combination of letters is called genotype and how it is expressed is called a phenotype so say having brown hair alleles can either be dominant or recessive with dominant alleles being represented by capital letters and recessive allele is being represented by lowercase letters suggest as an example if you inherited two dominant alleles say both for a purple hair than you would have purple hair if you inherited one dominant allele for purple hair one recessive allele for pink hair than you would have purple hair but if you inherited two recessive alleles for pink hair then you would have pink hair and if you inherited two dominant or two recessive alleles and you are homozygous for that gene and if you inherited one of each so one dominant and one recessive then you are heterozygous for that gene so the dominant ally is the one that you know dominates whereas the recessive allele will need to be backed up by another recessive allele in order to be expressed but all that being said most characteristics are controlled by several genes working together but if only one gene is involved as is the case with things such as your eye color and the shape of your earlobes then it is called mono hybrid inheritance and punnett squares can be used to predict mono hybrid inheritance so punnett squares or exactly as they sound they're pretty much just squares boy fetch like a wooden dough so in this scenario I'm gonna put a big P for purple hair and a little P for pink hair and I'm gonna put mmm two big ones down the side and two little ones even though they're gonna kind of look the same as each other so in this scenario we're gonna put a big P little P so this one comes from here and this this one comes from down here so the one on the left is a big P and on the right is a little P because you take one from each and this one is also the same these are all the same in this scenario each possible outcome results in purple hair because the dominant allele which is here is present in every cross so again so let's try another one I'm gonna change it up a little bit this time and I'm gonna put just one big P so one dominant allele up or down the side so in this case we've got that one that one same again but in this one we've got two new piece another tune in place so in this scenario you have a one in two chance of getting purple hair or pink hair and let's take one more example we're gonna change this one to a big pay so in this case we're gonna have two dominant ones here one dominant and one little one dominant and one little and so in this case we've got two dominant here which means purple hair we've got one dominant here which still means purple hair one dominant here would still mean purple hair but this one is of course pink hair so you've got two little recessive ones and in this scenario you have a 75% chance of having purple hair and only a 25% chance of having pink hair this video was brought following the link in the description below and start learning today me and how it Tillery took me an hour corrected
