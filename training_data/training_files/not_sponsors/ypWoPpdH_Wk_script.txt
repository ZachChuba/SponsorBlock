oops what's up everybody my name is scott and you're watching kentucky ballistics below so for today's video we have a 55 pound anvil and we're gonna see how it holds up against the 50 bmg aka the 50 cal this thing is very heavy and i believe it's made out of cast iron normally we would start out with a small caliber and work our way up to the 50 but i really don't see any reason to shoot this with a 22 long rifle or nine millimeter or anything like that because i know it's not going to do anything to this anvil so today we're just going to do rifles and we're going to go backwards we're going to start out with the 50 and then work our way down we're going to be about 200 yards back i've already got the anvil set up it's at a slight angle that way if we have a ricochet it doesn't come back and hit me it's going to ricochet off that way into the woods so now let's get the 50 set up and get started okay we have the cerbu r 50 set up and we're going to start out with a blue tip this is a pure incendiary round [Applause] i am not sure if i hit the cinder block or if i hit the anvil let's go find out so it looks like i just hit the cinder block i was holding about right here with the rifle and we hit the cinder block so we know we are shooting low so we're going to need to aim a little higher and hopefully we hit the anvil this time [Music] we hit it that time okay let's see what kind of damage we did we flipped our anvil over all right well it doesn't look like we went very deep into the anvil we chipped off a pretty good chunk and look at all the black on this anvil now where that incendiary round went off and burned the surface of this anvil pretty cool okay so we use the blue tip now let's use a silver and red tip armor piercing incendiary tracer let's go check that out man so here's where we hit and it looks like we actually made it through the anvil a little bit we come out the side right here you can see through the hole that's pretty cool so now that we've shot it with an incendiary and an armor-piercing incendiary tracer we can tell that the armor piercing around is definitely doing a lot more damage to this anvil it actually managed to push into the anvil and come out the side now that we've shot the side of this thing let's set it upright and see if we can hit this flat spot here it is so cold these next few months are going to be miserable absolutely miserable all right so we used a blue incendiary round we used a silver and red tip armor piercing incendiary tracer now let's shoot it with a silver tip this is an armor-piercing incendiary i should have brought a pad gravel's killing my knee or i guess i could just take some tri-acting you know try acting like a man oh man oh wow you can see where that 50 cut down into that anvil that is awesome it's like my whole pinky finger down into the anvil that's impressive i think that before we shoot it with anything else we need to shoot it with the 50 bmg one more time armor piercing incendiary tracer and see if we can hit in this area okay last shot with the 50 bmg and again we're going to use the silver and red tip armor piercing incendiary tracer oh okay well we have some anvil all the way over here we broke off a chunk here's a little bit right here little pieces on the ground right there so it looks like the bullet went into the anvil and then you can see it kind of curved off and shot out the side i'd say this thing is pretty tough i mean we've hit it four times with the 50 and it's still holding up pretty well okay now we're going to shoot the amble with a few more calibers i wanted to show you this gun rack that holdup display sent to us it's really nice for filming when you bring a lot of rifles out this one holds six i like all the rubber coating on this so it's not gonna scratch your barrels it folds up and also it breaks down into like three pieces so it's really easy to take with you a big thank you to hold up displays for sending this out to us this is gonna be really useful on the channel be sure and check them out i'm going to leave a link in the description down below okay now let's hit that anvil with a 338 lapua this is a savage 111 long range hunter and we're going to be loaded up with some 250 grain full metal jackets well the 338 lapua did a little bit of damage didn't it put a nice little crater in that nice all right now let's use a 30 out six it's a ruger american rifle and we're going to be loaded up with some 180 grain bullets [Applause] [Music] okay so i shot twice i nicked it and then i hit it right here but both times we put pretty good dents in that anvil so now i'd like to introduce you to the newest addition to the channel we have an fn scar heavy 308 this thing is beautiful very very cool gun so excited about this thing all right that's enough talking about the gun we're loaded up with some 150 grain full metal jackets and again these are 308 i think i hit it so here's where we hit with 308 we've made a pretty good crater right there and then we hit the top and we chip some of the animal off okay let's shoot it one or two more times we have an ak-47 and we're loaded up with some full metal jackets these are 7.62 by 39. okay so there's where we hit with the ak it seems like all these rifles are kind of the same you've got 338 lapua 308 30 odd 6 7.62 by 39 they're not really doing a whole lot to this anvil they are putting some pretty good craters in it but no real damage by the way if you're wondering why you haven't had a close-up shot when i'm shooting it with these last few rifles because that camera down there crapped out sorry the cold has not been kind to these batteries all right lastly we're going to hit it with an ar-15 we're loaded up with some grain 556. okay so the 556 didn't even knock the anvil over so we had good hits here here and here again not a whole lot of difference the depth on these hits are all about the same some are a little wider like the 308 the 338 lapua but not really doing a whole lot this anvil all in all i would say that this thing is pretty darn tough all right that's it for today i hope you enjoyed the video again a big
