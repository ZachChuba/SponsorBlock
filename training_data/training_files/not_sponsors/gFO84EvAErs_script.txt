I used to make YouTube videos but now that feels like a lifetime ago I had this one series all about action movies it's been a year since the last episode maybe more now I'm a tenured professor at a small liberal arts college teaching the youth about cinema do I miss the videos could anything convince me to go back I don't think so I like my new life [Music] you need to make another installment of your blue flames special series or your beloved roommate dies [Music] so Patrick you're working again I'm just sorting some things out people keep asking me if I'm going to make another blue flame special and I haven't really had an answer but now yeah I'm thinking I'm going to make another blue flame special episode so this is it now haha so he really hires someone to do this every time he has to make a new video yep something he does to get motivated alright [Music] blame special largest son okay we're back and we've got a blue light up here because it's blue flames special today we're talking about the John wick movies specifically John wicks action these are some of my favorite action movies of the 21st century and I would argue what some of the most important as well how importance well who explained that it's time for another installment of the history of cinema with your host Patrick Williams okay I've got my tweed jacket on so let's talk about some film history in most John Rah's there are certain turning points movies that arrive with such a seismic impact that you can look at the landscape of cinema as the time before them and the time after the action genre is a great example in 1988 diehard arrived marking a shift away from the muscle-bound giant guns Superman era and into one with more human protagonists almost always the underdog often trapped in a single location then in 1999 there was the matrix suddenly martial arts were everywhere in Hollywood action movies even that three musketeers movie from 2001 everything was in slow motion hyper stylized and wearing black leather and then the Jason Bourne movies arrived and the shaky-cam era was born there isn't another singular turning point for several years the rise of superhero movies led to a rapid increase in CGI heavy action that still dominates much of action cinema but then in 2014 we had our next major action landmark the relatively low-budget revenge movie John wick starring a then 49 year old Keanu Reeves John wick didn't exactly introduce a bold new aesthetic choice in the way The Matrix did instead it synthesized several aspects of action we'd seen before delivered in a way that felt new the emphasis was on the choreography but it wasn't balletic and stylized like a Hong Kong martial arts movie it was fast and functional it combined guns with hand-to-hand combat so shootouts were now up close and personal and of course the action was shot in clear long wide shots allowing to see everything that was going on it was the opposite of shaky-cam it was the dawn of a new era the wick era that's not the official name I just made it up now so what is the secret of John wicks action is it as simple as pulling the camera back wide and filming a bunch of people getting shot in the head or is there more and dare I even say it are there ways John wicks action could be improved what I'm trying to say is I watched every action scene in the John wick movies like 20 times and took way too many notes and these are my findings okay the criteria we're going to be grading each action scene in four categories each given a numerical score out of five because as we all know the best way to discuss and critique art is with totally arbitrary subjective numbers category one is story by this I mean why is the action scene happening what's the motivation behind it what does it mean for John wick as a character and how well does the scene actually tell a story within itself category two is clarity do we understand the stakes and objectives and just like what is happening can we see all the action clearly do we understand the geography of the scene do we know who is who category three is creativity does the action do anything surprising that we haven't seen before how cool are the kills how exciting is the choreography does the action use the setting and props in unique ways and finally category four is the wow factor how much does the scene make us go woah are [ __ ] yeah are do we clench our teeth or yell at the screen do we feel something okay we're kicking this off with the original 2014 John wick from directors chads2 house key and David leach the action in this movie is a little bit different from the other two just because of the way the story is designed see the first half-hour of this movie has no action but it's all there to set up and motivate the action for the rest of the film we meet John wick we learned that his wife died but left him the world's most adorable puppy he also has a cool car we empathize with him and care about him and we care about that puppy so when some shitty gangsters killed a puppy beat up John and steal his car we want exactly what he wants revenge it's what drives all the action it's a pure simple revenge movie john has one goal and that's to kill the guy responsible for taking the one good thing in his life so now on to the action by the time the team of bad guys comes to John's house to kill him we are overflowing with bloodlust we need to see some people get punished for what happened plus we just heard this huge insane speech about how John wick is the deadliest man alive so we're dying to see him in action the last half hour has been one huge build-up to this by John wick Stander's this is a pretty tame scene but since it's the first action scene in the series it's mind-blowing the shots are long and wide and we can see all the choreography there's a sense of progress as he takes out the enemies we know there are about 10 guys so as each one goes down we know we're closer to the end and yeah it doesn't get as crazy as later scenes but you've got that great move where he shoots the guy through the wall and the final part where the shot holds forever as he just tries to stab that guy in the chest [Music] okay now we're getting to the good stuff in the red circle Club John is hunting this is the real revenge part since he has a clear target Joseph the dirty little rat man who killed his puppy so the entire sequence is driven by John just trying to get to Yosef and murder him and this takes us from the bath house to a dance floor to the upper level of the club and then back down to the dance floor there are so many stages to the action here with new characters being introduced and it really has a beginning a middle and an end it's a full story plus we get a mini-boss which makes any action seem better you love to see it it's told super clearly we always know where John is in relation to Yosef and this is where the movie gets really wild it's just non-stop insane creative kills the part where he reloads the foot shot he grabs the guy's beard and then shoots him in the head [Music] there's a fun B plot with Perkins running through the movie that builds on the mythology of the world this fight scene is pretty small but it's well-executed and really clearly staged this is the kind of fight most other action movies would make shakey over edited and incomprehensible and John wick makes it totally clear [Music] so here we have a shootouts a little break a fight scene a chase and then more of a shootout this one is kind of a nice mix of all the different kinds of action in the movie it doesn't get quite as nuts as the best parts do but this is one of my favourite shops in the whole film [Music] so once again John is out for revenge on one guy we've got the strong motivation a clear sense of progress as he works his way through the enemy is to get to Vigo plus the action evolves and goes through multiple phases and the car adds so many new glorious ways to kill bad guys the best obviously is this one I got a doc some points for the wow factor though this is the finale of the whole movie and it's fun but that final fight really needs some more crazy moves it's too chill for John wick who deserves to finish this up in a truly spectacular fashion I love that it starts raining very dramatic but we need more than just a fistfight with an old man [Music] oh and by the way if you want one of these mugs for yourself our official merch store is now open the link is in the description okay now it's on to chapter two which has double the budget and maybe double the fun it's probably not worth rating the brief little opening chase scenes it's not even really a full scene but I will anyway because of nothing else I commit way too hard to my stupid ideas this part it's a fun intro I like it [Music] okay here we go this is like a totally roided-up version of the finale of the first movie it's better in almost every way except that it's missing a part where John wet shoots the guy through the roof of the car but every so often it cuts to Peter Stormare adjust reacting to the sounds of the scene and every action movie should have that this is like an epilogue to the first movie so the same motivation carries over John wick is getting back the beloved car that the bad guys took from him we've got a clear goal to set up some bonkers stunt work that just looks so painful doing something like this in one shot really sells it in a way that cutting between multiple shots would not seriously how did people not get like paralyzed from this I have two issues with the scene first while the action is all shot really clearly I don't fully understand the geography of the warehouse so I know he's trying to escape but I don't know where the exit is so when he drives out into that empty lot it took me a minute to realize that he didn't actually get away and has to go back through the warehouse the other issue is that the scene just kind of ends when he runs out of guys to beat up every good action scene tells a story and this one has a bit of an anti climactic ending [Music] okay here is where I'm going to give one of my hotter takes John wick is way less interesting when using high-powered assault rifles they don't have the delicate accuracy of pistols they mean more distance between John and the enemies and they make the action feel more impersonal assault rifles are bad in real life and should be banned Plus now they're messing up my wonderful John wick movies the only time they're good is in the bank-robbery scene in heat other than that they suck and now I can't wait to get 300 angry comments about that one line the story here starts strong John needs to escape from an army of Italian assassins but once he's in the catacombs we don't know where he's going so it just becomes this repetitive routine of running down a new tunnel gunning down new bad guys then repeat we can see the action just fine but there are so many tunnels that is not clear he's making any progress also here's something that's very important the perspective on the action a lot of the scene is shot with the camera facing John wick as he moves toward us so we see him but not what he sees enemies will enter the frame only to immediately die compare this to when the camera is behind him we see what he sees so we register the enemies much earlier there's danger their actual obstacles so instead of their deaths just being sudden out of nowhere violence there's more of a story being told look there are obviously some great moves here at the part where he spears the guy with the shotgun then reloads it and shoots him amazing but too much of it is impersonal and repetitive which John wick action scenes almost never are [Music] okay this fight with casseon is immediately a big improvement first of all you've got another mini-boss you love to see it but casseon has his own motivation since he wants revenge on John for killing his boss real emotional stakes and the scene is funny they fall down so many stairs and it looks so painful I love this what good movies [Music] the montage of assassins around New York trying to kill John wick isn't really a traditional action scene since it's cross-cutting between all of them it means they all happen at different times so it kind of takes away any tension but it's great at everything else we get a great variety of different characters and builds on the world of assassins and one more thing what was it oh oh right yeah uh he kills two guys with a [ __ ] pencil Magnificence [Music] that montage is really just a setup for this a shootout that starts at Lincoln Center teleports to the oculus five miles away questionable geography and then turns into a fight on the path train it's a culmination of the running subplot with casseon and just a great little story the action has different stages it has quiet sections and loud sections and again it's funny as intense and ultra violent as these movies are they never forget to put comedy in the action and it makes them so much better and John wick doesn't move that I guess would best be described as a taint stab I don't know I cringe every time I see it [Music] okay now we're back in the classic territory of the first movie revenge and nothing motivates a John wick action scene better than revenge it gives John one specific goal makes the stakes extremely clear and gives the scene a constant feeling of progress through the whole scene we see Santino moving through a room then John following look here's the perfect formula for a John wick action scene give John a Glock put him in a cool location with one guy he wants to kill and put an army of henchmen between them also maybe add knives but we'll get to that soon the biggest missed opportunity here is at the setup of John only having seven bullets rules and that gets discarded pretty quickly but beyond that we've got a ton of great kills the coolest location in the whole series the Hall of Mirrors which creates some real suspense as John tries to navigate his way through and the scene introduces one of the all-time great John wick moves throwing an empty gun at an enemy plus another mini-boss you love to see it [Music] Oh guys do you know what time it is I think it's Parabellum time okay I love this fight we get a whole little story here Ernest shows up and immediately feels like a real interesting character and there's clearly a history between him and John this is a fight where John wet kills a seven-foot four man with a book let me repeat that he kills a giant with a book he breaks his jaw and he breaks his neck with a book I love this movie I love this movie [Music] when we talk about the great movie scenes of the decade you've got the damn scene and burning the opening scene of the social network the Cheetos and water scene and Magic Mike double-xl the accordion scene in holy motors the birth of the universe in The Tree of Life and the knife museum scene in genre chapter three it has the simplest setup in the world some guys try to kill John wick so he runs into what appears to be a museum for knives and over the next few minutes no scene in 2019 made me laugh gasps scream and clap as much as this one it starts as a fistfight then adds knives it adds more knives and then adds axes it's a symphony of perfectly choreographed violence The Kills are horrifying and magnificent this is cinema [Music] look John wit gets a horse to kick a guy to death and then he does it again and then he rides that horse through traffic and kills bad guys on motorcycles so sure you can tell me it doesn't advance the story much or develop the character but who gives a [ __ ] this scene gave me things I have never seen before in my entire life of watching movies and for that I will be forever grateful [Music] and now I sadly have to criticize my sweet precious John wick once again this scene where John wick and Sophia and Sophia's amazing dogs have to escape from a building in Casablanca contains a lot of well staged action and some truly insane dog stunts that made me cheer in the theatre but like the catacombs shootout in Chapter two it falls into this repetitive routine where the heroes just kill endless hordes of faceless bad guys with no sense of progress the action is cool but it just keeps going and going and then eventually it's over the heroes never seem to be in danger they're just going on murder spree John wick action is great because there's almost always a point to it it's not action for the sake of action and in instances like this where it falls into that it's a little bit frustrating still those dogs are really great [Music] okay now this [Applause] is the good [ __ ] kind of like the horse seen this one just seems so dangerous and impossible to pull off that it's exciting just to watch it exist is this one of the coolest things in the history of cinema I'm going to say yes it hits at the perfect moment John wick is back in New York baby and he arrives with a bang sure he's just fighting faceless motorcycle dudes but it's such a crazy rush of energy to the movie he's sword fighting on speeding motorcycles my one complaint is that the main enemy of the movie zero is one of the guys chasing him but since all the motorcycle guys are wearing identical faceless helmets we don't know which one is him so we lose that personal connection if we could tell one of them was a real character the scene would have greater emotional stakes [Music] look John wick folks here you brought back two things I told you not to automatic rifles and endless hordes of faceless enemies you've got to start listening to me this is better than the Casablanca shootout because it keeps John wick on the defensive and it introduces a bunch of cool elements the armour on the bad guys makes them way harder to kill we get to see John and the concierge team up and the underwater shootout is cool as hell but this does become another scene that just goes on and on until it stops [Music] the problem with this final fight is that it comes after so much action that were kind of exhausted by the time it starts but it's still really good the more punishment John wick takes the better and he gets smashed through like eight dozen glass cases over the course of this fight there's a collection of fun enemies with real personality before John finally faces off against zero his own biggest fan it really earns it's big moments and kills and by having zero constantly disappearing it adds new dynamic we haven't seen before I just think it lacks the pure focused motivation and emotional stakes of the series best action scenes he doesn't know these guys and he doesn't care about them to him they're just obstacles so as great as all of this is we are not as invested as we could be [Music] so what are our findings this is gonna sound cliche but John wick action scenes are so effective because each one is a really well told story they're clever and imaginative and surprising with a perfect balance of shocking violence and physical comedy and made with the delicacy of a great musical number we're marveling at the physical feats and visual Beauty on display but what we're most engaged by is the story playing out on screen so now that we've rated every single action scene on a totally scientific scale based on criteria I made up a few minutes ago let's count down the 10 best John wick action scenes number 10 the finale on the docks number 9 the final glass room fight against zero number 8 the New York assassin montage number 7 the motorcycle sword fight number 6 the library fight number 5 the final Museum and Hall of Mirrors shootout number 4 the horses number 3 the second casseon fight number 2 the red circle shootout number 1 what else could it possibly be it's the knife museum remember is a scientific and this ranking is all factual and not up for debate at all so now that we've done the most thorough analysis of all the action in the first three John wick movies that any human on earth has ever done it's time to look ahead to the future on May 21st 2021 less than 2 years from now John wick chapter 4 antebellum Kasim's revenge hits theaters so just in case Keanu and director trans to hell ski are watching this video and looking for some ideas to keep the action exciting and fresh I compiled a list of stuff I would like to see no need to pay me these are free to use but Keanu please come on my podcast ok so John Beck needs to fight people in a bar using darts pool cues and glass bottles John wick should fight Donnie Yen in an antique furniture store I want to see a 30-minute fight with John wick fighting his way through a casino in Macau where he throws a wok full of hot oil in someone's face and shoves a stack of poker chips in someone's mouth I want to see John McFly ting a bunch of trucker mark artists on top of two moving semi trailers let's have John wick in a shootout on a speedboat but all he has our flare guns I want to see John wick kill a guy with the frisbee okay so John wick is in a wheelchair and has to fight his way out of an evil hospital with a sword and finally John wick goes to Eastern Europe to kill the real head of the high table Dracula with a [ __ ] pencil hey how's it going [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
