oh she took it there wait a second welcome back to the channel I'm Justin Burke I am the singer songwriter and vocal coach we are about to get into family hit the subscribe button and of make sure to do that let's get into this reaction come on you two let's go [Music] that was effortless and that was beautiful listen to the way that the tone will get a little more piercing if she goes up that's as she's transitioning into her upper register into her mixed voice her cords are properly adducting but when I was looking at her everything everything and so much about the voice and it makes me so excited but I won't i won't dork out on you guys anyway notice how she was so relaxed as she went up into that upper register as well that shows me that she's got great technique [Music] yes that would be me I want to be invited to one of these just so I can like geek out in the audience but anyway they have such a sweet tone such a sweet sweet tone I love it so bright [Music] oh she took it there wait a second I didn't know she had the jobs like that she did a great job transitioning into her upper register stayed right on pitch stayed control kept her breath managed everything properly that is not easy to do and I was an intricate melody and she nailed that pitch a little bit of distortion on the top there and that riff going down her agility that was spot-on that was so good the vibrato [Music] I'd invite brother at the end oh my gosh she's oh whoa whoa was closed up Mike whoa whoa what it's getting late I don't know what I'm saying at this point but that was really really good the agility to be able to nail all those notes that is not easy let me tell you that it's not easy she did a wonderful wonderful job at that [Music] oh and opened up the sound notice how she she kind of she kind of rounded out the vowel added a little warmth to the tone and added by barato at the end there she really fell nicely into the placement fell into that nice warm round bow that's not a great Oh [Applause] [Music] she oh this is like a old like Bel Canto almost like a poggio style I mean did not not not totally operatic but I'm getting like hints of the kind of old classical operatic technique but but maybe like 20 percent then 80 percent more of the contemporary more mainstream style relevance of pop culture vibe but she has some of those nice round warm vowels that you will hear in the Bel Canto approach so she's well trained [Music] [Applause] oh that diminuendo and I say the words like diminuendo that means a decrease in volume senator says she had a lot of power she added that dynamic she brought some of that power back into a not a breathy tone but but a more quiet tone so that was that also shows that she has great breath support because many times singers are doing a proper breath management the only way they can get quiet is if they let a lot of air out through the vocal folds so they don't actually have control over the muscles that are around our vocal folds in our larynx right here okay so she has full control cause she was able to keep that cord closure right she was able to keep her - dork out on you or her thigh row a retinoid muscle contracted which pulls the vocal folds together and thickens them out which gives that a little more piercing quality of sound while she was lowering the volume so I was really good sorry guys I had to dork out in there anyway keep going [Music] hmm [Music] this is sweet like just the sweetest tone you've ever heard like the kind of tone that you just want to hear before bed and you fall in love hmm as opposed to later oh nice note there [Applause] she's kind of like that the faces [Music] beautiful vibrato [Music] Yosi has got some power I did not I was thinking this was gonna be a breathy cutesy voice but sheiks coming in with some power hello [Music] that's so cute [Music] it's like perfect for Christmas time management is like Christmas children's choirs and everything reminds me of growing up my mom would always play this Christmas album over Christmas time okay I dead grass but and it was like this children's choir singing these Christmas songs and it so reminds me of this [Music] and if I brought it with the end there when she stayed right on pitch on that straight town which is great so she keeps that straight tournament as vibrato out this phrase [Music] I'm telling you they have the sweetest tones it's the kind of tone that just makes you fall in love captivates you these kpop girls groups have the sweetest vocal tones like wow it's um it's so bright so beautiful I love love it making all the guys do that I'm one of them I'm over here just like Oh a nice and narrow vowel there then whitened out the vowel on that yeah [Music] oh my gosh and so relax okay and if you guys want to learn how to sing these kinds of high notes right there's a way to do it there's a certain technique that allows you to be able to sing that kind of power while staying relaxed check out singer I will teach you exactly how to do that I'm telling you let me be let me be your vocal coach and I will show you how to do all of this and maybe one day I'll be reacting to you next that's the goal I had someone in the singer private community messaged me and say my goal is to be on the Idol stage I'm like yes okay in one year I'm gonna be reacting to you now let's go let's do this and we'll see we're gonna do it nice nice [Music] look out wide that bow look just relax and wide [Music] [Applause] hmm Oh listen day she utilizes her breath to stylize this overseas is going off now oh my gosh before she gave it a little bit of breath in between the phrasing really give a nice dynamic [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] can I be completely honest with you that I was expecting more of a breathy cutesy voice and she completely shocked me and she gave us some power she gave us soul passion she was really singing from her heart and I could tell and it sounded so good she's really had some power and amazing amazing vocal control and I kind of went off a few times within the video and I won't make this too long and continue going off but I could really speak for probably been an hour on just all the incredible techniques that she was that she was using within that performance and it just hats off to her because she has such a beautiful voice and she's well trained I'm super impressed she got a new fan today I love the group but now I love her leave me a comment let me know what you think and of course if you are new don't forget to join the family hit the subscribe button right over there and if you want to learn how to sing you've got to get on singer try that free lesson I'd love to be a vocal coach again it's 15 minutes record your voice before go through it record your voice after and you will hear an improvement even if you think I'm kidding you and I'm just telling you what you want to hear so that you'll go to my website I'd probably think the same thing too okay it's all good no I really want you to be confident in your voice that's why I make these I want you to learn how to sing I want you to be confident in your voice when you're confident in your singing not only are you actually gonna be able to live out your dreams but you're also going to be confident in every other area of life and singing is a gift that just everybody needs to have access to and I want that for you and so take that free 15 minute lesson at the very least and it will motivate you you'll be proud of yourself that you actually can improve and something that you've wanted to improve in so make sure to go check that out alright tons of love I will see you tomorrow peace it's the way you looked [Music] oh it's the way you feel [Music] it's the [Music] it's the head [Music] we found the value we found a break I can't believe it's your time stop it someone like you [Music] [Music] [Music]
