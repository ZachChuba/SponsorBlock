hey guys welcome back to my channel so it feels like forever since I've made a reaction was it just me I don't know why but it seems like June kind of flight got me used to releasing a lot of reactions and so now that July has come and I'm trying to rest I feel uneasy about resting you know so anyway so so me he's back again I feel like it's been forever as well since we've seen her since her debut song I feel like her debut song was very much a hit or miss for many people I enjoyed it like it wasn't my favorite I preferred the other song that she had on the like the single that she released I preferred that one I obviously watch the teasers and everything it sounds already very much summery so I'm very happy about this since the trend nowadays is to have a very Dyke dog concept in the summer which is not typical you know so this one sounds like it's going to be definitely more summery than some of the other releases that we've had so far all right so okay so without further that you were you're waiting for I have the captions on let's go ahead there we go but that's sound no one by 'high you know what I'm talking about it's just talking about herself I mean she's rocking that drag this sounds even more American than her debut song if that's even possible Oh oh my god [Music] the fashion gives me solo from Jenny she just caught me poor how does she know it is like I forgot I've known her my whole life [Music] the course is going to be so easily suck in your head because most of it is in English at least to me I know that this course is gonna be stuck in my head how did she do that ring ring the alarm bell whatever if you didn't tell me that that was kpop I wouldn't have known [Music] okay this song gives me a mix of like visually speaking it reminds me of solo by Jenny the song has some hints of no one is it no one is it the title by 'high and bi you know it has that tropical vibe which fits the season at the moment I'd be freaking liked this song I genuinely think that this song might appeal to a lot more people than the her debut song I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself I feel like this sound here is more generic so which isn't bad don't get me wrong but because it sounds more generic it might appeal to a broader audience honestly don't mind it like it's very much American like this vibe the the overall vibe of the music video plus the song is very much American on top of that whenever she sings in English there is this sass that is coming out and this is something that I say about a lot of like the English speakers in the kpop industry when they are delivering a line in English there is definitely a different vibe than when they are delivering it in Korean if that makes sense there is definitely a lot more attitude and sass whenever they use English and yeah I could definitely feel that your friends between her Korean and like her English one thing that I like to note is that in this track she's mostly singing which is something that I think was missing in the first one feel like a lot of people were saying that her voice was annoying in the first track and that's why they didn't like it here she's really just showcasing her vocals which is great because she has a nice voice and I feel like in this song she really is proving that she has a really really nice voice and that might also be one of the factor why I think this song might do better than her debut song I think these really speaking like the music video in itself I prefer birthday which was a lot more dynamic colorful era but I prefer this song like I feel like a mix of both would be my ideal song when I come back whatever I didn't really get the music video it feels like at the end she's like kind of like hoping over people so it's kind of like the whole hard dolls so people are the hoarders how do you call her how do you pronounce about anyways it seems to me like she's talking about herself like she's asking herself what are you waiting for but then again what do I know I don't know I don't understand anything so with that subscribe to my channel and obviously in the next video bye bye
