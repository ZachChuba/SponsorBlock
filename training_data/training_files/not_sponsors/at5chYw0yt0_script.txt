wow [Music] i made a promise i'm not going to [Music] [Music] call down your vengeance [Music] your head hey everyone and welcome to a hunt gameplay live stream uh joined today by our by our lovely iceman or rick herrick community manager in europe hey everyone and uh also ari our na community manager hey ari hiya so uh yeah as you guys seen the event started just uh about like one and a half hours ago and now we're gonna play some games for you to show off uh some of the weapons we can hopefully unlock and some of the skins and all the good stuff so uh let's dive into it with our lovely community managers and hopefully we won't suck too much so you know we will try our best if you call this lovely of course you're such a high bar for us well you guys are lovely right well i mean we try our best so we already prepared a bunch of hunters so you guys won't have to wait too much on ari because he always takes like 20 minutes to equip a hunter it's not no it's he's not normally the one that's delaying i always delay it i'm the worst for picking stuff so i actually just made hunters first for a change which was like the best thing ever well so i think we found the odd one out pence makes hunters too quickly and the rest of us make hunters in an appropriate amount of time yeah i mean yeah yeah i usually choose the same equipment so it's not too difficult for me yeah it doesn't take that long to put on a sparks and an uppercut and just hit ready exactly and how are you doing chat how do you like the events so far i've seen some of you have already reached the cap we also played some games so we are currently at 70 points together so we hope to get the the cap as well in one game so the next game we can already play with the bow and uh uh throwing axe for you guys bring the screen closer so i can i can hit those hit those headshots yeah just for the record i never use the bow uh at all and uh these other two have already tried them so you know oh and we also took some vapors just so you can see every game i i brought the hunter that had no weapons equipped because i was waiting to use it of course oh yeah i brought vapers hang on i'll i'll leave okay we gotta go do a vapor party paper party we are doing don't do drugs kids yeah okay so 125 and a 50 meter radius so the max i believe is up to 70 meters um yeah yeah i believe yeah 70 is the max and the 10 is the default well what we can do me and bench can handle the the combat and rick can just be our scout or i've seen some devs in the chat uh maybe they could spawn some weapons quickly i'll find something here look i've got a lamp i'll i'll just i'm fine we're good i thought you're gonna have a lamp and a knife or something come here i'm actually looking for a weapon for you yeah yeah i'm keeping an eye out maybe we can get you a silenced or something this is just typical of me though right [Music] we could look in the sniper towers there's a chance there yeah the tower's a good place i mean i'm sure that they'll find something and if not it's just going to be fun as hell me running around with just a knife nice make sure you make sure to look in entire oh guys we've got some we've got some stuff over dark side down to 240. yeah i'm showing it to people right so here you can see that you can actually see the uh activating item the board and we got four points yes and look you can actually see along here there's a little line through the the the ground and through the that points you in the direction of the fire oh yeah i can i'm showing that as well it looks really cool there's one further down the line too yep oh i have to use my entire shirt direction i have a i have a stamina shot with this one so at least you know i was gonna give you a stamp shot if you didn't have it i think it's really cool that um you know we kind of give the the hints and dark side now because you know uh it just it makes it did when it adds some awesome extra little bits for the event um some cool stuff to see um but you know it's just it's nice to to be able to find things quickly yeah saves you a little bit of time i don't know i had a great time finding those little uh crow jesuses oh i did too but you know sometimes they were just hard to see you know the corrosive fixes is that what the crucifix yeah the grocery fixes that's what we call or that's what i called them anyway that's only one i'm gonna need help for this emulator oh you're using just like fists yeah i literally have nothing else so i mean i have my knife but i can't stand i don't use that on him i can't stab an emulator but no no i followed you they followed you they were we called them cross fixes so it's it's you know it's all encompassing with the projectors as well i i don't know what you guys are talking about but yeah it's the there's the crow stuff from the scrapbook vector come on keep up oh okay oh i i got you yeah ben that's too far back he doesn't remember that i have no idea yeah i have a memory of five minutes i found another pyre i get to light this one i'm still looking for guns uh rig but yeah me too like i haven't found anything i another free perk well there's a hammer here uh would anyone like silent killer for free oh even charge you really are you sure i'll charge you a little bit uh ten hundred dollars ten hundred dollars man no yeah i gotta fund that i gotta film my obsession was that one of you setting off that those pros yeah yeah this is ben oh i found a hammer yeah that was me and in the chat yes the event is live and uh you can already put a play and if you choose the bow path you will have the bow unlocked that's 100 points and same goes for the throwing x what were you pinging by the way oh yeah so what was that pink right here i'm already pretty far rick just decimated a poor grunt with the sledgehammer what what was our leg group starlighting by the way uh four and a half i think oh okay yeah ooh i i brought it down a little bit you know rick's gotten too good recently oh i find your math kit but that's not really the best uh well ricky will have to box people to death it's fine it's absolutely fine i'm okay with this how much damage does that deal actually like heavy charged face that day heavy charge no it's i mean it's not strong enough you know it takes like five or six to kill an emulator with it so you know oh no some puppies puppy wow okay i can't hit him i got you i got you they're still pretty far guys should i wait for you i mean you can maybe uh can serve you check that tower ready i did it's a medkit there's a trait here go through for uh bradley and see i'm gonna just walk through it and just see if i can find oh i feel like i just heard hunters did you come in i mean it could have been me i picked up a three well we reached the daily cup good job team ah nice i thought i missed the boat we've unlocked the boat next round next game uh i think i mean throwing axe hashtag shadow hashtag pierce the shadow um no talking of that we will have a giveaway later on in this stream guys for the brand new dlc yes so please keep an eye out for that and you will be able to win some nice uh what's in the dlc called uh bayou wraith yeah yeah it is oh you tested me nice one he was [Music] and then i ran at it ben shot the barrel and then i ran at the barrel fair enough a synergy in the team ever since one of my first uh gameplay sessions with uh colga or a german community manager i've always been very scared of barrels oh please don't trap the barrel sorry oh i'm i'm trapping them on the i am who i am so ari has this tendency to trap every barrel and i always run into trap barrels too i'm trapping this oh my god oh this is good okay i'm leaving right now i'm gonna trap the one at the bottom of the stairs too so oh by the way our target is right next to the other bus so i think we should go to the butcher first that was not us that was not us those crows were not us there's people near and i still have no weapon remember the crows i did not they were from southwest 220ish no um if we can still move uh to north well i mean i can't i need to get a weapon so because i can't really do much otherwise yeah but there are some there's a big tower there i'm sure we find one in there all right okay okay that was blanc big shot at blanc yeah they are probably killing the bus there they wouldn't dare i mean they probably would you know yeah they probably would uh and uh yeah we are looking at youtube chat twitch and facebook as well but the giveaway we will have during the stream will only be on facebook and twitch just because we are unable to give out keys on youtube so if you want to participate in that please uh just join the other chat for that second so you can uh join the giveaway all right rick you got your fingers crossed i'm checking the tower yep i'm going underneath still nothing i'm nothing i'm sorry it's for real i'm mad oh i'm sure we would get something there's a tower that way too but all the way over there though dude okay yeah they are punishing the other boss two and uh it could be the same team actually let's just yeah let's just head up maybe yeah i think there are a few more sniper towers to our north as we head up to golden but so uh when you activate the wars you gain event points basically that's the only use and the first team that touches it it also lights it on fire yeah well i mean every team gets the point right but the first thing also lights it on fire i didn't think when i thought once it was interacted with you couldn't nobody else got could try i think it's like clues so you can still interact but they are not unless maybe i'm wrong but that's how my uh close your defenses okay yeah can be interacted with multiple times just the first time they're like that your crows yeah there's another big tower there i think there are also some to our east if i remember outside of arden like two of them so i'll go check some of these guys don't write give uh give a command in the chat because it's not on yet and we will tell you how to enter so just be patient it will be randomly during the stream at one point we'll give you guys a phrase or something to type uh and then uh we'll go through and pick whether it's probably after no weapon in this one either i'm checking this one oh come on no no weapon in this one you're very unlucky here here comes i am really unlucky they don't just do not want me to have a weapon there's got it there's another tower over here so are we gonna try to fight these guys now without a weapon or i mean you can i'm just gonna keep trying to find a weapon you guys want to engage oh and we could just kill them and take their weapons understand that someone leaves without weapons that would be speed yeah it will be sweet or confusing we're having both all right all right come on let's hope wow dude another ammo box if i needed ammo i'd be so happy right now lawson normally has something i mean i usually find guns everywhere normally i do as well normally i'm pretty good at finding them is there another one of those big sniper towers on uh delta i don't remember i know i know that one i don't have stamina can i just go just go to the gun i say yeah i mean it's entertaining you without the gun so it is we'll try to get your gun i love how chat uh keeps spamming giveaway yeah guys uh x-men giveaway does not do anything so okay ari are you coming with me because we are very spread out right now and like they picked up a month you know yeah i i got to golden i was gonna check through golden but here's the tower too i'll try yeah yeah i checked uh the two that are around arden no luck they banished at golden but did not take the bounty rick here's the gun for you what is it uh oh that's fine i'll take it we'll take it as a gun at this point uh you should go with the bounty from golden yeah go for it we could yeah oh blanc is coming south uh maybe i mean i think it's one team honestly probably they killed both bosses they just triggered some crows oh yeah let's wait until he gets the uh ghana then we can fight where is it up here just go up i did go up i didn't see anything turn around uh go up and do 180. it's on your back side this little shelf okay okay checking where the other bounty is all right they're just perfect straight south okay let's let's go through them first i think without bounties yeah all right i mean they will be able to see us but we want some pvp warm up die quickly rick brought his favorite weapon the winfield aperture i mean he can't take off the site right so it's fine yeah i did i wanna i i do oh that's probably better not to make noise so they don't start scanning well no no they will sorry kind of had to dogs okay uh they're going for the furthest away extract from their boss it looks like but they are pretty far we have to run yeah rick didn't bring guns to the game chad oh he's here hit that wow okay nice that was not bounty that was not bounty no no it could have been a third or solo let me see if i can find the lantern real quick that scared me because i was looking at challenges he has a boy if anyone wants he has weapons and bow and everything yeah but i'm trying to chase these bounty guys all right where is this guy uh right there somewhere he has a bow and double uh conversion i think oh more people more people someone just threw come back come back oh yeah that's the other team okay come back rick i think we love that team yeah i want them behind the rock in the back can you ping again like here okay i think that one of them is that though so oh no i killed the regular one who is shooting at me but that's two so far i assume there's a third ring yeah over there i just saw him you didn't i think so yeah wait i don't know that was harry was it now you can take the weapons at least yeah spark sniper upper and officer i feel like rick has to take the ball i mean where's the bow guy he's way back though isn't it on the other side of this mound uh nice one all right by the way thank you he's in the area yeah he's there incendiary incendiary wow [Music] yeah get that bow get us some points did you loot this guy already okay we should burn them just too yeah make sure i have nothing the lantern there's one over here i'll toss it to you oh no that's an eye anything i'm looking i mean we are in the same building no okay how much damage does the boat do the damage depends on the range it does a lot including the draw yeah oh i found one and the part of the body you hit of course yeah but it can one shot the two to a torso if you're close enough and extra i say burn this guy first all right let's pick up the mountain see what happens yeah giveaway uh we are going to give away the new dlc soon if you guys want more information about the event and uh how to get everything unlocked in the event and what you know what's in it you can do the exclamation point event command in chat that should bring up our event blog post that we posted today yeah that should explain most uh things and if you missed the death stream yesterday you can also watch that where we are going to detail about everything the devstream vod should be on youtube and twitch yeah on facebook as well and facebook is you guys pick up the bounty or not maybe everything's very golden it tickles it uh okay and what parts did you guys pick yeah let us know which paths you pick and chat i meant you guys because shut up oh yeah well i went i went for the bow and arrow so the hashtag pierced the shadow from my side um the best and only path i think it's green cleave the shadow those throwing axes are so cool they are cool and i will unlock them too but first the bow okay very good uh one guy the first guy with the sniper burned out um and then we put the bow guy on fire could that let's just go to salters and extract them get into the next one did you do a skype yeah all right oh my god that scared me i was not sure if it was you or someone else yeah i do i was just trying to freak you out you did good oh yeah off this way i like how uh one person in chat just went hashtag hashtag team tomahawk oh not even cleave the shadow but i'll take more people on the cliff i can't aim well i mean we kind of knew that already i can only aim on pvp actually that's a that's the thing only when there's a live person actively avoiding his shots yeah because then i miss and then i hit them accidentally you know we are not multi-streaming uh we are all uh we are all cry tagged up so it's a cry texture dang it can you actually already collect points with the bow if you kill hives right now like we do because we're locked for the day we we are lost but you can still collect oh like you cannot okay um if he did if we did have extra room to go though i can just be able to yeah even if you pick up a weapon like a um bow or throwing axe i don't think with throwing x right because you can't pick up a throne oh wait yeah yeah well no so the throwing axe you can pick oh no you can't never mind ignore me never mind if you can find thank you for getting a quick play at least on pc you can yes if you find it in quick play then you can but not like a random axe around the map smash the uh my camera is over the event well the event counter doesn't really matter because it's locked so we kept it at the daily limit so we won't have more points for anyone interested in knowing we have 30 and we have 30 points and we've got the daily cap exactly all right you guys hang out there i'm gonna go you will be able to see it now you might want to stop bleeding pretty oh it's fine oh no you might not believe anymore still i'm fine i lived would you imagine road scaling him now we had the bounty there's a new mechanic called the bounty revive so he wouldn't even find it someone asking if the event points are available in quick play yes yes they are all of the stuff that is in bounty on can be found in quick play as well so you will see all of the the pyres and all of the things that you have to set on fire and uh the wards sorry that's the word i was looking for but you'll see all of them in quick play as well yes there's a actually even more in quick play right because you can find the 15 proof vapors setting up yes there is uh there are chances of finding that as well yes yes you can find that in bounty hunt no okay so we have the bow unlocked now let's try this uh zil jillah sigila um there is no catch-up mechanic but the event is gonna be running for almost four weeks so you'll have plenty of time to complete uh you should have plenty of time to complete both paths and you can even go way slower than us and uh really explore the map find lots of the piers that kind of stuff and get way more points than we did in in this just one game [Music] uh z4 cx yeah if you can't play in the event once the event is finished the hunting bow throwing axe and perk and traits anything gameplay wise will be uh just put into the regular unlock the bow was at rank the bow is at rank 54. uh the traits are around 60 to 67 i think i know give me one second now and i'll find out once this fly stops buzzing around my face while he's looking that up so they'll just go into your regular bloodline rank any of the cosmetic stuff though so um that's even the wayfarer that we're using here that is the tomahawk legendary and uh the hunting bow legendary those will be locked to the event for for right now and just like other event legendaries they may come back in the future but there's no guarantee yeah and uh for those who ask for the daily cups here uh you can see it on this event screen so the first cap that we completed now will uh reset in 21 hours so basically tomorrow uh then in one day after that is the second cap unlocked and then the last cap is the day after that so basically in three days uh you will have everything until the very end and you can see the progression path here as well so the first cap is the bow or the throwing axe and then you can already unlock multiple things tomorrow give me two seconds guys getting some traits yeah don't forget are you using the same hunter yeah if you if you guys are using bose bolts here is a new it's an ultra but it's been updated so it's a lot easier to find your bolts i'm actually going to pick it up just so i can find my uh precious throwing axes yeah i have it as well so exclamation point giveaway is not going to do anything uh if you guys just watch the stream we'll let you guys know a specific word to type in chat uh when it's ready for the giveaway and then that will enter you into the giveaway you just need to type it once and then we'll pick winners at the end of the stream and that is for youtube and facebook if you are watching on i'm sorry that is for facebook and twitch not youtube if you are watching on youtube and want to enter the giveaway uh pop into our twitch chat our facebook chat and whenever we give you that phrase type it in there and then you can get entered and that's just because we have some difficulty contacting winners on youtube because it's not as easy as the other platforms i had a hunter with quartermaster nice ooh are you gonna go bow plus like sparks or something no both uh i went i went bow mosin yeah i'm boson i don't even have the mosin unlocked so well that's the fantastic thing about uh cleave the shadow you don't need to use any weapon slots uh the throwing axe is a tool so i can bring in whatever weapons i want well you should take the new dlc weapons re their compact striker the springfield yeah i don't see it on you right now i don't think it has incendiary ammo does it uh so guys i have the details there for everybody for after the event so the bow and arrow will unlock at 54. uh the trade 100 hands will unlock at rank 60 and duke law will unlock at rank 67 then the throwing axe is unlocked through the book of weapons via the combat axe progression and this the trait assailant that forest that then unlocks at rank 11. so there you go very cool oh assailant locks at 11. yep dang i can start using that with my uh my throwing knives even yeah um i just remembered i didn't bring a stamina shot which might be a problem oh i don't even have those on the beginning of jack says my melee right has a cousin i'm sorry i can't pronounce that name we have said repeatedly over and over again that we are working on the bugs on console mate we've we've kind of repeatedly said it on every platform we have um so please just bear with us it's not as easy to get stuff sorted on console as it is on pc things have to go through certification and stuff like that and we also have to make sure that we get to the root cause of the problem as well so yes for anybody interested in knowing we are aware of the bugs that have popped up on console we are looking into them and we will have them hopefully have something coming as soon as possible yeah i forgot to change my game to max graphics so now it will be prettier okay oh don't forget to do our vapers i mean there's no point no no no well it gives us the increased range but i mean we don't really need we don't really collect anything yeah that's amazing oh i missed are you for real i just want to watch so do i aim at the oh okay i see oh that's sweet uh you guys missed two freaking arrows yeah you guys can steal each other's arrows if you have a spot i want to find where my two went do you have bolts here oh yeah hang on oh my god this is smooth like the reload is automatic that's new okay so and if i aim and oh no i have i must have all my arrows never mind if it's fine okay 14 so which no that's pretty right it starts with one plus 13 yeah you're right yeah okay so don't shoot me that's really cool oh my god uh will the unused vapors be converted to blood bones after the event i'm sure they will be like so yes yeah yeah oh is that a hive i'm gonna i wanna throw an axer wait well let me let me see all right let me see where are you she's in here hey nice give me that back oh wow over for shall we run yes yes i mean uh fighting with a ball at fort will be interesting but let's do it yeah it's sad i keep trying to steal i love how you like carrying your throwing axes like that yes over your head like you should have the cane skin with them uh you can pick up arrows with special ammo yes if you lose them oh ammo crates yep yeah like item camo boxes yeah if you don't have the bow though you can't steal other people's arrows so i can't take rick or pence's all right let's test how far you can throw it all right you run in that direction no no not at me hit that ground oh no can you hit the barrel um let's see i'm going to say about there oh my god no you made me loser you threw that really far holy crap oh my god you guys having fun back there yeah yeah um i'm pretty sure i threw my axe into four bolton nice i mean you can pick it up when we get there so oops i just lost an arrow i think i found it what you did hmm you can't trick me bench i got both i'm trying to push around to the side with the fork holder i didn't trick you i was just curious how far can you throw in very far apparently i got a great arm you trained for this that we do have different type of arrows actually uh you just have to unlock them through the event so today you know no one can use them yet but we do have poison concerting and frag arrows what's your guys's favorite arrows i guess pence hasn't tried any of them what about you tina's fun as hell but i like the poison yeah oh i don't think it was in uh i don't think we got to test the new poison melee with the declaw perk i really want to try that damn that i took three errors oh can i steal one of your arrows uh no sorry i think if you shoot it into bench let him hold it for a little bit we are approaching the theme by the way now yeah i'm going around by the the south this time uh boltzier works with the new throwing axes and the new uh arrows so it's uh bolts arrows throwing axes and throwing knives are all does scratching health with the arrows i'm in the ball i don't i believe so what about the same throwing actually maybe i'm shot i'm dead maybe i think for this way it would help that's it oh they're lighting benches i'm from hell you're behind those big grounds i am oh my god where are you i survived holy way down to the east oh they are on the northwest side i can't believe i lived rick should i check for weapons for you oh why i have weapons this time were they at the were they on the way uh i'm pretty sure they were probably like somewhere here i've been looking up there oh oh i see i see my hair stand still stand still please oh ouch are they inside on the wall there's a cane on my ping rick is solo going deep come on there was a cane right there on the pink yeah i saw i think it jumped on you must have i'm rotating to rick that's the same oh also the arrow drop is pretty huge oh i hit them i heard you you said there's a guy above me why is he not hitting him i'm trying to get t-rex i'm sorry why isn't i'm moving no wait i got he's dead nice first bokeh well he was not moving so i don't know i didn't know uh he didn't know where your pose your ears are coming from probably it's very hard it has blood drop guys don't don't believe me i'm with you oh there's a guy he's up at the back um 300 ish he's out the compound that's another one two of them oh kitty cat here i hear stairs somewhere back here one in the compound one don't go in there oh i didn't mean to release that [ __ ] [ __ ] run [ __ ] it's so hard one up here yeah or oh in this a little on the wall i have to move my cap real quick oh i i accidentally shot my bow again oops i'm taking the bounty well i lost i can hear someone inside oh that's you okay okay he's gone he's pushed in a bit don't go in that entrance there because i trapped it oh thank you for the heads up so one is dead on the wall by uh rick yeah i think they're inside their building how many uh i don't know i just can't hear you hear the stups he's on fire he ran into a barrel i wanted to see the that was a lot of shots yeah i lit him on fire and he strafed into a yellow barrel and set it off with his own body okay we're clear now good job team but ari you can't use your guns you have to use your throwing guy oh i didn't think about it good excuses i've been trying to use my hair you need a bench here if you need both uh arrows sorry oh cool i'm just picking up the bounty queen uh let me know if anybody happens to find a medkit yeah i need healing as well but it was a scrub beak so you won't find any here oh yeah all right i'll just heal myself you need water oh what about try looting the guy up here oh i got eight arrows back bro yeah i'm back up to 14. there's only limits i think on the first four days oh the other team is extracting i think so we can leave but they are really far as well so let's just why did this guy die i think he's further this way yeah yeah yeah right above the poopoo entrance the poo poo entrance this we call it secret entrance our secret action yeah yes the ball has bullet drop wait i can actually show you while we are waiting here so the camera has bullets i'm aiming i mean okay well that's too close aerodrome bullet drop is that's a lot actually it went down like uh i think if you use the 100 i maybe get a top and it went to the middle of the building so it's pretty i think it has more drop than the uh crossbow oh oh i'm running it's a chaos bomb it's fine i'm gonna try so shall we just head south yeah yeah try to find out where uh bence killed this guy on the wall that was the guy he killed wasn't it no no i killed that one ben poor oh my god yeah look at this guy he was just waiting there he gave me a free kill with my ball still didn't get any uh anything back uh why is clover that's a very cool idea with the arrows lighting up as far as catching on fire and becoming fire arrows when you shoot them through fire but no that's not how it works it would be cool but no it'll just be still regular i mean then you would have to have like oily arrows or something right oily probably like if you can dip them in oil gun oil i mean that one looks so cool in night maps though wait how is the heat fire i haven't tried it oh it's really accurate yeah yeah it's pretty accurate uh space ghost any legendaries you purchase when you proceed you'll still have access to recruit the legendary hunters if you purchase legendary weapons you'll still need to unlock the base version or the uh whatever variant of you them start getting the legendary versions the new dlc should become available on console pretty soon pull that drop that's a good one call that drop good game guys oh the cane i killed was a five star yay nice poor kane i don't think he deserved you did him dirty you were just like he knew where he was getting shot from i think it was his first death to a bow as well probably i'm proud i was like what the hell is happening here i'm gonna ready up and i'm going to make tea all right and we are almost at the one hour mark so after rick is back maybe we can do the little giveaway remember exclamation point giveaway does not do anything uh you'll need to use a certain phrase that we give you guys to type in chat and then we'll go back and and pick winners from that so ari take the new weapon take the new weapon i got the throwing axe look at it no take the uh compact striker oh no i'll take it once this hunter's dead i have it on uh on the next hunter okay because if i take off one of these weapons then i won't have all the incendiary on them i've crafted this loadout with very precise you know i did all the maths i did the you know the math i know exactly yeah i have an excel spreadsheet it's the perfect loadout i don't know dublin's in the area let's start our z4 we have not mentioned if uh bow or throwing x will be a starting option i don't think beau will be because it's kind of a middle bloodline rank unlock i think rick said 54 where you're starting equipment and quick play is normally like tier 1 stuff we are in a game and ricky's making a t that's very irish of him uh olomat uh exclamation point ben's lovers would be a very good command for the giveaway it's that's unfortunately not it but it's a great guess i would support them yeah yeah bands would

messages uh but you cannot enter the uh giveaway because we are unable to give out the keys there so please if you would like to enter uh just write your pierce the shadow hashtag [Music] the problem is that there isn't really much of a way to dm people on youtube so when with twitch and with facebook it is significantly easier oh my keyboard just went crazy and i'm auto running uh i don't know what to do okay it went crazy okay it's fixed i was also running that was very odd i think they might be out of the compound by now i don't think it was a fight it sounds like maybe they're just nope there's i just got one tapped half martini henry from 54 meters so straight up the road that we were yeah i see oh um where is bam bence is way away one was up there oh they're direct why is it always me first oh my keyboard just unplugged i think whatever who needs to walk in this game um i hear him above me yeah i'm coming closer yeah i'm gonna try not to engage until you're here there's a lot of females here are you killing no no it's a team fight it's a team fight rick just got caught in the middle of it really these are two teams typical it's two teams on the west side of king snake yeah but get close to me yeah then i have to come a different way hashtag fix the keyboard bt yeah i mean the keyboard is unimportant as long as i have a mouse is that you bet yeah i have two yeah i mean i'm pretty close now yeah i'm already there i see a poison bomb i think i think one guy's right above me right there i was trying to hide underneath him so i wouldn't get shot till you got over i see a choke bomb i'm going for rick yeah that's pretty far to me yeah he's he's watching my body with a scope sniper scope well so it was a scope one um and so you need to go a bit closer dude i mean i know it's a good position but you're too far out no i think i'll watch ahri instead yeah i just they look for a lantern so i can burn that emulator you're gonna burn the emulator oh i'm in the armor this concertina so i don't really want to you heard those steps too harry yeah yeah but whatever i'm just running past him oh there he is there he is oh i'm dead maybe she is coming alright oh my god i'm good i'm good can you kill the emulator please throw the axe at him oh yep you mean the armored yeah i'm sorry i don't know why i called him later that all right he is at northwest fargo i got shot from southwestern yeah yeah uh hiding next to those uh grunts that are just chilling out over there yeah are they still up there next to the grunts yeah i'll come look in a second just through the other guy was head beacon from out here you can see it from here your your position is better i'm coming back oh my gosh is it come over here he's behind like that roll that nice let's push i think i just saw some movement back here oh oh yes you did tagged him here oh with arie very exactly dead oh nice is there a last one that's just two that's just two there was only two firing at us so uh was that the scope one though checking scoped one was the other guy yeah yeah this this guy doesn't have fun okay oh where we just were okay there is a third looping around to the left keeping it this time she's on me nice let's let's go for rick there's still this this is the scope one they all had scopes dude they knew the kind of fight that they wanted mm-hmm i think we saw a team on the south side of the the compound though because we heard that early death and ben's got shot from the south yeah i love the uppercut chest this uh chat it's like i'm really used to it [Applause] all right so where are we going it's going to go oh yeah get the clue in case that's a clue but that was a nice funny fight it was nice yeah yeah yeah you could feel that verticality this is awesome just having a nice lie down you heard something when i'm south but did you not did you not say it was two teams i think so because you got shot from the south which neither of them came from and yeah no i think that was the compact uh from the sound of it and we killed that guy unless they die to ai but there's also like the choke and the poison oh true i mean the clue is the white so we are good yeah yeah that's good do you happen to see a lantern maybe grab it is anyone running rick are you running bro right now yes yes oh you could use your axe on the boss right i i found a dead hunter up here where that choke bomb was so maybe the other teams already done so here's the assassin assassin i'm just gonna try he's gonna eat my axes i'm gonna set myself on fire oh no oh it's going down ah the fire like everywhere i can't even get to you to shoot the bloody thing yeah i usually like to talk lantern he's shooting lanterns around you i think no no no i only shot this one oh i think uh seems to take my arrows with it still white there's some arrows on the ground right here [Music] the hunting bow and the throwing x are both permanent uh but they will be no regular unlocks after the game so the throwing axe will be unlocked using the book of weapons through the combat x progression and the uh hunting bull will be ranked uh uh 54 i think yeah 54 yep boom memory the dead hunter lady's still up there and the other one slogan yeah they were one team probably no they're they're four people oh really yeah i found four bodies hmm though doing a trio maybe you never know never know one of the best parts about well you will actually know after the game [Music] i really like the team details actually like i always check in yeah that's really awesome yeah it's been nice i think i heard the steps i'm not sure [Applause] you didn't just throw a chaos bomb the kind of meathead i stuck the meathead with the chaos though hello the best is on the dogs and then they just wait was that you that was the specter oh no that was the chaos one game was it toxic did you get baited by the kids i got invaded by the chaos bomb the throwing axe is such a nice way to take out the minor grunts without risking your own skin that was a real shot but really far where's the other bounty yeah they picked it up i wonder if they are extra oh they are extracted we have been actually winning almost every game now or is it just did we lose the game oh we lost the last one did we oh yeah i died right at the end but other than that we've been doing really good oh yeah you can enter the giveaway by writing uh piers of shadow or if you really want to clip the shadow i suppose right after that was to plea of the shadows just so you know no pierce the shadows i see a two pierced the shadows so leave the piers here's the cleave we're clear yeah let's just extract i suppose if four is that one team is extracting they are most likely the last one yep said north south oh we can look at the alien the alien oh you have not seen it i may have we are very close to it right now i can show you yeah are you do you know where exactly uh is it this this way or is it far this way i think this way yeah i think this way if you don't find it i'm gonna shoot each of you with an arrow no it will be it will be there from whoa why am i getting butt shot too because you pinged you got involved because you love alien ships right like invader son and obviously yeah so that's fine well if it's not here you're both getting shot in the butt that's all i'm saying my poor butt shaking out of here oh my god wait is it not here you got to go all the way oh it is here at this here yeah yeah ah okay all right fair enough you get lucky this time aliens confirm that's just one of the few easter eggs we added to the cell map yeah this isn't like one of the many i think i've only seen one person finding this one i mean it's not too hard to find though if you go around the houma but i'm pretty sure there's a bunch that still haven't been found at all don't shoot the aliens they come in peace ah i'm sorry i think you mean they'll leave in pieces after we're done with them wow i was established pierce the aliens at least we know you need to never be involved in first contact with another species cleave the aliens yeah you will i don't know if you're at the extract yet but you might want to wait 20 seconds you'll be all right i'm just playing with my throne axe i miss pokey i'll donate my throwing axe to the heavens oh my gosh it went so far ggs oh yeah this is the sal this is the new map for those of you that haven't played it yet you should it's great what is the giveaway about uh it's the new dlc by wraith uh it's available on steam already but you can win a copy first uh pc as well and this chat by writing the hashtags you can see in the chat which is pierce the shadow or clip the shadow which legendaries come with that new uh dlc it's a springfield compact striker and the knife and the legender hunter and uh what's the legendary hunter's name uh uh thatcher wraith and ver verbana is the knife and uh sadly i cannot remember the compact striker but i can check it out do you know the name wraith's hand oh here it is i can show you show it to chad meanwhile show it to him give him a good look so the uh you cannot win for console just yet because uh it is not out yet but it will come out in a few days so i'm sure we will do giveaway for console as well so just keep an eye on our social what should i pair this uh new wraith's hand with for my large slot um i would say the bow but you know oh wow that's uh that's uh i don't know why we're trying to go do low blows here but i mean oh i know i'll do blackhand the caldwell rival with wraith's hand both of my hands i'm full of traits oops people love traits that's good to know oh cats yeah i have like max rates max traits maximum straights double springfield compact striker that's uh yeah i've seen some people use it to do very good results what kind of custom ammo can you take on the spring explosive and dum-dum oh that's actually not bad if you have to you can have every yep yep yep no springfield you can run both of them at the same time because it's a single shot exactly exactly yeah but i would take the regular as well you know rick are you playing two bows [Music] no in this hand bow on the other hand yeah uh no bow and i think double caldwell still oh you didn't go for a quarter master no i should have i didn't even think of it one of the best parts of the bow it's only a little medium [Music] yes to to uh our burn yes it is a bb-8 mug it's a giant bb-8 mug bench shows you a cat i show you a bb-8 mug yeah i showed my cat too oh good good which kitty was it uh bruce ah percy little bruce wayne my cat was being very uh needy but she has since ran away oh my other cat is just sleeping somewhere all day oh i found her you can see her in my camera right there sitting oh i can yeah cute rick you still need to get a cat to be an actual developer you need a cat and i need a guitar during x you missed ah can i find your axe no oh i can see the arrow yep i think you can see the axe but you shouldn't be able to take it [Music] what's going on over there um just messing up the the emulator because i can't like two shot him yeah oh snap i don't know the bow did that uh-huh if you aimed really well i like that dogs without you benson oh yeah it's me oh i just found a pack of lots of ducks yeah the same the buzz great for taking out that's right all right rick yes um have you got the clue i'm grabbing it i'm grabbing one i saved you with my throwing axe you're meant to be an ex-murderer or not a savior i'm an ex-superhero i still haven't seen an axe kill uh this session already no we need to wait for nino to jump on and then he'll he'll just get the axe kill for us uh xp here i love my throwing axes so much i'm scared i'm gonna throw a cash register here and never find him again money oh where are we going so to get both of the new uh weapons you have to finish one path first or you can obviously take it from uh take the ball from other hunters but to actually unlock it during the event you have to finish finish your first path and then uh you will be able to do the second one yeah colonel crockett the games are going fairly well actually actually maybe cleave the shadow is a better first option because you can just loot the ball but you can't really lose the throwing air don't say that that's it don't turn on me uh come on i mean i'm still with the ball obviously because it's cooler but captain picard unfortunately we did have to move those uh widescreen icons it was intentional uh as it was causing some problems as they were on the edge of the screen so they got brought in to normalize their the ui with the rest of the game let's run to the boss by the way it's pretty far you weren't doing that already i was killing dogs okay fair enough at least we know where your priorities lie but i'm still the furthest away it's all good the sunlight is split completely safe just ignore me completely i accidentally scrolled and threw my sticky bomb okay instead of firing the boat so why would you need access to the caldwell when you have the throwing axe i said i accidentally scrolled and i got the sticky bomb not you i was responding to chat ah [Laughter] what i i did a jump as well which made it even better mama musee yes if you get a cold you can just gift it to someone else it's a code so if you win you can give it to anyone you would like to give it to uh the first uh we have no hunt tournaments planned we have given some codes and stuff to uh outside tournaments ran by players uh like the bayou bowl um and bayoubo one and two i think we provided prizes for both right rick yes say that again the valuables we have prizes for yes well we don't have any uh tournaments planned ourselves as a company for now uh in the future stuff might change though uh captain picard we it has to be forced so um it's not we know it's not like visually as appealing but we can't have them where they previously were because it was causing technical problems was the summary we got from our team um so even though it would be cool to have as an option they have to stay where they are are for now so someone else what are the vapors good for so they actually increase the percentage of how many points you collect as a team and they also increase the range of your dark side vision where you are able to see the interactable objects in the events of the wards and the fires rick do you happen to have an answer for the uh crosshairs lower on the screen um you know there was a consequence of screen spacing so basically it was to try and prevent people just from looking at the ground the entire time looking up into the sky the entire time to try and get as much into the screen as possible as well was that you no that's uh wait was it yep that was sorry um so no that shot's coming from the compound though all right well we're way behind you because you ran on the head so events is too fast i mean they are at the extraction so we kind of throw our bayern i think we've confirmed rain probably won't be coming as oh it's rain as it's too demanding um that being said we were always working and testing on different types of times of day and that kind of effect so um something similar might not be out of the question but full on rain is probably too intensive but there is a new time of day in the event actually yeah we haven't gotten it yet i think but it's got sun down and it's really nice i never i've never even seen it yet in game i've just seen the great uh screenshots we've provided okay so they are still in the compound uh colonel we're only talking about uh light the shadow today but we are working on more live events as what is in the window they are a ton of fun we'll be with you in a second yep yep we're running fast at least they're not running no they are inside of something hb replay if you want to enter the giveaway you can type cleave the shadow or hashtag pierce the shadow in our twitch or facebook chat you only need to type it once and then after the stream we'll go through and pick uh randomly pick winners for the by your wraith dlc voice theme so uh wumbo's here yeah i couldn't hit him i just saw his heart poking out but i think he's still there listen miss you okay just as a reminder you only need to type it in chat once um any more times will not help your percentage unfortunately [Applause] did you see someone that was a good hit oh dead is that us it's two teams that's there's two teams here on there one hit ping dad that's sorry i couldn't think but i killed him oh outside of the compounds taking some shots at me they are south of us so that might be a fourth team there's someone still in this building yeah big building oh someone down oh yes with the arrow as well nice nice nice i heard that i don't think there's someone else in there uh you could go in no their bounties are still with on someone right she is uh the south team yeah this oh there's someone still in there someone still in that window the two bounties are still picked up so they must have gotten a res because we've gotten five kills so far i've heard five kills i see someone inside yeah uh and all uh save loadouts are already uh and i heard someone had a shotgun so i think uh one of the bounty carriers have a shotgun carl crispy croissant uh light the shadow is live just went live today a few hours ago emulator running outside what the hell was that you that threw a fire bomb oh i threw it at this window yeah i was outside the window oh really tagged again she's holding that the top of the stairs oh come on lady yeah i can come into if you guys are brave like not in i'm not in uh that window you're right next to you or rick that's three yeah okay i'm going inside but i may die oh south team is pushing inside i'm dead shotgun inside uh three people coming south entrance big entrance oh there's downstairs one with the caldwell i think i think i knew that was gonna happen you should maybe heal the chunk if you can though oh he has double uppercuts you got five shots what nice because there's a team on the right you could maybe try to rest me inside from the other side they are pushing you all night oh i'm getting in this pillow oh exciting you do it did it die yeah i think so you need to reload your uppercuts good traps if you have a witch shelter or something yeah i just was trying to reload first omnichrome uh winners will receive their giveaway codes and private messages so either whispers through twitch or facebook messenger where you're shooting yeah you just saw him around there but one was on your right as well i think he is below you actually maybe trying to get his friend you do have necromancer if you want to rotate around the fence nice yeah he's uh and uh okay the reverend this up that you killed so he's probably one shot [Music] that was that was uh killing uh any points you earn as a team uh all of the points will come to you so in the match let's say we earned 30 points uh all three of us would get 30 points at the end so it's not split up everybody's stays together and then everybody gets those same points out and uh i think this is going to be our last game the next one so yep if you want to enter the giveaway uh this is your last chance that's hashtag cleave the shadow or hashtag pierce the shadow on our twitch or youtube chats very sorry twitter facebook jets and if you're in youtube check out our twitter facebook chats the stream should be going on both uh and you can type to enter them uh edgy uh wraith the rate dlc is coming to consoles very soon i don't think we have an official day out quite yet though yeah it turns out i did kill that guy the revenant day oh nice i think oh no no i didn't no i didn't sorry i didn't i killed somebody else i wasn't sure uh so the points you collect in the game is shared between the whole team like every team member so it's not split to three or two depending on your team so like basically everyone gets the same amount of points and even the boost applies to everyone so if you guys boost the points together it will apply to all of you and you will get uh the end result at the end look at that long list of hashtag pierce the shadow harry yeah see how beautiful it looks out of here uh colonel crockett is not case sensitive so feel free to do however you like chris mr croissant uh yes you can ever earn event points in quick play you can earn them by uh destroying the what are those little flamey fires the pyres yeah and lighting the boards lighting the words um and you can still accomplish the killing armored or killing hive with the specific tool or weapon in quick play as well if you happen to find a throwing axe or hunting bow in quick play bullseye benson we've said that we are getting twitch drops by the end of the year but that is going to be separate from the light to shadow campaign so nothing will no drops for this campaign and yes the vapor boosts uh do stack on your team as well both for the percentage and the range increase as well but the maximum range you can get is 70 meters low ella i think it's very easy hashtag cleave the shadow is clearly better um so bam jam effect the event is going on for almost four weeks uh it ends on the 22nd of september 22nd of september thank you 2 pm utc lots of time to get in there good luck with your last week of of uni yeah that may be more important than the event but i mean i would but you know what after you pass your uni uh you still have a bunch of time and there is no locks anymore so you can unlock everything the first day picking up the clue the caps were implemented just to prevent players from immediately finishing both paths um but they only last for the first four days of the event okay golden acres or arden parish arden i don't know why oh because that's those shots from where uh further than arden maybe prison-ish but let's go in that direction hi hive bye hive really like the bow it's like silent as well it feels nice it's starting oh this will be very difficult i killed the hive and she tried to eat both of my throwing axes let's head to windy all right i i hit the emulator three times with the ball too yeah all rack uh we are still working on the trials for desal they're still planning on coming but no date on them right now we're getting close uh you do not need to extract to get your event points once you earn them in game um whatever number is up there even if your team doesn't make it out you will get those uh progression so that number in the top left but make sure if you want to use the vapors if you don't use them before you die they won't actually impact that number sorry that was me [Music] what was someone shot at me that was me dude oh okay i was shooting at the hive with the silence just so you guys know oh no oh i just head shot i don't know if it was a grunt or not but i had shot something over there vapor does not affect dark side boost it only affects your range for the event uh items divorce and the pyres so you can see them further away but they won't increase your dark side boost or anything else that's from that window up there seems separate to the guy who shot bounce but did you kill a guy did you find his body i i don't know the light like the sun was kind of in my eye and i was squinting i just heard that josh i just got one tap wow dude was clearly watching me open the window this window rick yeah all right somebody got me a cracker of a shot was the window open or no no it was close oh snap see if it's watching through the cracks i think that was a side window probably possibly but either way let's go from the other cider all right but there are dogs somewhere they were over here i'm scared always it's such an open field oh the dog is on you i think he stands no chance against my throwing axe what gun was it was the label or something um one sec on the roof mode nagan all right let's try to play uh rick's rez what other team here somebody else on the roof yeah very far here is the guy let's focus on rick if we can hit nice shot they just rest the girl on the roof yeah i have to leave i'm out of ammo i think it's maybe all teams here oh no there's a spanish team so three teams two teams you don't need to fight them come over back over here let's focus on getting rick up i have to reload soon i mean i don't like the position of the sun from the necromancer that was from no i wasn't that from that window somewhere over there but we've seen two on the roof so far the other team is coming from here okay that's further yeah we gotta hope this other team distracts the roof team so we can try to get rick up yeah but if the guy who killed him is still inside oh yeah there's someone inside ari and that window is open yep i'm watching the side window now that yeah i think i can rest from here actually oh i'm shot they were shooting through the crack of that yeah window rick said and then i have to use the heel too now they open this window too now i'm gonna get a choke up there i see they just closed the window i'll be very low on ammo i did not get a joke up there i mean rick moved so i may be able to rest him but it's like risky for him should i try yeah i mean give it a try i'm probably gonna die straight away but still i mean you are in the bush i'll make something yeah you're good one dead one dead on the other team bentz was trying to fight the roof team killed one of them i don't like standing here let's move no no they're trying to shoot at me again we're moving towards the white house yeah i'll need ammo too are behind the building i feel like there's one on that one there's one in this building i see that one dead there are you sure they arrest that phone there's one i just saw one shooting no no uh the one that was on the roof yeah uh that's she got red one is behind here oh but it's a scrapbook so i won't find any ammo uh do you guys have an ammo box by any chance no okay one just ran behind the right hand side of the longboard dead someone died yeah this is still in that building on the roof on the roof in the front-facing window nice oh goodness gracious i couldn't get that girl uh mozin in that window she took me out yep phantom i'm just gonna sit over here and wait for a few sure i think they killed the other team too honestly think you are alone with them well you also have a museum so there are there's a window on the other side of uh the building you're looking at and they are out there on the roof uh bands are getting some reports that the stream is having some buffering and pixelization um should be fine i have zero frames oh yeah i got one at least nice popped him in the head as he peeked that mosin girl i could not land a shot on her i wanted well it was a nice try i want to see if who is alive from there [Music] oh it's only these two guys left so we uh yeah so the other team died before us i can kill 200's out of it so i'm happy well uh i guess that was it then it was a nice try so guys if you have any uh last questions uh ask them now in the chat and we'll try to answer them and then we will wish you good luck uh during the event and make sure you get in your hashtag pierce the shadow or hashtag cleave the shadow if you haven't already uh if you have already then you already entered boom good job and that's for twitch and for facebook [Music] cool and uh one second now just want to check on something just before we finish up i want to mention one one one last thing we have an offer on steam currently hunt is available to buy 50 off what's if you guys if anyone here is watching that wants to jump in but doesn't have a copy on now is your time to get it it's 50 off so head on over to the same store and take advantage of the offer that's there and it's good to mention that uh in the bloodborne store you're also able to buy the event items and uh you can actually buy the new hunter and the med kit with a bundle as well with 10 percent off some random pers asks if the blood bond event skin will be gone after the event is over uh wayfarer so you will if you purchase her with blood bonds during the event you can still use wafer after the event but i don't if you don't purchase her during the event i don't believe she's purchasable after correct oh i think she's an event exclusive blood punch item so if you want her get her now after the event she won't be you won't be able to you know unlock her but if you've already used blood bonds to get her you can keep recruiting her like any other hunter right like any other legendary yeah it's true to every event unlock except the dlc basically so after after the event is over you won't be able to unlock those skins anymore fanny fox we have heard some reports that stream is is yeah but i'm also watching it and it looks like i'm watching the stream on my second pc and it's normal twitch it's on twitch it is buffering from time to time for me so maybe it might be something going on with twitch if uh nothing seems like it's happening on bence's side yeah i mean i'm watching the stream on one of my screens i guess either way that is a good time to end things anyway so shall we shall we leave that that for this evening folks yes sir
