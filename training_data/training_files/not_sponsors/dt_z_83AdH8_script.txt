hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video whydid soldiers wear bright uniforms before we start I 10% off of your first year of dashlane premium today we're going to be traveling from antiquity to present day and learning about the myriad reasons soldiers throughout history wore flashy uniforms we'll begin by addressing the Pitts a tribal Confederation indigenous to Scotland although the pics did not wear a uniform they are relevant to our discussion because of their use of face and body paint one popular theory is that the name pict was imposed on these tribesmen by the Romans who allegedly used the Latin word pic T meaning painted or tattooed people to describe them Polybius the Greek historian wrote of another tribal group the Gallic gasset a some of whom went to war naked just like the pics across the channel it is likely that the primary reason both groups adopted this practice was because of its effectiveness as an intimidation tactic commanders had a similar rationale far into the future they wanted to intimidate their foes just without exposing their troops brightly coloured and visible uniforms were part of their strategy to achieve this end we need not leave the British Isles to make an observation about uniform trends during the Middle Ages during the medieval period the armies of England Scotland and pretty much every other European state consisted of feudal levies and mercenaries there were no standing armies in these states in order to clearly be identified on the battlefields oftentimes medieval soldiers were armored with brightly coloured taverns depicting their Lords coat of arms this practice filled into the modern era well past the Middle Ages in the book a history of the regiments and uniforms of the British Army Maj Barnes writes that until the mid 18th century the Colonel's personal coat of arms or crest was emblazoned on the colors and only Grenadier caps of the men but to say that the nature of combat and uniforms had not evolved throughout Europe would be grossly inaccurate between 1645 and 1715 many of them garbed with colorful uniforms innovations in dress regular pay and strict discipline all became the norm for standing armies which forms the core of a state's defense standardized coloration of uniforms and drilling were introduced hand-in-hand as uniformity among the ranks helped contribute to the professionalization of an army during this period beginning in the 17th century and concluding in the 19th century warfare was also characterized by the advent of guns and Tillery along with all of the smoke and confusion that accompanied them a generals ability to locate and direct his troops significantly contributed to the outcome of almost each and every battle bright uniforms along with flags and standards which had been used since antiquity became especially important as they allowed units to be quickly identified and contrary to what you might think these showy uniform colors were relatively affordable for example the British used red uniforms since as early as 1600 primarily because of the cheapness of red dyes by the time of the Napoleonic Wars uniforms became increasingly extravagant but they would fall out of fashion the following century the end of brightly colored uniforms coincided with a change in battlefield tactics the introduction of the machine gun along with more accurate firearms made invisibility more beneficial than visible resonators new methods of communication such as the pigeon post cabled telegram and phone allowed commanders to issue orders without having to locate their troops amid this smoky chaos by the time the Balkan Wars broke out in 1912 uniforms were quickly becoming deep color honest some objected to this shift however claiming that it undermined good taste and national pride perhaps as a result of this logic the French continued to use bright red trousers until the first weeks of the first world war when they realized that good tastes didn't save their men from boys according to Andrew Nitin and his article by 1914 most countries in Europe had changed from their traditional brightly colored uniforms to khakis grays and other neutral colors that would blend in this saved soldiers from being easy targets for guns of growing accuracy and range today camouflage is by and large the most prevalent uniform design except for ceremonial uniforms like the Queen's Guard or the pont official Swiss Guard who are of course not expected to engage in combat on the field coloured uniforms are worn on the battlefield pretty much exclusively by organizations like the you and peacekeepers who iconic lead on light blue helmets with the sole reason of being identified on the battlefield and
