ten cats does countdown John Richardson
unlock Rose Mehta fail Perry Hill Alex horn in the horn section Suzy did great
- lolly hello and welcome to a dative chain cats
does countdown a show about letters numbers and conundrums okay let's meet a
nice place first I'll be team captain Sean Locke many women find Shawn locked sexy and
fantasize about getting him alone for some grandpa grumpy rumpy-pumpy Jody
short tonight it's comedy legend Harry hell he has a unique look like a testicle off
to play a game of golf up against the receiving team captain John Richardson John appeared on the TV show comedians
watching football with friends I assume alone with my best mate
actually Claire Sweeney off of her frock so you still keep in touch I follow her
on Twitter my best mate after you and you we're
best mates that way yeah just did a joke about me being small and let's move on
fun fact John is short for a man five four two and John's teammate Rose much afire Rose has a paralyzing fear of rodents
with their furry little bodies and wrap light features so we can only apologize
for sitting in Harriet's it's your first time on the show are you gonna be better
with the letters or what a numbers hurry oh well you know I had this I had this
problem with letters I see a letter and is associated with the smell so for
instance the letter hey I smell elderflower straight away and then B I
might get just morning dew straight to out getting morning chew the letter F
wet wipes so I'm worried about it I'm gonna be like a basset hound in a
perfume Factory have any hidden talents oh I know where this is going
you told him no I never said anything I don't never talk to him it's the
moonwalk humor well I learned from the master Michael Jackson pH go fool you
may not know this but when Michael Jackson died Phillip Schofield brought
all his shoes mainly flip-flops and because he's feet are different science
to my projections he had to trim them all so often I would go around for my
lesson he'd be trimming me and he only gets you afternoons because he works in
the morning so I do yeah I do look I do move more but I haven't come here to do
I'm not doing Oh what was interested to know Shawn if
you've tried any interesting diets yes I have Jimmy I've found a whole new food
source and it's very exciting and what I've got into eating recently this
remove delicacy is fatbergs you get a fat bag because everyone's told you
they're absolutely delicious they're like truffles and I go down the
sewers and hunt birds obviously I don't take a truffle pig I take a rat on a
lead honestly Jimmy they are delicious because you cut a
slice like it's like a cake and it's savory one end sweet yeah there with a
bit of hint of Dettol in the middle what I do is I get a trained sushi chef to
cut around the condoms and wet wipes just get the really tasty bits that's
why I'm into okay rose you're from New Zealand you now live in
London what's the worst thing about living in England the plugs are weird
were they different to where I'm from apply my plugs they look my one looks
like I'm kind of like the screen it's like kind of like that it says and that
your ones come up like you John if you could bring one thing back
from the past what would it be uh what I would like to bring back is the airing
cupboard because boilers have got smaller Oh people already in London but
I used to go in there after me lunch I'd hide there and try and scare people play
a bit of hide-and-seek and then come out when no one fucking look for me it's
like having a holiday home when you're six having and that was like that was my
sheet why would you give it an errand a second exactly I'm still banging I don't miss
that okay you don't miss what you got on tap man yeah yeah
it's it's because on a serious note it's because of it improved lagging on me on
the emotions don't get the warning what we on a holiday oh is this a
conversation if you want to get back you know a way of getting back at if you've
ever spurned by a lover one of the ways to get back as you know you start off
with a kipper on the exhaust pipe you know that one so when she starts up the
cards it stinks next stage after would be so prawns into the hem of the curves if you can get a dolphin yeah she won't forget you then close if
you got a mascot I do have a mascot I wanted to bring something that would
relax me and I'm a quite a crafty person myself so I have a stack of my favorite
adult coloring in books which is great and I got to say an adult coloring and
book it's a fantastic gift to give to any loved ones when you want to kind of
show that your concern but want to keep it fun because these are food you know
you mean to well-being but I really I really enjoyed doing them so I actually
started filling them out but I'm kind of freaked out my family because I started
doing them but purely in black sharpie pens kind of freaked them out a bit
that's that's a turtle there that some ducks and stuff and then I decided
writing stuff that I kind of went outside the lines a bit and started just
writing stuff I wanted to get off my chest in my family so help me there
that's why my dad's girlfriend is a cat I like it yeah like a lot Oh Jonah do
you got a mascot yeah sort of I get a lot of stick on
this show for like in the maths but I thought I'd find a way of making math
school and I know what people like pop music so I've written an equation a
mathematical equation with music bands that we can solve hello Rachel how are
you this is all mine I don't like to share so where would you start here
Rachel if you were tidying up this equation sign a squared seasons times
way ode to joy' plus you all over dur√°n equals do round x tops brackets joy to
the world all over B squared or minus u plus one get x by G around with ya
that's what you do problem on this side and then on this side of course you'd
have juran squared or Jai Ramji RAM popularly known now you look on this
side you've got sign now I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes so of course we
can substitute there for a surf base you haven't been studying how is the base
now Ace of Base as we know so all that she wants she round around they sang all
she wants is so if we divide both sides by the thing that she wants would of
course cancel those out so let's get rid of that u we can add you to that side
and that'll cancel that bit out and of course here we'd have to use or you to
usually of course sang that we can do this with or without you
so if we take the without u option then that removes the youth from that side
we can get those bracket so we have your fun yet kids oh I didn't expect to get
out of breath writing on a board so B squared there B squared a squared
season's tops enjoy to the world now if we divide by four we know there are four
seasons so that councils that one out and of course four tops to the world an
ode to joy' so of course we need to remove the joys or if you like carry out
a Joy Division from the equation here we're left with ode to or minus two if
you will so we take the minus to add to two cancel out and you're left with
three on this side three is of course a magic number hard enough there it comes
right off the board and you can just hold it in your hand like that squared a
squared or BB a a or if you prefer a bur money money money it's a rich man's
world and that leaves us back to you Jimmy just wondering sonic saw a date out for
your intervention sure have you gone mascot now what I've done to me I've
created something I call total comedy have you aware of the Dutch team of the
1970s a famous Dutch bubble TV I cried they played total football total comedy weighs his bases my comedy characters I
do how many characters I'll just go through them you know some of them like
this one here Oh put the cat out that was Renee no fixed abode or gender that's Darcy win balls this is oh you've
done this place up nice that is enough that's art Falacci oh I have three of
your warmest soups this is jakey Lionel no you can't have
