what's up you guys it's Graham here so three years ago I started this channel to share my enthusiasm towards personal finance saving money investing and real estate and back then when I posted my very first video I had no idea that anyone would actually watch me nor did I have any idea that you could actually make money doing this but lo and behold this channel grew more than I ever thought was imaginable and since then I've always made the decision to share exactly how much I've made throughout the entire process not to mention your support is the reason why all of this is possible in the first place so I owe you nothing but full transparency and to share exactly what I have learned along the way so we could be a part of this journey together so what that said I'm going to be going over exactly how much I made throughout these last three years starting with how much I was making with under a hundred thousand subscribers then with under three hundred thousand subscribers and now how much I'm making with over a million subscribers here on YouTube and let me just preface this by saying it is not my intention to make one of these like YouTube flex videos where you go and hype up how much money you make throughout the entire time without any real substance whatsoever instead I really do my best to be as thorough as possible go over all the details share with you everything involved and go over exactly what goes on behind the scenes and how it works because really at the end of the day like I said I owe all of this to you for all of your support and that deserves sincere recognition so I hope you find this helpful and I hope it answers to all of your questions and if it does I would really appreciate it if you went over to that gray little thumbs up handy button and you click it so that it turns blue because the YouTube algorithm really loves it when you make that little button turn blue so anyway with that said let's get into the video first before I start sharing my own numbers let me just say this there's a lot of confusion out there as to how much money youtubers make and I'd like to do my best to clear things up because on the one hand you have articles like this reporting that 96% of youtubers don't earn enough to cross the poverty line and another the claims that YouTube stars is almost 1.4 million monthly viewers earn an average of seventeen thousand dollars a year but if someone has been in the industry for a few years and has met and talked to dozens of creators throughout just about every category possible on YouTube I have to say those numbers are really just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible how much a youtuber makes is really entirely dependent on how well they run that channel like a business most likely just making a video and putting a five-second ad in the very beginning is not gonna be enough and for most people here in the platform how much money they're making from YouTube ads is really only just a drop in the bucket compared with how much money they could be making but now that we're on the topic of YouTube ad revenue let's just start right here almost every youtuber you see on the platform makes money from what's called Google Adsense now if you aren't familiar with it it's this 5 to 15 second skippable ads that show up in the beginning middle and end of the videos that you watch now in order to be eligible for that type of advertising the channel has to have at least a thousand subscribers and have accumulated four thousand hours or more of watch time and once that threshold is hit the channel is submitted for review to determine whether or not it is advertiser friendly and that's the point where we can go in two entirely different directions in terms of how much a YouTube channel can make for example if the channel contains profanity mature content or anything else that could be a little bit risque well either ads are just not going to be shown on the channel or advertisers are gonna pay significantly less because those channels are just seen as less desirable not to mention if a channel is using copyrighted material in the videos such as a song or using someone else's content in a clip the owner of that copyrighted material can claim ownership of that video and of the rights that video has to monetize and they could take a percentage of the revenue kind of like sting taking eighty five percent of the song lucid dream because the background was sampled from shape of my heart on the other hand if a channel is advertiser friendly and doesn't contain profanity or a mature subject matter or use copyrighted material then advertisers will pay a premium to put themselves in front of that content and how much they pay really depends on the subject of the video and how desirable that target audience is then if you want to go even further than that ad rates can also be impacted by the time of the year the length of the video the watch time of the video and whether or not the video contains multiple mid-roll ads or just one in the very beginning now in terms of how much they're actually making if they're just making generic non specific family-friendly content that doesn't really center around one specific audience in general then I think it's safe to say on the low ends they're probably making two to three dollars per 1000 views that means if this type of channel gets 5 million views a month they're probably making between ten and fifteen thousand dollars a month just from ads however though ad ray it's only tend to go up from their car channels for example might be getting paid $5 per 1000 views which means that if they get 5 million views that equates to $25,000 in ad revenue or you have beauty channels which could get $7 per 1000 views or you also have business or investing videos which frequently see between 15 and 30 dollars per 1000 views or higher depending on the topic so the range here is vast and pinpointing exactly how much someone is making from Google ad revenue is a little bit difficult but expect that most channels are probably making between $4 and $7 per 1000 views assuming you're posting clean family-friendly content without any swearing and without any copyrighted material now in terms of how much money I make is a channel with over a million subscribers last month I did about 7.8 million views and my take-home from that was one hundred and twenty nine thousand one hundred and twenty two dollars and 99 cents in ad revenue I'll cover exactly how much I made throughout the entire year of 2019 towards the end of the video but keep in mind that my channel on YouTube is one of the highest paying because of what I talk about which is business personal finance and investing so because of that advertisers end up paying a lot of money to put themselves in front of my videos and that's why my channel is making a lot more money compared with a lot of the other channels out there but even then ad revenue like this can only be a small percentage of what youtubers can make and a very common one that a lot of people do is with sponsorships this is what a brand or a company will reach out and request to be mentioned in the beginning of a video for a set fee for example you have shane dawson with honey or david dobrik with SeatGeek and those companies will end up paying a lot of money just for a 60 second mention in a video that gets tens of millions of views now I can't really speak as to how much exactly they're getting paid for those mentions because those amounts can't really be disclosed but I can share the details from what I have allegedly heard and also based off my own experiences with sponsorships for channel of my size with just over a million subscribers in my niche sponsors have generally offered between four thousand and twenty thousand dollars for a 60 to 90 second mention in a video however my experience is the more legitimate the sponsor is the last money they want to pay you the ones who end up offering me a lot of money in my niche are usually the most fly-by-night scammy waste of time company I would never ever want to be involved in or give any promotion whatsoever so I end up turning most of them down if it's the right company at the right time then I'm certainly open to it but I don't want to overdo it and I want to make my content more focused around the information than around a particular sponsor so because of that I try not to overdo it but on the other hand for youtubers like david dobrik or shane dawson I can't speak to exactly how much they're getting but if I were to make an educated guess I would say that Shane Dawson likely charges about a hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a mention and honey in one of his videos and david dobrik likely charges around 75 to maybe $125,000 for a mention on SeatGeek now again that's purely speculation in my opinion and it could be wrong on that but if I were to guess I would say that's probably within the ballpark of what they would be charging but again as you can see how much money a youtuber makes can really start to add up especially if every video of theirs is sponsored and even though david dobrik might not make a lot of money from youtube ad revenue because he's using copyrighted music in his videos he could likely still make about six hundred thousand dollars a month just from sponsorships alone not including anything else he's doing like this and that would be selling merch I'm not gonna name names here but I will say that some of the larger YouTube March liens do exceptionally well those are the ones with a very recognizable brand that have a variety of products that continually cycle through limited-edition merch to continually get you buying and those are the ones that end up doing a lots of money I personally seen some of the larger more established youtubers out there in the 1 to 5 million subscriber range make about 50,000 to 150,000 dollars a month and profit for merch sales now I will admit that those channels are the creme de la creme of the merch business and most youtubers out there won't expect to make that kind of money but overall expect a 20 to 30% of your merch order any time you buy something is profit for them and that adds up so I would say for most channels out there with 1 million or more subscribers that run their own merch line they're probably making anywhere from three thousand to ten thousand dollars per month depending on how much promotion they're doing and the strength of their brand and then obviously could just go up from there depending on the loyalty of their audience and then that brings us to another really common way that almost every youtuber ends up making money and that would be affiliate marketing this is where they promote a service or a company that isn't theirs but they get a commission any time someone signs up or buy something for example Amazon affiliates is by far the easiest way that most people end up getting started almost anyone can go and create their own store on Amazon and you get paid a commission any time someone clicks on the link to purchase an item usually that commission will range anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars but again it adds up for me I've always just placed an Amazon affiliate link in the description of my videos it covers all of the camera equipment that I use to film these videos doing that last year in 2019 made me ten thousand three hundred and forty two dollars in the 81 cents I've also used affiliate marketing for other services as well for instance last year I made about $8,000 from acorns because when you work for a friend they get $5 invested and you get five dollars invested so this is a really easy one for me to mention because who doesn't want to get a free $5 link down below in the description I've also done this with a free stock trading app weeble because when you use the link down below in the description and deposit $100 they'll give you two free stocks and one of those stocks can be valued up to $1400 so that's a really great way to get two free stocks and I also use them for free stock trading so there you go if you're interested link down below and again all of that just adds up but wait we're not done yet there's still several other ways that youtubers make money and one of the really popular ones especially in my niche is by creating a product or service that your subscribers can join for example for those that are not aware I created two programs the first one is called the real estate agent Academy which teaches people how to become a real estate agent and grow in the business and the second one is called the YouTube creator Academy which teaches people how to grow on YouTube and eventually turn that into a business I created this as a way to supplement my income and provide a one-stop shop for anyone who wants my advice without having to go and individually coach people one-on-one and so far in the last year of 2019 both of those programs did just over $500,000 in profits without any paid advertising I just leave a link in the description of my videos or make the occasional mention around the holidays and if people are interested they could get it and if not that's fine too but if you are interested just know I offer a no-questions-asked 30 day refund policy if you want to give it a shot there you go anyway for youtubers with a specific skill to teach online education is a fantastic way to provide value while still making additional income and again I won't name names here but I will say that some of the larger business channels here in YouTube are making close to 1 million dollars a month in profit from program sales consulting speaking engagements and subscription services education is really one of those things that's never going away and the more value you could provide to someone else the more money you will end up making and lastly one of the things I've noticed a lot of these non advertised your friendly channels doing lately is starting their own membership website this is where you see all the bonus content uncensored that you can't put on YouTube and lucky for you I actually found the information of the person who's thinking about it first came to mind when talking about this and that would be by tally he created a website called by tally uncensored and in an interview with Logan Paul he said he had 100,000 subscribers each paying $5 a month to see his content that is absolutely substantial and also this interview was posted quite a while ago so there's a good chance he's making even more money now so for any other youtuber out there with a membership site I have a feeling they're earning a sizable amount of money per subscriber every single month probably even way more money than they would ever make on YouTube and they also get to control the traffic and what they post but now let's get back to what everyone clicked on this video for in the first place how much money do I make with 1 million subscribers and here's my entire journey starting from the very beginning in my first year of YouTube during the entire year of 2017 I was working 50 hours a week planning filming and editing videos posting three times a week consecutively without missing an upload and staying up until 2:00 I am almost every single night answering nearly all of the comments I made that entire year 26 thousand nine hundred and sixty six dollars and 69 cents and if you break that down per hour that was the equivalent of me making less than minimum wage for an entire year's worth of work while also working full-time as a real estate agent but in the beginning of 2018 I hit 100,000 subscribers and that was the point where I really started taking YouTube way more seriously I began reinvesting back into the channel I created the studio that you see here I began posting higher quality content and diversifying my income I did that by creating a real estate agent Academy to teach agents how to grow in the business I started doing consulting and speaking engagements and I finally started doing amaz affiliate links and that year I ended 2018 with almost 300,000 subscribers and I made a grand total of just over two hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars from YouTube almost one hundred and seventy thousand dollars of that came from YouTube ad revenue with almost 14 million views and eighty six thousand dollars came from the program sales the rest of it was from Amazon affiliates consulting and public speaking but this last year in 2019 things were wildly different and once we broke past a million subscribers things just took off in total the 2019 ad revenue for just this channel alone was 1 million one hundred and forty one thousand two hundred and thirty one dollars and forty three cents with almost 80 million channel views that also does not include my second channel the Graham Steffen show which I'm just going to include here because the two channels tend to play off one another and that was another one hundred and seventy thousand four hundred and twenty eight dollars and seventy five cents in income with just over 16 million views in addition to that my program sales have really taken off and I have a feeling it's just because as I'm building a larger audience it just tends to sell a little bit more and that led to 2019 making over five hundred thousand dollars just from the programs then on top of that last year I was able to do several sponsorships with brands including audible skills share and simply safe and even though I can't specifically mention exactly how much each brand has paid me I will say that overall it added up to another fifty thousand dollars plus added another forty thousand dollars for affiliate marketing private consulting and any other opportunities that came up throughout the year so as you could see when you add all of this up during the entire year of 2019 I have made just over one point nine million dollars from YouTube alone as a youtuber with 1.3 million subscribers which as I'm saying this right now sounds absolutely absurd because that is a mind-blowing amount of money and I am beyond humbled that you find enough value from these videos to want to subscribe and watch and just be a part of this journey with me because I remember doing all of this in 2017 making less than minimum wage when you factored in how much time I was putting into making these videos and to be able to go from that to this right now is just absolutely incredible it just it makes me speechless thank you everyone so much for allowing me this opportunity and I hope at the very least I can give you good content back on how to increase your credit score save more money increase her income and invest in the long term and anything you need to know about real estate I got you so with that said I'm just gonna end the video by saying this how much your youtuber makes is really entirely dependent on whether or not they run it like a business and how many subscribers they have doesn't really have a direct correlation with how much money they're gonna be making I've seen channels with a hundred thousand subscribers making 1 million dollars a year selling educational products and I've also seen channels with a million subscribers who can't make more than 30 thousand dollars a year because their content is not advertiser friendly and they have not found a way to diversify their income beyond Adsense but the youtubers who are business savvy who find a way to diversify and branch off to create additional sources of income can make a significant amount of money oftentimes a lot of these youtubers don't want you to know the full extent of how much money they're making because in a way it might make them seem a little bit less relatable and often it's a lot more difficult to ask your audience to support you by buying something if your audience knows you already have millions of dollars sitting there in the bank so I think it makes sense from this perspective if they want to maintain a certain image they're not gonna want you to know how much money they're making but for me I built this channel and being totally open about all things money and it's also what I teach here on the channel in terms of how to make money invest and how to smash the like button for the YouTube algorithm of course so there you go that's how much money I make with the channel with now over 1 million subscribers and again if you enjoy this type of content or you're brand new here and want to learn more about personal finance saving money investing in real estate
