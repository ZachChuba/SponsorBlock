[Applause] [Music] this video is brought to you by curiosity stream and contain spoilers [Music] well it's Halloween week 2019 which means it's been exactly five years since Wirt and Greg began their journey into the unknown in over the garden wall a miniseries that ran only ten very short episodes on Cartoon Network back in 2014 and I gotta say it's kind of a miracle that this show exists as it does some comic books I still need to check out aside there's something almost shocking about how self-contained it is it didn't run for years get a theatrical movie or get turned into some CG abomination by blue sky studios or something it just is it continues to exist almost entirely as this one nearly perfect and weird object and in the almost entirely brand driven world of modern entertainment there's something pretty amazing about that it's only been five years but I have a suspicion that the series will continue to stand the test of time in a big way not just because I like it though that obviously doesn't hurt but because it draws from so many different influences all at once in a way that helps it create a world and tone that feel completely unique I didn't pay much attention to the show when it first premiered mostly because I kept hearing it was like Cartoon Network's attempt at mimicking the Tim Burton style which sounded pretty stale to me but once I got around to you know actually seeing it I really didn't think there was much of a connection at all Tim Burton style is very reflective of all the Vincent Price gothic horror movies infused with the 60s California suburbia he grew up in garden wall is a totally different beast pun intended I guess as much as I love characters like Greg Wirt Beatrice and of course jason funderberker jason funderberker I've always considered that land of the unknown to be the real star of the show it somehow manages to feel otherworldly and completely familiar all at once the show's creator patch Mikael has talked a lot about how he took inspiration from old New England postcards and that shines through as the autumn of the show feels comfortable and idealized there's a darkness and evil in the unknown but there's a lot of warmth and brightness too making it really feel like a place you'd want to get lost in filled with both adventure and peril now some of that could describe a fantasy land like middle-earth as well but even there I think the show feels very different talking and so many of the writers that followed in his footsteps are very invested in the logical explanation of the worlds that they create I mean pick up a copy of The Return of the King right now and you'll find the last fourth of it is a collection of appendices family trees and more supplemental material to fill out all the little details of the author's fantasy landscape and it works well for what people like Tolkien are trying to achieve but over the garden wall feels like it's continuing a much older storytelling tradition it's like a natural extension of the Brothers Grimm collection of folk tales or and this may be a little reach here even ancient stories like The Odyssey just this idea of characters finding themselves in fantastical situations that they can barely understand and the story itself being perfectly okay with leaving those details to your imagination over the garden wall has created the community that loves to try to decode what the ending means and separate what's real and what isn't and I think that's part of a larger obsession with fan theories plot consistency and logic that fuels a ton of online discussion around art especially on YouTube and maybe there's nothing wrong with that like I do think it can be a lot of fun in the right context but I kind of don't think that's what really matters here don't get me wrong it's clear that the producers of the show have a lot of this detail mapped out in their heads but they play things very close to the chest and the show is all the better for it things like the backstory of anti whispers or the costumed skeleton town of potter's field aren't spelled out almost at all and we get the sense that what we're seeing is only the tip of the iceberg one small part of the massive tapestry that this world has to offer and that's exciting it makes the feel vivid and lived in in a way that many fantasy worlds just don't but the thing that most brings to mind old folklore to me is the way that the show uses horror on the whole over the garden wall is a very kid-friendly show in fact in one of the most funny and meta scenes of the series the show makes it very clear that a bunch of teenagers are going into the woods to drink age-appropriate drinks not anything illegal like the juice but one area where it feels a little more grown-up is in the show scarier moments when you go back and reread Brothers Grimm stuff like Hansel and Gretel in their old fashion form you really notice how creepy it is and how much it leaves to the imagination over the garden wall happily keeps that tradition alive a good example is the old witch Adelaide telling Wirt and Greg that she's gonna fill their heads with wall so that they'll follow her every command that's one of those great little lines that says a horrifying amount with so little like how would she do that how does it work is it just their brain or would they have an entire head made of wool these are exactly the kind of spooky questions that really stick with you and you're a kid hearing old fairy tales and I'm guessing they stuck with the kids who watch this episode to where this creepy minimalist approach to horror really works best is in the show's main antagonist the beast and man I could just talk about the woodsman and the beast for this whole thing because they're so interesting and mysterious I think we see one clear shot of the Beast in the whole show when were tanned the woodsman finally fight back against him in the final episode and what we see is this horrible and honestly kind of feeble looking creature with faces all over his body you could spend a million theories about exactly what he is and why he demands children be turned into trees and people on the internet have been more than happy to come up with them but to me one of the best things about this show is that that answer is beside the point we uncover the villain and see that he's nothing but a sad leech someone who needs the woodsman far more than the woodsman ever needed him so much of the rest beyond that remains unknown another secret the show keeps to itself and honestly I'm more than happy to leave it as one the fact that so much wonder and mystery remains the show smith ology is one of my favorite things the show does how are you we're burglars no no no we're not we just needed to get out of the race so we came here to burgle your church one of the series best episodes songs of the dark Lantern C's Wirt and Greg wander into a tavern where everyone is obsessed with singing songs and identifying exactly what everyone's role in life is the tavern keeper is a tavern keeper the tailors a tailor and so on at first they're all annoyed and confused that they don't know what works role is but after a few false starts they land on the idea that he's a pilgrim a traveler on a Sacred Journey in their words this is another idea that helps connect the series to older stories and especially old folk tales I love that in most episodes the cast just wanders into an entirely new society with its own rules and customs that we can barely understand not only does it give every episode its own unique identity something that a lot of shows don't bother to do these days it's a great way to make it feel like these characters are really deep in the unknown there's no time for anything to feel familiar like the settings of other cartoons because the characters are always on a journey on their way to find the next weird group of leisurely frog people or school that teaches animals how to read and write this may not be a recipe for a good long-running show which may hit diminishing returns after a while without a story engine like bikini bottom but for a miniseries like over the garden wall I think it's the perfect way to make things continue to feel odd and interesting from the first episode to the last but if the world of the unknown is the show's greatest achievement its most endearing element is probably the characters Greg and Wirt seem very one-dimensional when we first meet them the energetic kid who always leaps before he looks and the constantly whirring straight man who'd be scared of his own shadow it's a pretty classic comedy dynamic dating back to like the silent era of movies but over the course of the show over the garden wall really works to deepen them especially worked I love how they handle his origin in episode 9 where we see him terrified to ask out a girl named Sarah from his school only to freak out even more when he finds out the famous jason funderberker plans to ask her out too like most people probably I was expecting this to go the obvious route with Jason as some popular jock type and Sarah as a stereotypical cheerleader and the show actually leans into that assumption by having Wirt run to meet her at a football game but then the show pulls the rug out from under us in a really fun way Sarah isn't some 90s movie style cheerleader and Jason definitely isn't some beloved quarterback but the biggest revelation of all is that all these people like worked especially Sarah he's only the Haden nerd and Jason is only the popular ladies man in his own head he's just too neurotic to realize that he needs to get out of his own way now that smart bit of storytelling raises Wirt and his friends beyond the boring cliche that most cartoons would have been more than happy to settle for but where worked is constantly worrying about what others think Greg's journey is about having to consider other people's thoughts and feelings kind of for the first time now don't get me wrong he's a likable kid but he's also pure impulse like most kids are and his choices early on in the show are really just based on what he feels like doing at any given moment that all changes in what might be the show's boldest episode babes in the wood where Greg enters a surreal dreamscape inspired by old 30s and 40s animation and makes a deal with the beast to save warts life at the beginning of the episode word had lashed out at him telling him the fact that they got lost in the first place was all his fault but doesn't cry about it in fact he immediately tries to take responsibility in whatever way he can by going with the Beast even if he's clearly not old enough yet to see that the Beast is tricking him still it's a brave and selfless choice and one that I couldn't see him making at the beginning of the series and then there's probably my favorite lead character Beatrice when Beatrice was first introduced I liked her but I thought she was a pretty predictable spin on an old fantasy trope like instead of the animal friend a guy being peppy and helpful she's really sarcastic and mean fun but not really any more clever than something you'd find in a Shrek movie but when Yuri watch the show her dismissive quips take on a sadder more sinister life as she's clearly trying to keep herself from getting too attached to Wirt or Greg at all since you know that would only make it harder to lead them to their woolly doom by the end of this really short season she's undergone an impressive character art but even in those early episodes her role as the cynical jerk of the group is really important I think it adds even more to the Greg and Wirt dynamic and it gives the show some of its best lines by the time all is said and done I gotta say I think over the garden wall will go down is one of the greatest achievements in animation this decade its blend of childlike wonder and older more adult themes combined to create a world that I just love going back to I mean it's a show with a singing frog but that singing frog is voiced by Tom Waits there's really just nothing else like that so many animated shows seem intent on mean is loud and over-caffeinated as possible and while Greg definitely has some of that energy overall the show is a little more melancholy and thoughtful than that the character designs are simple and fun but the world around them is an amazing mix of gorgeous fall colors and old-fashioned Americana which I think really makes over the garden wall the ultimate Halloween [Music] Captain midnite which you'll find in the description and pins comment below you'd better hurry up and join it what because there's a big adventure ahead the thing to do now is to get started because we're going to have not only barrels of fun but loads our free gifts and prizes
