28:18 was the year of one-plus not only was it awarded smartphone of the year from the likes of mkbhd but it also held the top spot in our speedtest rankings for most of the year with its rain actually going for 16 consecutive months dating all the way back to mid 2017 with 1 plus 5 which you know and the fast-moving world of tech is a pretty impressive streak of course all good things come to an end and that's exactly what happened to 1 plus when it went up against the iPhone 10s max losing his title to that phone which subsequently lost its title just a few months later to the galaxy s 10 Plus which brings us to the matchup that we have here today where the SL plus coming fresh off a title defense against Huawei's P 30 Pro is going up against a phone that was built for speed in the 1 + 7 Pro just like the Galaxy S 10 + d1 + 7 has the same Snapdragon a 55 processor but despite its lower price point it comes with faster u FS 3.0 storage a whopping 12 gigabytes RAM and even a 90 Hertz display now both samsung n1 + say that their phones learn to get faster over time based off how you use the phone so we made sure to do plenty of training with each phone by like basically running our tests over and over across multiple days but the time has a finally come will the galaxy is 10 + remain fumble style speed test champ or will 1 + reclaim the title that it held for so long before as the fastest smartphone in the world let's find out [Music] after the test check out the official free at the first link down below ok we'll get this championship matchup started by heading into the first row where the sm+ is able to pull ahead in facebook with the 1 + 7 Pro quickly recovering in Starbucks putting the two phones neck and neck here in Microsoft Word where each phone is loading up the same 500 page documents looks like the 1 + 7 Pro is able to take the lead by loading the document up first which may in part be due to its faster ufs 3.0 storage the phones perform roughly the same through Excel and despite its pop-up selfie cam the oneplus it didn't give up too much ground in the camera test here in Snapseed we've made things a little more intensive this time around adding not one but two different filters to the same exact photo where the 1 + 7 Pro is it was to complete the task at a faster rate we'll see if we can continue that trend here in lab sites where each one will have to process the same exact video clip and so far it looks like the 1 + 7 Pro is doing so at a significantly faster rates adding onto its lead with it already moving ahead to the browser test with the sm+ finally finishing up with lop sides it has dug itself into a bit of a hole here you won't play 7 Pro is already working on the gaming row so it'll take a significant push from the SM Plus in order for it to make a comeback that said there is a chance the 1 + 7 Pro may not be able to sustain its high level of performance given that it has that extra load of its 90 Hertz display but at least so far it isn't showing any signs of weakness with the phone ripping through fit the fats and moving on to the last game here in bullet force now with the title of thumb of style spice hash champ on the line the galaxy's temp plus has gotta make a move before the end of this first lap as I don't expect either of these phones to have any issues in the second lap given their large amounts of RAM but unfortunately for the S temp plus it loads bullet force at a slower rate while the one +7 Pro blazed through both Spotify and ESPN allowing the seven pro to pull a full app ahead late here in the first lap with its clocking in an impressive time of 2 minutes and 2 seconds with the sm+ taking a full 7 seconds longer to do the same finishing the first lap with a time of 2 minutes and 9 seconds again I don't expect there to be much of a difference here in the second lap given that both phones have just an absurd amount of RAM and so far that's exactly what we're seeing both phones have kept all the apps open and ready to go in the background and both phones are actually doing a good job at switching from app to app pretty smoothly I am impressed with how little of an issue that pop-up camera was in terms of speed for the oneplus 7 pro for some reason I thought that it would slow it down but no it finishes the entire test with flying colors and a time of 2 minutes and 35 seconds with the sm+ finishing 12 seconds later with a time of 2 minutes and 43 seconds making the winner and the new bump of style speed test champ the 1 plus 7 pro for the updated speed test rankings be sure to check out our website at the link below but anyways that is it for me in this video thank you guys for watching and as always I'll see you in the very next episode you
