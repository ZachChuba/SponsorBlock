After eight seasons in 73 episodes Game of Thrones finally came to an end on May 19th 2019 with the final episode the iron throne in the day and age of binge watching Game of Thrones felt like the last popular example of Appointment television since Breaking Bad went off the air in 2013 and the last popular example of a show shrouded in mystery twists and turns and Deep-seated mythology since lost went off the air in 2010 Game of Thrones was admired for its terrific ensemble of characters sharp dialogue elaborate set pieces Action sequences and the way it consistently defied story expectations most notably at the end of season 1 when the show killed off his protagonist in Ned Stark Fan ratings on IMDB were consistently stellar throughout the run of the show Until the final season with the final three episodes receiving by far the worst ratings of the entire series now IMDB isn't the perfect rating system Any list that has Avengers endgame rated as the 17th best movie in film history while jaws is all the way down at 238 has issues, but it still helps give an indication into general audience reception The final few episodes were met with an outpouring of scathing reviews from fans who expected much more from their beloved show a show many Considered to be the best show of all time So where exactly do Game of Thrones go wrong season 7 was the first season that received considerable Backlash for the show's creative decisions Ed Sheeran's cameo was met with a collective cringe It's a new one Character decisions like Jon Snow's plan to venture out beyond the wall in order to capture a single white Walker Seemed idiotic and implausible and the show began to severely alter the pace of characters Across the space of Westeros with some characters travelling seemingly thousands of miles in a single episode But I'll come back to this issue later in my opinion All of those issues were forgivable and didn't detract from what was another fantastic season the real problems began to stack up in season 8 It was a season plagued with both minor annoyances and major issue minor annoyances like cups and plastic bottles being left visible within the frame and The dim lighting that shrouded the seasons third episode the long night in almost perpetual darkness Now maybe to you. These aren't minor annoyances You might think that they speak to the last season's over a lack of attention to detail. Here's why I think they're minor Continuity and production mishaps happen all the time some that immediately come to mind are in North by Northwest Where the child extra preemptively closes his ears before the gunshot even goes off and in Pulp Fiction Where the bullet holes are clearly visible in the wall behind Jules and Vincent before the gun is even fired mistakes happen It's all part of the suspension of disbelief that audiences must undertake when watching a story Plus simple mistakes like the cup and plastic bottle are easy fixes. Since those two episodes premiered They've both already been digitally removed as for the dim lighting in the episode the long night I'd argue that dim lighting was exactly what Cinematographer Fabien fagner was trying to achieve had added to the themes and aesthetic of the episode good and evil light and dark Fire and Ice Darkness was beautifully harnessed to help tell the story it was the Dothraki torches being snuffed out that signaled the ominous threat of the approaching white walkers in the icy winds storm that made It difficult to see also helped us sympathize with John and Daenerys as their vision was purposefully obstructed by the enemy personally I didn't have an issue with the lighting because I watched the episode on my TV at night with all the lights off It's hard to cater to an audience that watches content on such a wide variety of platforms like televisions computers Cell phones and can choose to watch set content anywhere at any time Allowing cinematographers to make creative choices that fit their vision and help tell the story is worth it otherwise Cinematography will be reduced to the blindest lowest common denominator when you're trying to watch something you care about Put yourself in the best position to succeed. This has been your elk tip of the day the major issues of the final season boiled down to two main elements Pacing and character arcs and these two major issues were never more apparent than on May 12 2009 teen in the episode the bells The day I believe Game of Thrones died first pacing Game of Thrones was a show known for its big action sequences, but at its heart it was a show about Conversations two people in a room and how the power of words can be wielded to form alliances and start wars It was the definition of slow-burn storytelling over the course of a season or even multiple seasons The chess pieces were slowly and deliberately moved in their proper places so they could take action and it was in these scenes that the show was able to effectively build up the characters while simultaneously Feeding the story. We were given character relations Motivations and exposition and by giving the audience this information the big moments of action carried more weight Because we cared about the characters involved. We knew why characters were doing what they were doing And what was at stake it was this methodical pace that made Game of Thrones stand apart for example in season one There's a whole storyline involving Catelyn Stark having to negotiate safe passage for Rob's army across the Trident at the green fork from Walder Frey There was this attention to detail that made the show feel authentic The Creators didn't just wash over these details every moment was earned in the show was better for it in the first six seasons Movement across Westeros and Essos was slow and methodical but starting in season seven The pace was severely altered movement was blurred and storylines were rushed Jaime Lannister was jumping around from King's Landing to Highgarden while Jon Snow popped in between Winterfell and Dragonstone as if they were next-door neighbours and in the season 7 episode Beyond the wall time and space was almost completely thrown out the window when Jon and his fellow hunters realized that their outmatched ginjury runs all the way back to the wall sends a raven that flies halfway across Westeros to Danny and Dragonstone who then hops on her dragon and flies all the way up to John beyond the wall and what appears to be a single night in the story but only takes 17 minutes in the I Understand that this is a fantasy story and I already stated the importance of audiences suspension of disbelief earlier in this video But it's this inconsistency with the stories establish pace over six years That feels jarring and this pacing issue only got worse in game of thrones' final season time and time again Game of Thrones Reminded the audience of the approaching danger of the night king and the White Walkers It's their presence and threat that kicks off the very beginning of the entire series The creator's invested so much time throughout the series building up this unstoppable force But then in the episode the long night They're defeated in a single episode and when it was all over I couldn't help but feel a resounding Men part of that might be because Expectations had been built up to impossible levels after promising this battle for over seven seasons But I think the biggest reason this battle felt underwhelming was because the stakes weren't clearly defined There must be something at stake in order to create drama If we don't do X then Y will happen which means Z for our characters Instantly the audience has something to connect to and care about in the episode We're told if we don't fight to protect Bran then the night king will conquer the world Which means that our collective memory will be erased first the characters don't really explain any kind of real fighting strategy So we're just watching people and monsters Clash into each other and then the idea of the night king conquering the world and erasing memory is far too vague and intangible I don't really even understand what it means or what that looks like So it's difficult to put my finger on it and feel the weight of it Since this entire battle was rushed and crammed into a single episode these important story beats weren't given the proper time for exploration and understanding Another way the quickened pace of the final season hurt Game of Thrones is that it robbed the audience of precious moments with the characters We weren't able to understand how they felt about particular situations Which also meant that we lacked clarity for the motivations that led to their eventual action, for example? Sandor and Aria venture off together from Winterfell down to King's Landing after the battle with the night king But we don't see them again until they eventually arrived at King's Landing the next episode in past seasons We would have spent time with them on that long journey We would have been given insight and perspective and how they're feeling and would have laid out clear goals plans and stakes But we're not given any of that. And so those story elements are left vague. We're kept at arm's reach Disconnected from the characters as opposed to experiencing these moments and emotions alongside them By far the most damning example of this pacing issue was with Daenerys Targaryen a character whose descent into madness Which should be the show's most dramatic story revelation happened almost entirely off screen with little to no Explanation or motivation and basically two episodes which leads me into my next major issue with Game of Thrones its final season second character arcs a character arc is the inner transformation of a character over the course of a story the character begins as one sort of person and Gradually transforms into a different sort of person as a direct result of their experiences and choices within the story Some classic character arc examples are physical where the underdog character rises to the top like Rocky Balboa Emotional where the immature or an experienced character battles their inner demons to become a better person like George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life an Egotistical where the worst parts of a character are intensified until they become the worst version of themselves like Walter White in Breaking Bad The final season of Game of Thrones saw the remaining characters arcs come to a close and even though a few of them were done exceptionally well and fit the characters like Theon Greyjoy and Sandor Clegane a vast majority of them were poorly executed and some even betrayed the characters themselves Jon Snow's story of bastard to true heir of the throne was amazing, but the entire last season He was reduced to a passive character Watching everything happen around him Cersei Lannister also became a passive character in the final season for a character who was always one step ahead of everyone else scheming and Manipulating her way to the top. She spent a vast majority of her little screen time in the final season simply staring out a window For some reason her one and only plan was to Bank entirely on scorpions to slay the one remaining dragon She did virtually nothing right up until the point where she was buried under rocks Jaime Lannister's Ark is personally the most disappointing for me this transformation from the golden boy Ruthless Kingslayer to a vulnerable sympathetic character seeking Redemption made him one of the most fascinating And endearing characters in the entire story but in the final few episodes his art is completely thrown at the window as he decides to go back to Cersei and ultimately die alongside her and Again, I think the show's biggest betrayal was in their handling of Daenerys his character personally I didn't mind the final destination of Danny's character taking the breaker of chains in Transforming her into a power obsessed tyrant would make for a wonderful character arc the problem Is that creators David Benioff and DB Weiss didn't earn that transformation Here's an excerpt from the anatomy of story by John Truby regarding character arcs Character change doesn't happen at the end of the story. It happens at the beginning more precisely It is made possible at the beginning by how you set it up in other words The main character doesn't suddenly flip to being someone else The main character completes a process which has been occurring throughout the story of becoming who she is in a deeper and more focused way Effective character change is slow and methodical but Daenerys suddenly flipped from leader to tyrant. And what seemed like two episodes The writers through a lot of obstacles at Daenerys all at once no support from the north the threat of Jon as the true heir Jorah killed reg all killed missandei killed betrayal by Varys it's a lot I get that but since the final season was so rushed there wasn't the usual time to ruminate and Examine each of these obstacles they wash over both her and the audience in a small amount of screen time When the episode the Belles begins were just told flippantly that Daenerys has been isolated for days in her chamber You haven't seen anyone since we returned Hasn't left two chambers hasn't accepted any food. We don't even get to see this isolation Firsthand were just told it and since we don't get to experience that full transformation into madness with her it makes her ultimate decision to burn everything and One in King's Landing feel all the more out of character for her as John Truby says in his book this final Transformation of Daenerys should complete the process of what's been occurring since the very beginning of the story But this isn't the process that's been laid out to viewers since the beginning even though the creators would like you to think That it is Danny had been cold and calculating in the past but it was never violence for the sake of violence Violence was only ever tolerated when someone oppressed her like the tarly's or oppressed others like the sack of hasta ploy Whenever there were random acts of violence like when her dragons killed a little girl in slavers Bay She immediately chained them up There were moments of foreshadowing like the vision of the Great Hall and ruins with what we now know is ash falling from the sky in the common expression Every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin These are all bits of random foreshadowing but foreshadowing is not character development It can't be wielded like a trump card in your back pocket that you can just throw down at any moment to justify wild leaps and character transformation When the bells were ringing at King's Landing, there was no difficult decision between mercy and throne She had both the people already surrendered So what was it about the bells ringing that made her go full-on mad, Queen We weren't given any clear indication for her motivation and because of that her decision felt like a betrayal to the audience and the show The television show past the book series by George RR martin with season six and because of that Martin told HBO and the creative staff a general outline of how a storyline would continue and eventually in Because of that this final season feels like Benioff Weiss and the rest of the writing staff were forcing their writing towards a specific end Point as opposed to naturally writing for the characters and their already established arcs and so Daenerys became a villain because Well, the show needed a villain not because of thoughtful payoffs over time It was indicative of the writing style across the final season, which continually focused more on shocked than story After Danny's character altering decision We only see her basically for two more scenes in the entire series her Sene and her death see again It felt like the show glazed over this monumental moment to deliver a hasty resolution and because of that I couldn't help but feel emotionally unattached from everything The last great episode that perfectly encapsulated a game of thrones' strong elements was in the episode a night of the Seven Kingdoms It was an episode that allowed itself to focus on character like the knighting of Brienne which was a highlight of not only the final season but the entire series a Majority of the strongest moments in the final season revolved around two characters in a room talking debating scheming The first six seasons of Game of Thrones each had ten episodes the season seven and seven episodes and season eight had only six episodes Because of that the show that was once defined by its conversations Methodical pacing and strong character arcs quickly devolved into a show that focused more on empty shock and spectacle Which is exactly what happened on May 12th 2019 the day Game of Thrones died Tuesday is new video day here and entertained the elk So make sure you hit subscribe below But also hit the bell button below so that we don't miss any new videos whenever they come out YouTube has moved away from the subscriber model So even if you are subscribed to entertain the elk YouTube's not guaranteed to share my videos with you all the time But clicking the bell below fixes all those stupid issues So again, click the bell right now So that way you don't miss any new content whenever it comes out If you enjoyed this video, please like it and share with a friend and leave me a comment below Tell me when you think Game of Thrones died, or maybe you don't think it died Maybe you thought it was great all the way through a couple of quick announcements Check out my ASMR relaxation Channel It's called quietly elk where I read books poetry screenplays and anything else to help you relax and fall asleep click the blue elf button below so that way you can go check out that channel and I'm taking the month of June off because I'm gearing up to direct this short film that I wrote that's gonna happen at the end but in the meantime Please leave me comments below telling me what you'd like to see me explore next in this day something died series Thanks again everyone for watching and I will see you all next time
