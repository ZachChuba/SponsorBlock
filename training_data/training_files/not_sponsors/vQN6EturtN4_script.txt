this is horrible ha ha Shawn Mendes video totally doable for 20k absolutely absolutely and just seeing them bows here at $1,850 already yeah what's going on guys Ted here and today we are talking about how to produce prep and plan any music video regardless of what your budget is this episode is sponsored by air table but again it's worth glowing these tips are gonna work no matter what software you're using to kick things off we're meeting is my friend Moses Israel who's an amazing producer that's produced videos from everyone from Pharrell to Diplo to Jaden Smith he's also familiar with what it takes to produce a project unlike a zero dollar budget and your mom's pick up that hey DP do you want a DP a Shawn Mendes video I'm gonna give you $400 here we've got three music videos and we're gonna pretend as if a director is coming to us with this as the treatment and this is the video that they want to make they refuse to cut anything in the actual music video so you gotta make it happen on the budget is it possible and can we actually do this it's very realistic to hearing that because that sounds about right like this is the budget we have this is the vision my job is put it together and being realistic like realistically this is what we have this is what you want let's find the middle ground neither Moses nor I have seen them we're gonna watch them identify what are the major production expenses and what of a logistics moses is actually going to walk through exactly how he would produced prep and budget each of these videos and to really see it in action and ask Moses to do this live so you can actually watch him do it in real time and see the thought process put your producing hats on because today we're gonna go through how to do three different music videos at three different low budget prep projects ultra-low budget $500 music video number two we're doing a three thousand dollar music video so someone's coming out they've got some actual budget they want to make something happen and for our last and final music video we're talking ten to twenty thousand dollars this is kind of our high low end of students so this right here is Tessa violet crush have you seen this video before I have not I've seen this video before either let's go this is the low budget or mmm-hmm a couple of cast members here probably friends of the artist okay it's I mean so far super low budget it's one artist and one location one location it also looks like it's almost all naturally lit from the fluorescence above little punch on her face just a little bit of soft life but not much some of them you can tell they might have went handheld but it's a little scooper you're going into like videos like this you call in a favor they're like you're somebody in the family or somebody that you have a good connection with that owns a chain of grocery stores yeah that you can just say hey let us have access to the store for like three or four hours okay all right Moses for this video do you think we can do it for less than $500 or is it way over that totally can do it under 500 Sam calling in favors for posts you're editing your DP you're probably getting all the camera gear from like a buddy that owns all this stuff because it didn't look like crazy lighting setups like it's probably somebody that owns their own gear probably like a crew of less than five or six people I think this is one day like less than six hours we don't have to pay five grand for a location and we don't need insurance we don't need to pull a permit all of these fees are already gonna be over like a little under 10k if you're doing it the big budget route so grocery store can accommodate for a lot of logistics restrooms taken care of parking taking the perfect filming location boom for staging there's all these aisles and stuff that camera department can have a camera cart build their stuff we're looking about a five statistics person crew that is all doing this for a favor so we want to find friends of the artist friends of the director or friends of the DP you're bringing people you know that can come and like donate a half a day for free all for the love of this artist I'm thinking your DP him or her is probably camera operating the focus looked pretty good the whole way through so you probably have a first AC you obviously have your director who's probably gonna double as a DI T you probably have one art director with an extra set of hands so far we're at five you have me that's six makeup and wardrobe you had a one person or maybe one person someone on GE and then maybe like a PA so at the most you're looking at nine people your camera team there you own a camera maybe one of your gaffers has like three or four aperture lighting kits that they can bring out that or that can state you know a couple of C stands and so it's very this is this is a Xindi as it gets for sure what you're gonna spend money on is crafty mmm catering mmm hard drives a camera rental or anything in post where I can see that being a little tricky to get for free where maybe you have a really great editor but they want two hundred bucks if they're coming out for free or for a very low rate you're feeding them through their stomach catering clinic box crafting a little here we're looking at somewhere between 300 to 350 dollars for your catering your crafty plus your hard drives your hard drives and the remaining two hundred dollars you put towards either kind of a camera or rental or something like that or your editor so it's like one place that you want to splurge a little bit or you can take that 200 and say okay we have everything paid for let's get some nicer glass let's get some better lenses what are your next steps in terms of immediately after this let's go location scout this with your with your key the key department head so you're probably looking at the DP the director art department I can see like an art director being there so they can see like what logos are things they're gonna have to turn or be aware of or be conscious of so while we're location scouting my team and I we're looking for these logistical things where are the restrooms where are people gonna park a little green room if there's a makeup area that we're gonna stage crafty and catering let's have a space set up for that if you overlook this stuff on the day of the shoot you're gonna have people asking you a thousand questions where's the restroom where is this where and that's you can think of any of this stuff you're kind of screwed so it really comes down to after the location scout you really understand what is absolutely needed what is a luxury what can we get rid of right after the scout we're putting together a concrete budget and then from there just locking in all your crew and then you're pulling together a schedule for a project like this it's probably made doing the schedule so that way if we're dealing with location they want to see what time are we rolling in all righty so on this gonna show you do you think that we actually need makeup and wardrobe on set absolutely on a shoot like this they had a makeup artist because she doesn't look reflective at all and then wardrobe just in between takes somebody tidying up to make sure looks clean so yeah next up we're talking $3,000 for our budget this one is called wallows of these days have you seen this music video I have not seen good here we go let's do this $3,000 it's on nice very Wes Anderson oh oh you see that oh they have a good lift there this looks like it was shot on location as well yeah oh my is that a celebrity he looks like one of the Jonas Brothers old fish we have an animal in here animal weapon whoa oh we got star stunts so you probably have crash pads for that they're falling Oh makeup Oh makeup you got blood this is pretty hard it's clearly an actor and you probably audition these people so that's part of pre-production this is good this is juicy oh all right $3,000 Moses I can budget this out and we can see it's probably landing between closer to five days okay this is for sure doable for 5k I think even though there's like special-effects makeup there's a stunt it's very minimal logistics wise one-house restrooms you probably have restrooms in the home there's probably residential parking crew size you're probably like 20 to 30 people for sure there's stunts there's a part where they all fall off of the lift specialty makeup casting wardrobe there's even a goldfish in there so there's an animal in there see that there's they're harder animals this is this is this is a drive to Pet Smart oh the biggest thing is the lift once again it's a bright shiny one we want to hunt that down as soon as possible priority wise if I were to see this video is location getting us that lift and starting the casting process in media they didn't cut any corners on the visual so you're probably budget wise on these thirty people looks like you're you have a solid camera team it's lit very nicely so you probably have like a good 5 tons package with like a nice set of light lights in there yeah sure for sure normally when you see exterior day there's all kinds of harsh shadows yeah harsh daylight but here it's very nice Baron Samedi as much people as there is on the camera team there's probably that amount of people on the art department a meaning that you have a production designer you have an art director you have a set dresser and then probably like a props person the highest paid person is gonna be 400 bucks only because if we're trying to stay between 3,000 to 5,000 we're gonna say it's four thousand ten percent should be your DPS even paid 10% when our artists may be paid I start with production and triple my way down so let's say your first ad 200 bucks now I want to pay my key PA something else I'll also pay him 202 production assistants let's say if this is indie route we're gonna get two guys at 150 apiece we're already at 700 bucks very good oh and let's say our DP lets pay their mother a low rate of 400 but they're gonna need a camera team so first AC base of 200 but then the person below them is gonna be yet and just animals here at $1,850 already and we're only halfway through they can have a gaffer and key we're gonna put them at 200 let's give them some swings so let's say that each swing is coming out for 150 our art director production designer we're gonna pay that person the same rate as our DP well for makeup I would say it's gonna be hard to give them 400 so let's say 200 and then they're also like a hair person and they kind of also have an eye for wardrobe so I would get someone that can like do makeup in hair and then once the talent gets in their wardrobe in between takes they're like lint rolling doing little adjustments things that like the same Department can do so we're at 3,500 just for the crew what do you think this video was actually shed for I would put this at the 20 to 25 K range I would say we could pull this off for like comfortably for like 17 to 20 K well that is a lot of money so let's go back to 3 5 K alright alright so but senator the director is gonna edit this thing for free cool so I would say two hard drives that are like two to three terabytes you're looking at 145 some prop rentals and prop purchases meaning that inside of her bedroom there's all kinds of set dressing going on for the main band that's on that lift they have guitars they have a whole set up we have the actual lifts and then if you remember the paramedic guy brings a gurney all of that is a rental the said deck was like papers and posters you know set that at like 200 bucks let's see we we go on share grid we get a camera and lenses package for 400 bucks this is like an Alexa Mini with some like CP twos or CP threes and the camera package has like everything you need cards card reader it's got a monitor hundy when it comes to the grip truck grip and lighting we're also going to share it like three ton fourth hutton package for like 500 bucks and let's say that group truck has some sky panels in it written there we're in their production vehicles we're gonna need to rent a Sprinter van 50 bucks and that's just $50 for Sprinter van port revenge so production supplies is tables chairs coolers director chairs 300 bucks I'm putting in a hundred bucks for two actors it's the main girl and then the dancing do at the end so how we gonna cut this down to five location we're gonna need to find a free location little-known fact in Los Angeles if you shoot in the city of San Fernando it's the only city in the Los Angeles County where you don't need a film permit if you're on private property I would say we have to find a house in San Fernando then I'll look at my DP and I'm gonna say you're gonna have to operate so I'm gonna zero out our camera operator budget I'm gonna tell art department you were cutting your Pierre art Piet's hmm we're gonna leave crafty and catering the same because we want to feed them properly let's scale down our drip truck to like a three ton package that shaves off a couple hundred bucks three hundred dollars for a three tons and share grid checkout share that is amazing I'm gonna ask our key department heads to take a smaller rate DP on the 300 our directors down the 300 now we're at 5500 this crews gonna hate us we're gonna have to feed them good after lunch we'll make to go plate so that way when we wrap they also get plates this is what I mean like let's treat our crew good because we're paying them such a low rate for a Stacy let's give them the legal Los Angeles rate one hundred and eighty five dollars and fifty cents it's kind of a random number why are we landing at 185 50 185 50 is in the state of California on the year of 2019 that is what minimum wage translates to for a 12-hour sheet but it could vary depending on what state here yes varies what year you're in and minimum wage I live in that moment yes this horrible it's horrible terrible yeah these are conversations that the conversations you have that police video happen oh yeah let's get some cheaper hard drives we're gonna go like I don't want hard drive brands out there we're buying new robot okay let's say 80 bucks for two Terry well let's see if the band can bring their own instruments the gurney in the lifts there's really no way around that so let's bring that down like 200 bucks there's a $5,000 I would say before I cut all this I would go to the label to the artist and say can we have more money I already know the answer to your question I just want to ask as the producer letting them see being transparent about everything like this is bare-bones like we're we're trying really hard we're sure I lost Sarah if there's director's assistant directors more often than not cinematographers who are represented by an agency they have an agent so that means that I'm not dealing with the DP I'm dealing with the agent when it comes to negotiating their deal memo their rate all of that so I can't touch the DP rate because the agent is very firm in saying this is the minimum they're gonna come out for and we're talking about how much money in this case we're talking like upwards of like 1,200 bucks hundred bucks or day per day Wow if their director or the label was very firm on like we have to use this VP then I know specifically I can't touch that number as I'm doing this in squeezing numbers being conscious of their certain line items we cannot touch now before we software is here it is now let's do number three here we go moving on to a ten thousand dollar budget Shawn Mendes if I can't have I have not seen it I've not seen this video another sign though you ready let's see it I don't know right now this seems pretty reasonable let's just hope it's this one shot for the entire video on a 5 d nothing else this one shot right on no no no things are changing oh no no oh you're gonna wet down on the floor here couch we got backdrop we didn't see any dolly tracks sticking a crane instead yeah techno crane yeah you're right yeah yeah oh yeah we're getting 360 rolls no we have an actress in there look at that lighting setup no no there's a lot of like 8-millimeter footage kind of a filter going on that's kind of cool we're gonna need to do a lot of pre-production so that way we can pull it off in one day oh no unicorns a choir of people in this Red Mill ah coming real quick what does it take a crane for the audience it's a big crane that you can put a camera on and what separates a crane from a techno crane is the telescoping movement you can push in and pull back you have that with the capabilities of a crane that you get nice swooping 30-foot long shots and that alone is like okay that's a technical okay let me ask real quick how much do you think it costs to make that video I think this video probably cost like sixty to seventy thousand dollars because they probably shot in multiple days what's number two this budget so what is the key to getting this year getting more money you got to have those conversations with the client artist the label so I would say sponsorship is the first thing one of the biggest set pieces is a grand piano there's a white Steinway grand piano so I would basically reach out to Steinway and let them know that we're looking for a donation and we also need a piano and it's for Shawn Mendes they know Shawn Mendes can reach a million audience members with the release of this video where they can't really even do that with regular advertising so at the end of the day they can probably give us a piano and like five grand do it officially and like show them a one page of what Shawn Mendes is and like his whole branding so and you think it's actually possible you can actually pull another time absolutely you asked for an extra 10 K yeah and they give it to you now the ball is in your court where you're like oh shoot can we pull this off for twenty I'm gonna give everybody their proper eight and then we'll come back and trim if we need to starting with production let's base things at the fourth right so let's put our department heads at four and then the lower tier and like two cinematographer let's give them again 750 after the DPA we're booking our operator one thing about the techno crane knows guys are a minimum of 750 and there's no real way around that you need to you need someone to operate the head and someone to operate the actual crane and usually those guys are awesome they work on like a true detective and like they're they're legit legit production designer I'm gonna give you your PD the same rate that we give our cinematographers that's standard you're so tired for a new production designer mo watch there yeah makeup and hair can be one but it's a Shawn Mendes video which means we're gonna have to pay his stylist he probably has a style as he comes with a lot so all of crews taken care of and we're I know for sure mr. Shawn Mendes video we want to cover RS we're gonna get some into production insurance we don't want anything falling back on his name my production company has it or you know what if he's with a label the label has production insurance location fees let's say we're gonna get that soundstage for a one-day shoot three K is pretty average meals I'm gonna do ten to eleven dollars a head craft services four hundred bucks if we have a crafty person that's doing hot crafty drops like warm food there they're cooking they're doing stuff it's gonna make us look like a badass let's give them three hundred bucks that's with their kid let's say we got a really good post house fifteen hundred bucks let's get some good hard drives so let's say I'm gonna pay $185 per hard drive something like a G Drive is a more trusted brand you don't want to explain it a label that you got the cheaper that you got the cheap you don't want to explain to the label that you got the cheap drive we got good hard drive okay cool I would say get threes just to be safe art rentals so we have a couch treadmill instruments right so there was like microphones and stuff choir was just standing on Apple boxes remember we're getting a piano donated so we don't have to put the piano in here wet down how do you do it though a lot of the warehouses already have hoses and spouts set up so that way you can know what down that's as simple as like getting a PA or like a high-ranking crew member to do a proper wet down let's say the warehouse didn't have that you'd probably want to rent a water truck that's doesn't have to be regulated for motion-picture when it comes to psi in production supplies all include one of those squeegee pushers so that way you can push water where you want it couch you're looking at under 100 bucks dad same under 100 or treadmill under 100 microphones there were a lot of them in the video so we're looking at a $200 range look at their return policy it's cheaper to pay your art team to an extra day to do returns if you can fully get all that money back there's probably gonna be some art purchases for example like the bed linens right where you probably wouldn't want to return that you know a man's life in those shoes oh and there a backdrop at the beginning you can't return a backdrop right if it's a paper photography backdrop it's like something you know they look like a 12-footer one so that's 90 bucks cameras inland camera lens let's say we're getting an Alexa Mini with like it might even use atom morphix on that this is closer to a thousand dollar rental Wow thousand dollars for Alexa Mini with an award with anamorphic monitoring water share grid once again for the save how much would this cost beer going through a proper rim plus three grand minimum dude grip truck I would also put that out of good like a thousand bucks just to make sure grip and electric have the proper support we're gonna give them an allowance of $700 and say don't go over your allowance make this happen yeah production supplies I would beef this up to more like a $600 thing well and where do you rent most these Brent refresh the place for the last like three or four years I'm renting them from Quixote from cass tech's TPT the production truck where 18k not bad art departments gonna need to transport a couch a bed all these backdrops so art departments gonna need a truck or cargo van so now that rate is multiplied by two by two because you have two of those now but you remember when you rent out these vehicles you have to return them with the property gas so so far so good now the last thing is telling hey you're gonna come out for four to five hours I'm gonna give them each $100 then we have ten of them so that's easily a thousand bucks right and so that almost puts us over budget so that means I now have a couple hundred bucks to get the model usually these models also represented by an agency five hundred bucks for this model and that's it and then another thing too is like a lot of these budgets we're not putting any contingencies in there like are were right at the 20k mark I'll still go back and try to shave off a thousand bucks because it's good to have 10 to 15% of the whole budget so I'll go in I'll try to trim off 1,300 so now our budget lands at 19 K and then I have a thousand dollars to play with maybe I talked to the artisans manager and I asked the manager like give us a bunch of free merch free CDs so that way when we wrap when we hand people to check we're handing them a Shawn Mendes head something so that way the crew feels like oh these guys kind of care about us it costs nothing the label has a million of the right exactly it cost them nothing marches like you know they they can donate a bunch of it so Shawn Mendes video totally doable for fun again absolutely alright even well it's tight there you go there's you have site of Indy mogul producing on a budget with Moses Israel there's a comment down below if you get any questions about producing tips or things that want most to help answer thank you guys for having me this is really cool for sure if thanks wasn't out good Dion usually does sheets it's a music memorabilia eBay there to see so now you can think as a creative producer
