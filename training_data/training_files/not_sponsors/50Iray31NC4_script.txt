ODOSSI Get in the back seat. Get in the back seat. HI~ Why did you tell me to come all the way here? I'm going to do a horror story contest. Do you know any scary stories? A scary story? I get sleep paralysis..... Oh, my gosh. Why are you surprised to see my face? We're going to have a scary story special. I heard you know a scary story. I had sleep paralysis. I'm sleeping. I was lying on the bed like this...   I lie down and I close my eyes, but I can still see. I can see very well. There's a girl on my toes who's looking down. (Don't get caught.) There's a woman with hair. (Please look over there.) I'm going to take these scissors off. I'm already scared. I saw how to relieve paralysis on the Internet. I saw on the Internet that moving my fingers or toes will relieve my paralysis. I just moved my fingers and toes. But all of a sudden! Suddenly!! Her ghost came to my ears and... (He's here, too.) "You know how to relieve paralysis? It's pretty good." So I'm wide awake.   (I have to get out....) (Done with the ghost story LOLLLL) Did you go through this in Gwangju? Do you have frequent paralysis? (Let's get out of here.) Are you paralyzed when you sleep because you're not feeling well? (Get out of the way.) (I have nothing to say now LOLLLLL)     (Careful Careful) (Passed to open the lid) That's right. Sleeping when I'm out of energy causes sleep paralysis. The ghost was a woman with long hair, wasn't? (Experiencing extreme jobs LOLLL) (Detailed hand gestures) I'm scared.
- You've been through it. What are you afraid of? (Settings complete) I will post the ghost story you just told us in our scary story contest. You can leave for the office now, and I'll be removed from the side, so go to the next seat.         Oh my gosh! You must be crazy!!!!!!! Is it a person? It's a person! What are you doing? What are you doing? Hello Our leader ordered it.   Sorry (I've never met...) I'm sorry. I thought you were a mannequin. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(Fake hands appear) (The fear isn't over yet!!!) Oh! What is this?! What's wrong with me? LOLLLLLLLLLLLL Now that you're done, go home. Your job is done. Good-bye It's coming! It's coming! Sora, please get in the back seat. I have a lot of luggage in the front seat. Hello   You know we're doing YouTube, right? We give a prize to the person who tells the scariest story.     You know what you have to do, don't? You mean I'm telling scary stories? Help us by telling scary stories. Do you know any scary stories? There's a story I've been through myself. Tell me about it. I'll see if you're scared or not. Oh, is this also an audition? It's not easy to do YouTube. It was a really creepy story for me. A long time ago, my boyfriend and I... went to Gapyeong. I rented a double-decker house. It's a living room on the first floor and a structure where you can sleep on the second floor. (Sneaking out a ghost) The first and second floors were all glass. (Oh, I'm so nervous.) If you lie down on the second floor, you can see the first floor through the glass. I came up to the second floor with my boyfriend after eating. I lied down and the front door sensor light turned on on the first floor. Suddenly? At first, I thought the sensor light was on because a fly was flying. (Why can't you open it? Then you'll get caught.) The light on the first floor is even scarier because it looks like a glass from the second floor. I'm sitting there talking to my boyfriend, and I don't care. The sensor light turns on again on the first floor. Second
-(Top-open successful) I was too scared to speak for a minute. The air in the pension is also very scary. It felt like someone was here with us, not us. (LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL) When I said I was scared, my boyfriend went down to the first floor and said he would take out the sensor light. What's so scary is that what if the sensor light turns on again when I take out my back?   My boyfriend went to the first floor and took out the sensor light. (Checking the camera) My boyfriend came up to the second floor with his back out on the sensor light and was talking again. The sensor light is back on!!! (That's enough!!) This story is real. My boyfriend took out the light bulb and the sensor light came back on.   My hands were shaking because I was scared. I was so scared that they sat still in bed.
-(I'm so scared, too. I'm afraid it'll be too funny.) I came out of the pension with my bag as soon as the sun rose. Go back to the office and tell me this story again.   (Now it's my turn!) Is that a fish?  LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL   I've got a big fish!!!       Sora, I'm sorry. LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL (It's not over yet!)   Are you okay? I hit you hard...   (Good Sora sitting back in her seat) There's no oxygen in the trunk, so sleep.   (Changing mood to go back to fear)   I'm really sorry.
-(Fake hands) (No handshake! ) (Try again)     That's the best reaction! Don't trust us till the end!   Sora, I'm done now, so go! Get me out of here. Thank you, Sora! Hi, Somi. Get in the back seat. I have a lot of luggage in the front seat. Please clean your car. It's so nice to be outside after a long time.
-(Light character)   Do you know any scary stories? I have a scary dreamer story. It's a dream I had myself. I had a dream about you. (Starting to come out) You run to me and say, "Somi, save me." But your body is all white. (Carefully opening) You're wearing white clothes from head to toe. I said, "What do I do?" You say, "I'm going to hide," and then you jump to my left.
-(I'm already hiding) It's going so fast. (Now is the chance!!)) (Passed to open the lid) The person who came after you is black from head to toe. (My face is white.) A black man came to me and asked me where you are. (It's hard to get out of my hair) He's angry at me asking where you are. (Watching his face for fear of getting caught.) I said, "I went this way." (Turns to turn)
- The black guy was running, but only his feet were white.     (Checking to see if he looks okay.)   (Settings complete)     (Now it's my turn again.) Give me my camera next to you.       The camera? Is this it?     Is this the camera? (Please look at me.) You scared me!! FUC,,,,,,, You scared me.     You didn't see this? I thought you were pretending you didn't know   I really didn't see it. Really??? I thought it was a hidden camera. That's hilarious!   You know the fake hands!   The clothes are thick. So I couldn't feel it. When I sat down like this, I could see the hair on the side. I'm sorry.
-(Fake hands appear)       Fake hands! Fake hands!     Oh no. I cursed too much.   Now that you're done, go home. Goodbye. Thank you. You're going through a lot ODOSSI
