my favorite quote in the world is I'm going to make everything around me beautiful that will be my life I learned this quote four years ago and since then it's shifted completely my outlook on life I have beauty goggles on basically non-stop now whether it's admiring the detail of the beautiful Silas or like tiny little insects or admiring the whole beautiful building that is in front of me or admiring the sad times that I'm experiencing and the feelings associated with that or even admiring the surcoat ugly locations or typically ugly things there's beauty everywhere choosing to see life through this beauty lens has really helped me as an artist perhaps this is why I can personally find beautiful locations to always shoot in there is never ever a shortage for me to find these locations so today I'm going to be sharing with you the thought process that I go into when I'm looking for beautiful places to photograph so you can find it as many as you can and create beautiful art I don't have the luxury of planning a help photo shoot so I'm very spontaneous in choosing locations and the locations that I find and I stumble upon they literally dictate the entire photo shoot for me I'll be driving along and I'll see a bunch of ties and I'll dress appropriately to that experience to make sure that I get the most out of the location right now I'm in a tiny little village in Germany and even the Vodafone guys just up the road will laughing that I'm here they're like what are you doing in this tiny village but to me this is the most beautiful location I could be in and I've just seen beauty everywhere and I've taken photographs with a range of objects including my home a pile of tires the wind turbines the grass the hay fields are shot in sunlight at nighttime to give a variety of shots I've showed in the cornfield I've shown inside the sunflowers fields I know the question will be but what if I live in this village or live in a small town or live in a small city what can I do if I'm not traveling as much as you well I've got a full list I got one so if I did live here I would take photos with the horses cows chickens with the tractors in the area the people's guns or around their homes basically if it's a small village you probably know the people here so you can just ask them be like I like your garden can I take a photo I shoot in front of the whole beautiful arms I'd drive an hour and shoot at the beach I'd shoot neither local plants I shoot at the local cafe I Streetman the playground I street at the local lake with sights and get permission to shoot in schools on the weekend should inside the corridor shoot inside the classrooms Shido on the basketball courts shoot in the playground and then I just tailor my outfits to make sure that it matches with this school environment it would like a cool edgy photoshoot and in each of these locations I change outfits a million times posed differently and at the photos differently that would give me a variety of shots and then you also have the change of seasons so you can go back to the locations you've shot during one particular season and shoot it during a different season and it's gonna be a completely different photograph and then I would also shoot in different times of day in those exact same locations which would completely change the entire feel of that photograph also I Drive to the local city probably like an hour way to get city shots use what you got man stop making excuses I firstly choose locations that can give me as much variety in one location as possible whenever I'm traveling I look for a hotel or Airbnb that is really beautiful inside and it has a variety of shots even if it's a tiny little room if you've seen my tiny room challenge you know exactly what I'm talking about that room itself just has to have a variety of corners that look completely different and can give a variety of shoots because I don't want to just get two snaps out of a location like if I'm paying to stay in our hotel I'm better be able to get some nice photographs out of that to say you are a photographer or you've been taking your advanced selfies if you're going out to shoot for the day which is something I recommend taking like a huge chunk of time out to go explore and take as many photos as possible just because it's fun and there's never a time restraint but anyway that's a point if you're taking a model or yourself I would find like a forest that is close enough to like a hay field or at the beach or a little city or a town or something just to spend the entire day photographing it's so much fun like why wouldn't you want to do that and then you get so many different photos from that change your hair change your makeup change your accessories again work with what you have in one spot you can take photos from above below straight on close-up far away sitting standing one location many options interrupting the broadcast your first purchase of a domain or website likewise I always aim to shoot in natural light basically because I don't really have the luxury of caring but lighting equipment with me because I'm a full time traveler I aim to generally shoot always at golden hour so sunrise or sunset that is the best life ever as a beginner photographer I do encourage you to definitely shoot during golden hour it's just so much easier and you can't really stop and stuff it up by the time you finish shooting all the locations during sunset you should probably be skilled enough by that time to start shooting those locations during the harshest Sun so that means you can go back to all those locations and shoot again giving you a completely different feel to the photograph especially if you switch up the hair makeup accessories clothing and so forth normal location scouting so no matter where you are in the world you can try the normal method of just going onto Instagram for example and putting the hashtag of the city you're in or the country you're in and seeing what comes up that could lead you to beautiful locations to photograph in another great way is to stay in beautiful Airbnb Zoar hotels that have a nice environment to shoot and if it's too expensive and you can't afford it right now we could do is just become best friends with the manager and ask them young man is it okay if I go into these rooms after someone checks out but it's still messy so I don't mess it up for you and just take a few photographs and your beautiful hotel room tell them you're studying photography and see if it's possible for you to just spend half an hour in between the cleaning sessions before the cleaner comes along just practicing so that there's no mess you don't leave a mess and you practice your shots yes you're gonna get rejected by a lot of hotels I so what keep going until you can get into a hotel because there will be someone that will say yes and if this sounds like a very daunting thought to go approach to the manager ask for this dude not many people would be asking this is a golden opportunity for you it's gonna be hot yes it's gonna be scary but if it works you have a beautiful location for free hell yeah to do great things you must push the boundaries sometimes finally I am NOT an expert in location scouting I just take photographs non-stop wherever I can that's my approach to this whole thing you see me with a camera basically non-stop it's my addiction and I just make it work I just have fun with it but hopefully these tips have helped you in one way or another here is my Instagram if you'd like to check out my photographs and until next time as a side note I bought these in case everyone's likes around on't steel they're from that beautiful sunflower field you found I bought these
