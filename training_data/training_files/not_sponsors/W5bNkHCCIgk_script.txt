so the backstory for this box alright I guess it's more of a crate really is pretty interesting so Intel brought me sedatives and ammunition who you may or may not be familiar with but we'll link those guys down below down to do a video about their 8086 processor and we thought it was just kind of like we were on a panel about PC gaming and game streaming and then they brought us down again and actually surprised us with computers that were based on sort of what we imagined as our dream pcs and I was particularly surprised because it is a formidable challenge coming up with the PC system for the guy who literally already has every PC system this is the wall of video cards so what did they come up with I guess we're about to find out aren't we after I tell you about our the video description [Music] okay so first things first let's get this moved somewhere a little more picturesque okay that seems better so there were a couple of sort of guiding things that I had said in the video obviously I love quiet systems because in my mind there's just no reason to have a loud system anymore now that cooling technology has advanced to the point that it has another thing that I mentioned was my love of retro machines and not retro in the sense that they have really old hardware inside retro in the sense that they're kind of like like classic machines that have been updated so one of my favorite things that we've done in the last couple of years has actually been the sleeper series that alex has worked on those these are just kind of like random boxes that we've found at the local free geek and then converted into you know bang in gaming rigs I was gonna do all these by hand just to like add to the suspense of the video but I saw how many there were I don't think they can handle that much suspense you know the thing about the Internet is somewhere someone is into it no matter what it is somewhere someone is like oh yeah taking out screws and putting them in could watch that all day so what's really interesting is that instead of going to the usual suspects you know BS mods or Lea Harrington or whoever else in the PC modding scene Intel actually solicited the help of a company that's more into like Hollywood props building and less into computers and so they were basically just given the footage of us describing our dream machines and told to make them come to life well Oh so when we set up this space I actually forgot that there's a monitor that goes with the system so I'm gonna go ahead and get this out of the way as much as it pains me to do so because this is an amazing monitor right here which isn't to say that in spite of what it looks like this one is the worst gaming monitor ever and you'll see what I mean in a minute here I get such a kick out of this thing I've seen it before and I'm still like I'm laughing inside just in anticipation so that's it it's not the most practical approach to skinning up a monitor that I could have possibly imagined because as you guys might already suspect yes the front cover here does in fact cover up the corners of the monitor so it's actually kinda hard to use and these dials these dials don't do anything but this is definitely the most complete attempt at retro izing a modern display that I think I've ever seen so they're using like a high density kind of prop foam here that they've shaped and painted and then they've painted the back of the display and what I think is a really great really close approximation to the kind of ugly greeny brownie tan color that you'd often find on older systems I don't know if that plastic was just cheaper or if they actually thought that looked space-age or whatever but so I'm sure you guys are eagerly anticipating the system now that you've seen this this thing is unbelievably cool I mean here they're actually under this very table we're opening it on is a perfect example of why it's impossible to send Linus a dream system I already have a murder box wait now I should preface this by saying that while some people are going to love this there are going to be others who are actually kind of upset now what happened here because the case that was chosen for this particular retro sleeper well let's just say there aren't a lot of good condition IBM 5150 s left out in the wild and now there's one fewer because this is what they sent over and absolutely tricked out and you can't really call it a sleeper anymore because of this gorgeous acrylic window on the top but it's a tricked out IBM 5150 chassis and the level of attention to detail in this thing is unfreaking real I'm gonna walk you guys through it here before we fire it up for the first time we first have to appreciate one of the finest details here so you can see obviously this this old chassis was not designed for modern standard ATX components so they had to create their own acrylic backplate with check this out those are when logos cut into the the grille for the radiator and then also our motherboard and our GPU which is mounted using a PCI Express riser the most impressive part to me though is this they actually integrated the original power switch so instead of having a chintzy little power flippity doo-dah on the back and they redid all the internal wiring have a look here so that it actually functions as the switch for the back of the power supply so sick so check this out not only does the original power button work and have an LED behind it to indicate that the system is on so even though these floppy disk bays arent functional check this out drive activity is still handled by the original LEDs and then these slits down the middle are actually functioning as an intake for cooling the graphics card you're ruining everything Brandon you're supposed to talk about it on camera Oh okay anyway the cooling system is actually pretty ingenious so to keep dust from getting in they've got an intake here and an intake here and then the whole thing just kind of blows out the top so they've got like I don't know whatever that is about three quarters of an inch the CPU now this was interesting because everyone else got 79 ATX ease and so I was kind of like yo I got an 80 86 K like what's the deal with that and they were like well we thought the 8086 K made perfect sense given that this is an original IBM 5150 chassis which had the original 8086 in it yeah you know what we should do we should get Alex to look at this and see if he thinks he can beat it yeah so I told Intel that one of the coolest projects I think we've done over the last little while or some of the coolest projects have been the sleeper machines and this was kind of their take on fusing retro with new no those don't do anything okay you can go so I've already found one unexpected side effect of yeah sure how's that just put that back on there oh so this is cool because the 8086 K is the highest performance single thread processor on the market check this out our local steam cache is actually working better than ever before so when we tested it we were having a hard time getting such impressive numbers on titles that have a lot of compression because we actually run into cpu bottlenecks but on this one 81 megabytes per second download in Grand Theft Auto 5 from our local cache that's really good for that title yeah grand theft auto 5 over 80 dad single thread performance no matter how cool your system is you can't get anything done when Windows decides hey how about now and I actually have an IBM model M from 1986 that I can hook up to it here that looks so good like so good ah this blows I actually don't have my ps2 adapter here so disappointing I am NOT very familiar with that rock style style let's just go for 5 gigahertz full-auto and see if it manages that boom speed 5 gigahertz I'll be curious to see if that download goes even faster now yep we just hit 85 peak pretty sure that's the best we've seen so far alright so let's see how she performs yes max zero and we are sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 to 300 frames per second at any given moment here I mean it still doesn't help me aim at anything but what it is then that's butter smooth so as a TN panel so frankly not the most color accurate experience ever but this thing's running out a hundred and forty-four Hertz of course we expected that with like an 80 86 K and GTX 1080i but man bots suck oh they still suck they still suck I just I own that I'm also not very good so that's pretty much it what we've got so far is the coolest retro themed gaming system that I have ever seen but I really don't think this is the last you're gonna see this and I'd love to hear from you guys what would you like to see us do to this thing to take it to the next level please leave your comments below because we've already got some ideas on our own but definitely interested in what you guys think and we're also interested in video description to get yours on amazon.com so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video then you must not like fun but you can't hit that button that is your right but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured how how good luck at the link in the video description you could get an AV 86 K or a GTX 1080 TI or a 2080 as far as most people can tell is pretty similar until RDX comes also down there is our merch store which has closed stores like this one at our community forum which you should definitely join one thing's for sure this mouse has to go a little more off-white
