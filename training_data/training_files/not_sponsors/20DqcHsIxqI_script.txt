finally made a decent start on the item goals boy it's time to get some of those big ticket items i'm looking forward to comparing the gear at the end of the video compared to now so first things first i got 300 dragon burns from very on currently 77 and here are the stats looking pretty good to be honest that took us all the way to 88 prayer which compared to before gets us an extra three per points per person first boss on the list is sarah this is actually exciting i've got the ranged relic we've got 99 ranged unlimited run energy and not bad gear either so i'm after the acb mainly but also the sgs as well 100 points for that 4kc we've already got a sarasota 1 in 42 drop rate so we're probably going to get quite a few of them the best part about all of this is that i can teleport in between every single kill which means i don't have to use any prayer at all and i can restock food whenever i had some ruined dallas in the bank and look at this saves me using the diamonds on the minions first drop there's not a siren on his sword at least make that two now that's more like a godzilla charred one oh no another sarah like is this really gonna happen another sarah sword well that's 100 kc 250 points this is actually admin yes raycon earbuds finally brought the dry streak rake on earbuds sound just as amazing as other top brands you know and the star are about half the price as well i'm actually really glad raycon came to me because i've been using them mainly to work out and they fit really well they don't fall out and really good quality not tinny whatsoever and i definitely recommend them as a great holiday gift raker earbuds give you six hours of playtime seamless bluetooth pairing more bass and a more compact design for a comfortable noise isolating fit and now's the best time to get them because for a limited time only you can get 20 percent off your order by going to buy raycon.com and you'll be supporting me it's a big thank you to raycon yet again for sponsoring the video that's a godzilla 2 from a minion which is actually not a duplicate so that's really good no let's not do this please and another duplicate of the shard one ladies and gentlemen that is the final shot okay i feel a little bit better but still i could do with a hill that'd be kind of helpful right that's it that is it that is the drop rate to get both the hill and the armada crossbow [Music] i don't deserve this blood [Music] oh yes it's not the acb but i'm just not gonna complain we've got sarah hill and we've got all the shards oh happy days in order to smith this thing i need ae smithing i think i have enough steel bars to make cannonballs to get that so i'm gonna do dwarf cannon there's the cannon and the ammo mould as you know smelting cannon balls takes about four minutes per invent it's a good day there we go 80 smith in 5 000 cannonballs so as you know i picked the spec relic and i've not had any use for it at all because i've only had an ms being a dds so it's been kind of useless so far but there it is sarah dorman god sword beautiful i've got five specks of this i never need food anymore and that is a one in two thousand drop very sick i'm just gonna go here with no food and let's see how much loot we can fit in our invent turns out i actually gained food from the boss and i need to bank godzilla shot three all they need now is to go to the chart two and then when we get one of the other hills we have two full godzilla's defeat any god wars dungeon boss 250 times 250 points yes i've got it i've got the acb 269 kc get in there come on subscribe because actually works now that is looking a lot better so i haven't upped my loot tab in quite a while and this is how it's looking it's pretty messy but pretty sick though and this is loot from 269 sarah i got seven satellites because i used one of them 13 sara swords i've got three spare shard ones two shard threes an sgs and the acb it's time to farm some elder cursed and get some lauren's keys and also stock up on range and potions i did about 100 kc there without any and yeah dwarf weeds are just a pain to get right now so this is my best bet oh there we go i went for the relic equilibrium where every xp drop i get is 10 of my total level i should have got the one where my stats don't drain but when i get to criara it drops a lot of dwarf weed seeds so we should be good so i've got myself 30 range pots and 27 laryn's keys dragon high top look at that beauty get in there and that is loot from 27 keys really good supplies there it has been a very long time since i've done demonic gorillas but it's time i'm looking for any of the ballista pieces and of course the zenites the big goal is to get a heavy ballista ball it's going to take a very long time we'll see how we get on 143 rune bolts that is an insane draw because i can use those for dragon stone ball ears for revs the plan was to get knight smith into smith through knight bolts but i guess i don't need to do that anymore to be honest i might as well use the dragon stone ball ease at demonic gorillas in order to enchant them i need soul runes and my only way of buying soul runes is from the mage guild i need to do a hand in the sand quest there we go we are back with the dragonstone bodies [Music] first sword let's go that's so sick i'm actually really enjoying these it's actually well fun like you literally like try britain [Music] into the spec oh the scs is so good these dumbbells are also really good as well so i need level 92 crafting to make the anguish i can pop four levels with the mushroom pie i've got a bunch of gems gold bars seaweed let's see where it takes us i also got a bunch of black dragon hide i forgot about that i got from revs that got me way further than i expected 92 crafting i actually don't even need a boost the plan is to get another zenite so i can get an anguish and a ring of suffering so i'm gonna need two onyxes so i'm gonna sell a bunch of stuff to the woolly store let's see what cash that we can get trade in the medallion that gets us 14 mil cash [Music] there goes the green cash deck but it's going towards a good cause i think i might have bought a little too many it's finally done 1.2 million total massive shout out to lisa for refreshing the stock we got extra taco by selling 10 at a time now we buy four onyxes that's enough onyxes for all zenites and 245k to spare there's the first zenite [Music] and there it is necklace of anguish big big upgrade now let's hunt for the second zenite first drop back i got a light frame wrong one oh yes yes i forgot teleport i just got the second zenite shard get me out of there i was completely out of food imagine if i died i would have never known it was a zenite shard and that is the ring of suffering i can actually imbue this thing by paying 725k cash for 725k points and that is my best in slot ring by far i'm gonna attempt cerberus for the first time we're gonna be looking for any of the crystals apart from the eternal one because we can't make that [Music] i killed it that fast that i defeated the cerberus before she summons herself at 250 points oh 14 kc and we've already got the pig gazing crystal now then the problem with this obviously that's really good that's what i'm after my ranger but the problem is clue scrolls are a pain and i don't have the clue score relic so the question is can i get the ranger boots but still can't complain [Music] food and prayer isn't needed here oh and dragon darts are actually better than using ruby and diamond ball ease don't have to deal with the summoning souls either some amount of dragon darts some oh smoldering stone 107 kc anyway yeah i'm out of so i'm gonna get myself 95 fletching because i actually have some dragon dart tips in the bank an easy way of getting the fletching level we buy with 300 points to learn how to fletch broad bolts and because i've got so much cash i can just buy the balls easy xp i was gonna save these logs for fire making but i need my hand let's get some xp it's got 2 000 total for 250 points for those who are wondering i have 24k points and that's 92 fletchin which was the goal all along because i can now make dragon javelins and there we go 95 fletching as 231 more dragon darts should last me a fair while to be honest the first crystal since the pageasians right at the start 139 kc we cannot get infinity boots in our regions seconds smoldering stone i am over drop rate i should have all three crystals at 170 kc there it is 247 kc we get the pegs the eternal and the prim beautiful the loot was actually really good from there too fire ups for when i get battle stops from revs d-bones room tussle seeds coal and wines of zami that is looking so much better and would you look at that unlock list we are making serious serious progress
