hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and welcome to operation Odysseus [Music] this video is sponsored by war thunder more on that later today's video will cover one of the most striking revolutions in naval warfare the introduction of the ironclad a tremor runs down the 275 foot length of the gunmetal gray hold the CSS Virginia has just rammed into the US Navy's Cumberland gouging its starboard side and sinking it almost immediately the order is then given for the gun battery to open fire upon another Union friggin the USS Congress the heavy shells fired by Virginia's 10 guns strike the enemy vessels magazine and the higher ship erupts in a fiery explosion by this point in history the maritime hegemony of wooden ships is over but why and how did this pivotal transition take place in order to fully appreciate just how revolutionary the ironclad was we must examine the nature of maritime combat as it existed before the invention of the ironclad wood has been the primary ship building material for most of recorded history but why well for one lumber is often readily available in regions near large bodies of water which allowed nearly all coastal settlements easy access not only that but would naturally floats is easy to shape using simple tools and yet is impressively sturdy in just the same way that the materials used in shipbuilding remained largely the same rowing and sailing remains the only method of propulsion for many years but the 19th century brought with it two new inventions in particular that made cladding boats with iron the logical next step in nautical development the first is the development of more devastating projectile weapons since reasonably thick holed wooden ships were sturdy enough to stand up to some fire from heavy cannons that dominated the Seas victory was often achieved by ships that could fire the most shots in short succession the fierce competition gave rise to ships with multiple gun decks that would compete to turn each other into Swiss cheese as quickly as possible so it's clear to see that by the time explosive shelves were introduced wooden armoring quickly became obsolete at first shipbuilders responded by shrinking their targets that enemy would aim for masts and sails grew smaller while the boats themselves were built lower and lower the second innovation was the invention of the steam engine and it's large-scale adoption as a power source for ships driving a propeller with these engines proved to be more efficient to produce thrust but it came with a fairly serious disadvantage the vibrations they produced could damage or even destroy the wooden hole and since the most important rule of naval warfare is don't destroy your own boats this was especially problematic all of these factors combined gave rise to the first warships fitted with metal armor in the Crimean War the British and French Navy's used floating gun batteries with wrought iron armor essentially proto ironclads these vessels had outstanding protection from enemy fire but proved somewhat unwieldly as it had to be towed into place by other boats that were better at you know boating further improvements followed swiftly and not long after European navies experimented with fitting iron plates over existing wooden vessels the French who hoped to compete with the larger British Navy launched the first of these iron clads in 1860 the British promptly began construction of their own iron clads followed by nearly every European nation that had a navy while the European powers were having their boat measuring contest the American Civil War saw the first-ever military engagements featuring iron clads the Confederacy knew that they could not hope to compete with the shipbuilding capacity of their adversaries instead they wanted to build a ship of such superior caliber that it would annihilate entire wooden fleets on its own their 19th century super weapon was the CSS Virginia a wooden hold vessel with 2-inch thick iron armor that was built upon the wooden skeleton of the scuttled USS Merrimack and it might very well have succeeded if it weren't for the union's commission of the USS Monitor also an ironclad in the months and years that followed the first engagement between the Virginia and the monitor naval arms race was on yet again more powerful explosives were created so the ironclad designers produced even thicker holes which led to the advent of even more powerful explosives thereby leading to well you get the idea though it's time as the king of the sea was short-lived the ironclad paved way for its even deadlier successor the battleship now a word from our sponsor can join the action in massive online battles on land air or at sea and before you go you may have noticed that in the beginning of the video I announced that this is part of Operation Odysseus what this is is a massive collaboration with 17 history YouTube channels you can find the entire playlist to everyone's videos in the description below and I highly recommend you watch all of these at some point if you're only interested in the long 19th century however I suggest you go watch Tiger Starr's video on how the u.s. got involved in almost all of its conflicts because of its Navy I also recommend you watch history graphs video on the dread-nots if you want to see what exactly happened after the development of the ironclad [Music] you
