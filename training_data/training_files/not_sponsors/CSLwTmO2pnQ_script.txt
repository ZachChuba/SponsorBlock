the guy comes on the car with a handgun holds them at gunpoint while he calls the police I say well yeah this video is made very first website or domain last month I was invited to speak at the Orlando Film Festival one of the biggest venues in the country for up-and-coming independent flicks while there I was treated to some amazing movies made by some amazing filmmakers all of whom were looking for their big break one such filmmaker was jeremy michael cohen the writer and director of Yin's which was having its world premiere Yin's ended up winning Best Screenplay as well as the award for audience favorite and narrative features it took Jeremy ten years to put Yin's together features are always a challenge and a first feature even more so since I'm gearing up production on my own movie next year I've been trying to get as much advice as possible from folks who are pulling it off and plenty of you are looking for that advice as well so I sat down with Jeremy for a few minutes to get the skinny on what it takes to make a feature film check it out alrighty so Jeremy we're here at the Orlando Film Festival you've got a film here Yin's it's a feature film it is I didn't get a chance to see it I was doing a few panels but I asked around what sort of the best of the best who should I talk to and your name kept coming up Ian's kept coming up what's the film about so I described to people kind of one sentence it's like Fargo with high school kids I think there's a lot more to it than that it's my first feature and it's something that I had been gestating since I was probably about 20 to 23 just started film school kind of want to tell a story about about growing up and what if everything had just gone completely wrong it kind of started as Reservoir Dogs with 16 year old so there's gonna be a bunch of best friends it's rich kids parents are out of town a long weekend they kill somebody and then they kind of Duke it out and their friendships fall apart like kind of over racial and socio-economic lines I think it was just some of the dynamics that I had lived out in high school and then you kind of got high drama to it and eventually whittled down from seven friends to three friends there's kind of a love plotline in there gives us a nice love triangle which kind of gives the person they're gonna kill an entry into the story but that's where it all started so you had this idea in your early 2020s so how long did it take from idea floating around in your head to sitting down saying let me write it I start writing it or start writing scenes of it probably I was 23 or so and that kind of some of that ended up in the final film some of it was completely scrapped I probably did you know 10 or 15 real drafts of the story it was the script was all done by the time I was let's say 30 or so and we had something I could shoot and then eventually we kept on tweaking as we got closer to production based you know around locations I didn't really change anything based on the cast we cast for the existing script but you know it took from about eight years from time I started writing till the two we actually shot yeah when you what was the budget for the film about a hundred thousand dollars raised you Raceland yeah raised thirty from Kickstarter then raised chunks of money really in five and ten thousand dollar increments from some family and some friends we had some kind of in-kind investors people who said mark me down as X dollar investment and I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment and that really allowed us to to make the film I would say if you're thinking about going to make you know film like this make sure you have some work experience and go to the people you've worked with and you've rented stuff from and kind of have a good successful relationship with this is your directorial debut for feature for feature you'd like Schwartz's yeah so I went to film school at USC and I was took three years of classes if you want to direct there's kind of another year often doing where you do a thesis film so I did a couple shorts there that had festival runs and then afterwards I just kind of I think like so many people our age started working in various kinds of short branded content and commercials and whatever I was I directed a bunch of that stuff also produced at some some point I was just like I knew I wanted to make a feature so I spent right after film school I was a being a ton I was working as a first ad and I did I think eight feature films as a first ad just back to back to back to back and then I lined produced another one and so that was like a second film school so I've worked with so many incredible people made incredible relationships most importantly learned mostly what not to do it saw so many screw-ups on so many films I was like dude you can't do this you can't fall into this trap but I learned you know how to schedule how to budget and also you know it's the first thing you're standing next to the director all day and then that's when I had the opportunity to work more in commercials I was making some money had some time to - just put towards working on the film because it could by you know by myself sometimes I'm going to take you to shoot we talked for four weeks so we had four five-day weeks 20 days and then one day on either side at the very beginning there was a ton of snow shot all the kind of a lot of beautiful establishing shots of the town some exteriors I know that we needed well I wanted like the three feet of snow on the ground and then at the end we had one day I got just a handful of of pickups here and there I'd you know cell phone on a car seat gun on whatever kind of surface so 22 days which is an incredible luxury you had mentioned lots of mistakes that you had seen working for other people what are some of the common mistakes that you see people we're making independent films commonly make and how did you number one mistake is not giving yourself enough time so somebody says what I really care about is this stunt or this bee effect shot so somebody budgets a day of let's say an 18 day shoot for something that's not that important for the story and it gives them less time to end up actually shooting the story and working with the actors like the number one thing you need to do is maximize the time with actors you have on set another thing I see all the time is when you have $100,000 or $50,000 even half a million dollars you can't you can't try to make a movie that looks like Star Wars because it's not going to happen what you have to do is some kind of like focus on the basics tell the story really well cast really really well but you can't try to to make a big-budget action movie there's just certain production value that money buys and you have to design your your shoot around that yeah I see this all the time in that if you have a low budget then if you embrace the fact that it's low budget and you actually adopt that as opposed to trying to imitate yes something with a much larger budget because if you try and imitate it it's just going to look even worse than if you would embrace what I really did is I like went back and studied first features a lot of first features kind of happen in the middle of nowhere a lot like ours did because you can have the run of a town and people are excited for you to shoot in a school or shooting in jail I'd shoot in a real jail in LA would probably cost $25,000 per day we got shooting in jail for several days for free and we could kind of do whatever we wanted yeah solutely now along with that comes a lot of responsibility right as it's it's easy to have the run of the town when you're a small town you get to film they don't have that very often but at the same time you want to be as respectful as you can be with the sets and with the places you shoot because you don't you don't want to take advantage of people's goodwill and then be disrespectful and ruin it for the next guy who tries stuff that is a hundred percent true and what I would do want to say is if you are gonna make an independent film do be respectful have insurance make sure you have whoever you are go make a movie but like have a pro or two there because those are the people that are gonna say like we just can't do this or this is illegal or this is this is going to be unsafe a lot of my best friends are crew people and they're putting really dangerous spots oftentimes don't do that to somebody you don't want someone to to ruin the rest of their lives or god forbid die for a small movie so take it seriously and absolutely kinda like be professional about it well we were we were talking about these films that like embrace the flawed edges I always use this as an example people laugh but it's true Napoleon Dynamite absolutely is in him it's a film that's very low-budget yeah but the fact that it was low budget allowed them to develop a very distinct look and style completely I'm worse for that film if they had shot that like a high budget film it would have been awful how many folks did you have in total working during principal photography Oh probably crew of about 15 people every day most of our department heads were from Los Angeles so people I had like long history working with did a really great job we we found a costume designer and a production designer and first ad from Pittsburgh and the first ad did a great job and brought on some people he knew but I would say it helps so much if there are people you know you trust you can bring them to work on this kind of project yeah absolutely you shot in my hometown it's called New Castle Pennsylvania about 60 miles northwest of Pittsburgh so all right I got a fun little exercise I'm like sure let's do it I kind of think a lot about especially when I made my first feature I think of it in terms of specific days yeah during filming that stood out so first off describe the worst day on set oh man I will tell you the probably the worst day and I think all the guys would agree it was the three best friends so it's Brad Johnny and Shane they're uh it's it's their first scene together and two of the guys have just gotten there the night before so all these actors these young guys are from New York City at least like live in New York City and really used to Lisa they show up at the super 8 motel in New Castle on the edge of town the night before they've never been to a place like this there's three feet of snow on the ground and there's supposed to be lifelong best friends and we hop into this kind of supposed to be both like funny and intense scene and I we probably shot the master 50 times we just could not get the hang of it and eventually history it was just the chemistry and it was so tough that was number one and eventually those guys were all incredible and completely worked as best friends then there's another two days so it's after the kind of big killing there's this kind of big set piece in the middle of film and these three best friends it kind of like it's where the premise really plays out so much and there's probably it's like a one-act play it's like about 20 pages just three friends arguing and just like they they just kind of bare their souls and rip it each other's wounds that like they know so well so three people one camera 20 pages everyone's dancing around a dead body and at the end of that was probably the most I think all all four of us would say the most taxing thing we've ever done because just the blocking was really intense for me and the DP keeping the eye line straight figuring out how we're gonna have masters that would both move around where we were gonna get coverage where we were gonna jump the line I didn't really have a screw a script supervisor didn't have you know like people like taking care of continuity so it was just in my head and in the actors too like up to the actors remember they're blocking bring it every time do do sit you know so many pages over and over because we have one Cameron that was incredibly intense did I mean how did you overcome it like everybody has these bad days but that's that's the test of the filmmaker is how do you you know what I have like just a couple things number one you just do the work like that it you know whatever the hardest thing is just do it you know just do it so we just did the work and it was really exhausting and you know there was that element of it and I just have like a really strict no drama policy yeah so we're there to do the work and these guys just rot you know they were they were pros they loved it they were doing what they loved they believed in the script so they they gave it their all we just you know dove headlong into it I mean my attitude is always if you're gonna have a really bad day where just everything goes wrong just get through it and then leave that day in the past yeah you can't let that bad day ruin the rest of the experience yeah and you can't harp on things there's no boost in complaining you just kind of like do it I mean we're shooting a movie in the middle of the winter with with 15 people like it was going to be hard everybody knew what they signed up for you know so but it's fun like that's a challenge that's the like you know you're going to the best summer camp every absolutely so in contrast to that now we've talked about the the the worst day what was the best day on set whoo our last day we shot the last scene of the movie yeah and I think there was something like we were just firing on all cylinders it was great like it was beautiful and I wasn't you know wasn't gonna allow myself to be sad because it was over it was just happy that it had happened and I knew we captured kind of incredible performances and pulled something off the funny thing is it's a best story from the show there's this tiny little Mindy brings her car home before Brad kind of admits everything to her so there's a shot that's in the movie for about two seconds her car has to pull in and I asked art department hey can you get this car a little dirty again last time we saw it had some snow on it producers came up and said oh we'll do it you know the first time we're not so incredibly busy would be like fun for us to go find some snow on the edge of town very long story short my car got totaled out of this they actually turned down a private road somebody something was not happy that somebody was trespassing so they took the giant lake Ford truck t-boned into my car on purpose like you know attempted to to really hurt them my car was totaled the guy comes out of the car with a handgun holds them at gunpoint while he calls the police so everything had basically gone perfect until one of the last day on well yeah I was like I was willing to sacrifice my car I was I mean is I'd already driven it across the country that was the bad thing that happened that day the first bad thing that happened was on the last day of shooting and I'm never gonna forget that yeah I every director I talked to when I asked what was the best day on set everybody says the last day oh yeah I mean when it was all over that feeling of like wow we did this yeah yeah exactly I think it was your first film you're like we got this we finished it there's nothing I hate more than like I hate like prematurely celebrating I hate like penny but like that last day we were like how this you know this happened we pulled off kind of be impossible did you watch dailies while you were shooting it um I did there wasn't necessarily time to go back and that we didn't have time to go reshoot any full scenes yeah exactly I cut the film myself so okay so how long did you wait till wrapping principal photography to go into actual editing did you decompress for like a month and then do like maybe a 10 day drive back across the country I did we had sent of drives back so an assistant editor was sinking everything so by the time I got back I could just get right back into like I it's good yeah take some time to just decompress and get yourself away from it before oh you know I took about probably about a year to edit the film which I don't know if that was too slow or the right amount or whatever it takes as long as exactly but I had to I had to keep making money so eventually I would go produce a commercial every couple months and that would give me like a week or two where my brain was out of the film if you can somehow do that while you're in post give yourself like a week or two away from watching stuff your brain will solve some some problems for sure sure so it's out now it's had its world premiere it's got some very good feedback what make plans for the film going we're working on distribution stuff and realistically will have you know both a digital VOD and streaming I think we just want to get the film out to the world quickly let as many people see it think about some various ideas for like digital marketing so I can drive people to the film but um yeah it's been super cool pick whichever camera you want give sort of a plug of how can people what's where do they go to learn more about the film cool i'm jeremy michael cohen find me at jeremy m Cohen on Twitter or Instagram or Jeremy M Cohen comm you find more about the movie at means movie.com please give it a watch thank you guys so much great so before we go one last question what do you think it takes to make stuff it takes stick-to-itiveness to make stuff go set a goal of what you're gonna do and just just do it be clever enough to get it done at however much money you have realize that your resources will affect the outcome but just keep going if you just keep going great stuff great stuff whatever Congrats to Jeremy and the production team behind yen's thanks to the Orlando Film Festival for putting on such an awesome event I've been to a ton of these
