this video is sponsored by Squarespace so if you're a regular viewer of this channel then you might recall that throughout the end of 2018 and the start of 2019 I occasionally drop little hints that I was working on a feature film and would likely be announcing it officially and starting production and then things got kind of quiet today I want to tell you the story of why it stalled out the lessons that I learned where I plan to go from here and hopefully not break too many non-disclosure agreements along the way I'm making a movie open a studio and we're working on projects and we're working on another feature film what can you tell us about this super secret super awesome project venture work I can't say anything about it honestly because if I if I say information about it right now and it changes then I'll have either lied to people or I'll have set up a false expectation and it's in its in pre-production right now we're heading towards production next year and you know details change especially an indie film staff changes last week you most filmmakers I know they tend to have two ideas at a time there's the idea that they're working on right now that is the thing they're trying to make with the resources that they currently have available but then there's this there's this other idea this is the one they keep in their back pocket this is the thing they would love to make but can't it's the dream project that they'll tackle if they ever manage to snag a blank check from a major movie studio this is the one you focus on of course but you never know at the start of 2019 I was hovering around half a million subscribers maybe like three-quarters a number of things were happening all at once due to the success of the channel I was getting more and more opportunities both on YouTube and outside of the platform to work on interesting projects and to make money as long as I didn't object to a particular project on like moral grounds I tended to say yes the idea was say yes as much as possible work super hard on everything and then use the money I made to finance personal passion projects it's basically the mindset of most people in this profession right pay your dues and then reap the benefits later at that point my workload became so big that I had to take appropriate measures to handle it all I started to open a video production studio I hired contractors to help me with YouTube projects TV projects online offline stuff anything that I could do to help get my work-life balance under control when I was working from home I would literally wake up at 7:00 a.m. every morning walk into this little office here and work until about 9:00 or 9:30 at night it put a ton of stress on my marriage it put a ton of stress on me it was literally destroying my back I have so much daily back pain you guys have no idea that things were getting better I was starting to get the workload under control and I could finally dedicate more time to this which was the whole reason for saying yes to so many things in the first place I remember one week for like three days straight I got up I came into the studio and I was able to work on this without interruption felt I was finally getting my head above water and this thing it seemed like it was gonna actually happen and then the next day I got an email from a person representing a large Hollywood studio I can't tell you who it was for obvious reasons but it's one of these big studios that makes these huge massive yearly blockbusters you've heard of them trust me so this lady poor guy was reaching out to see if I would be interested in a project that the studio was working on I immediately checked with a couple of people that I know in the industry to confirm that this person was legit and then I responded sure let's get together after about a week of trying to align our schedules we finally faced time she explained that the studio was working on how do I want to describe this it was sort of a spin-off project of an established property that had a movie about to start production this spin-off would be directly tied to the motion picture in question it would release concurrently on a major TV or streaming network possibly even get its own limited theatrical release I'm being very very vague sorry she told me that the head of this particular production had stumbled upon my youtube channel one day and wanted me involved in the process he thought I might be able to bring a certain vision to the project that nobody else could she asked if I would be interested in the project and I said sure then we talked for about an hour on concepts I sort of on the spot came up with a way that you could do the project that might resonate with their particular target audience not an hour of bouncing ideas back and forth she says hey look all of this is awesome I can't give you the project I don't have that authority so let's schedule another meeting in a few weeks and we'll bring more people in Wow we're getting all of that scheduled if you can find a way to present this in a way that's cohesive and documented it'll stand a better chance of getting greenlit so we disconnect the FaceTime call and I am immediately like all right this is my focus now I've got videos do for sponsors I've got events and projects that I am committed to for various parties and yes I am going to fulfill all of those commitments but this this thing needs to be a major priority at least for the next week or two so during that time I developed this comprehensive pitch it was like a 25 minute video that went step by step through how I thought the spin-off could work how it could be integrated by the studio some alternatives if the idea needed adjusting it was this big big thing but in the back of my head I kept repeating don't get ahead of yourself don't get ahead of yourself don't get ahead of yourself don't get ahead of yourself these kinds of things they fall apart all the time studios drop projects regularly you are a dude who makes videos about biscuits parachutes and other useless information they're probably going to go with somebody else fast forward to the second conference call and this time it's not just that studio rep from before but two other people sitting next to her one of them functioned like a courtroom stenographer they were constantly typing down everything that anybody said why they didn't just record the video chat I have no idea I gave them a quick than refined pitch and then I offered to show them an extended video they said yes I sent it over to them we watched it together and it wasn't like they weren't interested one of the guys he would periodically pause the video and he would ask questions I would clarify points that weren't clear and the whole meeting went on for about 90 minutes at the end everybody was like nodding to each other it was smiles all around and they said hey look all of this sounds great we really think there's potential here can we get together on another call next month and bring in some more people on this I was like sure absolutely then the original rep and the stenographer left and it was just me and this other guy we just kind of chewed the fat for a bit that means we shared idle small talk just in case you're an international viewer while we were talking he asks hey are you working on anything else and I said oh yeah there's this there's this project that I that I'm working on and he said oh yeah tell me about it what is it what's it about you know we're always on the lookout for new things here maybe we'd be interested in it and I said oh let me tell you all about it I give him the elevator pitch of the back pocket idea and he loves it he's like how far along are you and I'm like a treatment couple of pages of a first draft nothing's really concrete because I mean I don't have the budget to do something like this and he's like how much do you think you can do it I give him a seven-figure amount and he's like oh no problem he's like we have these development programs here at the studio we invest a couple million here a couple million they're constantly jump-starting lower budget projects we have an indie startup studio that green lights projects like this all the time if this thing that we're working on right now goes well I can easily see us jumping on board with something like that down the road at that point I'm trying not to like lose it from a happy panic we schedule the time for the next meeting I get off the call and I am just stunned somehow it feels like I am about to bypass a major hurdle and just goes straight to the back pocket idea so for the next month I am doing everything I can to not only perfect the studio pitch but I am also spending hours upon hours fully fleshing out my back pocket idea because I am starting to believe it might actually happen and all at once that little voice in the back of my head saying don't get ahead of yourself completely disappears [Music] I am now just slamming to get everything done I'm juggling YouTube I'm juggling this Hollywood thing other commitments outside of the internet suddenly that work-life balance it starts to tip again but you know what I'm telling myself it's okay it's okay for now because this this is different this this is my one real shot so a month passes it feels like an eternity but you know what I'm holding everything together I have a determination like you wouldn't believe I'm not really sleeping but still I am working harder than ever so it's the day of I fire up the video conference call and now gone is the first studio rep gone is the stenographer it's just the guy from before and six other people who based off their office attire I can safely assume probably make fifty times the amount of money that I do a year they're all sitting in this roundtable they all seem curious I'm invited to repeat the same pitch as before I do they pull up the pitch video I made we all watch it together before I know it we start talking logistics and feasibility of the concept meeting goes on for about 75 minutes it is very thorough but also it is very fun some jokes are cracked here and there everybody's all smiles repeating how excited they are about the project and then one of the reps says they'll be sending me some paperwork to look over if things continue to move in a positive direction they'll see if a contract can get drawn up to bring this project to reality they somebody to keep an eye on my inbox that they will get back to me by the end of the week or real soon afterwards I say great I get off the call and I'm thinking this thing's gonna happen yeah it didn't a week passes and I hear nothing I shoot them an email hey guys just check it in I haven't received anything from you all they email me back and say yeah sorry about that it'll probably be another week I say no problem a week passes still nothing I send them another email this goes on for about two months now for all intents and purposes this idea this movie that I had planned to shoot in 2019 it's essentially shelved the window in which I could have shot it is past and it's like now I'm not too terribly torn up about it because I think something bigger is on the horizon eventually after getting the runaround for an embarrassingly long amount of time I get this email in my inbox from one of the studio reps and it basically says hey sorry for the delay thank you for your patience as studio is gonna go in a different direction thanks for taking the time to talk maybe we'll meet up again sometime in the future and that's it no information about what direction the project is moving in if they're even going to still do it whether they'll use some of my ideas whether they won't just and so I feel foolish for dedicating so much time to something I realized later I had absolutely no real control over and thus it was time wasted what really makes it feel like truly wasted time is that there were so many other things I could have done during that time frame that I would have had total control over like I could have done this I mean that would have been something right I could have taken that time and directed it toward other projects that I was working on toward this channel even did improve the quality of things I could have spent that time getting the whole work-life thing back in balance by you know having a life it's still crazy for me to think that all that work boiled down to three video conference calls and then nothing at times during this whole ordeal I felt frustrated because I was often working on things that you all weren't allowed to see or even know about and as a result of that I think the quality of the videos I did put on this channel suffer greatly and I think that becomes apparent when you look at the lack of interest from my subscribers I allowed myself to get strung along for the better part of a year simply because I was talking to people who held name positions in studios that I respected as well I allowed myself to break essentially every rule I have about maintaining proper perspective and setting realistic expectations that I continually preach in Parratt to up-and-coming creators on this channel actually remember coming home after a long day of working on the studio project and it hitting me on the drive home that like I didn't really even like the movie franchise that the whole spin-off project was based on I just said yes because it was a project for I think I let myself get distracted or worse possibly taken advantage of because I fell under the spell that traditional Hollywood studios tend to cast on people seeking opportunities that lie that says hey we make real movies you know it's not it's not real success unless it's through us I don't buy that line and I cannot believe that I wasted so much time bartering for it there's a moment last year when I was in the middle of working on a video where my stress from the multiple business projects to personal family issues and the constant non-stop back pain was at its absolute peak and I just about called it quits what am i doing I gotta I gotta get this stuff figured out yeah I feel like I totally and completely dropped the ball last year and I'm sorry I know that I need to reset and I'm sort of like desperately trying to figure out how here's where I'm at I know that I have a studio space that is equipped with the bare-bones essentials to create things I know that I have an online platform that lets people see these things and I know or at least hope that I have you to let me know if the things that I make should sink or sale going forward this year I'm going to make some promises to myself first I am going to focus on the here and now what I can make with the tools and the resources that I have available to me no more pining for bigger and better conditions no more bargaining for pipe dreams no more getting ahead of myself I need to remember that if an opportunity sounds too good to be true it probably is trust what you see in front of you and do what you can with what you have that's what I continually Drive home on this channel maybe I should start practicing it second I need to celebrate and bring attention to other creators out there who are making things too I've made it a point in the past to highlight small and obscure artists with the occasional recommendation video but I can take that a step further by sharing and exploring their creative process in a way that goes deeper than a simple shoutout third I want to get back to making things that I actually enjoy making in my eagerness to say yes to so many opportunities last year I ended up with way too much on my plate and once this resulted in me working on a lot of things that honestly I just really didn't care about the thing about working in a creative field is that if your heart isn't in what you're working on it tends to show and I don't want that to ever be the case here most of all I think I am done with the traditional media thing it didn't interest me before Hollywood came calling and at the end of the day they didn't do much to change my mind there is no reason for me to try and earn the recognition or the approval of these slow bureaucratic unimaginative antiquated mediums the tools to create motion pictures are now ubiquitous I don't need to get the green light from a major studio and frankly why would I even want it why would I want to put a project that's so close to my heart into the hands of people I have never met and who likely wouldn't even care that much about it if there's something that I want to make I live in a time period where I don't need to convince a major studio head or a traditional distributor I don't need to get the approval of a round table to make something I have a direct line to all of you if I want to make a movie or a series I can just make it and you all will determine whether or not it's worth supporting for some reason I forgot that last year but I'm gonna try and get things back on track the further and further away I get from this whole failed Hollywood experience the more and more I realize that the thought of being just another cog in the Tinseltown machine doesn't excite me what excites me is seeing the next generation of artists and creators and advocates who are leveraging online interconnected platforms to share their work with a bigger audience than ever before and in a more honest and intimate way than ever before that's what I want to celebrate that's what I'm a part of and when you stack the old system against this new one there's no comparison alright I feel a bit better now I needed to make this to sort of clear my head thank you all for watching and now it's back to work do you have a passion project that austan McConnell to get 10% off your first purchase of a website or
