all right rachel and jean had to walk across the water they are like it's low tide we're getting it framed up here give them just one second we'll get this i promise we're about t minus one ish minute this is rachel and gene get ready here it comes yes perfect right there gene that's good we got it yes just in time let's hear it from rachel and gene they had to boat and then literally sprint across low tides pulling a boat they have to be so out of breath just in time to see static seal number five starship fire this is one for the ages holy moly oh let's hear for them rachel and gene let's see this we think we're literally seconds away at this point from static fire so here we go based on the sirens based on everything we we kind of know from previous static fires it seems like it's probably going to go off at 3 p.m local which accounting for the delay is about 30 seconds from right now ish i'm just kind of guessing oh we got a pointy end up flamingo down we're ready to go don't worry it's been a long day i've been streaming literally all day this is going to be the perfect cherry on top just in time to take a nap this is what i want to see this will set off a good weekend to finish up some more work and and get ready to uh wow rachel and gene i cannot believe it as padre aisle you guys are the best crazy crazy you guys are here we go any second now any second now it's gonna be quick we're just gonna see an engine ignition hopefully hopefully like any second we're not seeing any signs that they've scrubbed we don't see any additional venting my heart's beating like crazy come on baby this still all looks like it's just sitting there idle ready to ready to go i cannot believe you guys i really hope they didn't sprint for their lives for another scrub i will be so sad for for rachel and jean for spacex for all of us come on baby come on you can do it light that raptor light that raptor let's see it let's see it there yes yes you can help us listen there'll be a 15 second delay and it's still standing finally yes it's still standing that's what we're waiting for for those of you that are like that was it right there that little little blip that was it that's what we're waiting for oh that's literally been like multiple weeks in the waiting this is this is still really really really good because uh this the fact that it's still standing here maybe we'll actually see a hop in three or four days they'll probably go check it all out make sure everything's still good to go is still standing this is good so the next step okay we have uh here we can go uh ignition static fire and i did not crap my pants so everything appears to be completely normal this is great so so again the next step so real quick rundown since i've been so focused on this for those of you just tuning in or if you happen to click on this i have no idea what we're looking at this is spacex's starship prototype vehicle serial number five we've been waiting for this thing to test for a long time uh it is it's been a long time coming these are all the different versions that we've seen so far basically in the last year so first it was star hopper basically a little water tower with their raptor engine stuck underneath it and they flew that thing twice it actually flew this little it's i'm little as a relative it's it's nine meters wide uh it's about 20 meters tall so it's it's that's 30 feet wide about 60 feet tall or something ish that was star hopper it flew in 2019 a 20 meter hop and then 150 meter hop then since then they've been doing these larger full-scale prototypes and uh yeah that's that's what we're kind of in the middle of right now so they've done mark one and mark two those were more like mockups than prototype even though they did test mark one just to destruction anyway then they've had some pressure test articles uh then they've had serial number one three and four which are full size and this is serial number five this is the first one let's see which is when's the last time we actually saw a static fire that was successful was that seal number three i feel like it's been a long time i feel like it's been a really really long long time so this is great guys so uh i can't actually do a slow-mo replay tonight we'll be posting uh 120 frames per second slow motion 4k video of that static fire and that'll help us kind of look at the details and see a little bit more um on this but wow uh it happened so the next step now is is they'll check it out to go out there tonight and take a look over it they have clearances they have no tams which are noticed to airmen or basically a ceiling to make sure that it's okay for it to fly they have to have faa clearance this thing that's nine meters wide about 30 meters tall we're talking 30 feet wide almost 100 feet tall this is huge this is absolutely massive this will leave the ground it will take off using a single raptor engine and this the raptor engine is a full flow stage combustion cycle methane powered rocket engine that's arguably the most advanced rocket engine in the entire world and so what happens is it's it'll take off they'll start it'll start it up and then they'll release it or or at least they'll um you know i don't know actually know if they have full blown hold down clamps on it or not or what the deal is but maybe just once the thruster weight ratio gets high enough it'll leave the pad it'll translate over there's actually little six little landing legs up inside the skirt there those will pop down while it's in transit and then it'll land on these little landing legs and ah this is great news i'm so glad it's still standing there's no fires underneath it this has always been a concern is like there's been fires underneath some of these there's been problems everything looks great oh baby that looked fantastic that looked really really really good [Music] let me see here let's see if we can get something from elon everything seem normal all right sweet okay that's awesome this is great news guys so so as soon as this thing does whatever it does next i will be covering it i will also the next thing i'll be covering for you guys i will be covering the splashdown of dm2 uh that's currently scheduled to undock on saturday i will just uh do the the splashdown because that could be anywhere from like sunday early afternoon through monday or even tuesday depending on splashdown zones weather and a bunch of other variables so i will stream the splashdown whenever that happens i will also have a video out before that happens on how you get back from orbit because getting down from orbit is very complicated actually there's a lot of systems involved the maneuvering thrusters all the different orbital maneuvers they do to get ready to de-orbit the de-orbiting the heat shield the parachutes i'll go through all of the systems that take it take and get astronauts home safely from the international space station it is specific to the dragon capsule but it's also generic enough that it teaches you about um about de-orbiting from basically any vehicle so um it's it's it's topical for dm2 but it's also will help you understand how you exactly de-orbit so that'll be coming out hopefully on saturday-ish so wish me luck it means i won't be sleeping at all because i haven't slept ever so uh real quick thanks to space viking so much thank you space viking carson carolina thank you for maximum effort and uh per thyron thanks the filmers absolutely thank you so much per absolutely uh i i pay rachel and jean for

support and appreciation for getting these awesome shots for us um and thank you again space fighting uh perth iron the pointy end must be more pointer that the problem is true it is more of a squarey end up um let's see here somebody still does rocket audio we did get some some audio in there pretty stoked on that um and then let's see here uh does anyone see zeus i don't know if zeus how far away zeus is they do have a little robot dog that's out there so um oh sweet so elon said steer number five just completed full duration static fire 150 meter hop soon that's awesome sounds like he already got on it that is so great that is so great all right guys i'm going to take a much much much much needed nap thank you to all of you guys for tuning in again if you want to help support what i do
