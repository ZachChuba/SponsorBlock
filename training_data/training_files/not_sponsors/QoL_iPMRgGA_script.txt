I do not like pickles I still remember how gross the phrase mango pickle sounded to me when I heard it on em is 2007 Cola but my opinions were changed by this pickled mango flavoured with ginger cinnamon coriander pods black pepper and red chillies now the fruit is sweet tangy a little spicy and these little pickled peppers are an excellent byproduct on a sandwich or a slice of pizza so when I say pickled fruit think less along the lines of a beautiful crisp cucumber transforming into a giant soggy turtle baby and more like preserving and even enhancing the juicy fruits of summer to last all season long so here's a basic recipe for pickled pineapple it uses a cup of plain distilled white vinegar 1/2 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of salt you bring it all to a simmer just enough to melt the sugar and once that's all cooled down a little bit you pour it into a glass jar full of fresh pineapple along with any other flavors you might want to incorporate like again ginger or chili peppers this time I used blood orange zest as long as everything stays submerged in a refrigerator this jar could last several months while on the topic of preservation and pineapples I do want to take a moment to discuss tepache next time you enjoy a nice organic pineapple whether it's for pickling or any other use I implore you to save the core and the rinds instead of throwing them out pineapples are covered in a wild yeast that thrive and multiply in a jug of water along with a cinnamon stick a habanero some panella and a big pinch of whole cloves tepache is Mexican so that's why you typically find this mexican sugar use to sweeten it alternative names for pretty much the same thing include panocha and bolon see joel you could use brown sugar if you're scared of shopping in the ethnic foods aisle or even say rock coconut sugar if you want to introduce some Pina Colada adjacent flavor and avoid turning the liquid brown the point of the sugar is to feed the yeast the color and the flavor of said sugar is up to you let this hang out in a cool dark place with a breathable top like a coffee filter and rubber band or a kitchen towel and a blender lid you need to let the liquid breathe without letting the fruit flies come take a bath in it while fermenting you will notice the accumulation of a skimmable white scum don't let this scare you off the only times I've ever made unfavourable tepache were the results of using under ripe samples and not from contracting botulism here's how to avoid that off-putting unripe flavor and this is good advice for multiple occasions anytime you're about to partake smell the bottom before tearing in sniffing the butt is a good way to check its ripeness because how it smells is how it's gonna taste take it from me before munching on something that's made primarily out of skin sniff the button after three days of fermentation you'll have made tepache a probiotic and technically alcoholic ish pineapple soda it's really good on its own not too sweet and happily mixed with beer for a radler or tequila for a cocktail but let this stuff ferment for three whole weeks and all the yeast will eat up all of the sugar transforming your sweet jug of water into a probiotic rich raw vinegar this stuff used to be scraps and now it's something that you could sell at the farmers market for $4 a cup use it in salad dressings marinades or mixed into a seltzer water with honey for a daily tonic good enough to banish paddy Bragg back into her cave of stuffed dolls armed with three new uses for pineapple you can start to get creative imagine pickling pineapples in pineapple vinegar you never would have thought that a jar of pickles could conjure up the sound of steel drums but look at this ting fresh summer fruit pickled in its own home fermented pineapple vinegar super juiced up with sugar salt and chilies unbelievable
