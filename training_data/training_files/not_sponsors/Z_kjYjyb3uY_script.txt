purchase and get started today Jenny Powell is a name you are likely unfamiliar with but if you're a fan of web shows it's highly likely you've heard of the stuff she's worked on from pioneering series like lonely girl 15 and the guild to the more recent Emmy Award winning lizzie bennet diaries jenny has labored behind the camera since the very beginning of web video she really has seen it all currently a faculty member at the New York Film Academy in LA she was willing to sit down with me one morning catch up and talk a little bit about what it takes to make stuff on the worldwide web hope you enjoy so I'm just gonna run down the list you've been a production assistant on lonely girl 15 associate producer of with the Angels production assistant on legend of Neil and the guild digital creative coordinator at relativity staff producer at DeFranco incorporated associate editor at to filter news producer at zombie gold productions head of production at new rockstars producer of the Lizzie Bennet diaries producer at geek and sundry founder and producer of discourse productions and you're also a faculty member at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles that is quite a resume needless to say winding the clock back to let's just say 2005 when web video I guess really sort of started coming into its own where were you and how did you get here what where was I well when YouTube first started coming onto the scene I was working I was already in LA so I was already here I've been here for a few years and I was working in reality television so I was a what was called a supervising producer which sounds big and fancy but what it really meant is I sat in a desk and waited for footage to come in from the field and then I would down that the footage arrived and then I would make copies of it and then I would take some to the editors and some to the loggers and then I would check in with them to make sure they were doing their job there was a lot of like moving things around and making sure other people were getting things done so I had a lot of downtime and a computer because a lot of my job was waiting for other people to do theirs and that's right around when we were kind of passed the pasture like just cat videos and dogs on skateboard right and vloggers had just started to become a thing and so I watched a lot of the early bloggers like Renato and mr. safety and Philip DeFranco who was one of my all-time favorites which is fun because I got to work with him later so that was cool and then also I started watching a little channel called lonely girl 15 this was back when the whole controversy was is this real or is it not I watched a few videos and I so distinctly remember I said this is scripted and everyone says like how did you know I was like uh it was just a feeling like that was my gut instinct when it was shown to me I I don't think I like noticed anything in particular I don't and I don't think it was like badly done and that's why I was like this was fake I just honestly I was like this is great storytelling like this girl is she's cute she's got an interesting story but do I think it's real no and so I started that's what set me down the rabbit hole I started to do research and found that there was already communities online talking about the show and just got really involved in that and then was around when it was called out that like no this is scripted jessica lee Rose is an actress and I was like this is amazing how are they doing this I want to do this I want to do this because I was actually really miserable doing reality television because my job was not creative in any way I still love reality television i watch all the time I ain't gonna lie but I did not enjoy making it and at the time I was doing a lot of improv comedy and I was taking a sketch writing class at The Upright Citizens Brigade theater and had been developing a sketch show with a bunch of friends called the history of the world according to YouTube where we were taking historical events and memes and wishing them together and of course my first idea was well if Anne Frank had a camera she'd video blog so we wrote this sketch I literally took the first episode of lonely girl and rewrote it in like 1940s and we filmed it with me in the role just because it was convenient at the time and didn't have any intention of putting it anywhere just it was for fun but we did show it at UCB because at the time there there was a show where they would let you test material and so I was like I'm just gonna show this little video that we cut and people freaked out though it's amazing it's so funny you have to put it online and I was like yeah but I'm in the lonely girl community and I'm afraid they're gonna think I'm like either making fun of lonely girl or being disrespectful to Anne Frank right the UCB theatre like you can get away with that stuff but I was like is this really like should I put this online and I was like you know what why not I'll put it up I feel like the fan base would be pretty understanding not only were they understanding they loved it and so they were like do more we're just having fun and then all of a sudden Amanda good Frede reached out to me who is one of the creators of Lille ago 15 and she said I've been watching your videos can you write me apart I was like wait you want to be in my fan show and she's like yes I want to be in your fan show she came and shot like a five episode arc I wrote her an arc in the show and a few weeks after that she said you know I was really impressed by your work ethic and like only had this in my mind for a while because I knew you were local and you seemed to like know what you're doing and you have a background in production and would you like to come work for us and I said yeah I do and she was like well I know you're like a supervising producer right now you're probably pretty good money I can only pay you as a production assistant I said I don't care I'm I do not care cuz I saw the potential in digital and really wanted to dive in and this was I could either mess around digital on my own making no money or work on the only scripted webseries at the time that existed and make some money and gain that experience so I quit my job my parents thought I was crazy they didn't know what a webseries was like what are you talking about like my mom just got a Facebook account two weeks ago so very behind so so they were just like you're gonna be homeless and poor and live on the streets I was like no I'm gonna live in the lonely girl house because we rented a house to shoot him duh it's okay I didn't live on the streets or in the lonely girl house right but um but yeah that was a crazy experience cuz I I was literally the only besides the camera guy who they'd had for a while and a director and Amanda I was pretty much the only other crew person I had and so that led into that led into the guild which then led into other things yep yep worked for Felicia Day for almost three years it's really funny cuz I just call her my mentor but we kind of taught each other cuz she was like I just started doing this web series I don't know what I'm doing and I was like why worked on the only other one we should partner up and work on stuff so so yeah that was really great I mean I got really lucky I would manage to land paying gigs in two of the only web series that were really making money at the time that could hire people right and of course now you know it's it's been like a decade but things move very fast online and so what is what's changed about the industry and what's changed about online video since you were working on the guild you know it's interesting a lot has changed but a lot of stayed the same like you still totally have the capability of doing a website independent on your own and it has a chance to be successful sure there are now a lot of companies that buy digital content and it's like professional level like you're these really good budgets now and stuff like that but the core of the independent feel of it is still there like I teach at the New York Film Academy and I teach new media and transmedia and interactive digital content and a first day of class I'm like guys you can do this every single one of you in this room can do this if you want to and it's so much more like the equipment's gotten better everything has the capability of looking so much better I mean lonely girl 15 when it started was shot on a webcam right it just was and then even even in the couple years that lonely girl ran the equipment got so much better like it got to the point where there was a cameraman who actually and Kevin who was the cameraman I'm Lily girl 15 still to this day I think he's one of the most talented people I've ever worked with because he literally invented the style of shooting backwards yeah because in order to shoot the show he had to constantly be walking backwards because the character would be holding the bottom of the camera and he would be operating it right so when there was walking talking he had to go back I've seen this kid climb over rocks and down beaches and like through basically an obstacle obstacle course to like get these shots and that's really a format he invented yeah absolutely had been done before I mean now it's just like you know it's funny that we talk about when we girl 15 it really was pioneering in the sense that its influence is literally seen all over YouTube but people a lot of whom have never even heard the show part of the show or seen the show and yet today it's it's influencing even the biggest vloggers on the platform and the biggest web shows it went from being shot I mean the series itself evolved and web videos evolved lonely girl started out being shot on a webcam and now you have vloggers shooting on red cinemas right porque with their like ring light right I'm just everything it's only been like ten years and the medium is completely just taken a leap forward and scripted web series has changed quite a bit it's interesting to see although the technology's gotten a lot of better a lot better the core concepts kind of still seem the same I mean I remember with you know with the Anne Frank series that you were doing you were like what if I just take and this you know what if I take this older well not store it was actual event but what if I take this older narrative and apply it to a new more modern setting basically the same concept behind lizzie bennet diaries and the other things and so and of course that was wildly successful what was your experience working on that web series I had gotten to know Hank and John Green were the vlogbrothers I actually had known them from the lonely girl community way back in the eighth cuz again everything stems from lowly girl right right um but at the time I was helping them with VidCon the online video conference so I was working really closely with Hank like on a day-to-day basis and we chatted a lot online just about digital and where it was going and like what we wanted to feature at VidCon because everything was moving so fast and through one of those conversations online he just said to me he's like I had this idea the other day Jenny what do you think of this and I was like okay I'm all ears or eyes because we were typing at the time and he said what if we took a novel and adapted it to YouTube in the vlog format and I immediately went okay we're doing it now what book do you want to do we have to do this no one's thought of this yet we have to do it before anyone else I was like all caps like we gotta do this no one's done it it's a genius idea what book do you want to do I was so excited so excited he goes he types the Diary of Anne Frank [Laughter] you're like been there done that well that's what he said he's like this is why I wanted to pitch it to you Jenny because like you understand and you love Anne Frank and you've done it already I was like I did a parody show of lowly girl 14 and it was a comedy it was not a straight adaptation and how how how Hank do you think that's gonna happen and it was like really like he's like we can do it somehow we can do it I was like if you can pitch me a way to modernize and Frank to this day and age in a vlog format that isn't fantasy because how if you can pitch it to me I'll do it he couldn't do it but he was so stuck on the idea and I said okay there's a second problem here even if we could come up with a way to do it and Frank's not public domain yeah only reason I got away with it because it was parody so that fell under fair use right a straight adaptation of the Diary of Anne Frank you have to go through the Anne Frank foundation and get permission and they ain't gonna do that no and he still was so consumed with this idea cuz when Hank gets an idea he does not want to let it go it's one of the things I love about him and one of the things like drives me nuts because it was like weird time is ticking here right someone else do someone else will do this while we're working on the idea and so actually John Green saved the day because John Green at the time was writing The Fault in Our Stars which a part of it is set in the Anne Frank House so he was going through the process of getting permission to use the likeness of in the Anne Frank House in his book right right and he was like able to tell Hank like dude I have a good chance of accomplishing this and I'm even having a really hard time like it is hard to do do this and he's like I'm really certain they're gonna say no so you should move on he's like but John like and so John finally was like fine Hank put together a proposal I'll put it in front of them if it just the only way to get you and so he got the proposal to the Anne Frank Foundation and the Anne Frank Foundation said I just imagine the Hank handing John the proposal and John saying alright I'll give it to him and then turning right around and tossing it directly into the trash they said no bro sorry we tried our hardest and finally Hank was like alright well we can't do an Frank yet I was like what do you mean by yet he's like well this is what we're gonna we're gonna pick a different book and we'll do that first as a proof of concept then we'll go back to the house it's fine I don't care sure just get him just get him going on that on the right track and then we spent probably a good week just throwing things back and forth of like Shakespeare or blah Blee blah like like Peter Pan was actually one of the ones I pitched which is funny because I ended up doing later right but his wife Catherine I guess one day they were talking and she said well what about Pride and Prejudice it's my favorite book and he came to me and he's like Catherine said Pride and Prejudice and I was like oh yeah we both reread it and we were like yeah this could work and then we're like okay we need a writer cuz I I probably could have taken that on but like I was like at that time I was really into producing yes just think yeah I wear a lot of hats but I was like for this I was like let's get a writer right so that I can focus on the production side of it cuz I was gonna have to do a lot of the heavy lifting because he knew he wanted me to shoot it in LA because Hank doesn't live in LA right and so I started looking at casting because I was like wait like if we're gonna do this like we need to find someone amazing for Lizzie Bennet and Hanks like well why don't we just get I just seen was it here we go again it's not that I just seen isn't a lovely person but I was like Hank it's fine a relatively unknown actress and build her up kinda like what they did it's lonely girl right right and he was like alright well you run some casting sessions and if I see someone like I like will do that but if not it's iJustine okay fine okay great and then independent of me he had run into Bernie su at a YouTube event he pitched it to him and Bernie threw out some ideas of how we could do it structurally and then once that happened it was like the triangle of power was performed then I just felt like it just like fell into place did some casting we found some amazing actresses especially Ashley Clements who plays Lizzie Bennet I wanted someone who is classically trained in theater because the way we were going to be shooting this person was gonna have to memorize a ton of lines and move very very fast right and I I know from doing a lot of theater that that is a skill that comes from being a theater actor right I also for someone with some good improv skills and Ashley studied at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego which is a Shakespearean company which I'm familiar with because I grew up there and she had taken improv a bunch of improv and I was like okay so on paper this girl's perfect please come in and give a good audition and she killed it she was great she was basically perfect once we had our cast once we and figured out where we were gonna shoot it because were like oh should we get a set should we build a set should we like we toyed around all these options and then I was like you know what you know what works best it's just like an authentic room like let's shoot it in my room which of course opened me up to living in a hot set for seven months always fun this yeah cuz I couldn't take the set down because we needed it again and we actually ended up turning my room into two different Lizzie Bennet sets so one side of the room was a little bit Lizzie Bennett's bedroom and the other side was Netherfield which all we did was paint two walls purple and redress it right so I was living in a hot set half of which was purple absolutely absolutely as long as it's within the frame it's fine what was really really cool is like once we started lizzie bennet other people did glom on to the whole like oh wow this is a great idea let's modernize other books and so literally we created what is now referred to as literary webseries mm-hmm so once again we were able to kind of be a little you know pioneering in the center and still taking that classic blog format like we weren't reinventing the wheel but giving it that twist that it needed to just and encourage it what I loved about it is encouraging other people to play in that sandbox because there's so many books that are public domain that you end worlds that you can play in and I remember loving our younger fans who were like I had never read Pride and Prejudice until I saw this that's always nice that's when you know you've done the job right yeah we did it so discourse Productions is kind of your flagship right now at the moment most recent move that I've seen you all make is securing the rights for the lonely girl 15 franchise is there anything new to report in that area or how did that all go down I have an update but so the 10-year anniversary was coming up and I had been talking to miles just kind of casually and I was like would you give me permission to do a video on the channel on the 10-year what's funny is I'm actually logged into the lonely girl account right now and like every 15 minutes like it still gets your home it still gets comments still get to use I looked into the other day like she's so pretty I would kiss her face but worse than that right but so I had been talking to miles about it and and miles was like I'm all for it Jenny like whatever you want to you're like probably the only one I trust with the franchise more than like not myself I contacted Jessica who I think she's still there but she she's in Australia so I was like hey if I write you a script and direct you over Skype like could we shoot a video for the for the channel she agreed to do it and she killed it she sent us the footage we edited it on our side added in all the little puzzle clues because you can't have lowly girl without that and didn't besides miles Logan and myself and then we had an editor who is helping us no one knew we were doing this yeah yeah just kind of came out of the blue yeah so because that's what I wanted and I had an ulterior motive for doing it because I wanted to see if there was still interest sure in the context kind of testing the waters event so on the 10-year anniversary we'd dropped our little video into the YouTube universe to see what would happen and it exploded that made 2 million views in 48 hours and at the end of the towards the end of the first day was when I started getting calls from the press right because I don't really know how quickly people real I don't know if they were like calling miles and miles is like no it's not me it's her right they were getting to me and they're like we know you did this tell us about it I was like oh ah and then of course by this time miles and I had he's like this is like a thing can I sell you the rights for a dollar look we've all been there official that like you officially like own this stuff and I'll add you to the channel and like here's the thing and and he's like all I ask is that I be an EP and that you like run stuff by me so I was like okay great so that all happened and he's like wow I didn't know this is gonna be such a big thing and I was like yeah I didn't either but so did you make any plans did you make any plans after that is there any plan of continuing the franchise or is it kind of a there's a how long has it there's a 78 page Bible that we put together right there there is content to be had and world building that was done and we actually did besides that first video we did do a mini alternate reality game involving the character of daniel is yousef like down to do whatever right and he was really instrumental in getting katherine and max to come play - i will say we had talked to Jackson and he was on board to come back as well if we got to that point right away you do at the New York Film Academy now I am a faculty member at the New York Film Academy I just felt like it it started out as not an accident that's the wrong thing to say I had been brought in to speak at a screenwriting class at knife ax I was brought in by Margaret Dunlap who is one of the writers on Lizzie Bennet diaries and she was like come speak to my class and I was like great I will come speak to your class and it just so happens that sitting in on that class was the co-chair of the screenwriting department and afterwards he came out to me and he said you're a really great speaker have you ever thought about teaching and I was like well actually back in my before the industry days I actually taught middle school sex education same difference new New York Film Academy middle school sex ed same thing and then when I was doing my psychology degree I was working on a master's and as part of my program I was teaching psych 101 classes which I really really loved I always knew that teaching was the thing I was passionate about and I don't know it felt like a good time to start giving back because I had so many amazing mentors when I came up that now I'm like well there here's all these new fresh people that want to like they don't know what they want to do yet and if I could share my experiences and maybe open the up to trying things they maybe not didn't think of I really wanted to do that and the New York Film Academy has one of the only hands-on transmedia programs in the country right other than us see who has Henry Jenkins who is literally my hero like he coined the term transmedia and he really was one of the people that really inspired me to go into like not just doing webseries but doing like interactive web series with like world building and living on multiple platforms and that whole concept is in academia we call it transmedia but in the industry it's referred to as franchising right which actually means to executives dollar bills right so yeah it's becoming much more common now in the industry that when you go in to pitch they don't want to hear a single story they want to hear about your world right because they're looking for Harry Potter's and they're looking for Marvel Universe's and so if you have that world building skill and you as especially as a writer that's big power that's why Knifer wanted to have a transmedia track it's not just one class it's multiple classes because they learn about storytelling from all different perspectives like there's a comic book class and there's a videogame class and well they and a web series class and it's just like here try all this stuff because there's all these things as a writer that are available to you now you don't have to just write film or TV sure like its ton of other options but yeah but now it's it's funny I started just teaching web series and transmedia but I've really grown it into teaching all kinds of things at night from like we have classes on story generation which is just like hey stories can come from anywhere you can be inspired by anything and they get to have all these different experiences of like pull a real story from a newspaper and develop that into a story and take a fairy tale and make it your own and yeah it's been really fulfilling and I really enjoy it um still producing as well which is a lot but I make it work right so you've pretty much seen everything since the beginning of web video too now so much has changed in a short period of time but you've kind of been there for everything and you you've you've been along for the ride ever since the ride started where do you see the industry of web video heading in the next 10 years I really feel like not just digital but television and film it's all starting to converge right and when I talk about transmedia I'm not from an academic standpoint I'm not saying like I really enjoy it because it's a cool thing and academically it's really neat I think that's where it's going right I think and again and I see this in pitch meetings all the time like you're not you they don't want you to come in and just be like here's my story about a boy who like is having a common of age experience and it's just focusing on that microcosm I think we'll still have those stories and I think they'll exist but so much now is like they want you to come in with a world right they really do what advice would you give to the kid with the camera who wants to do something but isn't sure how to get started just do it Nike logo but all of us as creators when we started didn't know where to start but you just have to do it and if you are if the guy already has a camera he's already like five steps ahead of everybody else so turn it on try some stuff get some friends together be creative I actually get really jealous of people that they're like but I don't have a following at all I don't think that's the best time because you could do one of you what and the trolls aren't there yet yeah and you can you can just try stuff and if you mess up who cares try something different I mean we talk about all the shows I have worked on but there's also a lot of shows that are out there that I've also worked on that nobody's heard of it just didn't go anywhere or didn't work out or like there's tons of shows I've pitched that haven't gone anywhere like I failed to I think one of the reasons there's this fear like I'm not going to have a perfect track record and that keeps a lot of people from starting out and I think that's one of those old media things where they have to realize you see these you see these successful filmmakers but you have to realize that there was there such an entry barrier back then had to go through a studio had to have things approved had to have this collaborative process you know you had to market it and it had to go through all these different gates before it ever was shown publicly that so much of the stuff was weeded out a lot of failures were weeded out but by-and-large also a lot of creativity was we weeded out as well and so in the age where you can make it and upload it in a day and there is no middleman you know there is no gatekeeper that's not gonna let you put it out to the public you're gonna there's gonna be a lot of failure involved and you you've got to recognize that the failure is going to happen the you know you're not going to knock it out of the park each time the the best way to get started now is to just start putting content out there and experiment and don't worry about it being successful or not just try and just try it out and figure out the style and figure out what you want to do what advice would you give to someone who has been making videos for maybe several years and yet they have never really had a big moment or a big break what are some of the common mistakes that you see people make that keeping that keep them from taking things to the next level I would say if you're something you're doing has it hit in two years look about look at what you're doing and this is going to sound similar to this answer I gave before but it's like what are you trying other things are you just trying to beat a dead horse and like you're using a format that just people aren't relating to maybe just have to switch it up I know Tyler Oakley when he first started out he struggles with his daily vlog and what he was doing for years until I'm not sure exactly what tipped him over the point but it was probably hard and he finally like what's that I said it was probably the Illuminati there's all that money like I gotta do something pay the Illuminati though right right he just stuck at it and he kept experimenting with different things until he hit upon what worked and then he rose from there and he was one that like people forget that he came in at a time where it was really hard to push your way to the top like it's not it wasn't as saturated as it is now like now it's even harder it's so saturated yeah especially vloggers are so ridiculously saturated these days you know you just kept at it kept reworking his format and what he was sharing and he eventually hit on something that you know sent him to the next level and went from there what are you working on right now that you want to plug you can plug two things I'm never just doing one fab solution you know that's about me so one I'm working on a project called fictional fairs which is it's basically comedians in cars getting coffee meats once upon a time so it's always a change the main character is a rideshare driver so like a lyft driver an uber driver but all the fares he picks up our classic fictional characters from plays and novels so it's a little bit of throwback to Lizzie Bennet diaries only it's more of like a anthology so every episode is gonna feature different characters and then the second project I'm working on is actually a Canadian series called blackout I think you've talked about blackout yeah I had no idea you were involved in that and so I was like Jenny knows about this if she's involved because when you had plugged it the crater's emailed me and they're like Skye Austin he like did this great thing and whoa they were so happy I was like oh yeah I know Austin's like of course so it is a mystery thriller web series and it is actively in production now I will be the transmedia producer on it so there will be an alternate reality game around the etherion very nice yes it features a IT guy in a small town who starts sleepwalking at first he just thinks like oh I'm sleepwalking a little bit but then he starts losing like days and weeks of his time and he's like wait this is really weird right so so that's shooting I think middle mid May with the aim of October launched October ok well Jenni thank you very much for sitting down to talk with me one final question before we go in a single sentence what do you think it takes to make stuff a brain a camera and a good idea there it is that is an acceptable answer alrighty well Jenni thank you very much best of luck in all that you're working on right now and for the future and yeah have a good one Thanks there you have it if you want to learn more about Jenni's recent and upcoming projects then check the description one more thank you to our check the video out to learn a little more hope you guys are doing well I'll talk to you soon [Music]
