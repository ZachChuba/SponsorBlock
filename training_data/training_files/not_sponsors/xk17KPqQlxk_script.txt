it's pretty rare that a movie or game or any media will come out and essentially define its own genre or event kind of like how in Jaws and Star Wars initially came out in the 70s they were labeled as blockbusters because people would be forced to line up around the block to see him now it's kind of just tacked on to every movie that comes out ain't nobody blind enough for Blockbuster Video these days it's just become kind of a buzzword that you throw on to attempt to classify something kinda like Dark Souls crash bandicoot's the Dark Souls the 3d platforming hub heads the dark souls of 2d platforming let it die the goofy Dark Souls hello hi yes it's me Austin and today we're gonna be talking about some Dark Souls clones of which there's a lot of them but first I want to talk to you guys about today's sponsor raid shadow legends if you're know on with the show for those unfamiliar with Dark Souls watching this say like my parents let's run it down real quick demon souls was a weird as hell 3d action game that released on the PlayStation 3 back in 2009 by from software those dudes were at the time most notorious for the armored Corps franchise which by the way I'm still waiting for a new one demons got a lot of notoriety for having an ounce of difficulty back in a time where games were considerably easier than they are now I think we can blame halo for the whole regenerating health thing Demon Souls would be like a what's up your [ __ ] dirt then people loved that [ __ ] I love that [ __ ] but more importantly demons and the spiritual successors in Dark Souls blood-borne and say Kiro presented the player with so much more than angry gamer moments on YouTube and griefing videos although those grieving videos are pretty great you had an impressive amount of world-building only discoverable through the players efforts a minimal amount of central narrative dark fantasy world or even sometimes some horrifying Lovecraft II and stuff he had bosses that you trial-and-error it against for hours in an attempt to conquer it's all fair and as long as you're on your toes you can do it hell I did it I beats a hero it's not that hard just just block so instead of throwing around words like souls like souls born or I don't know soul Kiro born let's take a second to talk about some actual Dark Souls clones no more of this frickin fortune Street is the psyche row of Mario Party of blood-borne nonsense I'm talking about games that were like hmm let's try the thing what is the thing it's obvious just watch the video you understand so I'm back from the shame attic to announce that yes this is indeed not clickbait we about to talk about some Dark Souls clones and to get started let's talk about the most obvious one that I can think of nowadays there's a lot of souls likes but once upon a time if you wanted to try something really similar to Dark Souls you had nothing for like a really long time then Lords of the Fallen was like a wassup baby [Applause] German developer Dec 13 wasn't really known for too much at the time but I remember early previews of this game looking pretty slick especially in the visual Department which was never from sauce strongest suit Lorde's is like fine and I always felt like it played OK and had some decent moments but it tried too hard to do the souls thing but with like 15% more jank I did really like the experience point multiplier system and playing as an actual character but that's it Lords of the Fallen is kind of uninteresting to talk about but I do think that deck 13 surge is pretty cool when it's not off making nibbly bits allegedly shrink the surge is this futuristic Souls like that popped out of nowhere in 2017 I picked this thing up on a whim and it's not bad do you like terminator are you afraid of the robots have you ever wanted to play a game where you are basically the mech crab soup from aliens well then the surge might be for you you play as Warren on his first day of work at a business called creo totally not evil Google who want to read green the earth in this era of pollution by shooting missiles at it granted they're like healing Rockets but still Warren shows up with a dramatic wheelchair reveal hoping to get a robotic exoskeleton you actually pick your starting class by wheeling around from room to room hearing explanations of the types of suits you can pick it's neat then the robots are like administer the sedative but they totally did not administer the sedative and then you're like then you wake up and everything's all post-apocalyptic like how how fast was that oh well time to kill some robots oh yeah Dark Souls colognes the surge is a vast improvement over Dec their team's last effort and it has a handful of really neat mechanics you like do the Dark Souls lock-on on two dudes except you actually target individual body parts if you want to go for the quick kill you'll lock on to an unarmored part but your main method of acquiring crafting materials and new weapons is by attacking armored parts you'll run into a random dude that has a big scary looking weapon and you'll be like I want it so you break it off is mine now it's like Gundam breaker except with scary-looking Skynet robots who are like corpses instead of souls or blood as a currency you have Tech's crap you'll use these at med Bay's to increase your core power which allows you to slot better gear and implants to get big strong but maybe not bravery the heck is this it wouldn't be a souls clone without bosses I hope you like even bigger robots the search will have you dying a ton so it's definitely more forgiving than the series it pulls from although having a time limit to recover your dead body in order to keep the scraps you've gotten what's an exciting and difficult feature not only do you have to get back to where you were but you only got like five minutes so good luck over all the surges are pretty decent souls like and one that I've had a lot of fun with it's biggest flaw is honestly a lack of personality from playing it to straight that and combat can be a bit finicky control inputs are super sensitive so you'll accidentally press the button twice but then you're locked in for two full hits and you've got you gotta be real gentle I was really happy to see this urge to be a thing when it was announced so here's the hoping they make it even better I know it's popular to put them in games these days but hopefully they don't have the Terminator crossover stay away there's not too much to offer on the triple-a front when it comes to Dark Souls clones besides like the incredibly obvious ones like neo and Serge I think a lot of the more interesting stuff comes out of the indie corner so let's uh let's do that do you like Dark Souls I'm gonna assume probably well how about the rogue light or a roguelike whatever what about the souls like roguelike not enough for ya okay how about the four player co-op low souls like roguelike yeah buzzwords the crop allison concept is pretty sick the developer Harebrained Schemes was at the time known for the Shadowrun Returns reboot which was really solid and relatively popular with PC gamers when it released so when I came across the necropolis booth at PAX Prime and saw like three people playing a game that looked like Dark Souls together I was like oh hi hello yes where do i money so when it finally released in July of 2016 it was not well-received at all it turned me off from purchasing it at the time but there were a ton of complaints hairbrained themselves acknowledged review bombs so barely three months later hair brained released the brutal edition update which added a decent amount of content like new enemies new environments and even a new playable character the devs released this as part of a road map they posted on the steam forums of many hotfix and then promptly they sleep battle tech time so we're gonna talk a little bit about the brutal edition of necropolis whatever version I played like a week ago okay that's good yeah turns out video games are fun with friends in every situation single-player for this one a little less so but that's okay let's talk about it so in necropolis you basically just attempt to escape from the dungeon overseen by an Archmage called Abraxas I I think the plots very vague just like everything else when you create a character you pick one of two characters types and gender but there's no telling what makes them different unless you get a second to play as them that's fine but this kind of thing is basically a motif for the entirety of necropolis wanna make a potion sure what does it do figure it out [ __ ] time to equip a skill like you try to stomach bad food okay just like Final Fantasy 11 necropolis is one of those games you want to play with a second monitor displaying the Wikipedia like the entire time it's hard to even tell what things are this little book stand here that's how you get traits you would never know but beyond that this game feels real good to play once you figure out some of the base stuff with the controls and you have a little party of friends getting into it you're gonna have a good time considering this is a roguelike if you die you'll lose all of your progress and restart well besides these little progress gems here however in co-op you get to resurrect eachother mid run you'll need it too since Necropolis decided to keep friendly fire on can I just think about that oh my god sorry roguelike Dark Souls tight corridors friendly fire shenanigans but you end up trying to like communicate with each other to be like alright I don't have much stamina you go in and I'll stay back it's pretty cool however Necker does suffer from the same thing I mentioned with the surge earlier where your actions will cue leading to moments where you do long ass animations like this twice it's just unfortunate that the content here is really bare-bones now I know the developers updated it but considering it's been three years since the last update with no word necropolis remains that little game that could have been unless you and a few friends pick it up on sale for like five dollars but at the normal price of $30 that's a little steep maybe one day someone will make the definitive four player co-op souls like roguelike but for now this will have to do okay I think it's about time we move away from the finished product and move on to the bottomless pit known as early access after all why pay full price for something when you can like boot up steam navigate the hundreds of hentai games and pay for something that's totally not finished like like this now that all it takes is a handshake a hundred bucks and an exe to get a video game on to steam the platform's turned into this extremely difficult to navigate almost unusable search engine filled with literal trash and I love it now most people out there who played normal video games are like oh how do I even find good video games anymore but maybe the epic game store has them but the epic game store doesn't have gems like weed I guess people figured out how to throw Dark Souls into unity now so let's talk about a few early access clones only two specific ones though cuz there's a lot we got to deke loans 3d clones virtual reality clones probably normally I wouldn't pick on this type of thing but screw it this here is never end picked it cuz there's an anime girl I only listen to my dad and my dad loves anime girls I launched this thing and thought it crashed right away but no it just freezes when you open it for like 10 seconds sick never rinth is another one of those Souls like roguelikes turns out that's all the rage these days Dark Souls linear level progression upgrades on death anime pops BAM very positive we've talked about all kinds of clones at this point some of them are like games that are heavily inspired by something other clones are straight up in the same engine and feel identical to play looking at every doom clone out there then you have something like never in know this isn't just a modded Dark Souls although this is this a recolor maybe not but basically never in this' like rey Ayanami and the girl from heavenly sword got stuck in the lobby from demon souls and also tetris is here it's not often you get to play something so blatant but at the same time never n't it's just clearly early access on an indie budget at the moment there is hardly any variety in the enemies from floor to floor combat feels a little unbalanced any couple items are hard to make sense of their are boss fights they're pretty one notes the mechanics aren't that challenging but they have like a million health it's a big sponge you get a currency called crystal energy as you go through the nephron this is used for temporary upgrades for agility strength defense and luck temporary because the numbers and stat boosting all disappear I'm dead your main method of progression is by unlocking achievements like kill ten of this thing which is not gonna make you stronger so much as give you access to more tools it's kind of like dead cells there's also a crystal board Tetris thing that lets just slot runes you find while dungeon aim for a few passives and a totem that'll increase your base stats but that's about it damn costumes gotta love costumes for an early access game never rent is it bad although maybe the very this is a bit much considering the combat and UI needs a bit of work also I'm like pretty sure that the menu sound effect is straight up from Grandia - yo Grandia - still real good hey anime in the video J sticking with early access we're gonna be moving on to something that hit the stores back in January bloody spell the early access Dark Souls clone with purchasable downloadable content of sexy animal outfits of course if you're a player who pursues blood and is brave enough to challenge the limits it will def inspire your adrenaline a spell wants to be a tough-as-nails Souls like action game and it lets you know in the difficulty selection ez is recommended for players who have not touched the action game normals for players who have been exposed to action games and souls games Souls games hard' is for those who have been exposed to ninja gaiden and Yakuza I didn't know you could just name drop I feel like there's a pretty big gap between ninja gaiden and Yakuza maybe there's another game that should have had their name written here I don't know I'm not gonna say it you gotta love this basic font and early access y'all the game though it's uh there's something neat going on here you just gotta brush off a little layer of jank 3d platforming with Souls II physics sure being able to take damage while locked in texts with NPCs yep you wanna [ __ ] see anything no sir unlike never rent there's a ton of cool-looking gear you can find lying around or stuff you can spend your currency on which is just straight-up called blood by the way yes sir that will be 2,000 blood what there's several types of armor and weapon sets you can find lying around though it did take a while to find something to cover my nasty feet I was wearing like capri bloomers for the longest time but at least I was lucky enough to find a huge blunt the game's a pretty fun time though combat feels pretty fluid no matter which weapon you're using it crosses a lot of the Devil May Cry territory in terms of speed which I guess makes sense considering they ripped off the bloody palace mode on the menu yep that is just straight up bloody Palace when you slide in the boss fights battles are suddenly exhilarating you have a teleport mechanic you used to approach enemies quickly even if you end up doing it at the wrong time you're uh you're gonna die normal enemies are just like zombies though there's not much variety at the moment but the road map plans to add a lot of areas the beginning dungeon has multiple routes and it seems like it's randomly generated but everything else follows the souls like formula you hold on to any abilities you unlocked and any items you have equipped you can also unlock specific items by doing hidden mini-games like this one where you just throw a spear at a rat to unlock this what's what's the DLC then why is the woman on the front page and main menu of this game the one being used for all of the promotion not the main character you play as this guy but you can just equip this wig and oh oh it's what you guys have been using the budget for seriously keep up the good work bloody smells pretty cool even if it goes a little onii-chan bar at times I think they got a long way to go and a lot of jank in Times New Roman font to fix but it's on the right path though it did come out before say Kuro and now that path is even longer or maybe this is better I don't know so everything we've talked about in the video so far has been good or fine you know I think that's a testament to how good of a concept Dark Souls really is but I want to change that for our last game today let's talk about a little digital title called inferno climber reborn I bet you didn't know that Arc System Works made a Dark Souls clone you can tell without this on the bottom to just look at the logos Marxist logos always have this extremely over designed ridiculous look to it this one kind of looks similar to the under knight in birth logo actually I think this is a remake but Inferno climber reborn here gives us not one but two logos in the same main menu I'm stalling though cuz oh boy you begin with your standard character creation and what is that this is what I imagined sir Daniel from medieval would look like if he was alive you make your dude and slowly walk past a bunch of dead bodies toward what looks like a final boss arena and sure enough you did then death asks if you want to wake up in heaven or hell and it doesn't really make any sense but apparently heaven is just dying to this giant dragon thing over and over so let's go with hell that's right Inferno climber insinuates right off the bat that the act of normally playing the game is in heaven but he'll although the launch icon might have been enough to tell you that Inferno climber pulls a lot from Dark Souls but controls like absolute [ __ ] by comparison in every game I've spoken about in this episode the character you control has momentum to their movement there's a startup animation with weight to any slight jostling you might do you have different walk speeds looking at inferno for even two seconds is enough to see that this thing you just depress but but what if you take the mechanics and difficulty of Dark Souls and add in the durability system from breadth of the wild that kind of sucks but what if you add that durability system to all of the food you have to eat you need to fill up that tummy so you don't suddenly die but the food you find can also die and really fast too why does this literal walking corpse need to be fed you're a zombie when you die which by the way you will you then briefly control death and have to pick a new character if anyone out there is played let it die there is a system where your playable characters will get kidnapped by other players an inferno climber if you die your corpse run is by another character entirely so if your best dude dies in a high-level area and you've not like worked on anybody else you have to basically sacrifice someone else to grab them if everyone dies you have to permanently erase a character in order to get them a fresh start to try to get all the other characters again so so don't do that granted anytime you level up your XP goes to all of your body's characters Oh check this out look at this PS PS menu system my my eyes immediately glazed over this will be fine in like an MMO or a game from 20 years ago what is variants percentage what does this mean is it the percentage chance that shield Naruto run is it your enemy's chance to Naruto run infernal climber is not only infuriating in concept but has close to no conveyance of what you're supposed to do I get that like Dark Souls is like hey figure it out but Inferno climbers like figure out the one and only specific thing you have to do and we're not gonna tell you a [ __ ] I spent so much time trying to understand the significance of these trials you do from the note that I got in the jungle that just said I learned how to use this bow and arrow and a basement somewhere and then I couldn't for the life of me figure out where to go but once I did let me show you did you see it see that tiny little switch blurred out in the distance stuck here for like an hour most embarrassed I've ever been I kept going for a little bit for ragequitting while corpse running over and over in any other souls like you feel like you can slowly push your way through the combat as you learn more and more but an inferno climber you get jostling around like a rag doll and swarmed and just put into the ground like a sick this game doesn't feel real to me your food rots too fast your weapons break too fast and also everything's just this nasty brown and somehow Arc System Works made this though the guys known for maximum style and color yet somehow half of this game looks like a grim dark version of Chaco mountain from Mario Kart 64 steer clear of this one if you can don't be like me swear to me it's a bad game well that's it for today people have been making a meme out of the fact that I always promise a new video as a sequel to whatever one I'm working on so I'm not going to do that today very sensitive guys I had to had to move into the Attic the gamers are coming I tried to get into area 51 and all that was there was a bunch of angry Dark Souls fans unfortunately so this is where I live now I'm a barricaded up I hope everything is gonna be okay I think I'm gonna be safe but you know we'll see I I guess while I'm here we should think a couple of people I don't know if I'm gonna make it out but a special patreon shout-out to Alfredo Adriano Christopher Olivia Chris Shelton Donald Doughty David Molnar Eli Shane Stefanik or flaming
