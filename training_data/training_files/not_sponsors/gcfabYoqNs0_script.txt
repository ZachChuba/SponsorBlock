hi guys welcome to another makeover video if you guys didn't know if you haven't been following my journey I had these massive built-in wardrobes in this bedroom and I hated them and I thought one day you know what to get me to not hate them I'm gonna paint them so I painted them dark off black and then I hate them even more I felt like I was walking in a cave because he came out like above the door when you were walking in so I decided to bite the bullet and get them remade and I'm so happy with the outcome I will be getting new wooden flooring in January so ignore the carpet before I jump into this makeover I wanted to talk to you about something that is gonna help your shopping needs when it comes to Black Friday I love Black Friday sales but I find them so stressful so before I get into laptop online shopping it's time to do a little before of this room so as you walk in it is full of stuff right now but all of this stuff today is being picked up by the YMCA and I did this earlier in the year they're basically a charity and whatever they sell it for goes straight to charities we will do a little after of this today ones have been I think they're coming after 1 p.m. but I've taken all of the stuff out of the wardrobes and put it on the sofa ready for Thursday when the man comes to do my wardrobes so these are the wardrobes I absolutely hate them they encroach on the room it's so much uh-huh it's nearly frigging door width so these are gonna get ripped out and I'm gonna have new ones put in I'm so excited guys ok let's do a little before and after when all the stuff is gone so we've just been to take all this stuff away they were super thankful which is always really nice all of that stuff on my sofa is from the top of my wardrobe so it's just living there for now [Music] I wish you could see yourself ripping out the wardrobes caused a lot more damage than I thought it would so I had to go in and take the lining paper off and fill all the holes and son the walls I did actually upload a vlog of the whole process of getting my wardrobes and sorting the walls out so if you would like to see that I will leave it as a link below to watch I thought I would just speed up the whole process in this video [Music] [Music] well I see [Applause] [Music] falling to you some of you are going to think I'm literally insane but I'm gonna test a pink paint on the walls I haven't got a pink room yeah and I kind of wanted this room to be a ping so I'm gonna test what it looks like with my sofa this is called calamine by Farrell ball I've also got to paint this fireplace because it is a very very yellow okay so this is what it looks like I actually quite like it you what I'm gonna do now before I go out is try and move this to there and try and move my sofa to there because I know I want to paint this wall I'm not entirely sure if I want to paint the whole room yet but I definitely want to do this wall first so I'm gonna like move all the stuff over and of doing it I might actually keep the sofa over here to be honest I think it looks really nice there [Music] I'm all [Music] okay I've officially got my paint color now I went for the calamine by feral bull and you always get their modern emulsion it's like a tiny bit of Sheen but not that much let's get cracking I'm so excited to start painting I haven't taped the fireplace because I need to paint that anyway so we forget paint on it doesn't matter [Music] it's on hold [Music] okay guys I've done wallet Co on the wall and it looks friggin incredible and I'm so tempted to do the whole room I've just asked my friends what they think so Lucy and Gemma this is down to you whether I do the whole room or just have one wall I think maybe one wall would be the sensible option but damn I want to use this paint elsewhere it's so pretty I need to move that over there obviously isn't styled yet but I love this pink wall it's so cute and I think having my sofa here is good it kind of breaks up the pink a bit anyways I've got this rail from Ikea and it's like a clothing rail you put it on the wall like that then you can hang things on it and I'm thinking of putting it over the radiator and hanging a few things on it because this radiator isn't going anywhere yet so that is what the rail looks like absolutely love it because I've been struggling to dry clothes as well now that the weather's gone colder and I've just realized that I've put that right above the radiator so it's gonna be perfect for when I'm not filming and stuff like when I don't want pretty clothes on it to put that radiator on full blast and hang my washing on that is such a good idea I'm a genius I'm gonna paint this side table why to think too much the wardrobe just to put next to the sofa for in people stakes it's a sofa bed and obviously I still got to paint the fire if you can see up close it's just a right mess it just needs a coat of white [Music] little closer now cuz I don't wanna slow this down my heart is speaking out your name I'm wasting I just spent the last half an hour painting the fireplace and it looks so much better it blends in with the skirting board now I know you probably couldn't see how yellow it actually was on camera but it was so yellow okay guys so with the holes around the doorframe I just filled them with this like deep hole stuff a few days ago on let it dry and then have to sand it and painted it this looks so much better for now I basically don't think I'll get the finished door frame back on before I can post this video so I just thought I would do that quickly [Music] I'm really excited because I've got someone coming tomorrow to fit my new light fixture which is going up there so I did try this other light fixture right there and it just did not look right at all so I've ordered this amazing one from made comm and it is honestly perfect I'm so excited to see it done so hopefully he's gonna come tomorrow and then I can finish his bloody video it's been going on for weeks so we had a bit of an issue with the light that was supposed to be hung in here I'll put a picture of it on screen now it would have been absolutely bloomin perfect but there was no earth wire or something which means I would have had to get this whole room rewired to fit the light and I just can't do that right now so I just asked him if he could hang this IKEA one and luckily it actually looks okay okay so I'm going to talk you through the finished room I absolutely bloomin love it except the bloomin lights but as you walk in now obviously you can see a little pink paradise I freaking love it I kind of want this is my bedroom now so as you can see from this angle my new wardrobes look amazing and I'm honestly in love with them they're so perfect and it was such a good decision to get rid of the others I've had a few people be like you look now different they look so different I feel like those people had just been annoying to be honest and then as we move around to the side I've obviously got my clothing rack which I love I think it looks so good I would advise not to put too many clothes on here I think five things is probably my maximum I did add this leopard coat for this little clip because I like it but yeah if you are gonna get this I would say don't hang too many things cuz it could rip off the wall then I just added a radiator cover underneath I feel like this looks so much nicer this was actually left from the old owners so thank you so much if you are watching this because I genuinely love this then I've just got a little plank from Ikea on the side I wanted this room to have a lot of greenery I am actually looking for a real version of this plant just like a bigger plant to go in that corner but a real one but I'll search for that another time this one is just from Mike as well and then we're still waiting on the door frame to be repaired but that will be added sometime in December I'm not gonna show too much of my window for obvious reasons but I don't have curtains or a blind or anything I am actually getting a blind fitted in December which I will update you and show you on the vlog and as we come round this way I've just got this little plant little ivy actually on the window frame I think that's so sweet I brought it back from death because this plant was dying then I've got this gorgeous chair that I found in HomeSense and the reason that I've got that there is because this is now pretty much my dressing table until I can find one that I like for my other bedroom so I'm just gonna sit here dry my hair straighten my hair do my makeup and everything and it's gonna work fine for now I treated myself to some lovely flowers I got some eucalyptus and some other kind of flower I'm not entirely sure what it is but it's really pretty and then this far as I got it from Ikea this one is from H&M home this angle looks so nice so moving down this is my IKEA dresser that I did a little hack on if you haven't seen that video and you want to see like what it looked like before and how I did this definitely go and check it out after this video but I think it looks lovely in here I've also got this lovely mirror this was from Habitat I think and then at this side I've just got my Julie Andrews book and a pot full of brushes the pot was from H&M home I've got a little candle that my brother bought me and then down on the floor next to my dresser I actually keep this plant pot full of my hair tools and it's really good to keep it in a plant pot actually because if any of them were warm when you put them back here it's not like plastic so it's not going to melt or anything so yeah I've just got all of my hair tools in there moving round I decided to keep the fire open in this room I have boarded them all in my other rooms because obviously I've got a cat I don't want him to go up the chimney but what I'm going to do for this one is I'm gonna find some sort of like a chimney blocker and though you can get them I think it's like a balloon that you put up there so that Nelly can't get up there but I thought that these tiles were too pretty to cover all and then I've got this fast from Habitat with some leftover eucalyptus a little jo Malone candle and then I've got this artwork the Bonjour print is actually pinched my living room at the minute I need to get a different print for there but I haven't found one that I love yet and I've got this hand sworn it from a shop called FY and then another little dangling plan I'm obsessed with these IKEA dangling blunts and then down here I've got my side table this is from yes just the Danish store that I just can never say and then on top of it I've got a light from Oliver bonus I got this a while ago but they do still sell it so I'm gonna leave it down below then obviously we come round and I've got my sofa bed I'm gonna show you this sofa bed as a bed at the end of this video just because to be honest I want to see what it looks like as well but this was from made calm it was the only pink velvet sofa bed I could find so I snapped it up I've got a little side table from the Danish store as well and this little rug from Wayfair and then above it I've just got this print of Vienna if you didn't know I absolutely love Austria and Germany so this was a perfect print for me to get I thought that just looked nice and it kind of tied the wood accents in and then we're back to the start let me know what you guys think of this room to be honest I think it's my favorite one so far I cannot wait to get my wooden floors in here they are gonna look so good they're gonna make the whole room look ten times better I think I'm getting them in January so stay tuned for that but here's another quick little overview of my room absolutely love it and now I'm gonna turn this sofa into a sofa bed I will be back this is my room with the bed out and I'm actually jealous of my own room I want to bring my bed in here and have it as my bedroom I'm pretty tempted to do that to be honest it looks so nice and cozy so maybe after Christmas we'll move my rooms round and make the spare room the other room who knows let me know in the comments if you'll be happy sleeping here cuz obviously this right now is the guest room and that is the end of my bedroom slash dressing room makeover let me know
