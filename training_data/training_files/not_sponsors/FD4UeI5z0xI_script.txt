sponsored by brilliant just over a year ago Apple announced the all new iPad pro gone was the home button and touch ID and the Lightning port Spanos snapped were half the bezels in their place was a true depth camera and face ID and a USB C port all wrapped up in a modern retro design language it was controversial at first because all that a 12 X power and liquid retina grace just felt so underserved by the iOS 12 feature set it shipped with that was 2018 this is 2019 and while the Adams have gone without an upgrade the bits have finally started coming into their own with iPad OS an offshoot of iOS 13 we've also seen some discounts now a hundred or a couple hundred bucks off the top as we head into the holidays and you can keep it locked to thrifter calm to see just how low it goes either way the question remains have we gone from super high price to slightly more affordable more importantly have we gone from bleeding edge hardware limited by software to outdated Hardware made functional at longest last or have we finally found the perfect balance at least until the next update let's figure it out I'm Rene Richey and this is the iPad pro review one year later and also vector the current iPad pro has what I consider to be the best industrial design Apple's released in the last few years I love the looks of both the Apple watch and iPhone but there's something about taking the bigger rounder edged iPhone 10 design and combining it with the flatter edge squared-off look of the iPhone 4 and 5 that just works so well I want it everywhere the smaller iPads the next iPhone hell reports the Mac books out of it like the shards of narsil there was some concern about the durability of the new design right after it launched some reports basically confused and conflated normal minor manufacturing deviations with abnormal unacceptable bends and breaks basically to separate those things out if the iPad pro didn't sit completely 100 percent flat but curved by whatever fraction of a tiny millimeter was within design tolerances it was fine if it came out of the box Bente buckled or broken though you had every right to go back and have it replaced immediately I expect Apple will figure out a way to make the design even more sturdy over time at least against anything but the excessive deliberate force we've seen in some videos but metal bends just like glass breaks plastic cracks and ceramic shatters so if you're clumsy like me get AppleCare Plus as for me my old twelve point nine inch iPad pro was ever so slightly curved within tolerances and I never even noticed it until I look specifically for it my current twelve point nine inch iPad pro is completely flat and it's never bent not a bit not over the last twelve months of being stuffed into a variety of daily carry and camera bags and used and abused at home on planes at coffee shops on the road in hotels pretty much everywhere and anywhere you can abuse an iPad so is my pixel four by the way still flat and yeah I feel the same way about this as I do that the ipad pro's promotion display is still terrific as well the dynamic refresh rate goes to 120 Hertz for super extra smooth scrolling and then drops back down for energy efficiency in less than the blink of an eye it's just so much better than how the pixel 4 is currently doing 90 Hertz very different implementations over very different technology stacks yes of course but to the eye just better I do miss real HDR though high dynamic range Apple bought into the whole LCD HDR thing with the previous generation of iPads Pro but backed away from it with this one which was smart they just can't achieve the deep blacks and sustain brightness levels the way OLED displays do and now that I've got not only iTunes HDR and Netflix but Disney plus an Apple TV plus and they're much better bitrate I want it everywhere last year oled still didn't have enough consistency for iPad sized panels and it's unclear how expensive those panels would be even if enough of them could be produced to handle the extra demand that comes from iPad scale rumours are now pointing towards mini LED though not to be confused with micro LED which is even still further out I don't know if that'll ultimately give me the OLED levels HDR I'm looking for or not Apple brands it is XDR on the pro display after all but I'm really super eager to find out because for the other thing the display is already fantastic especially now that the screen to bezel ratio has changed and you get to see so much more in either the same size space on the 11 inch or the slightly smaller even more portable twelve point nine inch after a year of daily if not hourly use I've come to feel like face ID on the iPad pro is both better and worse than face ID on the iPhone 10 series it's better in that the true depth who works from any orientation portrait and landscape top bottom left and right it's just how face ID is meant to work its how the pixel four is faced on lock works and it's how I want the iPhone to work but it's worse in that the current portrait position of the true depth camera is less convenient for me than if it was situated on a landscape side since everything from using it with the keyboard to watching movies to getting the most out of side by side apps keeps it in landscape mode I typically end up using it when it's in that position almost all the time and that puts the camera on the side and then I'm almost always blocking the camera with my hand at least at first when I'm using FaceTime forget about it the camera is so far over the side it just makes everything feel super goofy imagine trying to use a Mac if the camera was on the sign instead of on the top I've always wanted and been asking for the iPad to have the camera in landscape instead and it's even more pressing with true depth but on the iPad pro it's become more complicated as well that's because Apple has used the exact place I want it for the Apple pencils magnetic inductive charging tech and as we know from every transporter accident ever in the history of Star Trek two objects trying to occupy the same space at the same time just never works out well for anything putting the camera at the bottom where the keyboard would dock is even Huawei levels worse still I'd love Apple to figure out something better otherwise face ID on its own is still a terrific experience and one I'd love on the Mac books as soon as in humanly possible I know I must sound like a broken record looping stream whatever the kids call it these days but I still think the cameras on the iPads are under served all of them some worse than others the iPad pro cameras have always been better than other iPads but have never been anywhere nearly as good as the iPhones these were at least 4k 60 frames per second because the new iPad pros are so thin they've lost an element in the camera system taking it back down from 6 to 5 and lost optical image stabilization as well Apple uses smart HDR off the a 12x neural engine to compensate but like I said in my pixel 4 of you good glass + great algorithm still isn't as good as great glass + great algorithms so while I still love the idea of the big viewfinder especially for professional video work I'd still rather take a bigger camera bump if it would mean getting better cameras like actual iPhone 11 quality cameras I'm not asking for the whole 3 camera system I mean I would totally take it if it was offered but I'm not asking for it at least not yet but the pro brand has to mean something and to me it has to mean more than just being the best of the best at editing and outputting photos and video and has to be the best of the best at taking photos and videos - especially as we move into the next phase of AR now I know adding all that and keeping prices not only from getting any higher but the same maybe even bringing them back down is an incredibly hard challenge but hopefully that's something time and scale will fix the Apple a 12x remains a monster an absolute monster and I'm sure we'll get an A 13 X or whatever comes next next but even a year later this 8 performance for efficiency 7 graphics core with the knurl engine just crushes everything else in its class even things beyond its class including what intel is doing with its Y series silicon and ultralight laptops it's proven more than capable of handling every app and game I've thrown at it and with style about the only thing still holding it back from running the biggest and baddest Mac OS style apps is memory the lower storage capacity iPad pros have 4 gigabytes of RAM the one terabyte version has 6 gigabytes of RAM but that's the most memory you can get by contrast a baseline MacBook comes with 8 gigabytes and you can upgrade to 16 gigabytes the new 6 inch macbook pro can go all the way to 64 gigabytes likewise it can also go to 8 terabytes of storage and swap so fast it's hard to actually hit a resource limit even if you try as apps like real Photoshop start coming to the iPad pro and hopefully Final Cut Pro Logic Pro Xcode and more they're gonna hit up against that lower RAM limit and swap and hard yes iOS or iPad OS is very different from Mac OS and the silicon can throw bits around like nobody's business but at some point it feels like the memory even the storage options are gonna have to catch up with the Mac because everything else including and especially the battery life has been beyond terrific even when traveling and bad signal and roaming hits the radio like a ton of bricks it just keeps going and going at the airport on the plane at the coffee shop in the hotel everywhere it goes so long I still get legit surprised when 20 percent battery warning even pops up USBC has been likewise terrific not having to use a powered hub for hungrier accessories like you do with lightening iPads is just all shades of liberating I'm tempted to say I now want to USB seaports like the MacBook Air or better one on each side when Apple released the original pencil after a decade of using Wacom I called it the best digital experience I'd ever had no air gap no reticule no digitizer very low latency it just felt like drawing and writing directly on the glass it was also incredibly convenient to top up when you needed to though in an utterly ridiculous way that made it easy to lose the cap but there was no similarly convenient way to carry it around with your iPad you had to carry it separately like you would any other pen Apple pencil to fix the charging problem entirely the magnetic inductive charging along the top in landscape mode is ludicrously good whenever I stopped using it I just snap it back on the charger and the result is it's just always charged at this point I've almost forgotten it even has a battery but only almost because as convenient as a magnetic charger is and fun to fuss with in an almost air pods case flipping way it's not strong enough to keep the pencil too attached in my bag at least not for long it's not even strong enough that I really feel confident carrying it around with the pencil attached when I'm racing around a city going from meeting to meeting in stark contrast to the first pencil I haven't lost a single one yet but I'm still nervous I'm going to various cases have loops Samsung lets you jam the whole thing into the body Microsoft's latest lets you hide it between the keyboard and frame I don't know if Apple could inset the connection point create a stronger magnetic lock mode add something to the smart Keyboard case or just figure out the solution I never knew I wanted but I'd love for there to be some way to have my pencil and not have to worry about it falling off - other than that I am totally head-over-heels in love with pencil - it's the better best digital tool I've ever used with iPad OS 13 Apple has also managed to crank up the responsiveness which is sort of like Tesla telling you they've cranked up the launch speeds it's still more natural for me to draw an erase with different hands like I was trained to do in every art in design school since I left childhood but I do like and use the double tap to toggle between tool States it works well enough that I wonder about Apple adding more controls like the air pods Pro half so I could assign something to a long squeeze for example maybe even a triple squeezed media pause and play fast app switching has so many possibilities functionally the second generation smart keyboard works and feels to me pretty much the same as the first I still like that it's simple to unfold and protects the back of the iPad I still don't like that even though the back has a camera cutout if you fold it back to actually use it like a tablet it covers the camera and worse than the old model it puts the keys directly under my fingers which feels like bubble wrap and I can't resist pigeon with it I also really still like that you can set it at two different angles but not that you can't set it at any angle especially now that you can't put it in an easel mode like you could the original and I'd still love some equivalent to the software trackpad mode where I could swipe across the keys to move selection and the cursor that way I could truly work without having to take my hands off the keyboard and mentally switch modes back and forth the typing experience remains tremendous way better than any bit of molded taffeta fabric has any right to be I can work as fast on it as I can my MacBook Pro and since the mechanisms aren't exposed I've never had to worry about getting some water or even coffee spilled on it the first and second time I reviewed the iPad pro last year it was before iPad OS was even announced nevermind shipped after iPad OS was announced I revisited the iPad pro but it was still early days now almost six months since the first beta and almost three months since release I'm still drunk and giddy of all of its potential but I'm also a little more sober about its current reality beyond iOS 13 being buggy in general I've already done a whole video on that I still love that iPad OS is finally its own thing if for no other reason than if Apple doesn't keep up its momentum every year it'll be wicked obvious on the WWDC stage by its absence not that I want them to overload themselves like they did this year but well-paced with equal time to new features and paying down technical debt like Apple did with iOS 12 and I'd be in heaven total tablet Evan with iPad OS we got a ton of new long time coming features this year including multi-window eng for every app it works really really well with a persistent consistent anything you can drag you can drop into its own window mechanic but I still find the execution of that mechanic the getting in and out totally gesture overloaded I still trip all over myself all the time between having to swipe twice for the dock and miss triggering the drag gestures to get apps off the dock and it all just really needs something that doesn't cause so many collisions so always I'm clumsy yes but the software should absolutely take that into consideration I don't know what the solution is maybe separating the setup from the usage date might work either way when the windows are set up and I'm researching on one side riding on another and swiping messaging in and out when and as I need it then well but I'm cooking for those specific tasks because of the way it still imposes focus maybe even more productively than on anniemac it'd be even more interesting if I could have slide overs for each side and pre-assign apps to them so they could just pull them in and out whenever I wanted I also love that the new files app lets me access pretty much anything local external and server side but it still feels a bit like wading through water compared to the speed flexibility and accuracy of the finder on the Mac yes still it's a huge improvement over what didn't exist before I just hope Apple keeps iterating on it sidecar which lets you use your iPad as a second screen for your Mac has been absolutely transformative for pro workflows I can dual screen with Final Cut Pro 10 pretty much anywhere any win which means I feel like in this studio even when I'm on the road desktop class Safari has been terrific fixed everything for about 99% of the websites I ever go to the new font system though which is tied to apps even three months later still seems like a problem that needs to be solved there are a few things though that still remain on many lists for example will Apple push things like multi-user support further than just the classroom context it's currently limited to or if I'll get my guests bored so I can pass some on my iPad without giving them access to all my personal data and if and when we'll get those mobile centric versions of Final Cut logic and Xcode and more that really light these pro atoms on fire with full-on prolapse all that said iPad OS is still absolutely the best thing that's happened to the iPad since the iPad pro and if Apple keeps pushing it forward the way they've been pushing iOS and watch iOS forward I'm super optimistic the rough edges will be smoothed out and faster than they ever would have otherwise if a lot of this has come off as me being super critical about the iPad pro it's because I need to be while Samsung makes great tablet hardware Android is basically given up on tablet software while Microsoft makes fantastic Windows laptops there's still traditional Windows laptops with detachable keyboards more than they are any true tablet experience like the mp3 market was basically an iPod market the tablet market has become basically an iPad market and the current iPad pro is amazing as it is easily tied with the Apple watch for for the most amazing product Apple made last year and while Apple has repeatedly proven they can compete with themselves the more feedback we can give them on doing just that that even more amazing products will get so just one year later it's impossible to overstate what an enormous leap forward the redesigned iPad pro hardware and updated iPad OS software really are it takes at original vision for a sheet of glass that could instantly immerse you in any website any app in the palms of your hands and makes it as close to manifest as the limits of physics seem to currently allow it takes portability power capability and creativity to a whole new level and I still think it's just the beginning if you haven't gotten one yet for you or yours take advantage of the holiday deals while they last and then Thanks brilliant thanks to all of you for supporting the show so that's what I think about the iPad pro one
