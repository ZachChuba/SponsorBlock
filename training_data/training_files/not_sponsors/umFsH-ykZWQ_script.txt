lot lot lot lot better so I'm risking 10.8 Mel Witt Fury's edge he has no armor no way yo that's innate yes oh my and there's no way I'm so lucky I'm so bad he axed me as well cuz I only had a zedzee yes now that's what I'm talking about 17.3 Mel definitely not the star was expecting I'm not gonna complain though I'm not gonna get too carried away because these people are so good I am basically a whale to them especially with the name like Pro PK double oven yeah we're second is he best of a 15% off let me put a banger so I was watching a skill spec stream and he was off to go steak or to make things fun he teleported into the duel arena on a PvP world and he had a bunch of noobs attacking him so I decided to go there straight away to see if I could answer was any of them [Music] looks like they didn't want it but that's when I realized a familiar face see engineer must have had the same idea [Music] [Music] [Music] fancier completed there's no way see you into me down I don't even think he knows it's me I speak at Bank of him there's no way gathering your Third Age brimstone ring hmm that's what I like to see thank you see engineer 21 mill this guy stopped fighting me because he thought I was too good what I buy for changed my name to told us that will he fight me now yes yes I'm gonna get him now you must be under estimating me I'm the same guy base all the name toll Vesta and now we're gonna take his 17 mil almost our food here yes yes yes get in there that's what I needed yeah I'm banking there's a lot TV is about that's what I like to see 17 milk [Music] I've using a speck so I need to try and benches yes what the help your eye actually good him wow this is actually working really well oh no I think we should be good I've got food on the ground as well I actually

actually broken I mean that'd be massive karma if I died there cuz I always TB people 17 Mel this should be interesting I've got a wrist fire on the piety account torture risk seventeen point six mil I think I might prefer this because the AGF spec is scary and Plus obviously we don't hit as high like we still hit a ridiculously high above ah big mistake there shouldn't no better not say Sven's like that [Music] [Music] yo he tried telling oh thank God for that give me that money back looking back in that clip he actually could have tallied but I know exactly what he did expect and his instinct was to tell e it was too late to realize that there's a delay on the tele I've done that plenty of times 16.6 more risk Carol d h AG asterisk fight [Music] no did he just air 59 on my HP I'm so unlucky and I want to change that name eight this game doesn't like me it's time to lose the bank um Bank in the AGS pulling out the prims 37.5 more risk yep yep yep seems legit it really does now
