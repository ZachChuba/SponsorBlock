for 10 weeks 20 runescape content creators will be competing for a massive prize along the way they'll face never before seen challenges brutal eliminations and a couple of twists welcome to the gilanor games so i bet you're all wondering why you're here i have no idea why we are here i'm tired and alert soup has been keeping us in this cave for days with no food no water i really hope he has some good news for us welcome to redemption falls all of you have technically been eliminated from the game but i've brought you here to tell you that you have a second chance every team here has a chance to get back into the main game and compete for the massive grand prize there's always a twist there's always a twist i knew there'd be a twist in this season of the killing or games but i was ecstatic to find out that the twist would involve me and eliot potentially coming back into the competition and there's one thing for certain we're getting a second chance and we will not [ __ ] up our second chance we're doomed we're still doomed this is still the end but we get one last hour by the end of today one team will have earned their chance to get back into the main game to be that team you simply have to make your way through the redemption falls gauntlet starting in the order you were eliminated in every team will be competing versus another previously eliminated team in a series of banning challenges the banning challenges will be a mix of eliminations from the current season the first season and some brand new eliminations we've never seen before the team that survives the redemption falls gauntlet will earn a spot in the main game's elimination for next week nobody knows this is happening after this there's no second chances you lose and poof you're gone not only can game and collect your reward i was over the moon getting a second chance is good i wanted to experience some more challenges so even if we don't win just being able to compete in like two maybe three more challenges i'd be happy with because i feel like we got cut short you know since the banning challenges today will happen in the order you were eliminated in evie scape and skiddler 9 rain and flutten your teams will have to win 5 straight redemption bannings today for a chance to make it back into the main game so without further ado let's get started come on up guys man when i found out we were up against nine rand and flutten i literally punched the air in excitement because i knew this was an easy dub because like if nine reigns so good why is there no ten range for the first redemption banning you guys will be playing spawn camping each team will be sent a list of the same five items that have a spawn location in the game the items are going to be scrambled up into an anagram so you'll have to unscramble the words find the item and bring it back to me the first team to bring me the correct five items wins the banning and stays in the game loser goes home i'll meet both teams at the dual arena and we'll get started this challenge was an anagram challenge we had to figure out what the anagrams were for specific item spawns in the game and then go and find them luckily for us skidler and i oftentimes on stream we'll do riddles and puzzles and stuff like that so we've had heaps of practice in the past i'm actually a little nervous on this i was fine but like i've been nervous from the start it has so little to do with your daily runescape playing that i think the advantage goes to whoever's playing a new account or whoever has started the most accounts the first team to bring me the correct five items from the spawn location survived the first redemption banning here's the list good luck okay so that's the mind drain again mind rune lumbridge uh uh harpoon purple dye garlic spade yeah so we actually had a strategy because flatten seemed to be better at the anagrams i was just quick on the trigger with teleports while i was running she and i would both start solving number two and number three um what's the second one a harpoon i'll get the popping you get the garlic uh serious village okay okay um garlic and seeds but that's not a mind room that's a knife and a dye purple dye so my surprise i'm very quick at solving anagrams i was happy with my performance on the on the anagram solving i was solving them and reading them out and jake was making sure that we had the correct locations for each one basically i was reading the mouth and then if i got stuck jake would help oh it's uh in the house yeah did you say you'll get the spade and i'll get the purple die yeah yeah i'll get the spade you get the purple die yeah and then i'll get the harpoon as always we just went in and completely winged it i thought i was gonna smash this challenge and as soon as we got the five words within the first three seconds skidler had already solved all five [Music] [Music] cool i'm going for harpoon where was the harpoon oh no wait that's that's the spawn spawn is only fishing killed oh no how do you get the fishing guild i'm running there um i'm in sears i'm running i feel like we didn't strategize very well at all it was kind of just like we saw the list and whoever thought of it would blurt the word out and then someone would say i'm gonna go get it so i've got purple dye and garlic yep and what have you got mind ruined space eight hundred i'm going to get the harpoon now okay i'm at the door arena already for you all right cool you trade me the items okay so i tell you to the jewel arena first and then i was waiting for him to tell you in and i was thinking man i know he's so close to italian but if i see nine random flat and sign up i would be so pissed so we're 90 seconds into the challenge and we have all five items already at this point i knew we had it in the bag all we had to do was get to the door arena trade over the items and take the dub come on teleport it there yeah okay we've done it right we win yeah listen so it's as simple as this mate we went out in the first round because that [ __ ] evan put us in the elimination challenge and i tell you what we might have to win a whole bunch of challenges to get back in this thing but i am coming for that ass kevin i tell you what i am coming for that ass no way it came down to the wire i think what really ended up mattering was the order that you did them in and it was something that you couldn't plan because you were solving the anagrams one at a time so you just had to be quick on your fiend i liked being able to fight everyone go against everyone it was fun i liked it it was a good experience even if we lost evie scape and skittler survived the first redemption banning great teamwork and communication nine random flutten your time has ended here on redemption falls oh my god i'm just glad it's over jesus christ that would have gone i did not sign up to this season of gilnor games just to get thanos snapped again bro what the [ __ ] kemp q and poison potion great to see you guys again it's now time for your redemption challenge versus evie escape and skidler this is great i mean if if we can get it back in there and have a chance to not do a nightmare boss for an elimination challenge we might actually have a chance of winning this this is our second chance as long as we play to our strengths there's a big chance that we can make it back into the main gillinor game group for this banning we're turning a challenge from the main game this season into elimination you guys will be playing ready or not aka runescape hide and seek this time though we're simplifying it no point system a best of three the first team to find me and have both members trade me win the round so the first team to win two rounds survives the banning alright i'm going to head to the first location and as soon as i'm there i'll send you the picture and you guys can try and find me jake and i are [ __ ] idiots the initial plan was jake goes i'll get all the teleports you can brainstorm and then he went wait we both have to trade him we're [ __ ] i came in this piece with the worst preparation all right bro this is red we can do this poison potion yeah we got this we got this man we're the best explorers of gilanor starting this off i'm already the weak link i have really bad observational skills and sometimes can get lost in my own hometown which only has about 4 000 people in it it's very small and it's a very sad thing right away i'm thinking this is not going to be good for me i hope kemp is going to be able to help me out in this regard and i just don't mess up that big that's drainable our first thought immediately was that's draenor village and we both decided to teleport there straight away except i don't know how to work a glory so i ended up in edgeville somehow okay i'm going to draynor village i'm going to go sauce all the houses out why am i in edgeville not draynor village um draenor trainer manor i don't know my first thought was um i'm gonna go to sears village i'll go to draenor you go again who is hardcore people oh that's poison potion i'm ahead of him i'm ahead of him oh my gosh he's here then yeah at draenor i'm like right behind him [Music] on my way to draenor manor i actually saw skidler so we both had the same idea we went down inside of dracula's where you fight counter con i think he's going no it's not here nope nope nope it's not here okay a table and an altar that has to be north of falador with those amarak wines he's here we won running running running yes easy peasy dude nice guess man that's that's sick when he said that it was here and that he saw soup i was so relieved because we take round one and it takes a little bit of pressure off our shoulders especially mine considering i knew this whole thing i probably wasn't going to be too much of a help now we're gonna win two nil bro we're gonna come back yeah the reverse swept we're zero one down in the redemption challenges we're already one round through we were the first out of gill in all games and we're just sat there saying imagine imagine if we're the players to go out in round one and make it back into the game you know that's how we pepped ourselves up what the hell is that oh we're all just so confused oh that door wait there's a weird door there is a weed exactly what i'm saying yeah where the where is the weirdest thor i'm going to go artie and i'm going to run across the hazelnuts house i reckon the thing is so i'm a giant loser and as soon as you sent that door i said that's hazel miss door like that not even a question that was the easiest picture you could have sent i spent a lot of time at hazelmere's house me and hazel me used to go down the gnome strip club together so i knew exactly where it was like we're never going to get this from the first picture anyway so we might as well just make a hail mary right yeah yeah yeah i'll join you i'll join you at hazel man then uh yeah try watchtower watch tower got it i just i don't have a towel really teleport so i'm like the closest leg lasso at first i had absolutely nothing i couldn't think of an area i was just we were both just kind of standing there stumped we had nothing [Music] i don't know why hazelnut's house is [ __ ] ringing sucked a bell but if this is it no i don't think it is wait that looks even more like hazelnut's house it is i'm here he's a hazelnut he's that hazelnut okay i'll be there in two seconds i knew where hazelmur's house was i knew there was a fairy ring right outside hazel mia's house i knew that yanil was the closest city to hazelmere yet we both ran from ardoine that's how [ __ ] flustered we were imagine they both rock up a fairy ring just before i get there i will actually let's grow as if we got that from the first picture bro there's no you got it well you know let's [ __ ] go elliot come on oh the reverse sleep is [Music] as soon as i saw his character relief and i knew now that we're up one one you know it's even we're gonna take this out one to one we got this bro oh yeah i'm kind of nervous jake bro i am literally shaking that's how bad i want this bro the redemption arc what a story what the [ __ ] that what the [ __ ] is that i don't know what that is i'm going through the lighthouse i don't know yeah i was going to do the exact same thing uh ring configure anywhere no idea miscellaneous that's what i'm thinking okay i have no idea where this is i'm just gonna go with somewhere that i've been to very rarely because i just don't recognize this place at all so my first thought just under the kingdom of miscellaneous that's like my best guess cause that's a place i've pretty much never been to i honestly have no idea um caldergrim sure try that bro what the [ __ ] is that yeah it's so weird maybe it's in the dk maybe it's like water birth mmm i have no clue bro bro i had an npc or a player like what the [ __ ] is that that's an npc where who do i swear if he says round bottle is that like a whiskey bottle yeah yeah i think so that's why i said keltogram because the uh area also looks i don't remember ever seeing that woman before yeah right that's a witch yeah i've never seen that npc before where are you in kerala that looks like some karamjian rum as well yeah for real for real for real where's karamja uh okay i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the karamja teleport spot on the um glory there's rum there's a karamjin looking character we need to get to karanja straight away and we both ended up at the teleport spot looking for the guy that sells the rum is this i'm so stressed man 100 bro they've got to be saying the same thing there's no way no one know like anyone knows what this is if they oh man if we lose [Music] [Applause] [Music] what is that pool and gnome goggles like what where i've never seen this i'm gonna go to um i'm going to go to trollheim i'm going to try witchhaven right next to the right of arty right yeah right next to artie teleport i've never seen that mpc in my life i don't know who that is she's wearing a power amy and there's a chair behind her and after that we were just completely stumped we had no clue i hope they're stumped as weird as a chemist of sorts who the [ __ ] is that i don't know man it's impressive maybe no no no where the [ __ ] is that it looks like it's in like there's a seagull walking next to him i remember saying to elliot there is no chance they have any idea where this is because neither of us have seen this in our entire life so i don't i think we're good here i don't think they found it [Music] where the [ __ ] is that oh my god it's um yeah i know exactly what how do you get that missed oh yeah they're covered right spirit spirit spirit um very very uh spirit tree uh grand exchange uh and then go to uh mitzguild uh yeah mythic guild no not that far north not that far off okay right yes in the middle follow me follow me follow me and then go to the right to the uh to the east once you once you teleport there i found it i have never been on such a roller coaster of emotions it was elation it's corsair cove we're on our way then it was oh my god poison potion is here i traded him i had no idea how to get to the corsair cove poison potion told me to use my fairy ring which i didn't know the code for so i just teleported to the myths guild right away because i i wasn't sure what to do i can see the pool on the map i can see the pool in there don't be there don't be there don't be there don't be there don't be there there if escape just got here i got there first i see evie escape come in and i'm thinking oh no they know it too please hurry please hurry thank you so much tried him trying to drive let's go oh my god you can't write that [ __ ] bro [Music] ah damn it yeah he got here oh well oh man that's brutal i mean we were given another chance here and we screwed it we screwed the pooch that was close eeveescape and skidler you guys won the third round by less than 10 seconds congratulations on winning your second redemption challenge so here's the thing mate you know you say you've won the redemption arc is gonna happen it's never in doubt you know what i mean it's going to happen at this point we've won villainor games kemp and pp this is the end of the road bye-bye bodie and skill specs can i just say that it is amazing to see you both again heartbreaking elimination in the main game but you have a chance to redeem yourself here and get your revenge on torvesta and dinner honestly soup i was out i was completely ruined after letting him down man i was feeling pretty bad for myself i was like oh no how could i how could i mess with this system this bad so you know knowing there was a chance for redemption mate it was it was it was all looking good bro it was looking good from there i think obviously adam is a very versatile player in old school runescape and skill specs has a terrible reputation as somebody that planks left right and center he's just you know although that being said i think skill specs is genuinely an underrated player don't worry there will be no lever pulling in this banning for today's third redemption challenge you guys will be playing two is better than one each of you are going to have a budget of 20 million gp with that money you need to buy a gear setup to defeat not one but two jads at the same time there's a couple of restrictions though you are not allowed to use the blowpipe and you are not allowed to bring food the team that averages the fastest time to kill two jads will win the redemption challenge and be one step closer to getting back into the main game by the way if you happen to die during your attempt your time will be set at 10 minutes for that run as usual i wouldn't recommend dying i've killed jazz all day every day i understand how jad works chad is an extremely easy npc to actually kill but the moment you're not two jars i was a little worried because one i had never attempted two jads in my life go ahead and get your setup sorted and you can start the fight good luck with the two jads it takes a bit more skill to make sure they're not on the same tick if you decide to melee them now melee and the jazz is going to be more dps than range given the restrictions put in place i thought we'd play it cool we'd jump in with a range set up and do that i'm flying in let's just do this so soup told us our challenge was going to be two jabs at the same time the two jad challenge that recently came into the game and as soon as he told me that i got out of my chair and hit an orange justice skill specs up against two chats so i went with a safe strap where i was like okay range can't go wrong it's decent it can get the job done and it should be okay overall carol's bow's the shell we have 12 15 mil left over and then jay again announces one carol's bow two amulet is down three band or squad sword okay you do it if there's anything you need to ask just ask it and i'll explain it very calmly rule is make sure you're just constantly focused on jack good luck i mentioned carol's super i don't know it's something about me and carols i mentioned carols i think maybe that'll be fresh strategy you know it's under 20 mil and instantly it clicks within adam's head that that's a good idea you know he's like oh carols and i mean if the damn that sounds great carols and a bgs actually would be a faster in the situation of killing jabs [Music] so it's going in the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to kill the north jab first i'm going to spam clip this divine potion really proud around attack mode hit it like that beautiful and then off i go let's see how good this does okay hit the divine yep okay good spec the north one run away now change your prayer to his attack get it rigged i've cracked on the ruby bolts for the first two hits what do you reckon yeah respect i'm glad you said that don't switch back coming up against the two jazz i was super confident considering the fact it took me 163 tries to get my infernal cape i've done triple jabs more times than i've had hot dinners so two jazz absolutely no problem managed to trap it so i only got one healer hitting me for the first one oh that's really nice so i think the most important thing is just not to become complacent just one lapse of concentration you can die in one hit so yeah just making sure you're focusing the whole time is basically where to not go wrong this is going well though holy [ __ ] this is disgusting bro your strategy is amazing oh those healer spawns with these jars there's five healers to hit these healers also hit way harder and way more accurate so these ones are tough so you have to kind of block them through jab if you can at any point oh no no ignore it relax no relax relax i watch adam do his first you know that pumped me up to do mine and i'm like oh god there's no worries you know i you know watching adam you know he makes it look easy right it's a it's a walk in the park for him for like no no sweat at all the whole time he's drinking pork he's just making it look easy bro really good spawn holy sh that's clean ish that's really nice if you don't know how to do multiple jars there's that level of panic which is that same feeling of like when you do your first fire cape but imagine doubling that immediately then also putting the galino games on the line and knowing everyone's going to watch this in whenever this releases there's a lot of pressure that's on it that's first job dead nice yeah me too oh wait i'm one hit off that should be first dead there yeah both going in we can say we were confident but it was late night over in england for elliot and it was eight o'clock in the morning for me and i just come off a massive bender over the weekend so i was still hungover so i was confident about my ability but i wasn't confident that i could see the screen properly [Music] i don't know what i'm doing i step out underneath the jar and they're both attacking me at the same time then soup adam's like you need to off tick them and i'm what what is what is off tick them i don't know i couldn't pray that i can't pray from both i'm laughing i'm laughing because that is so good for the video man it couldn't be any worse than that mate without the same that's all she wrote mate i'll let the ginger down again and he's laughing at me the whole entire time whilst drinking pork it's the video we'll see he on takes the chance it's easier said than done to optic two jacks like it's very difficult to get the moment he'd done that i knew it was game over i know my time might have been good but it's not good enough there's no tricks here with the healers and through the jab jab views beautifully to make sure i'm not in melee range it felt like it got healed a lot there to be honest look at its health oh dragon crossbows back hit 39 baby nice got here let's trap on the second one i'm about to finish i didn't think it was going to be this amazing you know what i mean we just gotta hide the [ __ ] skills died yeah for real right three minutes three i got three ten just finish it up clean beautiful clean 343 bro beautiful now that was a good bgs hits as well oh so nice job you guys one team completely outperformed the other eb escape and skiddler you guys had an average time of three minutes and six seconds boating skill specs because of a team member's death on your team [Laughter] your combined average time for your run was 6 minutes and 52 seconds i'm really really happy with both mine and jake's performance i'm glad that we beat both of them because i think we were kind of relying or at least expecting skill specs to get up so bad that we would win on an average to beat boat's time as well congratulations evie and skidler you have won your third straight redemption challenge to all the guillotine game watchers out there man i love each and every one of you and i'm sorry i let you down i uh i really hope torvesta loses that's all i have to say sylvester and solo mission if they go out and they're not winning i will consider myself a winner body and skill specs you uh yeah you tried your best two redemption challenges to go you guys are putting on quite the run here not bad simple as this soup i've said it before and i'll say it again we're the two most handsome runescape players in the game and not only are we extremely handsome we're both good at pvm skilling and pk we can do everything but to get to the final redemption challenge you'll have to beat the incredibly handsome duo a framed nc engineer come on up guys i was excited i felt like i had a chance to come back and win the money i feel like i've done very good this season and i think i have the potential and deserve to win so here we are with a second chance this is kind of ideal since i want to be able to get back in and knock out solo mission but we are going to be going against evie scape and skittler two people we initially sent into the banning in the first episode we went out in the first round of the gilanor games because framed and c engineer put us up and they said they're putting us up because they think we're a threat you god damn right we're a threat today things might get let's say a bit tipsy because today's redemption challenge is called buy me a drink [Music] both teams have 10 minutes to collect as many unique alcoholic beverages from around the game as possible it can be from a shop a spawn point an npc drop anywhere you can get it the only place you can get it is from the grand exchange or from another player once time is up or you're confident that you've collected as many as you can both team members must trade me at the dual arena to complete your run the team that collects the most unique alcoholic beverages in 10 minutes will win the banning and be one step away from getting back into the main game if it somehow comes down to a tiebreaker where both teams have the same amount of drinks then the team that traded me first wins ah great a drinking challenge and all we have to do is go against an australian and a brit two of the world's most notorious drunks i'll give you guys five minutes to prepare and the race begins all right you ready for this baby so we got a couple of minutes time to prep jake and i both sat on the wiki page going through all the alcoholic beverages available in old school runescape so each of us had like a pretty concise and succinct quest guide essentially to go and collect as many beers and brews as possible i found a new list here so the strategy that tom and i had since we're really not alcoholics is to just look up all the drinks on the wiki and kind of just figure out and plan the most efficient route since we have to get as many as we can on go three two one go go go go go all right black helen i bought it i've just picked him up bro [ __ ] okay he actually just bought all the stuff from me elliot i bought ten of one of the pre-made things so uh frame couldn't buy it good i'm i'm buying literally pre-made wizard mine bomb i literally just gonna hop worlds yeah that's cool leave escape that's cool all right so miscellaneous next how the [ __ ] i'm getting there starting off in valley buying some three you can get three different beers here josik isn't it that sends this trade this guy sells everything right this guy sells everything jake i've got gin brandy whiskey vodka everything yeah i've got all them as well okay elliot i've just made the biggest play of my life what by [ __ ] blocking kev yes bro so for today's challenge we had to run around the world picking up as many alcoholic beverages as we can and if you know anything about skidler and i we love an ice cold beverage i'm bloody bracer please might have been quicker if i just hit the arty clock i don't know [Music] oh god there's an iron man talking to me hello hello sir at the very beginning of my run a cute little iron man stopped me and said hi and there's no way i could ignore him so i had to tell him how kind he was you are so kind i should get a start to continue with this challenge yeah just a beer something a bit fruity something some kind of local specialty alvin here you go cool thank you all right carol so now i have to go to miscellania [Music] there's a bottle of wine and a jug of wine all right rona give me your stuff i don't see her in the bar here three you know what i may as well just i'll go to draenor right now while i have the time i'll get my head kicked in by vampires so you have vodka right i can drop my vodka yeah i got vodka gin whiskey and brandy oh no way no way no way no way oh please tell me i have the vian noble in the house uh okay i've wasted time here al because you need the via noble my run was as smooth as sandpaper i had everything i needed to get mapped out before i went on the run and all of a sudden when i went to go get the bloody bracer from darkmeyer i had to get via noble clothes which i didn't have so i was running around like a headless chick and trying to grab that and that stuffed me up completely because i forgot to go to karamgar and get the karamjin rum have you got a normal beer by the way uh no but i am gonna get a normal vi okay uh just grab one if you if you're there if you've got one i've got a beer i've got a beer we got a moonlight all right i felt like we did very well me and kevin i knew it would be a nail biter as we came to the end i was very nervous i think it could go either way pick a beer wait okay nice manny won't give me the [ __ ] beer keg uh i'm just getting a bandits brew now i need sammy wine and then i go into can i'm going to counterfeit quickly to get the moonlight mead and then zombie wine uh i was satiano yeah okay so i'm gonna go to relica right now wait no you want the relica too i'm gonna go to pawnee beach right you want the relica yeah cool grug all right let's go to karamia you know some people don't know this but you can if you grab a banana and then buy the coramia rum oh nobody around nobody asked i'm telling super and the viewers not cool kevin not cool oh are you gonna make a uh a banana thing you can make a banana you're making a banana rum yeah cool good job you're smart so so so now you asked yeah man you know i love you what the [ __ ] thanks racer uh some kind of local specialty perfect okay uh i need to go to yanil there's moonlight did you get a green men's ale by the way yes i don't know you were whining about something yeah because you can also make it as goldy nail by the way i am now at the jewel arena is there anything you need me to get uh no i'm just getting the last one did you end up getting the tag uh the keg of beer no no maybe google had to get that actually i realized when i was back at the jewel arena that i had missed one drink um it wasn't actually on our list it was something that both of us had overlooked so while jake was running around trying to um sort out the last couple he needed i was on the wikipedia page going right to begin this did we get this did we get this i realized we were missing one okay i got a blood punt i don't think there's anything i missed nice redemption banning guys both team successfully collected 30 unique alcoholic beverages so it all comes down to who did it faster we were tied on beverages at the end so if i hadn't got that beer that would have been a loss by a beer can you imagine losing because of no beer seven seconds separated one team from the other seven seconds with a time of 9 minutes and 20 seconds the winners are i can't believe i'm saying this eeveescape and skiddler [Music] i said in my first confessional in our first redemption challenge that i was coming for them framed in c engineer they're the reason we are out and now we get our revenge and let me tell you something how the [ __ ] does that feel congrats guys you know i kind of figured we were going to lose this challenge from the beginning because as i said before we are going against essentially the most alcoholic tribes in the world so what what chance do we stand all i was thinking is karma for taking them out in the first round first challenge first video of guildner games and maybe i shouldn't have been nice to that iron man you guys have won your fourth redemption challenge in a row i've also just received word that both of you were completely hammered during the banning as well which makes it even more impressive you are one banning win away from winning redemption falls framed nc engineer there is no denying that you guys were fan favorites but it just wasn't meant to be see ya it's final boss time jimmy unsettled come on up when i was told that we're being put in the final redemption challenge my hopes are pretty damn high i have to repent for what i did last week and messed up the shields i'm here to play it today my my hopes are high i was excited because i felt like when it comes down to it being settled have a lot of experience of clutching we're good under pressure so i figured we'll pull together we'll take our blindfolds off maybe turn our brightness up to like 25 on the monitors and uh maybe we'll find ourselves back in this is a big redemption challenge if evie scape and skidler win they'll have five redemption challenge wins in a row an absolutely insane story but you guys are going up against the powerhouse team of jimmy and settled who i'm guessing are itching to get some revenge on those who sent them in here skither and i have made it so far in this competition from such a deficit going out in the first round we thought it was all over and to find out we're one win away from making it back into the competition i am so excited the winner of this banning will win redemption falls and officially be back in the main game for the final banning you'll be playing alphabet soup [Music] very simple challenge today both teams have 10 minutes to finish as much of the npc alphabet as they can every time you kill an npc it checks off that letter on the npc alphabet so killing a goblin checks off the letter g killing a chicken checks off the letter c you get the point your goal is to check off as many letters as possible from the alphabet as fast as you can the team that checks off the most letters in 10 minutes will win the final redemption challenge and will earn a spot back in the main game you know i was actually glad that they had been there that long because they're probably exhausted and that works for us those two they've got a bunch of tricks up their sleeve they work well together they're not going to survive this many in a row there's no way um and we're missing x and q which are impossible and only n and uh nikolai i can do that one as well okay cool all right sweet so i have n we literally have every letter so as soon as we finish right off the bat what we prioritized is killing the monsters in the fastest amount of time possible we both thought that there's a high likelihood that both of us get 24 monsters killed it was just who's gonna kill them the fastest so we prioritize monsters that were as close as possible to a teleport location and then also decided to see how many monsters we could chain from that one teleport location and just see how many things we could do at one time there's nothing for qrx in the game there's one thing for q that yt hercule i can just run in and do a quick chat bang pop him down a half hp that [ __ ] pops out kill one skidler and i started this challenge like we start every single challenge straight to the old school runescape wiki you think i keep it in my head i can't remember my own birthday let alone the starting letters of npc's names alright this is it the final redemption challenge go [Music] come on and thank you instantly bang all right got myself a bird oh no this poor dude's wood cutting with it i feel so bad i'm so sorry man all right you done i've i'm going i'm going i'm going i'm going win no way what the al farcers aren't called elf archers there was a big mistake at the start of our run for eve we head down elf so i teleported to the iowa camp and unfortunately the elves there are called ironworth archers not elf archers so we were out on e straight away and had to brainstorm in the middle of our set uh we can figure something out on the run save that for last say that for last [Music] [Music] the man is dead [Music] the woman is dead nice the one good thing about me doing all these nostalgic series ideas is i spend a lot of time in the free-to-play areas and they're very overlooked in general so i'm thinking of like remington in that area of things there are so many random ass npcs around there in such a short distance i was like there's got to be like everything there and sure enough there was there was a route so efficient that i think i had knocked out like 12 or 13 of them in two and a half minutes or less something like that oh wait i've got the maritime legs i don't know i might have them so i'll check i've just got an earth for you okay i'm gonna save that for last uh johnny the beard he's in box square johnny the beard is then blue minion yeah yeah yeah i hit a nice little uh what's his first one there beef bigger [Music] uh how is that okay just run forward to the uh white arena place i felt like i literally could not be going faster everything was clicking i was hitting on the monster as i was taking care of everything that was on my list i was pretty much like halfway done with my list in the first 40 seconds it really felt like we were not gonna lose this [Music] all right call fight dead let's go to nada uh we do it's a spider i'm killing ah i've killed it i've killed a ram for r instead oh it was just on the fly make sure you're using your prayers as well oh yeah forgot about that all right liz it's done you're dead where i got next there was no strategy involving where we were going on the map we just picked the letter for every monster figured out where it was and teleported there immediately i'm on a maxed account so i've got teleports all over the game and that's a big advantage we have over jimmy and settle i know that's what a big frog oh there should be yeah there is a frog it's just a regular frog i'm gonna be done with my list in like two seconds if you need help let me know where to go no way i can't attack the penguin no way i can't attack the family all right [Music] under chicken i'm gonna go i'm gonna go do this [ __ ] um this jad can you like quickly brainstorm something for v the rest of the run went smooth as a butter and i was sure we had this in the bag the only monster i saw in the game that started with why was the healer from jad and there's no way either of those two are going into a jad run so the letter y gave us some trouble but thankfully due to my arbitrarily restricted mauritania locked ultimate iron man i was able to remember a specific villager in cannafest named yad vega and after killing like hundreds upon hundreds of those villagers that name stuck out to me and i knew that was where i was gonna go it's right near a teleport kuril portal send it and we knew that they would probably struggle with the letter y have you gone all the way to the ogres yeah oh [ __ ] the zogo's are back yeah yeah it's fine i can i can telly and then just fly in okay after this kill i'm done okay i'm here are they there nope oh this chad's going to take mad time in this gear bro but that's the only one in the game it's the only one in the game [Music] trade him all right we got we should win we got every single thing yeah that's the beer that has to be everything we got everything except for q and x which i'm gonna double check real quick i is there anything we're missing other than q and x uh no oh um or e no you already did that fire didn't you so we got there really early we got there so quick and i was so happy to see both of us get there trade you and be done and then we're waiting there and we're like wow this is awesome you know like a whole minute goes by they're still not they're like this is so cool this is great do you want to go over the monsters in alphabetical order real quick we're sitting there we're like uh let's run through everything let's let's double check stuff so uh we start running through the list a b c d all the way down uh we get all the way down to t and i was like t thug you're gonna do thug where'd you get you get the thug and he goes no t you t i didn't have t i have you for having k up here you said you got something thug or something no no after about two minutes of listing down every single monster think of everything we've killed we realized that we missed the letter t something happened miscommunication i don't know what it was but i decided to just teleport to edville right away not even think if i've killed the tea or not and i go straight to edgeville dungeon and kill a thug okay grab the yt hercott here we go come on let me cook this so i go to the jewel arena uh yeah this is our last one right uh-huh there's nothing else jimmy's here jimmy's next to soup jimmy's next oh they're here oh no way or skidler is while he's gone skidler gets back i'm sweating dude when i saw skidler get back i freaked out i almost didn't even want to tell him that they were back so he wouldn't be panicking but i couldn't help myself like he's here all right i'm killing this vampire driven and then flying in you can't kill them without a avandus flail i gotta get one i gotta get one hurry dude if we lose because of a thug i will be so upset flashbacks happen the shield all over again bro it's the oak shield all over again but this time in thug form okay jelly bag playback oh we can't kill them anyway you can't kill them i'm just coming declare they go into a cloud and disappear i mean i guess that's technically dead right [Music] they've missed one i beg they've missed one well done both teams for completing a tough final banning both teams successfully checked off 24 letters so it all comes down to who did it faster and that team was jimmy and settled let's go baby thank god i let out the biggest sigh of relief that we finally are done we beat them congratulations guys you have earned yourself a place back in the main game honestly i i kind of feel bad just because of how insane their run was from the very start to wipe out every other team that tried to beat them like it's honestly impressive and uh hopefully we can redeem you guys maybe you can live vicariously through jimmy and i now eeveescape and skidler what an absolutely amazing run in the gauntlet a single redemption challenge away from completing the miracle run a very respectable effort simple as this soup we had the hard run because of one person and that's frame he's the reason we're in the first elimination challenge and guess where he is out of the competition because of us as far as i'm concerned we've won i don't care if we got back into the game we took out the guy that took out us and that is good enough for me next season we're coming back swinging unfortunately you know what happens next settled in jimmy you were out and now you're back in next week you'll be placed into the banning against a team nominated by the golden apron winning team i'm sure both of you are ready to shake things up i'll see you there we're back i felt good it felt good size of relief around the board just and we're back and god damn that's exciting i had been thinking about re-entering the games like revealing ourselves for a week straight just thinking about it tanzanitosa i mean i i understand it but at the same time i don't because why would you not get rid of solo mission you know why why would you not do that you chose a strong alliance and jimmy and i are here to end it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] by downloading monster legends you're
