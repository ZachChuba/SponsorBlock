oh that's hot that's hot so yeah on the last episode jagex decided to dump a giant rock on my head and that would all be okay if it didn't have a level 90 mining requirement however a lot of people have said to me limp you don't have to do this grind this these stupid rocks they're not chunk specific you can just roll on a chunk and be on your merry way and while that might be true i don't want people to look back on the series come back to this episode and think to themselves what are you gay i said i would do everything in a chunk and i will do everything there is to do in a junk so yeah let's just call this a little side mission and a little integrity grind regularly scheduled autism so i have to get from 70 mining to 90 mining which is a huge grind it's about 4.6 million xp in mining which is around 131 000 iron ores and yes i am going to do this with iron ores they are not the most useful ones silver or gold would be much more useful but with my black pickaxe iron is the only thing that's that's that will work and that's sort of useful and yes i'm also going to bank all these iron ores power mining would be so fast just power mining iron from 70 to 90 might take like 100 hours at most but i i just i can't throw them away i will need them in the future for smithing or fletching or something yeah it would be stupid to just throw them on the ground but that is kind of a problem because banking is the our karat bank is the closest one if you disregard the pvp world bank chest in lumbridge but that one's not really viable because i'd need like 20 coins in my inventory at all times which would mean i lose an extra inventory slot and in the long run that would not just be a lot slower so here you can see the route i'd have to take i'd have to go from the bank to the iron ore back to the bank and all in all this would take around 3 minutes and 40 seconds for one inventory that means that over the 4 700 runs i have to do i will spend 290 hours going back and forth and mining iron so that's it right i'm absolutely [ __ ] i'm going to have to spend almost 300 hours mining iron or do i i don't have access to cosmic runes so i don't have rings of jewelling but what i do have is my defense cape which actually acts as a permanent ring of life which can be used infinitely so if i can find a way to keep my health low i can get back to my spawn point in lumbridge the ring of life effect activates if your hp goes below 10 of your maximum hp level which in my case is 8 hp but the problem is that your health regenerates at the rate of 1 hp points per minute so i need to take damage to keep my health low otherwise i can't teleport back the problem is that the scorpions in elkhart mine don't hit that high or too often so that wasn't really working i did try it but uh i would just stand there for minutes trying to wait for them to damage me enough to teleport so if damaging myself didn't work maybe there's a way to stop myself from regenerating health at all and as it turns out you can stop yourself from regenerating if you flick a rapid heal before you regenerate an hp point it resets to your current hp so with that issue solved i could start mining i thought i would just run from the bank chess in the pvp world do the iron catapult inventory hit a scorpion and get myself teleported back the only problem i had was that i that i didn't have enough run energy to actually reach the iron ore i would run out just before entering the mine which is kind of a problem because that slowed it down so i actually decided to get some agility levels so the way that agility and run energy work is that every five or six levels you'll get into a new bracket where your energy will replenish faster i'm now level 70 and i want to get to level 78 i'm not gonna go to 84 because that will take a little too long for my taste but at level 78 my energy will replenish 30 seconds faster from zero to 100 percent energy which might just be enough to reach the iron rocks so i had to do around a thousand laps on the paul nitinis course along the way i actually got 1250 total level and this was not a bad grind because i get like 40 50k xp an hour and for my account it's like a lot so yeah i finished 78 and i was finally ready to see how fast i could complete one inventory of iron and as it turns out i can now get a full inventory of iron and bank it in two minutes and 20 seconds which means that in total the grind will now take 182 hours instead of 290 hours which means i just saved myself a hundred hours of walking back and forth so there are four pvp worlds i can use obviously i can't use the free one the british one is too crowded it's like 250 people online so they'll just kill me and have to like get my health back to four there's also the australian one but that's really low ping for me because i'm in europe and so i'm using the high risk one which is an american world but it has decent ping alright so that was [ __ ] stupid this is a high risk world you drop everything when you die and now i lost one of my black pickaxes some guy the guy that killed me actually picked up my black pickaxe and now i can't pick it up anymore oh damn it ah still have another pickaxe but i didn't want to lose this one alright so i'm [ __ ] pissed so i'm going to fletch 10 000 bronze arrows and see how i feel afterwards nope didn't work i'm still pissed 72 mining and have started mining on the aussie world the ping is [ __ ] but there's only like 40 people online so the chances of me getting killed are practically zero 75 mining achieved pretty cool the black pickaxe is kind of slow compared to a room one but it's actually just as fast as a mithril pickaxe which is kind of weird but right i calculated that at the end of this grind i will have given 47k to these cards which is kind of a shame i need money pretty cool i actually found the shooting star on the pvp world it's a pretty low tier but doesn't really matter i'll just mine it and see how much dust i can get and how much xp per hour it's worth so i got around 200 stardust and the xp per hour is 5k or something so not too great i actually ran into sleigh brother at the mine we had a little chat he did a very similar grind to mine but with a bronze pickaxe so cheers bud oh a clue vein lead clue i don't get many of these because i have a lot of glue scrolls banked wilderness not going to do that 30k iron ore stack is starting to look juicy but it's not worth a whole lot some dude killed me in the mine so i'm about to kick his ass with a mithril scimitar alrighty ran away he's no match for my weaponized autism level 80 mining can now get the level 8 stars pretty cool just 10 more levels to go gonna take a little while 50k iron ore banked we're getting a pretty nice stack all right so i just got 87 mining and uh i'm calling it quits here for the video next time i'll get uh level 90 mining but i haven't uploaded loaded anything in about a month so i want to upload something for the channel so i can keep you guys a little updated yeah um almost a 100k iron ore oh and you guys also like to see my age of this account like how many days i played 111 days it's like 2700 hours you could max an account in that time i'm pretty sure but with that being said i'd like to thank you for watching join me next time i'm gonna get 90 mining and roll a few new chunks or one i don't later
