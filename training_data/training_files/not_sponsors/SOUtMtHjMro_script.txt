Oh has this incredible gift of smiling I'll be driving her in the car and I'll turn around and I'll see this incredible huge smile on her face she's just so happy and so at peace with life and the way she gazes at me is like nothing I've ever seen from a doc before she is 18 year-old rescue and she's known as grandma pop I picture a poll on Facebook little 11-year old old girl who's sitting behind bars Animal Control with just the saddest little look in her eyes but a smile on her face decided to rescue her her family dumped her at about 10 or 11 years old I don't know much about her backstory other than every time I touched her she flinched it was heartbreaking we thought she was going to be a hospice foster because she was already so old she could hardly walk she was very icky she was really bad at interacting like a normal dog what are you doing out there you're supposed to be up there so she kind of watched my other two fin and penny learned how to play with toys pone definitely knows how to be a dog now hi everybody here we have Finnegan honey hello miss hello grandma Paul meaning penny keep her so young he's a jerk isn't he just make sure every morning on our way to daycare that she bathes penny and Finn she loves to clean their ears for but they kind of just sit back and let her do it because she's got a very motherly instinct to her we found a really great game carrots and they get to go and hang out there during the day definitely pleases the other dogs there you guys are messing up my snow piles she's the first one out the door in the morning and she's the first one in the house and flies up the stairs to have her dinner so I know she's feeling great it surprises me very much how active she is for 18 years old clothes making up the lost time absolutely and we make sure that every component of her life physically mentally emotionally and socially are all as good as we can possibly provide for her and because of that I think that's why she's thriving and I think that's why she's lived as long as she has senior dogs are the greatest dogs and I think everybody should give a senior dog a chance because you won't regret it they're just such a gift you know it quite honestly they're pretty low-key and they're easier I think than puppies rescue senior dog it's probably the most fulfilling thing that I've done in my adult life I know for certain pose grateful that we brought her home bo is an absolute miracle dog I don't know what I would do without her I thought I was gonna have a short short amount of time with her and she's absolutely my best friend she's just the greatest gift this right here is the most pure form of love that I've ever seen in my life like
