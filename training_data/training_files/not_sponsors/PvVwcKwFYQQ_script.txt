all righty folks welcome back to another episode of eggs or eeeh as always whatever floats your goats and lots of good times so I am gonna be trying to make a thing that's gonna hopefully make our lives far far easier potentially maybe if the power system works because it is something that requires power is the only potential problem oh why did that break well there's the prep there's your problem right there well why is it there's a oh yeah that'll do it that'll definitely do it though the wire appears to be not wired how and why is this the the our last not going what do we need to do to make that go and also how do we dump the aluminium oK you've melted aluminum in here I don't think it goes into the caster let's make sure there is some iron in there so it looks like it's eight nuggets so let's clear that out and see if that will work okay and yeah okay cool so it doesn't here's that simple cool nice because some of them don't yeah but would have melted in the first place if it didn't work I feel ya know there's like cobalt and are tight both don't work in the middle caster but do work through the smelter bizarre alright so the right sound furnace is working again and is the nicer of the two okay cool cool as necessary so that's good alright so what are we working on well I have to continue to work on the void miner thing and yeah that's that's always a very fun time you're having fun that's what's important absolutely you know but yes so the void thing and then I'm also gonna be working on another thing in the hopes that it does do good good things great things you might say even if that goes well it could be great would would you say that I would even potentially say a thing like that huh okay well I hope it goes great then thank you thank you thank you yeah so what am i working on like I need to give my assignments to me you need to give your science to you science all right so there's all this automation stuff there mmm and you and then shoot its moistener and a squeezer flowers i'm moistener we got sturdy casing copper gears and glass that's pretty even hamster casings yeah I'm hoping that we got some more mystical flowers that I might be able to dig in oh yes yes indeed Lee - oh no no indeed Lee don't what the heck why did that happen why did it do that well are you okay is everything all right did you get hurt I broke me hey tall gray thing and it didn't give me anything you need to use shears whoops I made a boo-boo I've made a terrible boo-boo so on the tall ones II use shears and on the small ones what you do is you break them into petals yeah and then you can plant the petals and you'll have a little glowy glowy grass and then you bonemeal the glue glue a grass and it will then become the tall ones which then you use shears and you can get more petals and that's how you create gotcha but the small ones I can punch with my fist yes okay that's see that's why I was confused that's why I was wait do we have shears anywhere before I make new ones I have some but two ingots I would say just make him okay oh I didn't check my cast all right so um yeah there is so I can break the small one and then replant bonemeal it yes okay and you'll you'll be perpetually satisfied you can you can continue your I don't know dude yeah it's it's one of those things it's like it's not a big deal but it's just like constantly a big deal that every time I have to go undo what whatever random thing is you know you can right-click on what if you right-click on the text field it is clear this is it yeah that's nice yeah it's like JDI it's that's nice yeah I've never I don't think I've ever done that in jei either but still that's nice do that then oh there we go that's easy-peasy wait Twyman gray flower Oh tall guy gives four see now okay okay so there's moistener squeezy squeezy glass in tin okay that's easy too mainly because I've already made the okay cool we have got many rays now mini greys mm-hmm okay [Music] Capitan over here with his exposed wiring I gotta leave my signature somewhere dude yeah your signatures getting replaced Wow I can't believe you would do this I spent so much time putting down that wire I don't believe that's true I believe that's an all statement all right cool cool cool cool very good very nice is very nice is there a max number of relays IRA or things I can do I wonder I do not know the answer to said right away sir you know I know you don't well okay that's very rude bro no no it's just I knew that you didn't know it's a rudeboy I'm horribly you're like at some point and I have to like change this into an MV I'm kind of stacking up the wings for the main these pieces okay so now I am going to be able to hopefully be able to make our lives a little bit easier potentially potential meant a tangent meant a well then she all meant they that's a word is definitely a word Potenza bridgestone potenza okay here let's do this - Eyal Frick that's a yeah you got exposed wires out here okay so I got AC I gotta leave my signature somewhere oh he's giving me crap and he does it himself you literally have to jump to hit that one yours you can walk into that was the difference barely dude what are you even on about one being where you can get it and the other one where you can't you can see that over here where we walk where you might I insulated it Oh [Music] what are you even doing are you okay ah balls I forgot to grab the catalysts that's rough I feel like they don't like each other yeah that's not true oh I'm very high dude wait hey do you want to not what I'll let you take a look and see I needed to work on the windmills so how did this take place I don't know not sure what happened oh my god it's a weird why what's the point you're sabotaging yourself it's not like I'm the only one who has to go up hmm what it's not like I'm the only person who has to use the elevator you know sometimes you got to make sacrifices okay cool the heck Oh I'm like looking around at the cuz I'm by the windmills I'm like I hear electricity it's okay do you need a panic wow I keep getting hit by your crap uninsulated wires stop jumping right there you literally have to jump to hit it yeah I want to go fast how do you fast by jumping okay okay man this grumpy man's right here can dum-dum wow you block one elevator and this guy just is I feel like he doesn't like me anymore well some people just want to watch the world burn oh we are out of redstone which is quite problematic because someone might have made a stack of redstone servos I actually have it how much redstone does a redstone servo take one oh is it that's a lie a Brooke what you use two stacks of redstone oh my god hey you've got a some redstone on you right now because I like you anymore thank you thank you uh-huh appreciate you yeah uh-huh who's the dumb dumb now yeah I got you I got you um okay here's the new plan there's there's gotta be a new plan here this is this is untenable okay I have ender pearls now I have four of them I've been carrying around for a while I've been kind of hoarding them I didn't want to tell anyone that I had them but I have four ender pearls okay I'm going to make a ender chest or and and enter pouch so that I can go collect ash and send it straight into this dang thing without me having to run back and forth and that's gonna be a thing and then we're gonna have all the ash we need okay that's all that's in a story um are you storing your connectors in this one yes you are yes and then do you have on any wire I have two on me right now and I have one insulated yeah oh you know I have insulated I do not have insulated oh well I guess this is just a good we can check and see if it works before you insulate you know and when the other one went the hopper alright so the way this is I mean it's pretty straightforward but redstone furnace you know there's just a furnace we can build some augments to speed it up here soon but then it outputs to the factorize er which then takes the Nuggets and converts them into ingots oh wow alright good sorry I just got really distracted by like holy cannoli there's hot things going on here oh my god oh that's pretty cool alright need some stone already you who has the bane of Call with you oh it's over here not wrap what is not routable mean what hmm you appear to be making noises crowd noises okay there rejoices are being made trying to try to search for all the modular storage systems there's a lot of stuff Jesus Jesus Jesus there we go that's a good one there's four of them right no wrong wrong wrong sometimes you just ronk all right and then I needed to make pistons okay I have no slabs nor do I have cobblestone did I don't know wait is that - that might be too far away uh you know what let's just move these a little bit closer and make life easier potentially I like the potential of easy life Oh actually just move this one closer so you can go in there and then - 18 and in there I'm gonna need 10 right click oh my god where is it this is the worst freakin thing two three oh it won't find it it won't find Oscan again I literally just put Kabul in here oh there it is you stabbed Kabul why are you where are you the way you work I mean I can how do I know I just star these what okay I need two levers I want it I want to just I want it to just show that good ones how do i just show the favorites I'm not sure what this is doing I just want to show the favorites whatever we'll move it to the top I guess and and okay I'm making these how do I remove everything else press R after selecting the bad ones there's a lot of bad ones oh my god oh here we go we just remove all of them like that and there's a trapdoor I keep getting slightly spun around you've been talking to yourself for about 10 minutes now uh just just a lot of clicks that I have to do here a lot of just a significant amount of clicks that I have to do oh my god seems like a lot of clicks there's just so many inventories around here it's insane okay whoo we did it we got a trap doors good is that in it is it one of the different ones where did this come from they would know all right so now the question is say I want to make something from one of these let's say shears can I make shears if it is present in one of the inventories it is oh that's brilliant oh that's brilliant now all right cool so what is something else that I could potentially make so I wanted to make some stained glass panes gray stained glass panes could do oh wait those are in my inventories that doesn't really matter and does that mean that I can do this okay okay it's pretty cool this is pretty cool we're good we're good sound sounds like it's a lot yeah it's pretty cool you made it sound like a lot so hey let me let me show you something let me show you something it might it might greatly help us out it's a mite it's a pretty cool thing I would I would actually have to say it's pretty cool okay then my stone I mean just a quarter of a second almost done one ingot [Music] okay what are you showing me come over here dude check this sucker out so it's called a storage scanner you click on it it has everything in all the different all the different things we get you just use that one so basically we have an Emmy system now which is pretty cool and I'm just gonna throw everything in it throws it to the first routable available container when you shift on something and yeah and then if you have a recipe that you want to make and you have it in jei and you question mark it it'll just use all the available resources and you'll be good to go so we can now throw everything we have into the various inventories it also works off of just chests in the nearby area so there is that too but I do like the modular storage ones a little bit better me too so um I'd say life has definitely improved quality of life is is up for sure it's alright now you can get some freakin aluminum medium aluminum in iam okay and then I need the well it's gonna be fun is us trying to make and work at the same so we might end up wanting to make two it's a possibility there's a chance that we want to make two of them although wait are you typing no type doesn't show on my end nice so we might be able to wait okay try crafting something try crafting something with a question money yeah that shows dang it so that's the only limitation I guess but we can search at different times for different things how do I put stuff in just shift it just shift it and it goes into that blue and the bottom in the bottom left-hand corner oh yeah it's because there are multiple different storage devices that's the auto way otherwise I think you have to manually click on one and then you can add it directly to it I see yeah I need a bunch of random stuff okay so pipe know what's the what's the embers item pipe isn't yeah yeah mmm okay brilliant I love it so now I need to make more connectors and stuff actually is it I've always said you need to make more connectors and stuff a structure frame theour one that I must make interconnects okay and will make many interconnects have two eight sixteen interconnects okie dokie eight sixteen ethnics all right I'm up to 22 structure frames so that's pretty exciting yep good good and how many did I need total again 24 is that actually true no I have no idea you're right what the heck Wow I don't understand okay so two more don't be so amazed at my brilliance there man and structure panel requires air so that requires a connector so Frick so we need eight I want you woah but I can't filtered can I wait I mean I only need 14 of these is there a better way than then BuildCraft to pull items out of compacting pull a specific item out of a compacting drawer I know nots yeah you know I've really focused on the ideal situation which is to not be using that and instead of be using the good-good I feel like you're fundamentally doing or talking about a different thing but that's cool no no what I am talking about is that I've you know focused instead of on drawers or focused on the true the one in the only ME system which we have okay so how can that ME system accept an input of the ash particles and output an ash block into this good question I don't know it but I'm sure you can figure it out yeah dude hey Alexa set downstairs 274 kind of it's kind of getting a little chilly up in here I hope that I adjusted somebody else's air conditioning as well do you know or is that Lily like that's it's a pretty warm yeah I know because I want it to turn off I want the a/c to turn off but not be like also super cold at the same time so you don't have your heater on or super warm same time yeah I'm just shopping I got I don't have it on dual mode I never run my heater my gas bill is very brilliant it is very really much brilliant many well I can't think of any way to do this and that sucks I do need the more stick do we have is there a generator that uses power not that I really want that dynamo what are they it just takes our F oh wait this I mean I guess I could make that power they extract her put a tank on it we have what is your what is your gas bill get up to in the winter my gas bill is fine it's my power bill in the the summer that gets a little scary oh my power bill in the summer gets gets pretty nutty too that's that's at one time but ya know mine is your gas bill in the winter it's not bad I think it's 60 70 bucks oh okay it's not it's not horrific it is basic tinks do we have that we can expand on if any I mean I can make that but that's not that great oh I don't know what I want to do I don't know the best way to go about this I don't know how to do what I want to do when I'm looking for mmm yeah I know the field you don't know the feel yes I could do and we have a pump that uses an extra oh okay well that does use an extra if you alright you are right you're right you're right it's only two more of those yes we are out here we are out here I earned it now we're like really low on two interconnects brilliant this is this is a very nice machine I like that machine it is very nice isn't it I'm talking about machine but it's so fine don't have iron that's what we don't have iron but I'm fixing that there's some iron no wait no I got a shift click it click yep there you go now you have iron wait nope mother Frick why have you done this into the cauldron there we go I got my cauldron don't worry about it mmm I was worrying about it how did I get bacteria I end up with weird random stuff okay that can all go in there oh god we need more iron rods well yes I will be smelting a bit Oh the blocks of iron it's burning dust mmm it's oh wait I can imprint rods right right right all right what are you trying to do I just need some rods some the old iron rod scoodles which I believe I can get just use you can stack them yep that's what I meant I can press some dude and how many do I get per rod rod come on baby no usually not okay let's see I I don't know on rods I know gears are for I guess I'll need twice as many of these cuz I need an end thank you mmm I get - yeah - yah Oh God so hold on every single structure panel requires four iron bars I need 20 of them's that's a iron bars whoa-hoo which means I gotta get 5 times 5 times 6 is 30 so I need to chuck 15 is that so 14 sounds about right alright a lotta ayran going in dude a lot of our ongoing in get old I Ron going in going the IRA I'm math to that properly that's just not gonna work cuz its gonna dump weird random stuff out I need to dump specifically that that's my plane everything everything hinges on that wait did you need a cauldron cuz I think I collected one and now I back in there uh just you can just put it in I did I did I put in a sound situation good into the system brah its it's gonna I feel like we're gonna lose some stuff as we get used to having to shift quick answer things what do you mean I apparently it's just dropping him down on the ground so what I I made it cauldron I tried to insert it in and then you said you picked one up so I'm guessing that something happened to make it just drop down no I might have had an axe I didn't realize if you know you had an accident I had an accident uh I don't I don't know I don't know if that's what happened or not but I don't think it's dropping on the ground come on come on there we go oh we need to do we need to do craft so that makes it to where God dang it what's wrong God dang it freakin ah sniped away my my recipe again what I don't know what you want from me man I'm doing the best I can salt we're missing basalt it's not in there cuz it's in the drawer it's right here buddy all right we have a lot of assault all right a lot of assaults better have that base all breath sorry about the sniping I'm not that sorry but you know okay I did it you can have your recipes no I'm good I've already made mine all right now I got what I need all I need left is Frick come on poppies all right so frickin laser beams that's two more connectors Balzac's two more connector ball sacks I gotta connect two more ball sacks together and then all right settle down area clear laser lens what kind of laser lens would we like to get what color do we want to begin with probably clear okay too soon all right like the thing to do all right you can do okay we already have some that didn't I make a grinder that grinds for me I know not what thou hast done I can use that in the way of orange we do have orange okay so I turn that into that and fátima dong not shoot okay regardless irregardless and that's why I killed him your honor unlived him would be the proper terminology all right so why do I need to use that for each petal you can make dies with these Oh pesto in order we're going on important stuff I've got to make sure I get my color scheme just right got it I got a laser core good and then the final thing that we need to do is I guess make I guess we'll start off with the clear laser so sounds a good little me gosh darn it stop taking my okay what do I need all right I did it wink and a bowl no it needs to laser course it needs to laser cores how dare you oof you hate to hear it happen I love to hear it happen cuz I just made another one we have the resources we were all ready to go easy pretty cool sounds pretty cool oh god now I need to frickin build it yeah yep okay digital guide and assembler I remember this what do we have invar okay we thirty sixteen gets that's good you know apparently getting out of search into jei is a trick that I don't know yet uh manic I can't remember do we need to have a straight shot to bedrock for this thing to work I don't want to say yes okay repeat IPPY do we do it in the misty world I don't have an input on that but I bet you do mmm somebody might even put it on me what does that even mean oh it needs power mmm needs a lot of power so I guess let's do it in this world then cuz this world contains power okay actually probably doesn't matter what world right cuz it's mining out of the void so I mean you still gotta get power to it though right right but I'm saying that means we can do it in this world rather than having to wire a whole power set up in the misty world you know yeah yeah okay oh yeah Frick dude we just do it at embers yeah bro peace ok key and then I need the redstone pour ember borer so neglected so not you guys I is it all right so uh we need a big space for this a oh there's you've kind of started to mine on a big space this that's nice I see the way that I need for lava ahead of you and help you out and I don't think you did it with the intent of the void miner that's all I'm trying to say he the way that I helped you out there and definitely wasn't with the intent of the void miner but you know I know I knew that there would be we need space and so I was helping you out regard you didn't really though you dug a tunnel I don't really know where the tunnel was was going to but it's a pretty great tunnel I don't know why you were disapproving of the tunnel because it's a pretty great tunnel question is how big of an area does one need for the void miner mm-hmm it's like oh boy hi oh my god it needs to be a 14 by 14 by 13 yeah that's what I was saying it's big that's big and there's a lot of lava down here too so that's gonna be very fun this big place gonna make me wait fun ski doodles yeah yeah why don't you make a hammer okay no that takes a billion resources magmatic okay oh there is an upgrade I think that you can do with this thing does leave a lot of stuff but you know we're just things happen no you're gonna upgrade the ex pickle so it does do a big mining thing but anyway it's whatever rail and stones transmission is it whatever it's whatever bro whatever you know alright so transmission magmatic how's your weekend going if you've done anything fun um well my I was gonna say my weekend's over but I guess it's not yet well you got an extra hour of weekends that's pretty I do I did I used it for the sleeps everyone does with it I can see that party games were fun you wouldn't know you never come that's fine wow wow wow wow and had had to take it there wait no don't do that oh Jesus oh Jesus I hope that didn't break anything I heard you do break a thing what are you barely there was an inventory here with coal that it was able to pull from and I was trying to put down a torch and instead I clicked with my ax pickle and it started doing a Chuck mine so hoping that didn't break anything up on the service that was too valuable everything looks okay and for everybody saying use the chunk miner ah that's a no can do because that starts at the surface with the highest blocks available in the chunk and then works its way down so that's a no can do if you just want to line the bottom magmatic okay extraction simple item filtering right heck is this thing we is this big enough frontier one I wonder wouldn't Diamond fluid right it is okay yeah well star was this yes hairdo ow I shocked myself on hero cable all right so this there the real question is are we gonna have to like go all the way up to a tier six thing at some point because that that seems large and expensive I mean you know that's a response I guess it was a response I've responded um is it possible to ensure that the server you know still runs while we're off because I feel like that's gonna be kind of a necessary thing as having the server run for well we're afk and then that way we'll just have this thing kind of kicking in the background generating lots of resources so the next time we get on it'll be like wow look at the progress that they made by not doing anything you know yeah yeah yeah no sounds sounds about right mm-hmm I thought you'd think so okay well here we go [Music] this is enough space wait what why you do that nope oh wait oh four blocks I oh but I you know I just realized what did you realize that we have to get power down here and that might be problematic maybe it is but just better to mine down all the way from yeah maybe it is I mean there's a reason that there's a channel down there so that you can maybe run it if you want there's a chain but you know that that mind that that tunnel that I ran which comes from our based all the way down to there oh I mean I could just do it from the I could just mine at the top right I'm pretty sure we set this up in in septic I think from the very yeah ya know as long as it as long as it's got a view it doesn't matter where it is yeah the laser can be as long as you want it to be yeah I don't want to do that many wirings that's a lot of wirings it seems like that's a lot of wiring all right I'm just do a quick run to bedrock now Frick Oh Frick you're frickin Frick thing it it would your your whining would mean more if you didn't have one down here yourself like if you weren't doing it if you were the only one doing it then that'd be one thing or if I was the only one doing if someone was to listen someone's doing something listen all I want okay if if someone was doing something that would be something but they're not so stop telling me something if someone was doing something that would be something but you're not doing something so stop telling me to do something yeah okay you got it I'm so glad you paid attention for sure dude first you're for sure dude I figure out the best spot to do this cuz it's definitely lava or right under here that's our base okay there's the ash Bock and then I need the ender hearest I might down Bernie him all the things and I have Bernie I thought I made enough for you maybe I didn't he did what if I fall into lava doing this then Rippey dippy yeah that'll be a bummer mmm that would be the first time that we've died in this wouldn't it yeah that's never happened before actually I have a water bucket so it'll be fine there's no way that this could go wrong okay okay that sounds ominous how do I get leather gotta risk it gotta risk it for the biscuit wait oh how do you zoom in on the mini-map usually is usually it's plus okay let's see no it doesn't work is it that plus oh it is well it looks pretty lava free all right oh I do need to get back up it's a good point it's a good point um I can I can fix that no no I don't have the work stoned uh no big money no love a big money no lava that's for sure dude that's for sure I really have my works it doesn't see there's a lot of blocks to have to learn down Holy Mother of God Holy Mother of God all right so no no no stop this stop stop you idiot what did I do now he didn't do anything it was just his being dumb you always accuse me of things all right all this planning has come together now I need some black bag I have to have lightning reflexes you are the lightning reflex I believe in you I need your feels though I need your feels can you feel the love lava tonight I think you know everything I think we're oh my god I got lucky on that one oh my god I got lucky on that one what are you doing that's so dangerous uh I was digging straight down Wow yeah it was good you know there's there's a single rule to Minecraft really it's just kidding let's just sit here I'm a Tron Oh [Music] oh and then I think I actually have to break that torch otherwise it might think interfere with the pathing incoming GRU there we go I did it I did it is nice is good he's nice he's good Wow seize the pouch hope so there's that titties ooh we're actually gonna be able to get a whole bunch of diamonds now is you're gonna be necessary to repair my pickaxe because of the upgraded steel condenser which makes mega mega amounts of resources per each activity that it's performed how do you dye the pouch I do not know isn't it don't you break click on something and it picks it up I know nots the answer is usually yeah I know okay trust me I really look to you for answers Wow geez this guy is ruthless my god [Music] wait yeah what the crap where did my stuff go mmm couch off chest I mean I granted wait well weirded concern here is I don't want to die oh I can blow me back to white if need be bro where did my void controller stuff go I have no idea where okay good your boy controller stuff is I don't even know what your void control stuff is back like I had it in my inventory uh-huh and now it's gone what what the heck oh don't do oh my god that doesn't make any sense at all doesn't sound like it makes sense oh four blocks off the ground right right okay man gravity wait did it start making this thing clay maybe the assembler did absorb it weed that was fast okay cool such childlike joy all right now wait what the controller this here is top of machine up bottom right there and then this here nope don't do that what shoot these items required that are we serious it actually did it just got rid of everything that I had nice nice that's cool so um I have no idea where I'm just gonna give myself the resources it bugged out and like they disappeared or something I have no idea what happened what happened like everything that I just made just got I didn't put them anywhere I don't think seems more likely they were put somewhere but no don't think so I really don't think so all right so if I were to come over and find some leave oh yeah I don't I I never placed any of them down I never I don't what holy crap fire I don't know why everybody cares much about the storage get like I'm just gonna give them back to myself I don't know why is some something bugged out all right I never scan I mean if you give it to yourself and then if you find it later and just delete those and everything's fine yeah here we go one no it's hurt they're gone it's all gone boys something happened where we dropped employees panel does not exist yeah I don't know how that happened I think the assembler has a bug like absorbs the resources and then yep okay oh shoot oh shoot God dang it it just unfavorite of them nice this is why okay this is why I didn't want to do this this is exactly why I didn't want to do this okay so in theory should be able to put that there [Music] wherever right now but someday when I create a pump I can pump on it how it built it under the bedrock that would be funny that would be funny now wouldn't it all right yeah let's let's just give ourselves some stuff real quick um yeah what was it again me for 22 24 20 into oh wait yeah no yes maybe you need to make sure that the ash box are moving earning wait am i Opie I don't know I mean I can't tab and auto fill anything so damn it why isn't that working nope hey you mind giving me permissions on the server its power right there thank you I know you don't trust me very much but you know why that's power why in the world is that not working that one I don't get don't know either dude I mean it could be worse I could have lost all my stuff and have to be crude you know creating it in right now but okay it's not my fault that the thing just eats all your item is and throws them out of the world if you accidentally click on it at bedrock level I mean Jesus of course it needs to be a BuildCraft engine what I can't you just why do you have to suck hey dude why do you have to suck okay nothing in the last few minutes ever happened there's an energy power thing for you to accept yep it definitely built it under the bedrock okay yep all right cool cool we got ourselves the old void miner all right look at that now we need to attach an inventory to the top of there right this is can that power that oh no it needs power it needs power yeah we made these at one point woman Kinesis mmm inventory and from the side of joy okay all right let's try this it's cool because now I need to lose everything that it's done all right now oh this work no no of course not first night okay just thinking trying to think through a problem of crafts doing me a bamboozle is it so what what exactly are you trying to work on right now I'm trying to get it so we can collect ash and have it auto feed into all the system while we collect it okay so that we don't have to bring it back and drop it off and all that for sure I need to because we only get the ash I need to have it automatically convert that into the ash blocks and I got that working to where we can send Ashley and we get the ash blocks out but now I and the compact and drawer turns into - box but now I need to fill through the ash box out which I can do but I can't get the power to work on the extraction pipe just yet there's a thing I'm missing and I don't know what it is yet mmm okay so there you go you're all cut up have a good day I think you just need to use an engine and not a dynamo which is dumb and I don't like it okay so um let's see we need to get more power I guess oh wow I forgot about that we could set up a bill grant quarry a quarry out all the ash oh really yeah I mean quarries but I mean I particularly want to alright well that sucks mad Ducks head sighs my docks dude it does there's some serious duck suckage here uh-huh like you're taking my ducks seriously ah nuts now you're okay nuts and ducks and just everything sucks you make me feel certain sort of way yeah oh good I was making sticks it's not like we have enough sticks uh how how much range does an LV wire relay or wire have on its own about 20 blocks or so okay probably will need one really just given me thank you and I need levers see we got it out yeah but then I knew going oh you have to do the best part is I keep hitting my hitting this right here and I can't do right now but yeah yeah yeah see ow ow ow I haven't run into that one so yeah I've been running into the one you run into so maybe it's our respective problems okay ronk Wow Wow okay that levers I've got engines and not dynamos I'm even gonna try to keep up your freakin aesthetic here thank you mm-hmm I've got some killer aesthetics of course you do right does that work at least although I'm gonna I'm gonna bother you one bit with it I don't know I won't it's cool wait don't bother me don't you beep on me boy mmm good this is definitely more efficient than lava generators Oh God dang it right happy with that glad that turned out the way that it did yeah oh yeah feeling great Oh show hey put that away alright I think this episode has been dedicated you think it's been dedicated to kidding this entire thing to getting ash going there we go here we go here we go here we go and then in the moss and the moss one more and the Willis work yes that's what ask me how alright is powered ladies and gentlemen we have a powered void minor thing I think I don't know if there's a way to know if it's actually working at the only issue uh we have to wait and look for something that comes from it don't you yeah it did it's working we got a cobalt or dust oh thank goodness we out here nice Wow really yes it's your fault at some point it says more about you than me I like to go fast okay the only way to go faster than more about you than me sometimes you got to go fast okay sometimes you got to stop and take it's easy mm sometimes you got to go fast okay so anyway you were saying I was saying that I am collecting ash and dropping it in to a pouch while I'm out collecting ash and that is remotely dropping and and feeding into the system and everything is working as far as I can tell I haven't come back and verify but you might it might be working potentially everything appeared to be in theory everything is working correctly so which chest oh it goes into the NHS cool and then the ender chest into the compacting drawer okay and then the compacting drawer feeds into the SIVs ice if should be running right nice yeah the sieve have some some ash going through it cool so yeah I mean it's just again it was like it turned into a whole thing when I didn't mean for it to be a whole thing but at the end of the day it is working that the ash collection is a lot easier now yeah and so we'll be able to do that a little bit faster just okay so yeah that worked what happens craft this crafting station right here it has like part of my inventory in it and I just like walking like I don't what I have to be like a like a quarter of a second drag place it was just like here take some Cheers firestarter you know by i heck could that have been from the I'm trying to think like all I can think of is maybe it was from the this thing like shot your inventory in doing cuz it can pull the crafting table I I think I was running and had control down oh and and somehow managed to accidentally click on it and while I pulled my mouse like back to fit gun click from it like drag but anyway things took a turn okay but it's fine oh the scanners out route can't route tune on start enjoys I see I see so yeah that was yeah you just did a sleight of hand see if you would like to do a
