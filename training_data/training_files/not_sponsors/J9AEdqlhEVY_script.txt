this video is sponsored by brilliant now although most cells divide through mitosis a small teeny subset of cells divide to form sex cells so sperm or egg cells also known collectively as garments in a process called meiosis meiosis both mirrors and is completely different from mitosis at the same time so one of the biggest differences between the two is that where mitosis provides two complete sets of DNA to each daughter cell that is they contain 46 chromosomes the function of meiosis is to provide the genetic material so that each gamete only gets one complete set or 26 chromosomes each so then when a male gamete combines with a female comic during fertilization two sets of 26 chromosomes are joined together and the cell has 46 chromosomes again I know semantics human cells with two sets of chromosomes are called somatic cells and are diploid the sex cells called gametes or germ cells are haploid because all cells come from other cells and make sense that cells are always preparing to divide or are dividing and during mitosis when cells divide they are creating exact exact exact replicas of themselves and no cheap knock-offs neither so in comparison to mitosis meiosis consists of two rounds of cell division instead of just one the first round of division called meiosis 1 begins with a single solitary diploid cell and ends with two haploid cells and then in the second round of division known as meiosis to original it starts with these two haploid cells and concludes with four haploid cells each of which goes on to become a gamete so let's start at the start of meiosis you've got your single cell honest diploid what happens next is prophase one in prophase one the chromatin condenses into chromosomes once this occurs the first opportunity for genetic recombination or stuffing up the genes to produce variation promptly presents so the cell is still diploid and there are two versions of each chromosome each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at a centromere similarly to mitosis during an event called synapses chromosomes line up alongside each other forming ket rods on each Tet rod or group of four consists of four chromatids and this is now where the first act of genetic recombination within meiosis takes place in a process called crossing over not with John Edwards during crossing over non sister chromatids from opposing four ouma's Ohm's exchange genetic information crossing over Reed combines genetic information between chromosomes leaving each with a complete set of genes but an entirely different combination of alleles and this is basically why you don't look exactly like your siblings unless of course you're an identical twin and once crossing over has happened prophase one moves on largely as in mitosis the nucleoli a nuclear envelope breakdown centrioles migrate towards opposite poles of the cell and the spindle begins to assemble and then we've got metaphase one again as in mitosis pairs of homologous chromosomes line up in the center of the cell which we call the metaphase plate this is where the second recombination takes place the two chromosomes of a pair are going to go to opposing sides of the dividing cell so at the metaphase plate each pair of homologous chromosomes lines up randomly to one side or the other independently of the other pairs just as the combinations of alleles within chromosomes were shuffled during crossing over the combinations of maternal versus paternally inherited chromosomes are shuffle now - and then we've got anaphase one during anaphase one spindle fibers Palmer's base between centrioles at either pole of the cell on the metaphase plate connecting to the independently assorted chromosomes the spindle contracts segregating the pairs of homologous chromosomes pulling one complete set to a site next up is telophase one in telophase one the spindle disassembles and nuclear envelope forms around the single set of chromosomes that either the dividing so a cleavage furrow constricts on the center of the cell physically separating the two sides and in most cases the division proceeds all the way through cytokinesis and meiosis one and two two haploid cells each containing one can recombine set of chromosomes and each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids and finally we've got meiosis two this is a bit more straightforward than meiosis one so merely again we start with prophase two chromatin condenses nuclear envelopes disappear centrioles migrate and the spindles form and then next up is prophase two chromosomes align of the metaphase plate connected by spindles two centrioles at the poles and then we have anaphase to the centromeres of the chromosomes are cleaved and sister chromatids are segregated two opposing sides of the dividing cells lastly we have telophase to again the spindle dissolves nuclear envelopes form chromosomes uncoil and cytokinesis occurs and four haploid cells now stand where once there is but one tiny little single diploid cell after meiosis two is complete the four haploid cells go on to develop into gametes eventually to join together with other gammas during fertilization so the diploid zygote produced from this union will possess a unique combination of genes thanks to crossing over and independent assortment which is probably why you're glad you don't look like your siblings am i right I'm spongebob at this moment in time I'm I will let you know how it goes in a future video thank you for watching
