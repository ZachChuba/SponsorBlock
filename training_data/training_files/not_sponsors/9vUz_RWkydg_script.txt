alright ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL craft the event right now is happy Halloween it's no longer spawning mobs but dude I got on the server and it's like Halloween I can't I don't even want to try to impersonate it but a very very big boy over on the server oh no they said it's always a trick and never a treat ha ha ha oh dude that's terrifying look at his face it's also getting wrecked by something damage yeah yeah and there's another boy over there is like a devil who I saw leaving a fire trail we should go over there and say hi this is how we die just so you know just sort clear do you see how do you see a devil man over there yeah dude where's I mean I see there's devil new up in the air but there is that really grew in the air yeah that's what that dude flying to the left of the end is up in the air that's a girl hmm and want to find a way stone but also desert hot and cold right now so I don't think it's I'm not that cold so that's good oh yeah yeah not going just wreck your freakin dudes I'm marked as cold good I'm warming up now it's a good it's a good time and perfectly good rectum but you want to race through the desert here we are yeah we are again sounds a good place it what if I what if I shoots to this man's well it does do damage god that face is terrifying that face is absolutely terrifying oh that is a fairly disturbing face for sure I'm just I'm just put me I'm looking at this boy real quick right here dude just giving him a look taking some screenshots for thumbnail possibilities here dude you know yeah you gotta get them thumbnail thank you oh ok alright yeah it seems like things have decided to you know you can't interrupt my thumbnail taking ok your thumbnail taking is it is very well summoners were had it had it all covered now get out of here whoa hey he dropped a pumpkin my man's down here dropping pumpkins and guy doesn't seem that interested in those to be honest ok what if we can say hello to him correct uh I can't tell him he's slowly making his way to us or not he doesn't seem to be it kind of is no he's kind of he's walking inside of him I don't want to risk being a little too close to that that seems like a good way to get rekt ok just right you know in the event he's not actually a neutral I'd rather not deal with death yeah what is that over there that looks like that would kill us Halloween trick-or-treat what is this I received a pumpkin don't forget aggro yeah no I'm I'm I'm less concerned about the monetization now but I did lose six levels what was it again let's see grave scroll ah yes ender pearl paper and rotten flesh of course my goodness hey look it's me stuff I didn't know you were so kind dude God it just exploded everywhere oh my god dude okay I know I have to remember how my inventory was arranged and all that crap Allah it is real tough dude I'm presented with some very weight point really really really yes did you get all your stuff yeah I did I'll take sweets arrows though bro I love way stones yes this is exciting right when we're on fire too so boom Kirk cool trying oh there's an opening - ok back to real life there you go are you okay and yeah I just pray hey now why don't we clear out our inventories this is a good opportunity Marsh Loomer it's more slammer Murr dude how do you not remember me slamming work it's the place to be dude all right wait this is the this is the wrong one though this oh no it isn't okay I'm good okay cool cool we ready to go dude I'm gonna use a heart container Oh her container not heart cannister yes I like help you put it on and it like just oh yeah it like hurts you you got to inject yourself with more health you know you have the same gonna help but you're no longer how does it miss tribute that because every body part has its random oh and so but the other thing is is I found because I've applied a couple now but when you would you do it it'll redistribute so it's like it always adds two hearts but it let's go over since oh it labor to heal right here it juggles your things around yeah it oh so like I got it on my head initially and then I took a second one and I had four that were four hearts instead of two but my head was no longer one of them uh you know so if you like getting lucky in it it it just applies to extra to your head then it's like oh do I want to apply another until I have a way more to go around in general it's always good so we're gonna desert area oh is it wait you remember that naming them yes power base I didn't realize you were able to do that that's great that's nice okay let's check out what we got over in the thing over here I'm sure it's only nice things don't step on a cactus buddy mmm looks like looks like good place to go down and I see nothing wrong with this yeah it looks like good place good time oh dude that is the coolest effect that is that is really dynamic lighting I know but it is really cool just like oh we got mummies dude Oh buddy we got spawners - we are red creeper creeper creeper creeper creeper okay you will it's fine oh yeah do uh we had to have a little bit of a trade off you know mmm leather cat oh six torches

they just spawned out of no get out of here freakin bets yeah yeah yeah wait okay oh my he's what is that oh that's your good guy yeah well I should so I don't know what to do right now I don't know what you don't know what to do either you know you're you seem upset yep I am I mean you know we've all with friends like you know enemies Wow okay Oh ball sacks I don't even have my frickin pickaxe there's a lot of guys yeah yeah but we I need to go mine through here mine through here here line through there you want cuz I need to press where I don't rate okay this this block right here uh-huh I need to get I need to get in there because my stuff is in there oh my god whoa that's a big scorpion right there can you help can you can we can we make some progress down here to where the kobold probably just heated my stuff yeah do you mind like another opening so that I can angle through to because I can't do anything right now yeah this is gone well so far this is a good idea this is the RL craft experience we're used to yeah well I'm uh I'm in here Mike this Mike I messed up his lying around you should be a kid did you kill the manticore I did yes okay now I got to try and get in there yeah the issue is that Oh God Oh God oh my lord dude yeah this isn't gonna work out too well for me but we out here I mean I can pick up your stuff if you want me to problem is I need to because I don't have a pickaxe there's no other way for me to even get you in here what is this creeper like it's just taking so many hits from my diamond is it a special one okay this creeper is taking like 3 trick it was a trick I mean you know what was it I didn't have a whole lot booze what is this creeper this creeper is indestructible all right I'm grabbing a pickaxe I just had to do it I'll throw the rescue stuff back okay I mean you know so I'm gonna use this stuff rather than just lying there it's not like you know how dare oh god there's so much okay coming through I'm drew yeah okay I think that creeper is actually indestructible okay bro this this creeper is actually you can't you can't it's it can't be killed what is this it can't be killed this clink is not doing me much good I'm like I just I dislike it they oh it's a creeper oh this is bad so it's hurting me yeah I don't know but but that's a dance of terrifying skeleton oh god that's a bad one oh shoot oh Lord no brother skeleton is invincible now what I mean your armor hasn't despawn I just died he just died okay all right cool I'm running back I'm running back all of your creeper all of your stuff is in here in terms of your sounds great okay coo coo coo I can you seal it seal the gate seal the gates nice all right all right all right Thank You skeleton for your service you've done a wonderful job he brought he brought you back your stuff get scared okay I'm gonna be Halloween treats I don't think I'll use them ya know it seemed like a good way to just get rekt if that's what you're going for okay so my diamond pickaxe is probably despawn yeah no my pickaxe here you have the purified water no I that was my number one here you had this one and yours that and cool I threw everything else that I have currently into there that is about it yep okay yeah pretty low on things I don't know what the deal is with this creeper I don't have any information either for you there your bow is out here though so that's a thing holy my lord I can't yeah it's real great okay I can't I can't use the freaking stuff oh that's an angry bad skeleton - holy crap [Music] spider is like crazy oh is this another invincible spy it's another trick thing I think that's the only hurting me he's hurting me really Jesus really I think so are you sure these tricks what is what these trick stuff is it if it's actually hurting you that's that's really unfair yeah he's definitely hurting you it's slow but he's hurting me okay that's unfair I'm grabbing some stuff I'm grabbing some much like I'm just about out of whatever online okay I need those coal balls were so much better at defensive stuff and then this nonsense I know but it's like what can you okay I don't know what to do about this this do we need to do a difficulty toggle because it's absurd if that can actually do damage to you and it's invincible I don't know if it's a bug or not but it shouldn't be a thing I should not be a thing it's definitely doing slow damage to me I mean it again it's slow but it's there it it wants my bud okay well I'd say maybe use difficulty toggle real quick all right you got to deal with all the complaints I mean what else yeah yeah what are you gonna do it doesn't it doesn't it's invincible like what are we gonna do about that I don't think this much can be done okay all right and then collect every there sure but that was interesting oh lordy all right so I think we need to gather up either seal awesome cat like focus on stealing stuff I yep I agree or or or or you don't want an evacuation of some sort okay this is this is not a good thing at all no this is not a good thing at all okay don't worry about it okay oh my goodness what is that is that oh it's sandstone dope dude he just tricked shotted me from like 50,000 feet away holy crap I'm upset I'm upset this is a mess this is having me like a half dozen times so at this point I'm pretty just used to it no nice dude the skeleton just dies he's just one shot he's brutal okay oh okay oh happy new same guy same guy I don't know where I ended up here I see your sword okay cool don't yeah um can you reference me a direction no I'm dead I'm behind you so I got I got it blown up like blinded and then blown up okay cool and then so that was my experience you may have had okay cool you one shot at me yeah what is this skeleton does it have aim hax okay spider is that the end of it no that's not invincible okay cool so he's in it dummy there's your bezoar right there cool thank you okay oh god oh god why why did I go ahead and come out here why did I come out here no no no can't you help I don't have big X big X there you go there you go there you go nice nice and though he's coming over you fool I got you there's a hat there's a little leather a hat for you cool do you happen to have anything that is like a weapon melee no and mine is just about to break all right okay I know I saw something of my oh that's another thing of mine I got an axe I got an axe that can be used as a thank you then hand me there oh here's your peers here I just got your diamond pickaxe Oh dope or your diamond there you go right there oh that's not a pickaxe but I'll take it sorry sorry yep there goes my swords so if you have that axe throw it to me yep there you go thank you what no you do not do this what's going on it's a spider that throws you into the air blast off gastly exhaust what no no please I just broke ass god I'm done done done I need a pig heck so badly and then crude all right well yeah I I'm pretty sure just about everything else is despawned at this point unfortunately oh my lord all right so sadly I lost some arrows it's never what you want whoa whoa whoa whoa spike it's buddy careful Oh God oh wow whoa whoa well they are defendants is breached how do they do that how do they get through there I don't know but here comes the dude there do I do it for the boots what do you got to lose everything oh yeah uh just despondent for my face no damn it damn it my tiny boots just just went away they just disappeared no sorry that happened all right I need I need a pickaxe so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna head home or II said be some ladders oh you you bring up you didn't bring a pickaxe all right okay quick reset okay recovered we're okay everything's fine no prob so and extra diamond boots is always good I forgot about those thank you trying to figure out what they use you didn't I mean those cobol's were pretty darn handy yeah and I think things what it turned out really differently had they not just run away with my stuff it's they might have you know we'll try that cuz I wouldn't I feel like I wouldn't have to play as aggressive you know I am and it's so definitely somehow all my fault I agree no it's the kobolds fault not your fault you did not know they just went ahead and they were like all right change into the other team now okay I think we're good see okay I need to try again we're ready to isolate the room I have my 64 cobblestones and nothing could go wrong it will all work all right so this room that's actual okay if only I'd have told you dude you should have told me I can't believe you didn't yeah no it's pitch black you're likely to be eaten by something okay I can I can do I can handle you now why are you these things don't take damage it's oh you wanna do another weird ish I don't I don't know I know if it's me fam it's not an accord oh he's gone okay my guy my guys had that covered yeah get in there get get work done I did forget to make another staff but thank you wait what oh all right if we can just take care of all of these scorpions I feel like it'll get us a chance to go in there and take some spawners perhaps Oh God when you hurt me the scorpions do have a pretty big hitbox so you can take care of them keine from a distance which is nice all right so it's nice having a pickaxe again I forgot what that's like yeah it's it's very handy I did see a spawner yeah yeah they're looking at one right now and I'm also in a nice spot right here where I can kind of just take things from a distance I got this little perch up here dude it's a cool perch sounds good yeah I'd recommend it I'd recommend creating your own little perch where you can just wreck things from afar Oh or that or that I got a I got a spotter down okay all right more more calm more chill you make myself a nice little perch I like it you like to see it I could level up some stuff now what should i level up you got the wanderer oh yeah I'm just I'm just pondering I think I'm gonna add another level of uh melee damage so now I do 20% more damage could come in handy here you know you're coming Andy okay well perhaps we can make a little bit more progress good job with your torturing dude oh hey didn't see you there didn't see you there bud out of there can you just block that off real quick Albert Oh lots of arrows that's nice oh no guys ah he dropped some stuff though he dropped a one of the big Hal Birds well we might need to do difficulties our holy mother of I can't function right now I'm fine oh we're good we're it was just a momentary issue momentary issue alright oh there's a spawner got it it was a spider spawner I know I am oh there's a ton of stuff in this chest I'm trying to block some stuff off real quick there we go I difficulties our goal would still actually be kind of nice right now I'm lagging pretty badly if you get to a safe spot for it I mean thank you fine what is happening it's weird there's something over here that's causing some some perhaps issues they'll not know why but they just think I lose my bucket of water it looks like I lost my bucket of water you smell yeah where were those zombies coming from there's a spawn in this back room that I'm here okay shield redstone oh I've had a different looking place okay I don't know if it's a bad spot but zombie spawner down oh yeah there's there's men's commands commands by the many back here there's a lot of guys over here and I need water if you have it Oh got it oh that was a clutch one that was super shoot God dang it skeletons are the absolute worst all right I don't know where you I'm getting stuff okay good work I'm getting stuff I'm getting most of it unfortunately so that when flew into this place but yep right get any other stuff I'm missing my boots but otherwise is there can you use it no no yeah okay then I I will take that too where is it I'd like the diamond to axe hang on got it okay hey helping yeah oh diamond axe boys that's what I like and then an enchanted book of swords and fancy torches oh my goodness never never mind these are different NBT hope they stack we're good so many spiders seems to be a spider spawner so it means we can create easily I can see it got it yeah there's still one more there is a bow in here that has enchantments on it if you happen to be interested awesome throwing you some torches I am interested now that you mention it trying to be of as much help as I can you know I know how you do what sort of unbreaking you've been okay so this leads back around to her original spot alright there was a there was another flake entire cave system that this links into I don't know whether yeah there's a thing over here but there's a but I'm out of torches oh I have many I can give to you if you come to me I can share get rekt which Oh double diamonds and chain boots chamber inside that exciting there's another oh god oh god oh god I can't believe I made it out of that Chloe hey I did it I did the fun little lap right then yeah you're good you're good you're crushed I hate it out you're crushing it anything of value go up in the explosion I I don't know I was just running and trying not to look at an Enderman so I was I was in motion all right no good dude I'll good we are we're in good shape over here I think I think I did get that spotter that was there like you know I think I paid you for blood haha yeah collect so new recipe unlocked what did I get a remorseful essence this seems to be of value okay he's in German I can't stand the static yeah the static is pretty bad huh hahaha that's pretty funny dude that was a funny thing you did there Thanks I'm here for you also I've gotten some glowstone which is which is good right I mean you know yeah with its how we do now help okay we're fine everything is fine nothing to worry about come on Emmons get to work man it's like sometimes they're good to go and other times they're bad to go oh this was a this was an exit well that guy was just got mad at me oh it's cute oh I see what's going on there's a zombie spawner over there well it's a it's quite a few it's quite a few oh just making quick work of them they're not a big deal not a big deal okay we got fancy zombie over their fancies huh oh yeah all done Oh y'all taking them down boys there's an exit right above us that's okay click with this oh I see I see now our rights oh god I need to level things up before I lose too many levels doing something bad let's see more combat stuff what should I do arrow speed archery bow string back faster hmm damage stealth something random crits or melee damage 23 yeah sure dude I'm just gonna keep I'm just gonna keep max in melee damage anything interesting gold chicken and a whole lot of static okay um wow did we hit the end of this thing oh no there's me there's still a lot of other directions to go there's down here Oh is there actually a down no no I've been there was there another direction like back sort of where we yeah started okay so the kind of so are you back I'm back at the in essence yeah at the big mess at the big mess if we come over here and then go straight back then you can see it links into what I think might be a dungeon that equipped into there's there's Chester's I see a witch there's stuff going on back there a dungeon huh I mean I don't I have no idea I'm just saying that there was clearly more back there all right I mean we can take a look might as well if it's something new are more spotty boys over here got it I bought it down much in the way of blocks I'd give you some cool art Oh pickaxe yes it all works out in the end I know this this looks like the same sort of mining structure as before yeah go get them guys go do goes be yourself be yourselves that's good encouragement man very kind of you all right I did say I oh sorry your helmet broke there's another one I got this Bonner for these by the way so okay let me see if I can just run it okay Oh God Oh God Oh frickin gstfire dude there we go oh there it's uh it's light though I hear a lot of flight taking place okay that is that's wheat here oh this thing breaks spawner so fast oh so that's okay just another exit huh interesting empty room it does continue a little bit over here oh oh that's a that's what that is is it's a Dragon's Den no no do not want do not want I can hear the dragon flying eat oh I can see down into it I can see only just the beginning the particles I see the particles oh my god so yeah kinda start to see over [Music] I think some stuff might have wasn't anything I'm just tired of like being fine and then just like yeah the manticores are annoying I might have yoinked some of your experience accidentally but your stuff that's all I my experience just moments ago so good good maybe maybe let's go to safety first you know yeah let's get out of here let's just dip on out and hopefully not get incinerated the instant that we step up onto the higher ground if you want to wait for me to go first you're welcome to there's dragon bones right up here oh that's creeper and I don't know where we are okay yes I do there's a creeper right at the top but okay that's a dragon bone right there that's huh dragon bones are valuable though are they we can make if we can make some room that's not a bad thing to get we view shift right click I believe maybe not okay there we go yeah yeah did you get all of them oh I got some dragon bones oh that's that's a make dragon armor and stuff like that moving it's pretty valuable okay it seems good well let's uh let's go before the dragon realizes that we stole its long-lost friends yes oh and it's toasty again has it perhaps migrated to summertime spring well it was a catastrophe but we made it okay ish it's it I I actually I think in the end I gained things so that's pretty exciting I gained things as well as two different NBT types of dragon boats yeah yeah bro I'd say it was it was not bad I can team back but I got enough to whether that I can make another one yeah we have a lot of leather in the chest anyway so I think we're good on that okay well it could've been worse it really is just the entry point for all these dungeons it's the biggest pain link once once we seal off the entry point they're not really the rest of it was fairly straightforward yeah couple D monetization 'z but like nowhere near what it was like in the beginning yeah in the beginning there was pain yep that's that's definitely what it was all right well we'll have to figure out with these dragon bones do let's see dragon horn dragon bone flute yet that only requires two dragon bones we need a wither bone how does one would get a wither bone do we I mean I got a at least I had a wither skeleton school but I'd might have dropped it off somewhere along the way bro like these oh my god yeah these dragon Bowden things do good that's how you get that's how you get the the dude the oh my good oh we need to level up but oh no I was looking at the attack is a 24 that's that's the level of it I thought they were doing 24 damage there's gonna be that's naari gnarly but they're probably still good they're probably still pretty good yeah pretty good okay you wrap it up yeah thanks to our response MC pro money on your first month play with your friends and have a good time
