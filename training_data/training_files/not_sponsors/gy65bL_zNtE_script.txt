episode of scishow go to brilliant org slash scishow to learn more there is nothing fun about getting a cavity they can be uncomfortable to have an expensive to treat and sometimes it can feel like there's not much you can do to prevent them like you're already brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing how did tooth decay happen in many ways the world would be a better place if we could just prevent cavities from popping up altogether and the beautiful thing is we might be able to ultimately to keep our mouths cavity free we have to tackle the main cause of tooth decay and no I'm not talking about sugar I'm talking about a bacterium called streptococcus mutans it's one of the many types of bacteria in your mouth and it's one of the main things that causes cavities s mutants lives on your teeth feeds off the sugars on your tooth plaque and almost instantly turns those sugars into acid normally compounds in your saliva neutralized the extra acid after a few minutes which is why you don't really notice s mutants at work but that acid can still accumulate around the microbe itself and if you don't brush it away you can develop a really acidic spot on your tooth if that spot develops for long enough the acid can wear away the tooths outer surface potentially creating a pit so deep that it becomes a full-blown cavity that's a good reason to clean your teeth but sometimes cavities can happen despite your best efforts and besides not everyone has regular access to fancy toothbrushes and floss so while there are plenty of preventative options scientists have also begun to investigate if there's anything we can do to get rid of s mutants for good and so far they found some possibilities for one a few studies have noticed that people who have more of the amino acid arginine in their mouths tend to get fewer cavities according to a 2018 experiment this could be because a different strain of streptococcus metabolizes arginine into a tiny amount of hydrogen peroxide and that hydrogen peroxide prevents s mutants from fermenting sugar and ultimately from growing so if we could introduce the right kind of streptococcus into a toothpaste we might be able to reduce cavities that isn't the only option though in 2011 researchers also came up with a special mouthwash that can kill s mutants while leaving helpful bacteria alone the compound in their mouthwash is called C 16 G 2 which could probably benefit from a good brand name it's a synthetic antimicrobial compound assigned to quickly target a specific chemical s mutants Gibbs and while I can sometimes attack other bacteria it almost only kills these cavity culprits in a test the mouthwash effectively reduced the damage done to tooth enamel by the s mutants bacteria as well which is great so far though these options for eliminating cavities are promising but they're not well tested enough to go primetime well need some more research to prove that they're definitely effective and safe but hey if this someday means a world with no cavities I'm all for it this cavity problem is really just one big puzzle where scientists have to figure out how to get rid of S Newtons without disrupting the rest of our mouths it's a annual premium subscription [Music] you [Music]
