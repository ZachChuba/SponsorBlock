that am i open to um white boys who look kind of skinny like twinks and a little bit definitely have a bit of a pale cavalry pale golem lives with mom type of kind of a small streamer but kind of

gonna get myself some wine i promise you nico i will not lie to you during this entire stream i promise to only tell you the truth and i hope that you also do the same because i think that honesty is very important because i don't i want to meet a fictional version of you i want to read the real miko you know are you okay with opening up are you okay with having no boundaries together boundaries like what um like you ever you ever have like a real traumatic experience that we could go into that really affected you and may has you know caused you to be a very depressed person that you actually have to go online to find validation on twitch.tv oh by the way i just want to get this out of the way don't answer that um can i can i can i read uh there's text going across your chest can i read that i don't know if it's inappropriate i thought i would ask you permission to look because i i don't wanna can i can i read it can i you can read it go ahead but don't stare at the don't start the baubles just look at the words yeah i'm looking at the words yeah it's just the words not the bubbles i'm looking at the words you okay buddy yeah no someone someone to chat type something that i really like it's been a while since i talked to a man i know i mean scarra does he even count as a man probably not scarra is a friend but you know i'm very masculine i could lift boxes you know like as long as they're not more than 20 pounds did you know that at the moment i'm totally into desperate boys who are like trying to get their [ __ ] together but still live with their mom and they're kind of like pale skinny um slightly attractive but not quite there it's like he they could be there you know what i mean if you know they were born a little different that their jeans were slightly slightly tweaked that's kind of the phase i'm going through right now you know i understand that i i hope that the genetics aren't a problem because i am balding i hope uh is this is this a problem you have oh my god you're amazing foreign peek yeah no it's it's a little bit of an issue and i feel like i'm looking for a girl with a forehead that's not too big mostly because if we have kids i don't want them to be top yet heavy because like i feel like if i marry a girl with a big forehead the kids are just gonna be falling over all the time and that doesn't sound ideal yeah well the technician has a giant for it so i guess that wouldn't work with her but i have bangs see that's fine i'm here for me she's way prettier me yeah i agree i absolutely agree i have other forms to show you i'm excited for everyone i have many different forms if you if you and i are going to date you need to meet every single one of my forms okay that's that's good because um i i would normally get bored of a girl in a relationship that's why you know sometimes you could have them like you know do their hair different put on a wig but you could just transform into completely different people and then i will actually stay interested ooh oh nice too oh yeah yeah i sin i sin sometimes yes sometimes i have uh gay thoughts oh what which uh i wish i wish that i would i it's a little messed up they consider that a sin i i think it should be socially acceptable what's wrong with it i mean it's completely fine what year are we on you know what i'm saying like but um with your okay with who uh i actually had a dream a week ago um it i wasn't part of it but my my brothers were penetrating each other i have two brothers wait wait wait wait wait what yeah no i don't choose my dreams niko wait come on your brothers yeah my brothers were having gay sex in my dream um and i really didn't like it because i don't i it sucks because they didn't consent to doing that and neither did i like i feel like my dreams took advantage of me because [ __ ] i i never want to think about that i don't deserve that what did i do to have that dream like why why is this happening to me and am i supposed to look into it like are you no can you be a little bit my therapist why why did i have that dream you go you want to drink a little bit more yeah i think so give me a moment that could be our future i

what do you like the most about me um oof probably yeah probably you're you just have a wicked hot bob and the fact that you could transform it uh i like that because i even like sometimes you get a little bit big and that's something that i i'll admit like i'm i'm into that you've you've been big bob what about my personality what about me as a person yeah no that's a that is somewhere on the list of the things i like about you that is that that makes the cut yeah no that's that's in the i would put that in the top 20. actually i have to admit something this isn't my first time talking to a hot anime babe and the last one she she really didn't like me she just called me mean um i what's up who else did you talk to i i talked to to project melody but she hated me she really didn't like me um but you are way hotter i would say that you are the hottest uh cartoon i've ever spoken or that i've ever seen besides like lola bunny you are second only to lola bunny you talk to her that's that's lola bunny's pretty hard hot dude project melody you say we talk the project of melody what is it about it is it a bouncy perky titties no no no listen listen listen listen listen i was on a dating show for her oh i i picked you could either pick love or host and i picked host so i didn't even like her she was a stinking b word that's my take on her she's way less cool than than my queen nico say that again you're queen you'll say that again you're my you're my queen mikko i i think that you're infinitely you know way prettier than her nico you are everything that i dream of lord amigo you could be my lord master miko master miko i i would be i would be a slave to you you can make me a sex slave i'll even do the dishes you can make me a normal slave i'll do that for you how dumb are you uh you know i did score below national average on the sats ow oh wow and that says something because you know george carlin has that joke and he's like oh you know think about how dumb the average person is and then realize that half of them are even dumber than that and i'm in that category like [ __ ] like i'm dumb is that why you become a streamer yeah yes because then people could just laugh at me i don't have to make people laugh i could just be the butt of the joke and that's okay i i want some attention even if people hate me and just want to laugh at me i could accept that but i just hope one day a pretty girl like you will maybe like me please smile can you smile for me please please smile yes don't yep yep good i i like your smile please if i whenever i'm done saying something i would like you to smile or laugh that would be my preferred reaction to the things that i say i like you besides your weird dreams about your two younger brothers i like everything of older brothers older brothers yeah there was there was torture growing up with two hot older brothers that sucked a lot of temptation wait wait wait what too hot hold up like step brothers i heard that's actually no no they were they were they were blood so it was even more tempting um sometimes i would sometimes uh me and my brother shared a room we had bunk beds this used to be a bunk bed and sometimes he would a huge shower in the morning and i would take a peek when he was changing oh wait wait wait wait wait come on come on get like yeah okay it's okay he had a listen he had a hot girlfriend so i was like imagine like okay what is he packing if he's getting a girlfriend that hot he must be packing heat um that's it was just curiosity that that's it i'm that's it's it's you know how family works right yeah and when you're presenting this information can you can you act a little bit more happy and maybe smile a little bit more again i want the jovial i don't want it to be too intense family members is i'm kind of wrong okay buddy yeah that's what makes it so hot it's the taboo of it you remind me of my mod jordan i seem like a moderator to you are you serious i'm more than a moderator i'm a potential love interest i know that a lot of people they watch you and you know what they're hoping for they're like okay i'm a viewer right now but soon i'll be a subscriber and then after i'm a subscriber then i'm going to upgrade to a moderator and after i'm a moderator i'm going to start typing to her and then we're going to be friends and then once we're friends i'll have a chance and then maybe become my become her girlfriend and then after that maybe i can be her wife and yes every single viewer that's watching you is hoping for that that is the social ladder that they're looking to find not true that is load of bull crap my viewers know they are friends with me and they want to stay friends with me like a pure viewer friendship relationship you know what i'm saying no your your viewers are sexually interested and i would say my viewers are sexually interested in me too i think this is just an inevitable thing on twitch i would say that in any twitch chat ten percent of people are jacking off at any given time like even for like asming like a world of warcraft streamer it's because sometimes people want to watch porn but then they have their twitch stream on the other monitor so that they don't feel lonely watch this can you do this i'm a little bit of a real life clown you ready wait wait i'm going to call my friend physical hold on hold on once again this school will love this please funny man it's so funny how dare you refer to me as a woman cootie this good night woman cause they repeat after me bob yeah no fish go is not woman's coochie no fish is a fiscal fiscal is an own fish yeah fish fish go is is her own fish yeah i agree with that that's why uh i'm a vegan i i i don't eat meat i don't eat fish because i really care about animals i think it's a little bit hypocritical um like people think about the how [ __ ] up it is like as a society we're willing to kill a fish kill it you know and then eat it think about how [ __ ] up that is and then like people call me a weirdo if i take a dead fish and i [ __ ] it jesus christ i i take that back i don't do that i don't i i take that back i don't i don't i don't i don't [ __ ] that fishes i've never done that i just want to make that clear can you please jump up you did what i think it just shows a little bit of hypocrisy because like i'm taking something that's already dead like the the fish it's not gonna complain it's already dead meanwhile other people are killing a live fish and eating it i would argue that murder and cannibalism is worse than necrophilia i would argue that very very happy you made fiscal very happy bob seven more fiscal once more keep a nipple i i don't know if i could give a nipple i really i i would i would i would want to i would want it is it too tos you think yeah i think uh it's it's okay here's the thing so my nipple would be to us because you have to think about this if people sexualize it then it's no good and people will sexualize my nipple example if you take two people kissing if they're really hot they're gonna get banned but if you take two really old people kissing that's all good that's not against the os oh so you would be okay to kiss anybody whoa what what is what does that laugh oh i guess the answer is a no oh yeah can you say okay i just wanna i just wanna watch you say words just say words to me it doesn't even matter what it is i just wanna watch you speak rob you're a cook yeah oh my god five seven you you suck micro your brother's micropeen tell me more oh my no no no that was supposed to be an insult tell me more miko use that sweet mouth of yours you have i i'm what a gold okay you will never amount to anything what what [ __ ] of lipstick is that because i actually have to buy a christmas gift for my mom and i really like that shade of lipstick do you know what shade that is oh god my mom looked good with that oh my goodness you okay say explicitly bob i want you to do an impression of me mikko bob i want you to do an impression of me mika oh [ __ ] okay i can do this oh [ __ ] how much wine did you drink uh not not that much my name's mikko oh [ __ ] okay no i can't i can't oh that i just made myself i was gonna oh oh i'm going to the floor come back come back come back come back stand back up come back okay okay come on come on okay try that again come come back come back bob sit back down okay okay okay okay oh oh okay try again do it again oh my name's mikko look at my own uh comb in my mouth look at me do my i'm gonna fart i'm gonna go to outer space that's my impression of you rude yeah what do you like about me fish go can you go into detail i want you to speak for i want you to speak for one whole minute describe why you like me so much five seven very simple uh physical only has one brain cell but also above seven also has one brain cell so fiscal and by seven connect very well keep going yeah so if his school also has no you know free school has no friends you know what i mean because fiscal is a little socially challenged but also bob is also socially challenged with no friends yeah that's correct okay so okay so so i've seen fish go speak to many different people have you to make one friend why is that you have a lot of opportunities like you speak to many new people each day yes but it's just like bob it's just like bob you speak to lots of ladies every day but every single one of them friend zones bob how so how is that possible it's the same life physical am i too much for you no no no no no no you're wonderful you are you're wonderful you always think because do you want me to take a step back i could i could be a little bit less intense i know that sometimes you're a little bit too intense for the other person but then i was scared like what happens if i'm too intense for her i could i could dial myself back i could present maybe thirty percent of the true bob if you perfect just step back step back all the way back back bob back actually physically move back yes thank you thank you okay oh jesus christ that receding hairline looks good you think so yeah it's it's pretty sexy yeah that looks good how old are you you don't i'm i'm 22. how old are you i'm 24 are you really 22. you're 24 what happened to your face um so i i do want to tell you i want to be honest i do have two balls but they're very saggy and it's hard for me to believe like we're told with old age they're going to sag even more and that's hard for me to believe because if that's true when i'm 80 years old they're just going to be like between my knees like it's hard for me to believe with my current situation that they could sag even more than than now do they hang like up to your knees or something down to your knees how far did they go uh they are in between the thighs like mid at the mid point between the hip and the kneecap i would say that's where they are right now that must get kind of annoying oh yeah okay so the underwear that i'm wearing right now actually has a little bit of a pouch it has ah do you guys know what i'm talking about in chat there's underwear that have the pouch so then like the balls are contained so then you don't get like the legs stick either do you guys know what i'm talking about the pouch is very important you want boxers with a pouch okay it's ideal but if if i didn't have that then i'd be walking around and it would just be popping between my legs that would be annoying i would say that my best opinion is that i think you're incredible you simp you you smooth talker all right all right you little ah okay fine you're incredible do you know that you actually you're incredible mikko okay stop it that is the first word that comes to mind to describe you where is the punchline there's nothing there's literally no punch lines ah okay what do you want i want you okay stop stop right now what do you really want i don't understand the question i i was honest with you and you didn't believe me what am i supposed to do okay okay come on bob oh really yeah fine you can dm me five thousand times a day you can you can dm me twelve hours i don't care okay is that like do you wanna grip this because i don't wanna be all the weirdo when i actually do it so someone clipped this i will do it i'm gonna dm her 5 000 times a day and just know that she consented to this she decided this that this was a funny thing to do you ever uh do you ever get scared like you you never want to be a like you could look a little i'm going to say the word [ __ ] like you look a little [ __ ] or are you ever scared like have you ever had to tone down your outfit you know have you seen pink sparkles the streamer not yeah the streamer yeah yeah i've seen her there's a whole lot to see yeah i don't know what the implication i don't know what the implication of that is me saying there's a whole lot to see um i think i think my i think how i'm wearing my clothes i think i'm tos friendly um i am going to have to let you go oh yeah don't look sad bob come on oh come on i'll i'll be in the dms oh come on bob i'll be right there in discord what do you want just 12 hours [Applause] foreign
