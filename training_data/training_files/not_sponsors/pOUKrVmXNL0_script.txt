business or tech subject you can think of cherry bomb is Tyler the creator's fourth studio record released in 2015 it was abrasive experimental and a new direction for the rapper and critics hated it there are some instrumentals here that are some of the worst that I've ever been on II Tyler the Creator album so while I don't really care for this LP I'd have to give it to Tyler for being one of the few artists out there bold enough to simultaneously disappoint and impress so consistently I'm feeling a strong three too late for on the South brand position it was too much of this and not enough of that but no matter what they could come up with to complain about it was obvious to most of us that Tyler had put a ton of thought into Cherry Bomb it just didn't necessarily end up sounding how we expected it to the album opens with a hard-hitting guitar riff and heavily inspired by the rock rapid production that dominated the 2000s death camp especially shares characteristics with lap decks a song by one of Tyler's biggest inspirations as a producer Pharrell Williams and his various musical endeavors including NVR D and The Neptunes [Music] Tyler even rapped about this on death camp talking about how he draws more inspiration from frell's music than classic hip-hop albums like illmatic he expanded on this idea dissing his rivals for buying their style while tyler made his from scratch and that's a major theme on the album in general Tyler very much decided to go his own way instead of making his music sound like what other people were doing at the time and death camp achieved its early 2000s Pharrell Williams inspired sound by sampling its guitar riffs from a 1971 funk and soul hit called why can't there be love by Dean [Music] however in repurposing this guitar riff Tyler made it sound much more menacing than the original song the track sets the tone for Cherry Bomb to be a dark experimental album full of abrasive instrumentals and lyrics but as we would quickly find out the album instead explores many different sounds from pampas aggression in the same vein as Kanye's Jesus - rough abrasive instrumentals inspired by Death Grips - The Dreaming rhythm and blues of Stevie Wonder in short cherry bombs initial poor reception as an aimless mess of a record would later give way to a new more popular interpretation one that understands the importance of appreciating each and every one of Tyler's unique ideas as they come the album's next track Buffalo is significantly less intense than the death camp it opens with a sample from bunny Sigler's 1974 funk hit shake your booty a track that was also sampled by Kanye West on the Pusha T song numbers on the boards this song dropped in 2013 just two years before Cherry Bomb while both of the songs have starkly different atmospheres their use of the sample was almost exactly the same lyrically Buffalo is Tyler's declaration that he's going to go his own way as an artist rather than follow trends or try to appeal to as many people as possible the interlude from Shane powers talks about how Tyler has to be mindful of what he says to his audience because there are millions of kids listening to his music the conclusion that Tyler comes to is that he needs to lead by example rather than live in the shadow of others and that's what Tyler does for the rest of the record Cherry Bomb is his first project that features no contributions from any other future members it's his only record to have the instrumentals released alongside the final versions of the songs he took more inspiration from 1970s R&B and less inspiration from contemporary hip-hop than ever before and while he did use samples liberally at the same time a lot of the album's most recognizable melodies and instrumentation were completely original one of the records most recognizable instrumentals 2-seater borrows nothing more than a basic drum beat and a subdued bass line from the 1968 psychedelic classic get out of my life woman by Iron Butterfly the rest of the song including its beautiful orchestral passages and synth motifs are all Tyler's own creation but overall despite cherry bombs soulful motifs interesting composition and the sense that in many ways he finally figured out how to realize his potential cherry bomb was hailed as a mess there were a few different factors first of all the mixing when it's good it's great but the rest of the time well for almost half the album you can barely hear Tyler rapping above distorted overwhelming instrumentals it was an artistic choice that according to Tyler put his career on the line I just I just knew if this album was it good I will be [ __ ] that's how I felt it some people would disagree but I'm like man I'm not I'm nothing right now I felt that way coming off here yeah cuz everyone hated except for life music cares about drums like I opened a rap album with a rock song yeah most [ __ ] like and in Buffalo but in the end Cherry Bomb is more than just audio chaos it's more than a misstep in Tyler's career because the very basis of Tyler's career is the idea that creativity itself was valuable for its own sake not just for the purpose of fitting into some predetermined mold on how an album should sound or how a rapper should act Tyler makes music to explore himself and the world around him and with that being said Cherry Bomb may very well be his most inconsistent abrasive and confusing record but when you take a closer look you'll see that each and every moment on the album contains a unique interesting musical idea sure it didn't make for an iconic record like the summary Beauty a flower boy or Igor's experimental neo-soul cherry bombs legacy is as an album whose brilliance is hidden beneath a layer of controversy controversy from critics listeners and musicians even Tyler himself is openly torn about the album's legacy in my opinion Cherry Bomb is the quintessential musician's record sure it may be a mess but if you know where to look they'll quickly find yourself entranced by Tyler's musical creativity that truly knows no bounds while we wait months of unlimited access for free [Music]
