hello and welcome back to four FS gaming in this video we are going to look at update one point four point one for hunt showdown this update brings two major features a PvE trials mode and at long last the ability to dual wield pistols there are some other minor changes and additions that I shall go through as well also don't forget to find us over at twitch TV forward slash for FS gaming to catch our live streams as well so first up trials mode this is a solo PvE game mode where you can explore the map at each compound there is a challenge that you can activate these challenges come in three different types there is parkour mode where you have to run around reaching checkpoints within a time limit a sniper trial where you stay on a roof or in a tower and you have to headshot specific enemies within the time limit and wave trials in which you have to kill a number of specific enemies that spawn in succession each trial has additional objectives such as kill 10 hives or don't taking random damage and depending on your performance you can earn up to 3 stars in each trial the eventual aim would be to achieve 3 star ratings in all trials across both Maps at the start of each trial there is a snippet of law for you to read and the weapons and equipment you start with will be different for each trial one thing that I love about this mode is that once you load up one of the maps you can fast travel to any compound on that map and start the trial without any further loading screens so it's really really fluid to do a lot of trials on the same map the trials themselves are pretty fun and they range in difficulty some are rather easy and others forced me to take several attempts to learn the roots and spawns in order to earn my 3 stars it feels good to perfectly execute a parkour trial avoiding enemies and having everything fall into place the sniper trials force you to be accurate and fast with your shooting miss a few shots and getting 3 stars in the time limit will become very difficult the wave trials are a little bit lackluster in comparison but it is still fun to manage your kills while avoiding swarms of hellhounds especially when one of your objectives might be not to take any rending damage when you earn stars you will also unlock rewards depending on how many half this is mostly an assortment of equipment hunt dollars and blood ones but there are two legendary weapon skins to earn through trials as well the Tartar five for the specter bayonet and the cordwainer for the Nagant officer carbine now these are both really nice skins overall trials is a nice addition and I know some people were hoping for a PvE mode to be more story filled like a campaign and others would have preferred a proper wave defense mode with co-op but the way this is integrated does provide brilliant opportunities for newer players to learn the ins and outs of each compound especially with the parkour challenges and it provides more opportunity to practice aim maneuver through AI and get familiar with different weapons and equipment as well I think this is a really welcomed mode considering how it will help new players prepare for bounty hunt there is also opportunity to add a new set of trials with the third map when it finally arrives or rotate our trials as the game progresses let's move on and talk about dual wielding this mechanical lets you equip two pistols in the same slot as a matched pair the pistols must be the same however you can equip a legendary and a normal pistol side-by-side when you do this the two pistols take up a medium slot this means you can take a match pair of pistols and a medium weapon or too much pairs of pistols but if you want to take a large weapon you'll need quartermaster to dual wield as a secondary dual wielding prevents you from aiming down sights however you can tighten your spread by pressing the ad s button your shots in this mode are much more accurate than using fanning but they still come nowhere close to being viable at medium to long range without that ad s ability you can also control the rhythm of your shots so you can tap quickly to fire two shots in quick succession and then wait to fire again or you can alternate your fire so you've essentially doubled the fire rate or whatever pistols you're using as it turns out you're wielding is a lot of fun it allows you to shoot a lot and it's accurate enough to be used at short range but not much further it is dual wielding actually good well yes and no as expected the extra ammo and fire rate makes it very strong against AI but that's never really the threat is it the inability to ABS is a major limitation it means that if you're using a shotgun long weapon then you can't use your sidearm to get that player standing still 50 meters away when the opportunity presents itself and if you use long ammo you won't be at a quick swap and reliably killed beyond say 20 meters the obvious advantage of close range is that with any pistol but the Bornholm if you to tap the chest then you will down that enemy at close range and you can do that very quickly when holding two guns it also works well with a few weapons specifically like the LeMat as the secondary fire essentially acts now like a call-girl rifle hand cannon but with the longer reload and then you also get those 18 compact shots that you can spam if the enemy isn't quite dead honestly I don't think many competitive load outs will be using matched pairs and you're wielding aside from maybe a few select weapons it might be okay taking it with a whinny or a carabiner but the inability to quick swap at range means that many load outs aren't going to bother with this mechanic I'm a bit concerned that the lack of ATS will make your wielding obsolete but we'll have to see how it performs on live servers for final judgment a potential change could be to allow you to holster one of the pistols if you choose so it acts like a normal single slot pistol and then gives you the option to equip both simultaneously this would make sense because you'd think that a hunter in the field would be able to just put one pistol away if he's carrying two of them it will be nice for new players or even play into a fresh prestige to have more close-range options that are not shotguns of the early levels especially ones that don't require intensive use of trade points speaking of traits we are getting one new one ambidextrous will cost three points and it will help you reload matched pairs faster which is a nice little bonus there is one more small balance change coming with this patch the reserve ammo for compact ammo pistols is being reduced by about a third which is due to the ability to now take three compact ammo guns and stack obscene amounts of bullets finally we are getting three more legendary weapons to purchase with blood bonds the after Matt is getting the wolves mouth skin the Lebel is getting this very different spring chicken version and the uppercut gets yet another legendary the Lord's Prayer now I'm really looking forward to this update I don't think it's a huge game changer for experienced players however the trials mode is certainly worth playing and it will help support a newer player in learning and practicing the game if you liked this video please like and subscribe thank you so
