[Music] hey what's going on YouTube will hear from all-electric back again with another video and today we are going to be looking at roundabouts specifically one intersection over the last two most recent software updates [Music] huge thank you goes out to our grandma below and support this channel for as little as $1 a month so we're gonna be looking at these roundabouts over to software updates 12.5 and 12.6 so here is the actual roundabout and what it looks like so you can get a better understanding of the entire layout of the circle so here is the roundabout and we are gonna go and start in this direction here going through the roundabout and see what the first software update 12.5 and how it performs as we start to approach this traffic circle I slowed down the car and actually do this on every single test so here we are entering the roundabout and you can see take over immediately so not a great start here with 12.5 let's try again from the same angle following a car this time so you see the truck enter the roundabout and then we're gonna follow the car in autopilot and as soon as we enter those across those white lines almost like the car knows that we're entering the intersection it does take over immediately here is a right turn lane from the roundabout and here we go crossing over the white hand lines there and take over immediately so it looks like the auto pod system is able to identify the roundabout based on the white lines but now let's try from this direction so coming from the top of the screen as you see here so again here's a crosswalk and then the white lines entering the intersection and we see take over immediately so it's like the autopilot just stops once across these white lines here and another test take over immediately and here's a test with 12.6 go in the same direction and you can see here it's gonna stop at that line that identifies by those white markers and then we get the take over immediately once we enter the roundabout now let's try that roundabout from the last direction from here from the bottom so let's start with software update 12.5 here we go I'm slowing down the car manually a little bit and wow it went right through the intersection before I took over and we also curbed it a bit there so now let's slow down significantly because in the last clip I did not slow down very much and again once entering the roundabout crossing that line that Tesla knows the autopilot knows from 12.6 where the roundabout actually starts so here is 12.6 and we see that the car is going to stop at those white lines where it knows the intersection or the traffic circle starts then we get this message that this is an unsupported intersection I did mention error that was coming up in my 12.6 software update I'll put a link to that video if you haven't seen that up up here in the corner so let's try it from the last direction now from this right-hand side as you see in your screen and we're gonna start in 12.5 so 12.5 again I'm going about 25 miles an hour here and I'm gonna manually slow down the car so here you see me scrolling down the scroll wheel and as soon as we cross those white lines we hit take over immediately so let's try again in 12.5 manually slowing down the car here come the white lines and we get a little bit past the white lines before we get the take over immediately so let's try one more time with 12.5 as that last test went a little bit further than those white lines and here we go we're still in autopilot still in still in and now it says take over immediately so went significantly past those white lines like we've seen in all previous clips so one sort of kind of promising test there although the auto pilot did fail about midway through the roundabout so here we have the software update 12.6 where it's going to stop at these white lines and identify that it needs to stop it is impressive that it's able to identify that this is an intersection based on no stop sign so it is able to identify that it needs to stop for a roundabout but as you can see here now I'm just playing around because I'm very frustrated that it's not working but I did have the opportunity to take 12.6 on a couple pretty aggressive and new curves on my way to this roundabout for you guys and it is doing pretty well - this curve where I had to take over pretty quickly before I hit that van now I'm gonna re-engage autopilot here and speed up the vehicle a bit now that I've had several days to test 12.6 I'm pretty impressed with it nose cone Model S double hand wave but like I was saying 12.6 is a pre decent upgrade from 12.5 and I'm excited to run it through the curvy country road test and I also noticed just like in 12.5 it will identify people you can see this guy's out of our Lane but it still will show him up on the screen now 2020 that 12.6 was able to be fooled you can see here I'm an autopilot with no Lane lines in a neighborhood and there is a parked car on the side of the road and it did stop behind that car even though we have a flow of traffic on the other side of the road and you can see whatever I do I'm trying to tug on that wheel on the right-hand side push the accelerator and it will not go past I even turn on the turn signal and it will still not go past so autopilot is still able able to be tricked and like they said on autonomy day we are chasing the nines but I do end up having to take over before we pass this truck I hope one [Music]
