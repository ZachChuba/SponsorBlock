hallo everyone today we'll be discussing a new productivity method that has been gaining momentum across the internet and that method is called time batching you are curious about this Express tool using the links provided down below so essentially time batching dictates that similar or identical tasks should be tackled during the same period of time Salish a mindset for one task will then allow you to complete other similar tasks while saving your brain from shifting mindsets too often this basically saves energy boost your motivation and basically allows you to take less time and do more the good thing about time batching is that you can actually incorporate it into different parts of your life you can do it with your work schedule with your long-term projects and even with your habits if we use the concept of time batching for your work schedule we can actually implement this visually into a digital calendars so here I'm going to use Google Calendar to explain how you should use time batching to maximize your productivity when you are studying or doing your work so by using time batching you should basically do or tackle all of the same categorized tasks at the same time so first of all you should establish what's the time spend when you want to do your time batching so this means that you need to do your batching according to week monthly even yearly tasks so what's really important for you to understand is that you can do this in different times of your life so for instance I use a big yearly time batching method by going to all of my doctor's appointments at the same time so instead of going to different appointments in different parts of my year I always schedule a month of the year and it's usually May when it's my birthday and I schedule all my appointments in that month so I'm sure I'm good to go for the rest of the year if we talk about monthly batching I can say that I do some of my cleaning tasks on a monthly basis like in a specific weekend I also use time batching for a lot of my financial stuff so instead of having to go through all of my paperwork on a weekly basis I do it monthly on a full scheduled afternoon just to tackle paperwork and that takes care of the issue if we are going to talk about time batching in a weekly manner I can use my youtube schedule to actually explain how I do this so instead of brainstorming writing my script filming editing and taking thumbnail pictures for each YouTube video on a day or two or three days what I usually do is brainstorming three four or five videos in one or two bays and those two days are solely dedicated for researching and brainstorming then I will save one or two days to write the scripts or at least the bullet points or the topics for my videos and instead of doing that on a regular basis for each one of my videos I will save the day to do that for three four or five videos and that applies to each process of my YouTube schedule so that applies to brainstorming writing filming editing and so on what happens is when I enter into the mindset of writing I Manson by doing that specific task so instead of gaining momentum and getting to that mindset to that abandon that task and do something completely different like editing which is a more creative and technical task I instead save that whole day to do the writing thing and then I'll save a whole day to do the editing however you can also time batch long term projects I really wanted to write an e-book for a long time for this channel but when I started writing my master's thesis I was aware that if I was going to spend time writing an e-book as well as I was writing my dissertation I would not be able to fully optimize my mindset for writing for those two different projects so I decided that I wanted to write my dissertation in a shorter time by only writing my dissertation for a couple of months and after I finished that project I will start the e-book project and I could completely devote all my attention to that project instead of being worried about dividing my effort into two different tasks this also applies for things like language learning sometimes you're learning different languages at the same time and your mind is always jumping from the rules of one language to the rules of another language and when you're learning two or three different languages from scratch it's sometimes really difficult to carry on with that mindset for a long time so what I usually do is focusing on one language at a time and then reinforcing my past knowledge and switch back to another language you can also do time batching with habits so for instance if you started the new year with tons of different resolutions for habits like working out reading more and so on it may be very difficult for you to incorporate all of those new habits into your daily routine so what I suggest is try to concentrate your habits into monthly efforts can have the month of March that it came into fitness you can say that you want to incorporate new fitness habits into your life like drinking more water and be more active and you can try to do that for 30 days trains after that month you are going to reinforce those habit and you can start April and introduce a new habit that is focused around another part of your life you can start reading more during the month of April but really focusing on the fitness aspect during March you can then do this for the whole year to fully optimize your time and your attention to build strong habits without having to feel like you're abandoning new projects or that you're abandoning habits that you really can't incorporate into your daily routine don't forget subscribe to channel and I'll see you next week with more college/university and organization related videos bye
