4k ultra water Kaiser law okay how do you decide between 4k and ultra wide why not both introducing the LG 5k ultra wide feat your fiestas last wire allows Android device use offer code Lynas to get 25% off at the link below [Music] historically there have been mostly two different pixel counts for ultra wide monitors 2560 by 1080 which takes your standard 16 by 9 1080p monitor and stretches it by 1/3 and 34 40 by 1440 which does the same thing to a wqhd monitor both of them have an aspect ratio of 21 by 9 except it's not actually 21 by 9 it's more like 21 and 1/3 by 9 so 64 by 27 but I guess that didn't sound as sexy on the marketing materials and also I guess it's easier for people to understand 21 by 9 since most people are pretty familiar with how 16 by 9 looks so that means that visualizing 21 by 9 isn't as much of a stretch of the imagination as calling it 7 by 3 would have been anyway none of that is the point all of that stuff pales in comparison to the beast that we've got today this ladies and gentlemen is LG's 34 wk 95 eww I think the wk is for work like working it because this thing boasts over 11 million pixels that are so close to each other that if you tried to pass your body between them you would have to go through one cell at a time it is a lot of pixels and yet LG still doesn't call this resolution 5k they call it 5 K 2 K because they already make a 5 K monitor which has 3 million more pixels all in the vertical direction so IMHO even though there are 5,000 horizontal pixels here really this is more like a 4k ultra wide something that we've never seen before and a true 5k ultra wide should have a resolution of something like 68 20 by 2880 but let's not get ahead of ourselves here because 5k 2k is plenty sweet as it is its pixel density of 163 pixels per inch is almost exactly the same as a 27 4k monitor putting it at Apple retina levels from a reasonable viewing distance of 21 inches which means you will be blown away by the crazy sharp text assuming that is that your PC can actually drive this many pixels so if you're plugging the monitor into the display port port man I wish they had come up with a different name for that on your 10 series Nvidia or rx 400 series or newer AMD graphics card then you are golden if you're relying on the HDMI 2.0 ports then you are basically Sol you'll be capped at 30 for 40 by 1440 since even though 3840 by 2160 is available you can select it that is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio meaning it is squish ville so say no to HDMI as for if you're using the Thunderbolt 3 port probably on your laptop that's where things get really interesting because when we reviewed the LG 5k ultra-fine we learned that while it worked perfectly at full resolution with our 2016 MacBook we could only get about 4 and a half of those k's on a Windows machine the reason was that the available Thunderbolt 3 chipsets at that time only supported DisplayPort 1.2 which doesn't have nearly enough bandwidth for 5k at 60 Hertz it only worked on the MacBook because Apple cleverly used the capacity from the chipsets of two side-by-side ports to push all those pixels through but that changed ostensibly in early 2018 when Intel released a new Thunderbolt 3 chipset called Titan Ridge that supports DisplayPort 1.4 which can handle full 5k at 60 Hertz or even 8k at 30 Hertz off of a single port so okay that's great Linus how do I know if I have a Titan Ridge good question if you want a one chord solution to connect your laptop to an external display and potentially even charge it at the same time what you need is both a 2018 model laptop that has the new Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3 implementation you can check with your manufacturer to find that out and a discrete GPU since Titan Ridge isn't designed to work with Intel's integrated graphics and even if you have all that there's still no guarantee that it will charge your laptop so if you're a Windows user on a one cable laptop docking feature is a big focus for you be sure that you've got a compatible machine or you will be disappointed oh and by the way you can wipe that smug lot a moustache smirk off your faces 2018 MacBook users because currently Mojave has a bug preventing this monitor from working properly for you - the good news is that once these little details are ironed out this thing will not disappoint its color accuracy is fantastic out of the box we measured color differences that were on average indistinguishable to the human eye despite this not being a 10 bit panel thanks in part to LG's nano cell tech which if you're not familiar works on a similar principle to quantum dot but kind of the opposite so it filters out all the colors except the intended RG and B and its HDR capabilities are what I would describe as not bad now bear in mind that the 34 wk 95 u W only manages a peak brightness of 600 nits while 1000 nits is required IMO for a true ok this makes a really big difference HDR experience but at the very least it does sport the new vasive display HDR 600 certification which demands 90% coverage of the DCI p3 gamut a threshold that it crosses with ease the biggest deficiency with this panel at least on our particular unit was uniformity though and it was worst along the left edge and in the corners which are a little darker than the rest of the display and you could also make the argument that given the $1,500 price tag the looks of the monitor are clean but a little less premium than they could be with that said though personally I'd rather my money went towards a better panel and backlight solution than fancy casing for the most part anyway so bottom line should you buy this monitor I guess that depends on who you are if you're a gamer you're gonna find this thing pretty hard to drive like especially in triple-a titles and I would strongly recommend a higher refresh rate lower resolution alternative but if you specifically want large format and very high resolution the 34 wk 95 eww really is a best of both worlds solution that does a reasonable job of justifying its $1,500 price tag so go for it because the rest of the really big computer displays out there are 4k and even though they have a lot of pixels at this kind of size 4k won't be nearly as sharp as this and for my part anyway I prefer the ultra wide aspect ratio it's kind of like multi monitor but with no awesome bezels the mass drop Sennheiser description to join the drop and get your own HD 6 xx headphones so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like and subscribe maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we've featured at the link below also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts I shot a lot of videos in this shirt today that's awkward as I keep telling people to go check out our merch store you know what it's fine our merch store has cool shirts they're just not like this one and you can check out our community forum that's also link down they definitely join in sauce [Music]
