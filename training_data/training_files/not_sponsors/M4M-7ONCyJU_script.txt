[Music] this well this is the 600 I the most recent ship added to star citizen and certainly one of the best-looking however it's not without its flaws and in this video that's what we're gonna be talking about hey guys I'm morphologist and if you didn't know I'm a practicing architect in Taiwan now you might be wondering why on earth is that at all relevant to a star citizen video well let me tell you architects don't just build buildings we create spaces for the human being that means that we have an intimate understanding of the human scale and what makes humans feel comfortable or uncomfortable in any given space now to the communities credit there have been a lot of great statements about what has made the interior of the 600 AI unsuccessful namely the biggest one is that it's a large waste of space on the interior but that only partially gets at the issue so in this video I'll try to more accurately state what's wrong with the interior and if you haven't seen the 600 I well then you're also in for a treat before we continue though let me first state that I don't think that cloud imperium is did a terrible job it's actually wonderful the design Lee which is beautiful but as all designers know the design process is one of iteration and it's my hope that this video helps them make a better 600 eye for the next version so without further ado let's begin our first stop is the cockpit of the 600 eye it's one of the more beautiful spaces and certainly what they've accomplished with visibility is definitely to be commended the flowing lines the selection of materials are all excellent the panel is a ssin is beautiful I frankly love it however we start to see some of the issues with the design here in the back you see there's a difference between using design language successfully and correctly designing space the back of the cockpit area is basically unused there are no places to sit or access for any of the other crew that leaves basically 80 to 90 percent of the bridge unused during any sort of mission seems like quite a wasted opportunity perhaps some engineering stations might be useful in this area something certainly to consider but now let's move aft to the exploration module here we're immediately greeted by a very large holographic readout which will presumably help us scan the area it's wonderful it's very large and easily readable however it's the surrounding space that really seems to fall short and utilize the space pretty poorly again here we can see very consistent design language and material selection just as we saw in the cockpit however it's the way that the language was utilized that makes it very difficult to use the science stations are actually separated from the main holographic readout which means that I've eyes the captain want to directly communicate with the science officers I have to step through this door here and talk to them this seems very unintuitive and quite user unfriendly I'm not quite sure what the thought process was behind the wall and splaying the program but I would recommend removing it completely in keeping the struts as some sort of structural piece not only that I'm not sure why the science stations are facing away from one another I would believe that they would want to actually communicate and facing away I don't have you ever talked to somebody before while facing away from them it's actually very hard to hear them so why not just have both of these consoles facing the large holographic display that way when the captain comes in they can also communicate with the captain without having to turn their heads 90 degrees to the right or left over although I love the glass floor and the design of the room is quite nice probably a bit too spacious probably try to figure out something more with some of these circulation paths instead of having so much circulation maybe some more readouts or consoles would be better suited moving further after we see a lift and a very well-designed staircase which fits perfectly with the 600 eyes design language next we are visiting here the armoury which I believe has absolutely nothing wrong so I'm going to kind of skip over this space and not speak too much about it now we're getting into one of the cooler parts of the ship the rear end is really for relaxation of the crew and it is pretty darn cool definitely very reminiscent of high-end yachts but again the design language is well utilized but the space is not I'm not quite sure what the benefit of having so much space behind the bar is and having so little circulation path around it also why are there only two seats in front of it why not move the bar against the back wall have ourselves a bit more for a seating area and even have maybe a dance floor behind it or some additional tables I'm not quite sure why the bar had to be located in the middle the circulation around the side that was just fine and I really like this rear end seating area it's a little bit low and makes it hard to look out horizontally from the ship but vertically it's pretty uninterrupted and gorgeous though I wonder why the table is so far from a seating area it seems quite difficult to reach if I wanted to put my drinks down maybe some interstitial places to put drinks between the long bench and the back would be nice but otherwise I think it's silver all pretty nice I like the added wood accent as well it gives a bit more of a luxurious feeling to it and sees how a lot of this ship is so large and so spacious it's nice to also see a bit of a more intimate space here with this little seating area this back one is quite large and I really can't see myself having a very comfortable intimate conversation there but now that we've looked at this upper half of the entertainment area of the 600 I let's look at the lower half actually I think the lower part of the ship is quite intimate which I enjoy I think large spaces can be sometimes confused for luxurious but often times they're not it feels nice to be able to hang out with friends in an area that feels human scales and this back pool table area certainly feels that way definitely would love to play a game of pool back here the separation wall seems a little bit strange I'm not quite sure why you'd want to have it there it makes so much of that space inaccessible perhaps maybe removing that or moving it or adjusting its position might be a bit better this kitchen area back here though is quite nice again the stools are a bit strange of not quite sure why they're fixed or so far away from the actual table it seems like it'd be very uncomfortable to use it seeing as how you'd be so far away from the plate that you're eating from maybe having some more or moveable ones would be nice kitchen counter is nice definitely a bit more upscale from Ikea I would say I think there's nothing really wrong with it the refrigerator looks fine the material selection looks amazing I don't think I wouldn't change much the only thing I might be concerned with this stuff sliding around but I'm sure they've got some sort of future magnets holding stuff together now we're gonna start talking a bit less about the interior design and more about the arrangement of spaces because this part of the ship is really strangely located I have no idea why they didn't add an alternative access point to get to storage and engineering that doesn't go through the area that would presumably most often have passengers in it if I'm a billionaire in space a space billionaire from star citizen and I've paid good money to be transported on this 600 I why would I want my relaxation space interrupted by an engineer suddenly walking across my field of view this wouldn't be done in real life and so I really think that they should very strongly consider making an alternative route it could be a ladder or something it doesn't have to be easily accessible by a non-professional user it just has to have a way to get here without having to walk across the view of the guests not being said this area is very well designed I love the blue lighting it really denotes that it's a very different kind of space from the very warm and intimate VIP area very well done in that sense it's also very well designed for the fact that it's an area of the ship that will most often not be seen by the large majority of users when I digress let's move on to the lower deck of the ship [Music] now here we see an exceptionally well thought-out piece of the design of the 600 I the elevator or lift has a different sort of design language the doors are glass and different and you can see the interior space as being circular without even having to have anybody tell you or look at a sign I'm guessing that you guys immediately knew that this was a vertical lift that was going to bring you to a different part of the ship that is successful design being able to convey with the design the function of the space they've done it very well here at the end of the hallway down into the right from getting off the lift we arrive here at the crew quarters personally I find the space to be the least successful interior design an arrangement of space in the entire 600 I the reason for that is that although the crew cubbies here for where they sleep is extremely well designed denoting the difference in space by using a different type of softer material looks like leather and pleated fabric it's extremely exposed to the rest of the crew members what this means is that in long-haul flights which assuming this ship will have since it's an exploration vessel they'll have to be exposed to each other not only on duty but off duty imagine having to live with your coworkers face to face all the time for months on end I imagine without any privacy it would kind of start to get on your nerves so a great deal of wasted space in that area in the center which I'm not quite sure how to utilize in this area of the ship it's very much the same miss ceiling is very low the lighting is very low which although is very comfortable for a sleeping area is somewhat claustrophobic there are no windows to the outside and there are no plans to soft in the space plants and windows help create a more comfortable atmosphere the color blue in terms of blue lighting is also often used in sight Airlines to give people a more comfortable calming feeling there been a number of studies done by Boeing that has shown that the color blue is actually a much more therapeutic and soothing color to other ends of a spectrum something to think about something else very strange about the crew quarters here is the size of the bathroom now the bathrooms are very well designed don't get me wrong they're spacious and comfortable and I certainly wouldn't mind having something so large on a long-haul vessel however why separate the men's and women's and have a privacy door if you've got no privacy dividers in the sleeping quarters it seems like a very large disconnect in terms of design philosophy my recommendation reduce the size of the bathrooms and create a shared space this would allow for an increased amount of area allotted to the crew quarters allowing for separators any larger amount of space per cabin so that the crew members also feel comfortable perhaps even consider adding a separate area for them to dine considering they're probably not going to be eating with the VIP guests but now let's move on to the cargo area of the ship where you can store your vehicle now of all the places in the entirety of the 600 I this is probably the only space where a lot of space makes sense here we can see a place to put your spacesuit places to store boxes and plenty of space to walk around where you would park your Ursa Rover or cyclone there's also this wonderful visual connection to the upper half of the Explorer module where I can see the science stations and the holographic readout the last thing I really like about this is just how much space there is around where you park the vehicle unlike in the constellation you actually have space once you get your vehicle inside but now we move on to the very best part of the 600 I the captains quarters [Music] this is probably the best conceived space on the interior of the ship this little nook area for working for the captain the seating area to invite guests ins that have conversations and perhaps a cigar and the sleeping area with the panoramic view of the front of the ship are all will wonderfully conceived its intimate it's low it's well lit I can't really say anything negative about this space and there's nothing that I would change and I think that this is a great place to end the video because this is an excellent example of how to properly employ the origin design language in a way that uses the space intelligently you don't need a huge amount of space to feel luxurious and well put together you see this space is smaller than the crew quarters and yet for some reason it feels more comfortable everything is much better conceived everything fits and and that feeling of things fitting elegantly is so much more high-end than a large open space devoid of any reason ever could be so I want to leave you with this thought while the design language of the 600 I is successful and beautiful and the selection of materials is wonderful and consistent the utilization of space is very inconsistent and the arrangement of space could use a lot of help in terms of what program should be accessible to what user there's a lot of space on the 600 eye that could be reconfigured to make a lot more sense and feel like you're getting a lot more out of the ship than you currently are so I hope this video helps the creators over there at cloud Imperium games come up with the next best iteration of the 600 eye so co crew and join me and a video in the future anyway guys to be super cheesy I'll see you guys around the verse [Music]
