hey what's going on YouTube we just got a new software if they 2020 28.24 our white model 3 in this video I'm going to show you the release notes and I'm also going to take a test drive so let's jump right yuge thank you goes out to our little as $1 a month ok so here the release notes for 2022 28.2 so it looks like we if you have a traffic light and stop sign control enable you can now increase the speed up to +5 miles per hour so they disable that a few software updates ago you could only go to the speed limit and so now you can go +5 miles an hour over the speed limit something i've graped and complained about in previous videos so really nice to see that next is we now have polish as a language so if that is your language of choice so really cool to see tesla continuing to support multiple new languages so that is it for the release notes here everything else is previous release notes so let's go and see how 2020 that 28.2 drives something that I did see electric post was that you could turn off the climate control with this new software update for the passenger seat now I have a 2018 model 3 don't see any sort of settings in here where I can turn off this other vent because I don't have a passenger and it goes off of the I guess the seat sensor knowing that nobody is sitting there it'll turn off the vent right up here but definitely don't see any setting this button down here is for the rear AC so don't see any setting in here where I can turn off this vent and only have the driver vent going and there was word I saw some comments on Twitter saying that there it was only for modeled wise so definitely leave a comment down below if you have a mono Y or you've also heard that all right here we go we're testing software update twenty twenty dot 22 8.2 and as you can see I had the relative speed and my cruise control is set to plus five and it automatically takes me to plus five over the posted speed limit which is 35 miles an hour so that is really great to see that they added that back if you guys recall from one of my previous videos when I did a software update video when they started enabling the stoplight and stop sign detection they reduced that to the max speed of whatever the posted speed limit so in this case it would be 35 miles an hour so with this software update 20-20-20 8.2 we also we get the plus 5 the ability to go 5 miles per hour over the posted speed limit so the road is gonna get really curvy here so let's see how this new update handles these really aggressive turns we have a big bend coming up here we're going downhill and a big bend going back right to the right-hand slowing down all the way to 32 from 40 miles an hour down to 30 so slowing down 10 miles per hour to navigate that really beautiful job by the autopilot there now we are back up to 40 miles per hour 5 miles per hour over the posted speed limit as I have that set in the settings here we have a write curve coming up going 5 miles 6 miles per hour below what it was going and now left been doing a really good job going really smooth around these pretty aggressive curves now we have a beautiful sunset in front of us so you guys can enjoy that right along with me some pretty aggressive bends coming up as you can see from that sign right over there really aggressive curves coming up going downhill as well the autopilot is doing a great job using that regenerative braking to control the speed going down to 30 29 miles per hour so down 11 miles per hour down 12 miles per hour down 27 26 great job by autopilot if you guys have watched my Kirby country road test and especially my most recent one with no Lane lines the autopilot is definitely doing a great job and struggle sometimes when it reaches a point where the curve is too aggressive so really nice to see it this new update 2020 that 28.2 being able to handle those a really aggressive curves so I'll show you in the settings if we go into the settings - autopilot and we go down to speed limit that's where we can see the offset is +5 so if you guys want the same settings that I have here where to automatic that goes 5 miles per hour over the posted speed limit the maximum that Tesla will let you go then you go over here to offset under autopilot in your settings and hit relative speed to +5 and that'll get you that setting here we are approaching a stoplight and it is identifying that a stoplight and it's identified it as yellow and now red so it is going to come to a complete stop no involvement from me as a driver I'm not pushing the brake pedal you can see by the blue steering wheel that is still in autopilot and stops automagically at this red light now when the light does turn green because I'm not following a vehicle I do have to press the accelerator pedal or I have to pull down on the gear stock in order for it to go through the stoplight a couple software updates ago they added if I was the second car so if I was behind this black car that's behind me and I was following that car and the light did turn green then it would go and follow that car through the intersection here we go we have a green light I'm gonna heading knowledge and the car and the autopilot is going to go straight ahead so now having tested this software version on several different roads it is operating really smooth the only noticeable thing is that I'm allowed to go five miles per hour over the posted speed limit so I can go here I can go up to 50 miles per hour and I think since this is a divided highway I can go more than five miles per hour over so you see I'm going ten miles per hour over there but I'm gonna go back down to only five miles per hour over so I don't get a speeding ticket but other than the speed limit change no noticeable improvements yet but I'll be sure to run this through my aggressive testing including the curvy country road test if you guys haven't seen that I'll leave a link up here in the corner for you to check that below in the description I hope you guys subscribe button as always I will see you guys in the next one
