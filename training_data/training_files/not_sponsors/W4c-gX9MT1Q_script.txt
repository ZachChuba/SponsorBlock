The universe is expanding - so does that mean
there's a center from which everything is stretching? I mean, it LOOKS like the center is here,
because this point didn't move when we scaled. But we could just as easily have watched the
scaling from this star, or this one, and they each "look" like the center. In fact, ANY time you scale anything up or
down, there's no real center to the scaling. I mean, this square was clearly scaled up
from its center... I mean, its corner. I mean, that point over there. The point... is, sure there may be points
that stay in the same place because of your frame of reference, which is why it appears
to us as if the earth is the center of the expansion of the universe, but to someone
in the Andromeda Galaxy it would appear that THEY were the center of the expansion. In short, if you're too close-minded to view
the universe from different perspectives, it's easy to think you're at the center of
the universe. Maybe that's the universe's way of making
us all feel special?
