did you hear that that's the sound of crispy crunchy korean fried chicken in the and boy is it gonna be good goes together pretty quick and then we're eating i can't wait who can't wait thank you silent people behind the camera you guys have voices you can't use them you know we don't do this fourth wall thing gentlemen let's try that again who can't wait yeah there you go chance and max thank you for finally waking the hell up we'll start with our chicken we're just gonna cut it up it's very simple start chicken thighs right here look i love the thighs because they're they're they're they're more tender they're more juicy they just don't dry out as much so i want these in sort of bite-size-ish pieces like this we're going to cut them we're just going to drop them in our bowl for now and all we'll be fine and i'm not really going to give a [ __ ] about little bits of fat that are on here what i am going to give a [ __ ] about is this freaking fly that's seemingly everywhere he's really starting to piss me off max anyway continue on with your thighs until they're all cut i don't really need to give you too much conversation here because well we're just cutting slightly larger than bite-sized pieces and we're fine you're obsessed with thighs well do you not agree no i know at times i do think that thighs are better but at times i think that breasts are better sometimes i just like a non-complicated piece of chicken how is this complicated because there's cartilage and fat and breast is just white meat just straight nothing complicated about it i may have gotten him i may have gotten him and let us know are you a thigh person or a breast person and we're talking chicken that's what we're talking we are we're talking chicken wait we're not talking chicken [Music] oh it's gonna be good i'm telling you right now all right next we season a bit so here's our chicken nicely cut up we're going to season it with a little salt and pepper let me show you this first you know what that is that's kosher salt and pepper already mixed people ask about it uh look i have one with salt and i have one with salt and pepper because 90 of the time i need them both and then it's just a quick pinch and then i go so we'll mix this around a tiny bit more and then the important step oops watch again our key to the crispness is twofold one will be double frying and the second will be potato starch not bob's necessarily but this is the one i happen to have potato starch will make this light and crispy and wonderful so we open our bag we're gonna toss some on top and work everything around here we go now we'll mix and we want to do this well we want everybody coated well so i'm going to add another amount to this but we'll start with this it's funny i don't know if you can hear this i'm going to try and get close it sounds like when you're walking through fresh snow it's crazy huh exactly okay i'm just gonna go down to the street and get the newspaper really snowed last night okay this is good a little bit more and you want to make sure that all your pieces are coated nicely and when they are matched you know what we do next fry yes attaboy i knew it poor max i asked these questions and i see the fear in his face gotta want answer wrong nothing happens for the wrong answer max except you make fun of me well that's what fathers do all right let's fry this [ __ ] my oils at 350 will lower the basket and we'll start to put our pieces in after we give them a little shake to get off extra potato starch and we're going to give this a first initial fry of eight minutes and then we'll take it out we'll do the next batch we're going to do this in twos because what we don't want to do is put too much chicken in here because it'll drop the temperature of the oil you want to keep it where it is which is 350. i mean anywhere between 340 and 360 you're gonna be fine a couple more pieces one more and now we wait i always like to have a look to make sure everything's okay give it a little bit of this to make sure nobody's sticking to each other now we set our clock and we come back in eight and our eight minutes is up our first fry for this first half of the batch is done we'll let it drain for a second a little shake we'll bring him out put them on the pan put the next batch in in they go we're just shaking off the excess dropping them in carefully nobody wants to be splattered with oil we're good and batch two is ready so same drill out it comes we let it drip off oh these guys will come we're gonna let these guys cool for just a couple of seconds before we refry everybody once more but right now we'll make our sauce oh damn it what the hell never mind five second rule look you're gonna love this chicken so much you could put almost anything on it and it would be delicious but in keeping with our korean fried chicken theme we're using a main korean ingredient and that is gochujang yeah which is a red pepper paste we've used it before now you can get this in many western supermarkets you don't need to go to specialty markets for it i say many look if you're in the middle of iowa and your supermarket is a place called bucky's probably not finding this definitely on amazon and in bigger markets for sure you get you're going to get your hands on gochujang so this is what it is you open it up there's this little protective layer and it looks like this it looks like super thick and rich ketchup and we're gonna go with oh like three tablespoons of it in here that's like two maybe and then we'll add the rest and the rest consists of some soy sauce i've used a thick one just because i like it a little splash of sesame oil remember little bit good a lot bad couple tablespoons of honey the sweetness will round out the spice from the gochujang about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for a little acidic kick last definitely not least a big couple cloves of garlic squeezed in and we mix lovely wow this is going to coat our chicken and give it the most incredible flavor right let's get back to our final frying now that it's been fried you don't have to worry about them sticking you can probably load this guy up with almost all of this chicken i've turned the temperature up a little bit so we're about 365. i think we're gonna be okay here we're gonna go another eight minutes with this load let's see if this works i hope i haven't overloaded it now and we're in then you notice it's not sizzling like crazy right away because it's already been cooked and when the eight minutes is up out they come we let them drip the oil off a little bit and then we put them in a bowl and i want you to listen carefully because this is the real payoff you ready unbelievable all right i want you to listen to somebody everybody turn off everything around you just listen to this unbelievable now we're going to add our sauce and not all of it we're going to do it sparingly and i like it in a wide bowl i didn't want it all clumped on top of each other so now we'll drizzle some sauce in you can always add more i want it to have sauce i don't want it to be laced with sauce so let's see how this looks one more and now we'll gently mix it [Applause] honestly it's like i'm stirring rocks [Applause] okay a little bit more look you can add as much or as little as you want i'm gonna be happy with i think this all right let's prettier up a little bit here's what we're going to do i'm going to take our serving cast iron pan because i love it and with these guys we're just going to mound up in here wait do you hear the crunch that comes out of these oh boy i'm super excited for these and now we give them only two more things of course some green onion look you have to have that it's just not gonna be right and some toasted sesame seeds on top hello my friend look how beautiful you are it's so beautiful i'll just do the slow runway turn hi buddies what the hell i'm ready come on let's eat one this guy's just sitting around doing nothing let's have him because why wouldn't we sesame oil gochujang wait for it let me tell you something i'm so happy look we've all had fried chicken before that's coated with a super thick crust a little bit of chicken a lot of crust that's not what this is this is a light coating that that potato starch does all the right things for this and this you'll be so happy if you make this so happy wait that's a mean face so happy that's the right face thanks for being here thanks for watching subscribing liking smashing the
