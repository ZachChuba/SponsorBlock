website or online store make it with Squarespace imagine shooting a feature film as a crew of one writing directing shooting starring editing everything behind the camera and in front of it what level of insanity would you need to pull such a feat off Jamie Stewart is one such madman his DIY feature film a motion selfie is set for release this spring and recently we sat down over a cup of joe and talked about what it took for him to bring the movie to life if you're an aspiring filmmaker who feels paralyzed by a lack of resources Jamie's advice might be the antidote you need enjoy most of my audience watching this video have probably they've probably never heard of you and they've never heard of a motion selfie I only recently learned about you through a retweet from filmmaker magazine I think about the IndieGoGo and I've watched the pitch video and really kind of fell in love with the concept so give us the elevator pitch for the film and the elevator pitch of you sure I would describe a motion selfie basically as a DIY reinvention of the silent film it's a movie that took me two and a half years to complete entirely as a crew of one I directed it I starred in it I photographed it edited it did the color the music the compositing everything when I'm in front of the camera there's literally nobody behind the camera it is as DIY as it gets but it's done in this like hyper polished hyper controlled manner there's nothing low-budget I kind of developed this style over the course of you know whatever 30 years I was an only child so I would be shooting short films by myself all the time and it wasn't something that like I ever aspired to be doing but it was the type of thing that like from time to time I would do because I needed to do and I just was comfortable with it and I just got really good at it I was I was very impressed by the by the pitch video it was just very polished very well edited and it seemed like you really showcased an ability to do a lot with very little yeah which obviously if project like this calls for and you know I love the the dynamic nature of the shots that you were using the ending style how did you find your way into filmmaking I seem to think I was always going to be a filmmaker I don't know that I was always going to be a director I made my first short film when I was I believe I was 12 it was a stop-motion claymation book report for jaws that the teacher I think she gave me an F on it because it took so long to finish which was kind of ridiculous and then after that family got our first VHS camcorder so I was doing stuff and then I got really into special makeup effects it was like a late 80s so you know it's like Nightmare on Elm Street and all that stuff was big and Fangoria so I got really into special makeup effects and and my mother was really great because she would like contact the best people in the business and just so I could meet them I would be like 14 15 years old and it turned out Dick Smith lived like 25 minutes from us so she wrote him a letter and he invited me over to his house and I went to his basement and I got to see all of the original like molds and you know The Exorcist and a little big man and everything I went to we went on vacation to LA one time and my mother calls him Rick Baker's office and so I got to go visit his studio a1a Fangoria makeup contest one time but like simultaneous to that two things kind of happened one it was kind of the dawn of the big-budget mute music videos on MTV and you had like David Fincher started really blowing up like around the end of 88 and his stuff was just so much better than everything else out there that it stood out everything the editing the photography so on and so I started getting really into that stuff and then shortly after that we got our first laserdisc player and so I was able to you know instead of seeing movies on VHS I could see like these high quality movies in widescreen and then also at that time independent film first blew up so all of these things were just kind of happening at the same time and I just got sucked into it you you know you weren't picturing yourself as a director you you want to be involved in you know in movies in some way shape or form were you thinking more like the makeup department or for a little for a little while I was really into it but the thing is you know this I never had anybody to put the makeup on except myself right right and so I got really sick and tired of it and simultaneously you know I had the VHS camera and then I started writing screenplays I wrote my first feature-length screenplay when I was like 16 I think and I just started banging those out by the time I was 23 I think I'd written like 9 or 10 screenplays so it was just at a certain point and so by the time I graduated high school I was I had done a couple of documentaries that I shot at my high school and New York Film Academy had like just opened they didn't even have like their big offices yet they were renting some space down in De Niro's Tribeca building and then like some classrooms like you have to like run around like try like Soho to like different spaces to go to and stuff like that and I did that right out of high school and at the time I was the youngest student they had ever taken on they hadn't taken on anybody who was like 18 so I actually had to go there an interview with the owner just to make sure that like I was mature enough to like write do that and you know from that point on you know I I was gonna be a filmmaker and so it's just been kind of a you know figuring it out from there the concept of the film seems like the perfect DIY filmmaking concept you know you've literally stripped away everything yes that requires anybody else and there are plenty of people out there that I think probably find themselves in similar shoes in that they want to make movies they want to do stuff an independent film but it's just them like you said they don't have anybody to put the makeup on except themselves what what advice would you give to a complete nobody who wants to get started in moviemaking but they have no resources they have no friends they have no connections maybe they just have a camera and that's it what advice would you give to them as somebody who has successfully completed a feature film as a as a one-man army well what advice would you give to them well the first thing I'm gonna say and I say this a lot okay so about 15 years ago I was at an event and I briefly got to meet George Lucas and I point-blank asked him what advice he had and he gave me a one-word answer perseverance so that's the first thing I'm gonna say perseverance play the long game you know you might make a short film and maybe it doesn't come out as good as you know you expected it to or maybe it's not a successful on the festival circuit where it doesn't get as many views on YouTube or whatever as you expected move on to the next thing keep going play the long game so that's you know first of all second learn your craft don't just decide you know I'm a filmmaker and I'm gonna make a feature I you know I thought I was gonna have my first feature made 20 years ago and it didn't happen like that you know it took a lot longer but in the meantime I got really really good at what I was doing which isn't to say that it might not have been good if I made you know a more conventional movie 20 years ago but it's like anything else the more you do something the more you practice at it the better you get so that's the other thing keep doing it and get better and better at what you're doing just practice and practice and you know the other thing is is make sure your material is good you know that's it that's another you know it's not going to go anywhere if you you don't have a good script or a good you know sense of storytelling or whatever so it's it's kind of all of these things but it all still kind of goes back to Lucas's answer which is perseverance you know don't give up if you really want something stick to it I agree 100% I mean I've been on YouTube for 11 years I think and only this past year and a half have I you know actually found I think in the past you know a year and a half my you know I was at a thousand subscribers in this time two years ago if I hadn't persevered through the times where nobody was watching you know I wouldn't have been set for when people did start watching and I think it you know it takes that kind of long 40 years in the in the desert to hone your craft and to learn what works and what doesn't well let me ask you a question what was there something specific that triggered this the increase when that started happening there was I basically changed my entire thinking of online of what I wanted to do with YouTube so before the growth started happening I would put maybe one short film on there every year because I usually made a short film a year maybe two short films a year and I would just upload that and just a bunch of short films and then what you could just call glorified camera tests and that was it and I wasn't connecting with an audience at all it was me just kind of throwing a thing on there and letting people watch it or throwing a camera test on there just cuz I thought it looked cool and then I kind of changed my thinking and I had to ask myself kind of a sobering question which is I looked at my channel and all the videos I posted and I asked myself why would anybody watch this because why would anybody sit there and watch seven camera tests back to back to back that have no story that have no entertaining value and I decided to really focus on putting quality writing into what I was doing and trying to tell stories through the videos it sounds so simple to say but writing for an audience in I did the audience to come and watch you basically you basically developed a style for yourself right absolutely yeah now that was basically you know back in 2013 when I decided to focus on just doing this thing where I'm shooting myself it's kind of that same thing you know you you realize you're at a point where something isn't working here you know I've been working for a number of years I had a pretty big bounce after I had like my big viral short with Eddie with the tripod and you know that had kind of worn off at that point and it was just kind of like well what am I gonna do now and you're just kind of like say okay this is what I'm gonna do and you just kind of keep doing it was this film completely planned out with was it a planned out affair or was it something sporadic that you made over you know a period of time how long did it take to shoot was it you know did you set out saying I'm gonna make a feature film all by myself or was this several shorts that all came together I started doing like digital DIY my first stuff with like mini DV and Final Cut was like late 2001 early 2002 by 2004 I started doing web shorts and this is before there was YouTube you know I was this is like when if you wanted to put videos up you needed to like literally upload like these tiny little quick times that would be like 320 by 240 in size and what happened was I had a website with a friend where we covered movies so he would do movie reviews and I would interview filmmakers and actors and things like that and so I already had a foot in press and I had this idea that I could somehow merge that with my filmmaking I was still trying to get regular scripted features made in 2013 there was a movie that I had been trying to get made for about six years and it fell apart and I was basically just done with it at that point and I needed to you know figure out what am I gonna do now what am I good at and I just you know I spent like maybe about four or five months writing bits and pieces of scripts just you know maybe all just maybe I'll forget about trying to be an innovative you know filmmaker who like messes with the form and stuff like that and maybe I'll be like an indie James Cameron and just like focus on like you know technology or something like that and do sci-fi so and I but nothing was ever like really clicking I do like the first 10 or 15 pages and then I'd lose interest in the scripts and then it just kind of occurred to me well I'm really good at shooting myself nobody else is doing this so what if I were to make an entire feature just doing this well if I was going to do a feature and I was gonna try to sell people on this I needed to have like a style that was fully thought through so I just started breaking it down what year do I need how can I use that year to tell a story visually for instance like I like moving the camera but you know unless I am spending a couple thousand dollars on a you know really high-end slider with you know motion controls you know that can do stuff like that I'm stuck doing it by hand so well I can't very well do that on myself I can't you know move a slider on me and make it look good so what types of shots can I do with the slider that I'm not in so it could be something like for instance I look over at something and then my point of view pushes in on that thing that I'm looking in on and I just started breaking the style down and that's kind of what I did and so to answer your question about how pre-planned it was it was completely and totally not pre-planned I just start shooting and I figure it out as I go along the only thing I knew at the beginning was that it was gonna take me at least a year to shoot and I just knew that from my experience you know because it's so time demanding not just shooting myself but you know the whole thing is cut to music so it has a very high volume of shots there's thirty six hundred shots in 90 minutes which is insane and so I just knew that it was gonna take me at least a year to shoot so the story needs to take place at least over the course of the year so that was kind of built into it and then the first actor that I brought on board Booth's small enough who I had worked with before I kind of came up with a concept where he would be like some guy who was kind of obsessed with these celebrity photos that I post online that was kind of all we knew at the very beginning was that it was gonna take place over the course of a year it was gonna be kind of like this stalker thriller thing and then we just kind of I would just start shooting stuff and very slowly it you know the pieces started falling into place and it was always totally fluid you know I'd come up with one idea it wouldn't you know for whatever reason we couldn't do it I'd have to come up with a creative solution and do something else I'd hire actors to play you know one role and I'd realized we can't do that but I like the actor so then I would come up with something else for them so it's it was you know in that sense it was pure chaos but what we wound up with is something that's just completely and totally controlled from the behind the scenes stuff that I saw I learned that you basically had to learn music composition to you know to make the music for the film and that you know you do that as well there's a lot of people who shoot their own stuff but many of us are dependent upon you know royalty free music and and licensing music but you were able to do both which I think you said in one of you behind the scenes clips made you kind of you know the whole package of the DIY filmmaker well like what happened was like back in back back when I was a kid like back when I was in high school I had like a rock band that I was in and and after that I had like a an old cassette for track so I had written like tons of songs I think I had you know when I was younger I've written somewhere in the vicinity probably a hundred songs and I used to like make my own like full-length like albums and you know I Xerox the copy and I'd hand it out to friends but I never did anything with it I was like horrified about playing live you know I'm not social I didn't you know so I never did anything with the music and then like in early 2011 I had had a huge viral hit at the end of 2010 with the short film called Eddie with the tripod which Roger Ebert like fell in love with and I was on the Today Show actually the last time I did Skype was when the Today Show was interviewing me yeah and you'd company then right yeah yeah and and so I just I just found myself with a little bit of extra cash I had done my price went up you know after that it has some extra cash and I just said you know what I'm gonna take some of my old songs and I'm gonna rerecord them now onto my computer using like GarageBand and I can use you know like electronic drums and I can plug in an electric guitar like actually make it sound like something more than just like me with some cassette for track and I got comfortable working with you know the musical tools and you know but the jobs that I was getting hired on I was still having to use like those crappy library tracks and you know let's say I'd get hired to do a job where there's maybe you know five six seven videos as part of a series you know you spend so much time just browsing through this library trying to find something that makes sense and you know there's none of the tracks sound alike and there's no you know conformity to any of it and just kind of on a whim at the end of 2011 I decided on a particular video I might as well just try doing my own music because I I know I can do it it just had never occurred to me to do it and it went all right and then after that I just started regularly doing the music - a lot of the videos that I was doing however the the thing the funny thing is most of those videos you know they're short form things so I might only need to compose like a minute of music for something and so I definitely miscalculated how long it was going to take me to do the music for the movie right right you know I thought I thought I could get it done fairly quickly but you know composing 90 minutes of music it's pretty tough job yeah it's you know that's like two symphonies basically I mean there there are people who that's there that is their job for two years of production is trying to come up with all the musical elements and and you're you know you're doing it all and tackling it all yourself so apart from the apart from the audio aspect let's move and talk about the video part of it because from what I understand you shot this thing on the Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera correct when that camera was first announced and you look at it on paper I thought that's a really cool camera and then when they released the camera and I actually got to see it used practically you know I got rid of mine and I thought there is no way that anyone will ever make a feature film on this this camera because it just had so many sort of technical drawbacks to it I I thought maybe some people will make some short films on this camera I really doubt it anyone would do it anything comprehensive with all of a sudden you show up 2018 you're about to release a feature film that's shot yeah on this camera so what was your experience with the camera it was the absolute perfect camera for this Wow because you think about it I need to be really mobile and the thing is tiny I wanted a camera it was more important to me that I had a camera that could shoot raw rather than 4k you know even there's there's like there's a series of sequences that take place at a karate dojo and Blackmagic was nice enough to actually send me one of their IRS's because before the 4.6 it was like the original model I needed I needed that camera for those sequences too I wanted to shoot slow motion but the pod cameras I haven't like I had the only thing negative that I can say about it in terms of my work is that the batteries don't last long and there were plenty of killer things yeah me was that battery and yeah yeah well I didn't need the audio again yeah that's that's why you say it's a great it's the great and perfect camera for your film because your film kind of played to your your fit your film plays to your the strengths of the equipment that you have which is something that lots of indie film makers particularly guys who are just starting out and doing low no budget stuff they they don't really understand is that you have to play to the strengths of your equipment the raw video is the big aspect of them of the black magic of the Blackmagic camera line and so it seemed like it was the perfect fit for were there anything it was there anything else with the technical stuff I mean there's got to be tons of drawbacks when you're shooting everything yourself did you what were the positives of a one-man crew and what were the negatives you know to be honest with you most of the stuff that I've shot has been one-man crew stuff so like it's something that I know forwards backwards you know sideways upside down at this point it's something that I'm very comfortable with you know not not to do the whole stupid 10,000 hours kind of thing but like you know I'd done 20,000 hours of it it's it's and so not having like a crew of people with me wasn't a big deal because again like I had thought all of this through so for instance let's say I want to do a shot where the camera is pushing in on something like you know maybe it's a shot where like like a notification pops up on my phone I look over at the phone and the camera pushes in on the phone and we see the notification on the phone well rather than pulling focus while I'm moving the camera what I would do is like normally maybe I'd be shooting with an ND - you know so that there would be a shallower depth of field so first of all what I'll do is I'll take the nd off and so that I have more more in focus and then I'll focus to like the farthest back point so that as I'm pushing in a huge bunch of it is already just staying in focus as I'm moving camera so I don't have to worry about the focus and then I know the spot that I need to end on is the very far point of the focus another thing that I went over in one of the videos is since I was shooting with practical light most of the time is I would do a lot of multiple exposures when I needed to so like for instance there might be a window in the shot that's totally blown out well I'll get a second exposure where I'm just exposing for the window and then I'll composite it afterwards and that you know that could involve rotoscoping or whatever there's one sequence in the movie that I shot in Dumbo by the Manhattan Bridge where the the problem was shooting in that area is because of the buildings and because of the bridge you're either in the light or you're in the shadows and there's there's no way it you know around it and the odds aren't any given shot you do you're gonna have one or the other in the shot so if you set your exposure for the light part the shadows are gonna be dark and if you you know expose for the shadows the light part is going to be overexposed so I would have to get multiple exposures of all these things and then stitch it together and post the only drawback to doing everything myself I do have any drawback to shooting other people that wasn't so much an issue because I can figure out the shots very quickly the biggest issue was more just thinking through this stuff where I'm on camera and it's just me because that stuff a lot of times was like two steps forward one step back I'd shoot stuff I'd look at it and I'd be like that isn't quite right you know I need to go back and reshoot this stuff but from a technical perspective it wasn't a big deal because I'd done so much of it already right I mean with with having you know the one-man crew it's got to make sort of the guerilla style of filmmaking so much easier because if you just want to go and shoot something somewhere real quick by yourself you can just you know knocked out of the park when when I have to do shots that involve you know even just a crew of four or five there's a lot of walking in setting up and tearing down and all of it has to be very pre-planned and very scheduled that's right if it's just you and your camera I mean you there's so much spontaneity that freedom freedom allows you to if you want to go somewhere or you just happen upon a cool location you can just set the camera up real quick and and start recording you know so there's got to be you know some positives and some and some negatives to both of it but it's been fun to see in the little snippets of the film that I've seen how you were able to how you were able to mediate between the two extremes so it'll be it'll be interesting to see the entire film what are your distribution plans that you have for it I know you had the IndieGoGo I don't know if you had a flex goal or not was it flex go like a yeah yeah it was it was you know whatever I get I get I think my goal was 4500 but I knew that I needed a minimum of three and so I wound up with like whatever I wanted was like 37 or something and so you know I'm okay it would have been nice if I'd gotten a little bit more but but I wound up with you know at least what I needed right I'm gonna start it at Vimeo on demand which is like the easiest thing to do I've already been using you know Vimeo for years all I need to do now is just you know pay a couple hundred bucks for a pro account and they have great features because I knew the previous incarnation of it which was vhx and right before I got started shooting the movie they used to do these open houses where you could go there and they talk about their platform and everything like that I went to that just in cases like a backup in case for whatever reason I wound up having to self distribute and so I was at least familiar with that and and so yeah I just kind of decide you know what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna focus entirely on Vimeo on demand for now just to at least get it out there and so people can see it and the bulk of the money that I raised is just gonna go into like hiring a publicist who confront the movie to critics and journalists and I know a lot of these people already because I kind of came up through the New York Press scene and so yeah that's kind of the idea is just get it onto Vimeo on demand and make sure it gets to critics and journalists so we can at least get some kind of word out there for it and then see what starts happening a lot of especially no budget low no budget filmmakers there's such a push to do the traditional distribution model because it seems more legitimate and maybe there's a little bit of vanity involved in that but in order to have it you know traditionally theatrically released you have to have a marketing department you have to have not a marketing department you have to have really a marketing team to get the word out in your movie one of the struggles that I had when with my first feature that I made was first of all it takes you know everything out of you just to get it finished and then once you get it finished you're completely drained and you just kind of throw it out there to the festival circuit and hope you know hope somebody bites and most of the people don't and then you get a couple that do and like you said it's kind of a shot in the dark when you go up to the festival whether anybody's gonna even be there to see it or what the response is going to be and there's a lot of investment in going to the festival to support the film and what I had to end up doing the past few years is is I decided I'm gonna give up this whole desire to go the traditional route and I kind of you know just fully went all-in on the web video thing and doing online community and seems like you're doing all right you know yeah it's really kind of blowing up the past year and so do you think that's where independent filmmaking is is heading like where do you see the industry in the next 10 years yeah what's the distribution model ten years from now it's inch it's interesting because like just like the past few days Sundance you know Sundance had started an initiative to help filmmakers self distribute and they just started releasing some of the figures like one of their like the first major movie that went through their you know program was Columbus last year and it did fairly well and so they're gonna you know try to build that into like a legitimate platform but what it kind of seems like is you know I've been I've been around at this like long enough now like like I said like when I was starting off doing web video like there was no YouTube there was no you know anything one of my closest friends when I first met her a few years back you know she was like a year out of college and she already had a job at helping compose you know doing videos for them and nothing like that even remotely you know existed you know way back and in fact it turned out that she I think she was like a freshman in high school when I actually did my first web series you know so I kind of seen this whole progression as these things have have gone and one of the things that you start realizing is that as time goes on the entire like model of independent film is constantly changing like when I first kind of showed up legit on the scene like around 2006 say when I started working for filmmaker magazine and I was basically like filmmaker magazines in-house filmmaker for a number of years and and at that point there were a number of producers whose entire business model was built around two million dollars for a first or second you know feature and they could get a nice you know six-figure payday out of that and they could make you know one or two movies a year and they could support themselves pretty nicely and right around the time that I showed up on the scene at that point the bottom just kind of fell out of that and all of a sudden two million dollar movies became 500 thousand dollar movies and there's no financial incentive you know what's the business model for them and then you you know right at that time is when digital DIY was really started to kick in and they'll look at like what's happening with the studio's we're basically the only thing the studio's are interested in are you know like blockbuster franchises and so it used to be you know Studios made all sorts of movies at a wide range of budgets and so what happened is all these movies that used to be the low-budget dramas in mid-range dramas or comedies or whatever they're without a home at the studio's so where do they go they now became like the top-tier independent films I don't know where it's going to be in ten years I can't you know if you would ask me ten years ago if I had any idea that things would be like this I probably put you know couldn't have predicted it I certainly felt that like web video was gonna you know take off you know the reason I went to to the Internet in the first place instead of doing film festivals was because I knew that it would be cheaper and you know I could get my own website for $100 a year that's better than spending thousands of dollars submitting to film festivals yeah having any theaters that nobody's sitting in the seats yeah and and and and and the other thing was I could get more people to see it right and in a much you know quicker time like I remember this was probably right around the time that YouTube had just come out so I I wasn't using any of those things for a while I was still using Quicktime I remember I did a short film and it did like 3,000 views over like the first weekend and I was like really excited and I remember I had gone to like some some Q&A thing that Soderbergh was doing and I went over and introduced myself to him afterwards and I told him like you know that I had just done this short and it did three thousand views over the first weekend and he looked at me like wow that's amazing you know and like look at it now where it's you know people regularly you know you have 400,000 subscribers you know it's it's just blown up you know you can just create something and put it out there and find an audience now it is it's it's amazing to see how it's changed in a short amount of time and and you know who knows where it's going to be but I think that films like the motion selfie are the perfect demonstration of the democratization of film and you know what you can do with very little I hope I hope that the film does well and that it's successful where can people go to either support the film or well right now like I literally just finished the fundraiser like a week ago so I mean there's nothing more that people can do in that sense in terms of you know I am expecting at this point that we'll have it online by late spring there's one wild card we we threw the link over to like one festival that were friendly with just you know on the off chance that maybe they wanted to program it and it would kind of coincide with around the time that like I was going to be throwing it online anyhow you know best cases you know maybe it plays there and we use that you know to kind of you know premiere it and then it goes right online after that so in a single sentence what do you think it takes to make stuff if you want to make stuff it takes talent and determination how's that that's great Jamie thank you very much thank you best of luck on the film thank you thanks for thanks for having me on and there you go if you want to learn more about Jamie Stewart's film a motion selfie then check the description if you're an aspiring filmmaker I hope this interview gave you a creative kick-start I'd like your first purchase of a website or domain thanks for watching I'll talk to you soon [Music]
