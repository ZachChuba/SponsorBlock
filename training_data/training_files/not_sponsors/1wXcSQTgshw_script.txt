-I'll do a quick interview. As a leader [Place full of honor 'Leader that orders food']
You are ordering food as a leader, how do you feel about it? First of all although we have a team leader In specific fields I think that someone who has more opinion and can make a move should get the role of it -And you are getting a lot of support regarding food.
-Of course! What do you think about it? Firstly I'm so honored about it And as much as you support me -I'll do my best to show my improvement.
-There's rumor that you're the one paying for everything, is it true? That's not, because I don't know the address here. -So..
-Is this our manager's phone? Yes, it is so if you told me the address and gate then I could have ordered -But it's such a pity that I couldn't.
-That really is a sad tale Now, that's the end of today's interview. Bye! Everybody! They arrived. [The hot dogs arrived!]
I want to spray cheddar cheese sauce. [SinB is having trouble since the cheese doesn't cut off ^^] Tada~ Thank you [This is the kind of coupling and structure that we saw often in G-log] Yum! Here we go. Mine is also sweet potato. Thank you for the hot dogs~ I think my mozzarella will be finished soon. -This is so good
-I'm exhausted. -This is so yummy.
