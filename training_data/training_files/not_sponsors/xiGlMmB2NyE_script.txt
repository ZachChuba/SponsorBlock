do you think you could tell the difference between this [Music] yeah of course you can cuz that's a two-stroke engine so there's two main types of gasoline-powered combustion engines the two cycle or two-stroke and the forced cycle were four-stroke engines the names pretty much explain how they operate a two cycle engine completes a combustion and exhaust cycle and only two strokes of the piston and a four cycle takes four strokes of the piston let's start with a four-stroke engine because we talked about a lot when we're talking about cars the piston moves down and the intake valve opens to let in a mixture of air and fuel that's the intake stroke when the piston moves back up it compresses the air fuel mixture and that's the compression stroke so when the spark plug releases a spark the resulting explosion pushes the piston back down the combustion stroke when the piston gets to the bottom of the stroke the exhaust valve then opens and when the piston moves up it pushes the exhaust from the cylinder out through the tailpipe and that is the exhaust stroke it's not difficult to see where we get these names and the whole cycle in a 1 cylinder four-stroke engine is powered by the first combustion stroke before we get to the 2 stroke just take a second hit the subscribe button ring the bell and that'll give you notifications oh wait thanks now on to the two strokes well it sounds more basic the 2 stroke engine was patented after the four-stroke Carl Benz received a patent for his two-stroke gas engine in 1879 in Germany he saw three of the four strokes in an auto cycle engine as wasted and he wanted to fix that a two cycle engine has much simpler mechanic it consolidates the process of a four-stroke engine in a two strokes what ah the piston is really doing a bunch of different things in a two-stroke engine so it's a little hard to split off it's drawing air and fuel into the crankcase while it's pressurizing air and fuel on the chamber and it's forcing up air and fuel to the chamber when it's being driven down by combustion on one side of the piston is the combustion chamber where the Pistons compressing the air-fuel mixture and capturing energy released by the ignition of the fuel on the other side of the piston is the crank the crankcase also acts as an air chamber or reservoir as the piston drives up on its combustion stroke it's creating a vacuum to suck in air and fuel from the carburetor through the reed valve the valve doesn't need to be mechanically actuated because of the air flow once the combustion stroke starts that pressurizes the crankcase the valve closes in the air and fuel is forced into the combustion chamber meanwhile it's the sides of the piston that are doing the job of the valves in an auto cycle engine covering and uncovering the intake to the chamber and the exhaust port out of it the air in the fuel rushing up force out the exhaust which has a scavenging effect pulling more air and fuel under the chamber until the piston once again closes things off then the air and fuel are compressed and ignited and the whole thing starts over again so that one power stroke doesn't have to carry it as far as it does in a four-stroke that's why you're gonna more often see a four-stroke engine with multiple cylinders so you can get more consistent power with fewer cylinders from a two-stroke even if it's only one a one cylinder engine so you may not be making more power per power stroke with a two-stroke but you're making twice as many power strokes as in a four-stroke engine and two-stroke engines can work in any orientation which can be important in something like a chainsaw two strokes are lighter simpler and less expensive to manufacture and also have pretty fantastic power-to-weight ratio compared to many four-stroke engine designs they also have fewer overheating concerns three of the four strokes of a four-stroke engine involve hot hot stuff compression heats up combustion is super hot and the exhaust well that's just pushing out hot air in a two-stroke each new charge is cooling off the chamber and often the top of the cylinder is exposed to air for cooling that's why they got all those dangle metal ridges to dissipate the heat into the air what if two strokes are so great why don't you normally see them engines in cars well they have some pretty significant disadvantages in a four-stroke engines valves allow the separation of the combustion chamber in the drive shaft this lets all lubricate the sides of the piston and everything under it without intruding into the combustion chamber in a two-stroke remember you got no valves so oils gotta mix with the gas before it gets to the cylinder the oil and the gas together are gonna do the lubrication gas and oil together lubricate worse than oil alone and gas and oil together combust worse than gasoline alone so not only is this not as effective at lubricating the system but it also means that the oil burns up in the chamber that means more wear more deposits and more harmful emissions in general two-stroke engines don't last nearly as long as four strokes the lack of a dedicated lubrication system means that the parts of a true stroke engine wear out two-stroke oil is expensive you need about four ounces of it for every gallon of gas you would burn about a gallon of oil every thousand miles if you used a two-stroke engine in a car two-stroke engines also don't use fuel efficiently you're probably not getting rid of 100% of the exhaust gases you're probably not taken in a perfect air fuel mix two-strokes also produce a lot of pollution each time a new charge of air and fuel is loaded into the combustion chamber some of that is probably sneaking out through the exhaust port that's why a lot of leaf blowers and lawnmowers exhaust still smells like gas because of valve timing you can change all of those things to perform optimally in a four-stroke engine and that lets four strokes be super efficient these disadvantages mean that two-stroke engines are used really only in applications where the motor is not used all the time and you need a great power-to-weight ratio in terms of simplicity and the ease of fixing it a two-stroke easily wins out so both engines have their place all right in my four-stroke engine powered car to the beach they get on my two-stroke powered jet ski
