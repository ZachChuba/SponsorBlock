[Music] welcome back to number eighteen of the wilderness only Ironman we're gonna be picking up where we left off last time we had just unlocked the house for the account and this episode is gonna include how I'm gonna train construction and what we can actually use from the will appreciate this application so go check it out now from last episode I had a bunch of raw tuna that I ended up actually getting from rogue chests we unlock that with 84 thieving which was a huge grind finally out of the way and the thing is I actually can't make a fire because my fire making level is only eight and so to obtain normal logs I have to come south to about ten wilderness and chop these dead trees oh yeah it's random level 21 just wearing the Ironman armor is really sussing me out that took longer than expected but we're finally going to be training some fire making on the account I want to get 15 so that I can use all of the oak logs in my bank don't really need to do fire making in this game but I want a fire that can actually last quite a bit so I can actually cook the food on it and one of the shorter grinds I've done because fire making is such a fast skill in this game and there it is 15 fire making we can now burn oak logs which we do have a ton in our bank from the end Slayer tasks that we've actually completed now all we have to do is get a tinderbox and an oak log out of the bank and we can start cooking wow I did not know you could not light a fire in the mage bank this would have been more convenient but now we're gonna have to do it a different way we're gonna have to pull the lever and light a fire outside okay you can't light one beside the lever either I guess but light it outside take the lever back grab the food and then start cooking here if we take a look in the bank you'll see I've over 400 raw tuna these are actually really easy to obtain and a really good way to train cooking the reason getting some early cooking XP is going to be important is because from the lorentz key you can actually get all sorts of raw food some of them require a high level of cooking and the higher cooking we get anyways the more successful will be at actually cooking the lower tier foods even with just having oak logs the fires do go out pretty quick so I have to bring an extra log with me just so I can finish an inventory of food over 400 tuna finally cooked after getting 60 for cooking and being half way to 65 I decided that I was gonna try to get my crafting up because I still have some gems in my bank that haven't used please give me an emerald or a sapphire and it's gonna be 80 gold of course after making a few more sapphire necklaces in the wilderness resource area we can now cut emeralds which means we can get some free exp because I have a bunch of them in the bank we have 73 emeralds to cut this is going to be some extremely quick crafting so it looks like we're only going to be getting up to 31 crafting after all the emeralds which means we can't yet go through all of the rubies we have because those require 34 but now we can make emerald necklaces and emerald amulets which I'm probably gonna use to train the skill further crafting is gonna play a huge role later on as we will be able to make strength amulets glories and Ring of Wealth's which are all going to be very useful for this account after turning a bunch of sapphire necklaces into game's necklaces we now have 44 8 charged games necklaces which means we can start training some construction the only plank obtainable from the ground in the wilderness is the normal plank which is perfect for those early construction levels and they can be found in the cemetery at 20 wilderness oh I completely forgot you needed nails to construct these chairs ok fortunately in earlier episodes I actually made nails in advance for this we have 50 steel nails let's see how far we get off this one inventory alone [Music] off just the first Simmons worried alone we almost got seven construction we did end up using quite a few steel nails luckily I can make them and I have a lot more in the bank now the way I'm gonna be running all these inventories is simply just using the game's necklace and teleporting to corporal beast the reason we teleports a corporal beast is because we can actually suicide to this boss and it sends us straight to Edgeville which we paid 5 million GP to spawn here for because the planks are located just west of the corporal beast cave entrance it makes this method very very effective there it is 15 construction that didn't take too long as the skill is amazing we can now sit on our rocking chair but yeah the reason we got 15 construction and the reason this level is really good is because we can unlock the tool store 1 the tool store 1 allows you to get an unlimited amount of shears chisels hammers and saws which is extremely important because we cannot lose the only saw that we have there's just one problem the only way to get oak planks which is the recipe for this is from vetti on an extremely difficult wood Ernest boss that my account isn't ready to fight other useful tool stores include tool store two at 25 construction and tool store four at 40 for construction the Spade obtained from tool store 2 would allow us to potentially juggle hard clues from hellhounds assuming we had a ring of wealth I which is fully obtainable through the crafting skill again none of this matters until we get our hands on some oak planks as for construction I'm just gonna wrap it up by saying the only other thing I found useful that I could actually make is an oak altar for some quick prayer points everything else requires materials outside of the wilderness so if you guys have any ideas let me know the next part of this video is mainly going to talk about Slayer I'm gonna use all of these Slayer points I have on broad bolts which is the strongest bolt I can actually purchase eventually I am gonna unlock the herb sack but that is later down the road and the Slayer ring is completely useless as long as the room pouch is just not needed before jump right into some bossing and some Slayer tasks I'm gonna be getting 38 herb Lord because I want to be able to make prayer potions once and for all on this account in the last episode I showed you the method where we loot red spider eggs from inside the wilderness dungeon and we go ahead and make normal restore potions for the experience I'm gonna fluid about 250 of these which is gonna be 5 trips with the looting bag 287 red spider eggs in the bank we should have just enough to get this level alright so I thought I had enough hair Landers for this but I don't I mean I have to go kill some chaos true it's because I don't have enough of the herb that actually makes this potion the red spider eggs were well calculated but I just did not have enough herbs few trips later from the cast ruins and I think we should be good yes boys 38 herblore oh my god the amount of chaos ruins I had to kill to get that was actually ridiculous I thought they'd be more common but our lenders are hard to get I'm not gonna be able to make too many prayer potions because for one Snape grass is a really uncommon from cast Rhodes and I only have about 40 in the bank look at this setup sharks prayer potions pizzas games necklace recoil magic dart with the enhanced Slayer staff the count is coming along really nicely what we're gonna be doing now is going ahead and trying to get my power amulet back from some crazy archaeologist also as a bonus we do have a chance of landing the uniques that we actually need to finish the series from this boss and this is one of the few that I'm gonna get out of the way first so hopefully we can you know get our hands on some of those and it's 10 room knives please power amulet 10 white berries coins not my drop because someone else did damage shark and more coins [Music] yes kill 101 power amulet this isn't even that uncommon but yeah I can't believe we've killed over a hundred of these guys now with no unique there it is though finally we can do some Slayer currently we have 75 black demons to slay which is some pretty nice XP with the enhanced Slayer staff on task we can actually hit up to 25 with magic dart so we should be smashing through these black demons mysterious emblem at number one of the task Oh Loren's key number one of the tasks black diamond task completed what is Kristy Lia gonna give us today 101 magic axes that is a very easy task magic axes are really safe because the only way to get in here is by lock-picking the store and they're all aggressive so it's really hard to die here from a peak air I missed the level but we just got 72 strength and we're coming up on a slayer level as well no I missed the level pop-up again but we just got sixty slayer so I was a really quick and afk task this area is actually really good for AFK melee exp now to get back to Edgeville for my tasks the method I can use now since I actually have the game's necklace is simply banking all my items teleporting the Corp beast and then just committing suicide because I spawn an edge Ville so it's like 300 IQ strats next task 111 earth warriors probably gonna end up using a lot of food here since my defense is only 40 and I'm not gonna be using prayer oh my god I've never searched this sack what if I can get something good and I can't get anything finally done with these guys oh god the food we just used for that task wasn't even worth holy crap boys we just got a chaos elemental task I want to slay 35 of these just give me the max this is the first boss task that I got I actually don't believe it I think I just made a huge mistake for signing up for that but holy this is gonna be exciting we get to kill 35 chaos elemental I actually need the dragon to H from them as well so ah so for those of you don't know I actually already have the dragon pickaxe from cows elemental which I got on kill count 24 this item is a 1 in 256 drop rate which means that I got extremely lucky and the only other unique I need from this boss is a dragon 2h we have 35 chances to land it on this Slayer task while getting some Slayer exp so let's hope we get it for each of the kills I'm gonna have to learn the chaos elemental into a safe spot and then kill it with broad bolts which does take extremely long so 35 of these will not be easy but it's definitely possible and I'm gonna do it [Music] I let that clip play out just to show you what I meant by long kills first kill 7.5 k cash not impressed Oh 75 blood runes the next kill right after that's actually really good it is gonna be explained in the next episode white blood runes are very important and while I'll need at least a thousand of them but uh that's for next episode just show me the dragon 2h 300 mint arts kill 28 weapon poison + + useless actually these things do drop dragon daggers and if I poison them they can actually ask for more and what is this bot running through my chaos elemental it's actually screwed up 3 my kills that is so upsetting 42 rune arrows is rare drop table 150 rune arrows is the common drop from the boss I don't know what this guy was doing but first he attacked me and then Auto retaliated back to the chaos elemental and killed them yeah and I thought I was gonna be able to finish the kill but then these guys showed up and you know you think to max level P cares would be able to tear me down but uh you thought wrong [Music] yeah the spot is extremely safe because just north of here is a door like I said the magic axe hut is completely safe unless these guys bring a team for every single axe that I'm talking crap to these guys because I'm happy I got away but yeah you guys should learn to be good I'm serious emblem okay that's something that's actually decent all right about 10 kills oh okay it's a dragon dagger not a dragon 2h oh the tease is so real now I'd love to bore you guys with all of the kills being shown but nothing but troll dragon dagger drops rune drops and potions is pretty much all I got but after a really long time finally completed all 35 chaos elemental no dragon to H of course 58 kill count though we can now finally move on and continue slayer at a normal pace next episode is going to be the search for the magic short bow which we are gonna have to get 63 slayer for this is gonna conclude episode 18 if you guys want to start from the beginning the link will be in the description for the entire playlist
