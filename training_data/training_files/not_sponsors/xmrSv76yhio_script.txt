electric vehicle technology is improving at an impressive rate in terms of the range and also charge time but what if you could charge an electric vehicle in a matter of seconds sorry sorry this could be made possible using super capacitors as they can be charged and discharged at very high rates with minimal long-term damage in fact they would work well in an electric dragster this video is sponsored by brilliant the main chassis for the dragster we use a carbon fiber cheap for high strength and low weight as well as making it easy to mount various electronics to a 3d printed a wheel hub with a toothed pulley on one side and fitted a rubber tire to it then after inserting some bearings and a shaft it could be clamped to the carbon fiber tube chassis and be driven by the motor using a belt then with the basic steering mechanism added to the front of the tube and a temporary lithium battery strapped to the top it was time for a quick test on the wet patio which slightly lacked in grip but made for some interesting slow-mo footage the next step was to build a super capacitor bank which consisted of 12 capacitors of 50 farad's each specifically two in parallel and six in series the drugs that can be powered by a minimum of six point four volts before the motors cut out then by plugging in the lithium battery it can be charged to 11 volts in literally seconds disconnecting the lithium battery allows the car to be powered purely from the energy stored in the super capacitors and you can see the voltage gradually decrease to six point four volts where the motors cut out and then through you printed a body kit for it and attached a rear wing to give it more of a dragster look this is super capacitor charging now we are fully charged I'm not very good at building cars but super capacitors are pretty cool and that's about it alright I came halfway round the world to film this video and you're just trying to wreck it so it's pretty obvious this car suffers from stability issues as well as lacking in grip but if control properly it runs pretty well using the super capacitors it's really hard to steer high speed I think I have better school I'm gonna record okay go Peter I'm just scared that he's gonna explode at some point yeah if they surely do you know our normal hobby life of Aries are rated milliamp hours yeah dude this exact milli of our rating on the capacitors do they have they have a farad rating with that great question Peter Street pool most batteries have a voltage and amp hour rating which when multiplied together gives a rough estimate for the energy stored in what hours however capacitors have a voltage and farad rating which requires the following equation to estimate energy stored in what hours yes that's correct this lithium cell has the equivalent energy storage of nearly 180 of these capacitors I then purchase a cheap radio-controlled car from Walmart to test the range difference and believe me the quality definitely reflected the price usually you have like a variable terrazzo and is usages on/off and save a single button yeah a bone in there yeah there's like a push button on either end and you just go Duke yeah it's all or nothing just bang bang it's a little nothing but a trash car this cheap radio-controlled car took 27 minutes to finally run out of juice which seems very impressive to me for such a small lithium battery however it supplied USB charger it took an hour and 51 minutes to charge granted with a decent charger it should be possible to safely charge in around 45 minutes but how about replacing this battery with some super caps specifically two in series and two in parallel so they can be charged up to the same voltage as a small AC and battery [Music] these were they're mounted to the roof of the car with the power wires running down into the compartment where the battery is supposed to go then I can connect my 10 amp power supply to fully charge the car in about 15 seconds but what does this mean for the runtime well after just one minute and 40 seconds it was dead which considering the four capacitors are far larger than the supplied lithium battery that lasted 27 minutes the capacitors don't seem very practical now I like to learn new things such as can you charge an electric car in a matter of seconds and go check out the link in the description down below if you enjoyed this video you'd be great if you can leave a thumbs up down below if you're new to my channel and want to see more similar projects to this then please click subscribe down below a huge thanks to all of my patreon supporters over on patreon comm for making these projects possible thanks once again for watching and I'll see you in the next video goodbye
