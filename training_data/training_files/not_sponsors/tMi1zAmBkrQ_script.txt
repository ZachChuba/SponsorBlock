did you said you can fix college football I don't know if it needs to be fixed by the way but you just have this concept that you say is gonna make college football season much better know as someone who loves college football and used to love bull season I do think it does need to be fixed 23 of the 35 bull games this year ratings were down 2 playoff games ratings were up so obviously people care about the playoffs so why not make the playoffs bigger like this oh hey that's smart by the right page not just cases people care about this they don't care about that let's make this bigger and make that smaller like the January 1 games this year we're actually pretty good but it was hard to care about him unless you were gambling on it so here is my fix the regular season ends Thanksgiving weekend like it currently does with with rivalry weekend okay and then here's the one where the old whites and a lot of people are going to be upset that next weekend there's gonna be no no conference championship games bigger than a damn Super Bowl diner the South dumb pigs northern guy will stick with me here the NFL's doing quite alright and they don't have the visual Championships just do better in the regular season if you need the conference championship to get into a 16 team playoff that's on you ok and then so not that weekend will be off in the weekend after because you got to have army-navy in there one of those weekends and you got to have two weeks off for finals let's just let's let's let the schools be ok with that student athletes student athlete student human athlete yes dude and human athlete yeah so then the third weekend is when the playoffs start 16 teams higher seed gets home-field advantage ok so the higher seats you do seating them huh the college still that's still the same committee who does the college football playoffs now I'm cool with them so you're cool with them everybody hates them yeah you're cool in this format I think they could pick 16 that's fine if you're gonna complain about being 17 that's on you so at least you're rewarded for doing good during the regular see and higher seed gets the the first round home field okay then we go to the next round Elite Eight is playing at the Orange Bowl the Sugar Bowl the cotton and the Rose Bowl just like it that's how it was this year so that those bulls still get their money everyone still has those things so they're not upset about that that's all still there and then I like the idea for the Final Four which this year the two playoff games were the Fiesta and Peach I like how the NCAA basketball does it where it's in the same city mmm so I like the Friday Saturday same city for the semifinal games obviously you're gonna have to do it in a turf city so like Vegas Indianapolis Atlanta Dallas one of those cities because you can't play on grass back-to-back days that's just budget you just can't do it can't do it you just can't do that and then the championship game is still played on the same Monday that's currently played on so you're not extending the season any so no reason to be mad at that and then if you're Clemson and LSU this year you're playing 15 games win the national championship if in my format you have to play 16 games so I mean one extra game are we really gonna cry about that these kids are 18 19 20 years old they can handle it and I think you know you still have your other bull games that people can bet on blah blah but making more games that people care about I think is good overall for the entire billion dollar industry and that's how you save a bull season I wish I was the type of host I'd just be like well you're wrong well get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic well why I mean championship weekend is gonna be tough for some people but I have a question yeah so you said 1 through 16 they're seated so who does one play first game 16 so you're gonna waste LSU's time playing let's say Iowa maybe I mean a lot of people thought oh look they finished 16th well a lot of people that's 140 like anything can happen a lot of people thought the Tennessee Titans were wasting their time going to Baltimore I mean you you take away what now we do have to be realistic here like the disparity between college yeah and other colleges is vast they not although I think it should be eight teams I respect your sixteenth it's never gonna happen no I don't think sixteen is ever gonna have getting it to four was like colossal paramount almost cuz it used to be there's people that don't remember the BCS system think the n-c-double-a sold their right to declare a champion to this BCS Committee that was able to select these bowls and BCS polls where everything like when we don't to a BCS poll for the first time as West Virginia it was massive news and I going to a BCS bowl it's a big deal we want a BCS bowl like that was a big big thing nowadays those bowls unless they're the playoffs they don't really mean as much like I was it's just it's very they're gonna change it they have to especially if they see ratings going down and your way to save money I think it's a good idea but you Diggs you're talking to right people yes I think that's a large part of the student human athlete operation is how can we raise the funds to make sure these kids are playing with the greatest facilities to ever be made even like spaceship type facilities at these places and these stadiums or were six seven billion dollars like you gonna make sure you make the money so smart by you I don't think it'll go to sixteen but I like your thought expanding and I'm all in on the eight five conference champions and then three at-large that that committee can pick but I like sixteen I didn't mind a lady actually I thought you were pretty smart there Diggs I'm proud of you from thinking that
