make your next move with Squarespace guys I need your help with something because I am genuinely confused I'm sure you've heard over the last few weeks that Facebook is under a lot of scrutiny right now something about some company got Facebook user data or something which is a violation of the Terms of privacy or something I don't know I frankly I don't care the point that interests me is how everyone is so up in arms about this thing can you believe how loose Facebook is with your user data it is appalling okay haven't we all known I think that wait four years now they've been doing this what oh this is the first we're learning about this well I'm not saying Facebook is a good company I'm asking why are people all of a sudden so mad I've been telling you to stay off Facebook since at least 2011 this is my voice of mine's out there you could actually wake up in the morning and not get on Facebook it would be great what did people think Facebook was a nice company who values your privacy or something you think Mark Zuckerberg er is actually the nice guy he pretends to be are you stupid why do you think Facebook is free I'm just saying if you use their site this is what they do I mean if you want real reasons to hate Facebook there are plenty so in honor of a superior social network let's look at my topic reasons Facebook is terrible number eight the newsfeed what is there even to say about the newsfeed this page is filled with posts that some algorithm decided would be the exact kind of post that would make you click unfollow this friend or how about that thing where you see something in your newsfeed that you would want to read but you only realized you want to read it after you've clicked on something else in your feet and you're waiting for it to load so once the new page loads you immediately go back a page to read the posts but now the post is gone forever you'll never see it again that's cool number seven people don't actually see the stuff you post this is specifically in regards to Facebook pages so if you like our blimeycow Facebook page unless you click see first in newsfeed you may not see the stuff we post in fact the only way to ensure that people that like our page do see our posts is to pay facebook for the privilege so cute see with YouTube if I create a video that brings people to YouTube they compensate us as a thank you but on Facebook the assumption is that those people are already there and it's privilege to access them they're really doing you a favor okay so all of your followers are over there no they can't see you I'm gonna need some cold hard cash I need that much cash and that's just so you can see 10% of them if you want 100% say bye-bye to your whole money number 6 the fact that they bought Instagram Instagram used to be this really great app and then Facebook destroyed it with their stupid algorithms when you see a picture on Instagram really cherish that moment beaten make sure that you that you're done looking at it because once you scroll down you never gonna see it again number 5 the people who run Facebook are terrible bunch of hypocrites complaining about fake news while they're literally trying to augment reality number 4 facebook video is a lie whoa just watch our video on facebook just hit 200 billion Wow absolutely nothing oh and look Josh we're getting a ton of new likes on our Facebook page wow I'm so excited to spend even more money to reach those new people Facebook's not a scam at all number three everything in this entire universe is connected to Facebook would you like to give this app access to your name friends list firstborn child so six six six number two you are now connected on messenger whenever you friend somebody on Facebook and then you get that that notification saying that is somebody's messaged you so you click it and oh no it's just Facebook telling you to talk to this person that you barely even know that you just friended thanks Facebook is like that annoying friend at the party the party that you're at you don't even want to be there but all your friends are there so you're there and they come up to you and they do this okay Sarah this is my friend Jordan hey yeah well now that I've connected you guys should talk do you guys have a lot in common I think it'd be really cool yes okay see you later bye okay and the number one reason Facebook is terrible it's legacy when we all look back on Facebook in 20 years from now and trust me we will be looking back on Facebook by then we're not gonna think wow no all people are gonna remember is like how Facebook made it impossible to have a political conversation ever again and we're all gonna begrudge the amount of time we spent on this website that I tried to warn you all about as early as 2011 no one is forcing you to use this free service there's other places you can go Google+ Twitter Tumblr off your butt look the way I see it the way I see it only two good things have ever happened because of Facebook the 2010 film The Social Network and our private Facebook page exclusively for our patrons that's patreon.com slash climbing stay tuned [Music] and you want them to see you then I'm gonna need the cash I need some cold hard cash I need this much I won't hit you again I'm sorry so all of your followers are over there and no do not try to see them sorry we do it say bye-bye to your whole money just like laughing
