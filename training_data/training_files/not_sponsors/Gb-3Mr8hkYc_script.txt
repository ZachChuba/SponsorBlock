folks welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as always brought to you by the server on which we are playing and trying to grind that gear dud oh I'm hoping that we have plenty of gear over in the void minor anyway if you want a grind gears on a server feel free to check the link in the description slash while under the video or the stream if you go through that link you'll get a discount off your first month of server hosting you can do a one-click install of this mod pack any other mod pack we are playing have played or just vanilla minecraft or whatever floats your goat so yeah we got we got some stuff we got some there's a lot we had talked about going offline and sorting through it I don't believe that happened no but we did get a bit of the materials that are generated I don't know how much oh we did get 63e rhodium which actually I think is good is that the one that I don't have a rhodium I think we have two stacks no a rhodium is really good that gets us to avoid minor tier 2 nice yeah latex processing unit ok so I need be able to process my latex Larry's other arrow the other these other rhodium we also more literate which is good industrial machines pretty cool yes I'm working at a diamond bit emerald bit more little right and your dust okay things are things are big plays out here do a big place looking up yeah I would say we're gonna need more storage is what I would say oh why would you say that because there's a lot of things a lot of things we got a lot of redstone redstone is good right gonna bother someone yeah no yes actually I was like no redstone is easy but no red sounds good happy to have redstone cool cool and I need LV wire and all of that stuff I think we should actually probably though dump some of the stuff that is in all some of the rocks that we don't need probably just add others take them absolutely or we could throw them in I could make another set of chests or something like that I don't know we could see let's see okay I don't know if we're gonna have the capacity for all of these tacks at this point Oh Howard that up man do I take this and put that in there I now I have a latex bucket I'm assuming I put the latex in there that did something something has been done on this day has it yeah yes that's awesome okay with one of these two alloys I can make industrial machines the first goal is to make plastic any plastic just following the instructions following the recipes I make plastic with a dry rubber okay let's see I might be able to do let's see slowly power void - - I don't even know which is which dude with some water to get tiny River okay so to get my tiny rubber I need add some water Oh make a solar power panel okay I see do we have solar power here on this world it doesn't look like there's a lot of Sun but I mean the Sun does come up right we've seen we've seen that happen yes I got a tiny dry rubber that sounds ineffective I don't recommend it it sounds perfect for me I am just gonna say the dry part just it might crack so I don't really recommend that personally yeah that's that's good that's true yeah yeah it's okay make it what I guess I need to make a solar array let's do it oh this is why I need the empower yeah yeah this is where the empower can leave rambha our connection to the mainland is off again what do you mean the elf elf portal was the elf Wow this takes so much water holy crap yeah sorry about that yeah and it's it's giving it to me dry come on it's giving it to you dry all right sounds like the dry the dry rubber is an issue yeah no that's that's why I add the water in and then it mixes with the latex but even with the water it's just giving me dry tiny dry rubber pellets hmm yeah of course it is cool cool so it's one / - okay all right okay do we have a lot of ender pearls or do we still not have a lot of we have us probably the ability to make like stacks are sixteen friender pearls we we probably have the ability to make like 20 stacks of ender pearls right do we use the ender dust with that with the bang boom machine the boom machine yes but also I would recommend that we let me get my lap ease a bit first yeah the condenser the boom boom machine is a better name I personally think I call it what you want dude I mean that's the name I gave it but doo doo doo doo doo doo doo I mean they give you and pearls and then I need palace crystal blocks which require Palace crystals in front of that which is the Allah peas Leto got any more lapis I need all the lapis basically dude upgrade the boom-boom machine to ender ium oh okay wait you-you-you beated my lap ease I didn't eat it it's in the hopper oh did it wait Oh was it done it was done processing okay that's why still it's shielded it's super chill dude okay it just eats poppies it's not like I would you know they just take your stuff out and put my stuff in that's that's a movie you do know the indie reom condenser uh have we made flux - oh that's redstone okay take no indiri oh I miss not having I miss I miss my system I miss and so we blend lead or plus plaque wait and dear iam a resident under bucket oh my god let in platinum alright well we're gonna be at this for a little bit but we can do it so lap ease is also a condenser I'm assuming laughs easy goes in the condenser okay LED and we should have platinum I'm assuming in here please platinum and media I would like it if you are here if you I'm not here i will be very disapoint oh you don't apply in him that's sad that's a sad day he's disappoint he said so himself oh I put it in the thing oh I couldn't okay cool cool thank your cast there's some spares and then we got that going for you and I both I need six you need I don't know how many oh I did get platinum think okay you got thank goodness for that your singing is incredible thank you I sang a song for you because it was the song of my people cool oh you just mock my remember I've never mocked you in my entire life my singing I never did that oh okay so how do you make the magics and again that boom-booms good question good question okay well there you go it's a the you mean the glass that goes boom boom yeah the clear glass there's something oh it's just you just put it's just glass into the per second I was thinking it was sand so but I got you I realized where I went miss cuz I knew whether it was simple I was just like wait okay so a for every time you do that so you need twice six alright alright and then we're gonna be able to do that from the thing I'm gonna bucket we're gonna get do this this condemned is gonna be nuts although what kind of condenser do we currently have again iron it is steel isn't it you Oh seal okay so this is going to be 4x if I can figure out how to get it done wow I hear those kabooms dude okay Gold and so we needed that we needed some more stuff so I could wait what do I add to this to make it to give it power again is it coal we obviously have the condenser stuff it's probably that I need to do this isn't it yeah that's probably that dude huh hey yeah yeah didn't even have to didn't have to look yes made it work give me one moment I'm gonna do the old ketchup a real get him go get him tiger I'm gonna go get him dude good yeah let me catch up on the notifications real quick quill 1 for 3 thanks for the 16 months Ulupi thanks for the 2 months Tommy Griffin thank you for the 7 months and for anyone who might be tuned in on this from the front page what we're doing is playing eggs Oreo which is a mod pack where we're placed on this barren deserted planet full of volcanic ash and we have to work our way towards uh I think finding our way home out of Exile over here we've made a lot of progress so far but it's a it's a hefty hefty mod pack for what like episode 37 this is I think and each episode being about an hour so 37 hours in and well we're working on solar power and other stuff so it's a it's a time to be alive how many though didn't didn't put it enough ender pearls in there so right now we're working on a really efficient way to be able to make resources with the indie reham condenser which yeah I guess I'm gonna need to put some redstone into here as well good thing we got like way more redstone then we're gonna have to upgrade the thing with the rhodium it's just it's there's a lot of grinding that takes place but it's ok 3 and 24 redstone that is big plays right they're sick dude you can make upgrade kits for your machine um which what do you what do you mean what do you mean upgrade kits to first oh oh you mean for the void the void minor thing you know you don't mean the the condenser right well then I need to make a new frame I think I need to make a new frame oh the magma crucible gotcha gotcha actually one away actually one away from what hi how you doing I just learned you silly I'm just silly are you but it's but it's fine you know it's whatever oh okay I'm sorry to hear that you are silly I needed to pump some water and I did it badly Mme do when that happens yeah so okay well I have made some lapiz and I have more lapiz making for you and then I am making my lapis as well as your lap ease there we go perfect cool well I am getting closer to being able to make the super condenser and then we will be it'll actually be pretty good honestly for goods that's easy enough oh wait I need to do that that's bad as long as I'm thinking about it and then this guy right here this guy right here and I set him to export and ah yes yes use the power of the force that's actually the aqueous you is supposed to actually get water I just put all the water stuff next to the thing that's supposed to gather water it's fine uh-huh hey why are you no bug what what what's a visual button this tank is I know that I dyed it to a color but it's showing his white white white and it's confusing and frightening to me and mmm various levels gotcha thank you durn latex takes a lot to get done also it's sucking through power pretty fast well when I get this solar array done hopefully you will be able to have a lot of power a lot of time I don't I mean we use a lot of power we have a lot of stuff also can you not use stand on the pressure plate that keeps the door but I'm thank you I'm literally lagging over here so don't mind me I'm sorry that you're having a hard time with everything what I'm having a hard time as well okay sorry to hear it dude yeah it's tough sounds like it okay nerium condenser has been completed and this thing all this baby can purr dude you ready alright so we're gonna dump that and I am gonna break this real quick actually do we want to do a different casing y'all right there my doing I don't know what like cuz you're able to move around without too much issue right like you're not lagging no I'm chill my something about my install is just died hmm I rebooted the server today earlier to make sure that that wasn't it and like you said you're not inks countering problems so I'm just like having a heck of a time trying it on yeah pressure plate while you're like grumping at me because I'm just stuck there I'm sorry man I did not realize that you were having a bad time out here it it hurt me in ways oh but you know I'm sorry I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry but do you really want tonight I think you digging out my closet Wow Wow I went to like do you really want to hurt me oh yeah but I went salmon and that you went full mmm yeah that was that was awkward on a on several levels for us no it was awkward oh I felt awkward I'm sorry that you felt that way dude I how many times do you tell me that in a day I'm like if whatever we need to get that yes cuz that's not that's not an uncommon phrase for the two of us no no no it's not okay so I need to make apparently the indium casing and then and then we will actually be able to have this super-dee-duper do pretty duper super-dee-duper dippity-do / yes yes absolutely but I am I might need more enterprise for this I'm not entirely sure I have made a spare and your pool and her pearls and her pools and her pools where you can find your Enders that are we good we gettin more out here or do it just in case and then I burn it right because it was already dry and now I need to dry it more only the driest of pellets for me thank you yeah dry pellet sounds sounds about right checked out right dry pellet sounds like a problem with like your rabbit poop he's got some dry pellets you're gonna have to go see a vet yeah I mean you know or or just you know if it's a personal problem like you know oh you got the right pellet like let's just just try not to mention it like right yeah oh no no no no I don't want you there I don't know okay fine listen that wasn't intended that was not intended mm oh that's right I can actually put these like swing them back in can't i yeah they're like little buckets little buckets of Swing of Hawaii of course but of course the buckets of Schwing but of alright so now that I have the plastic what does it want me to do with it not much easier farming I like it plant sower in the plant gather I would have been so much happier for that was plants our implant grower I don't would you've been so or much happier okay that was a good one yeah it's a pretty good one there's a thing I like I just kind of want to like punch you in the face like politely you know as a friend oh yeah no absolutely the Politis to face punches you could possibly often get it right you get it don't don't me because you and I both know that you felt that way about me many times no not with puns I appreciate puns unless they're bad puns but it seems like with you the better the pun is the angrier you get and that is a sad way to live your life it's so full you're lying oh okay okay I think I think I understand now a sad way to live your life it's a brofist to the fame good luck are you lagging what's happening what's happening with you I thought you were lagging not I don't know okay sort of a standoff this working out perfect for me because you were like hey man I'm going to troll you and I was like okay but I happen to know that you can't use the machines as long as I'm standing on the pressure plate so you know how dare you yeah gotta go how dare you how did what even is that stop that those are important that's little right you're important wait no that's not right there okay anyway cool so you've getting that done this has all the pack of the stuff it needs there we need more for that latex fluid extractor um you wanna hook it back up with that lift the right boy yeah just as soon as I get what I need okay be right back in a few minutes okay I had it on I had it on me oops so used any critical blocks to goof around with and lose them lately oh you're only sabotaging yourself I mean I feel like I'm sabotaging both of us and that that's the prospect I'm willing to live with I you you know that I will cut huh the end of my nose to spite you as my metaphorical face you know this I'm gonna go okay I was like it didn't show up online so I was like did he get that but okay so that should start getting more latex there good good [Music] seems to be the aqueous accumulator just is passive it takes no power and it exports if you have water around it you mean to put that one there yes remember all right it's the right eats the wood I totally I did forget about that hey sorry I keep forgetting about it but it just looks so out of place just a piece of wood sitting in the room I understand it's just you know that that's that's what's going on give me one second um okay uh Bridget you said okay what the cat thing it I literally oh my god this is sometimes represent just annoys the hell out of me I literally told them he's like okay water bottle is ready we can get it in the store I'm like no no no please don't I want you to send me a sample first I just want to verify the quality because this is a new type of item do you put the freaking thing up now I have to email him and be like why I didn't want it to be more on sale until I got to see the damn thing in person do not buy the water bottle yet please you get freaking dumb why why did they freaking do that they just didn't listen you just ignored me what the hell hold on Frick I don't understand like it's probably fine but lately when I say please send me a sample so I can make sure it's good like why hold on fricken anak I am annoyed I am annoyed it's not that hard sorry it was just dealing with an emergency where represent main item live they shouldn't have made live that I said don't make live until I have a sample good yo that's how represent do we are plowing through our power we are how are you we are powering through it fortunately we have a lot of batteries but we're about to run out also I think that I need to work on upgrading our wires but their's I'm pretty sure if we were to check in with old grammar he'd want us to yeah he wants you to use the letter our things the Vox duct oopsy-daisy there's stuff pouring that's fine it's huge are you pouring stuff again oh wow here we go oh he dokie we got ourselves a bit of the old SuperDuper condenser now this is gonna be sick dude I want to see this thing in action oh my god oh the speed it's oh the speed dude our efficiency is forty six hundred percent that's fast yeah faster we're getting more out of that than we were putting in oh that's that's optimized for optimum optimal oh yeah that combo wombo between the the frame and oh my goodness that is some next-level stuff right there it's so fast sometimes it goes backwards rammer cyst don't know that works but okay well have you ever like burned yourself and it's so so it's so hot it's cold kind of immediately I have not it sounds unpleasant it is yeah you should try it oh boy okay all right so why did it want me to make plastic what can I do with plastic and also I guess still the flux duct stuff which okay so a lot of fun back to the solar things because you said that power is an issue right yeah no always okay cool so we're making more lap YZ and it's gonna be great lapis lazuli lapiz laz you like energy cell wait is there is there a more more than basic or is basic the only one well maybe basic okay so here's fancy stuff and woot oh yeah which involves oh yeah that's the that's the mob grinder one okay so I don't think it's so what about mmm these can only pass through I mean $1,000 F is it seems plenty you I wonder how much if I wonder if I can tell how much these windmills are making I just I hate interconnects inert connects well you know if we you need any redstone servos I've got you covered thanks man yep appreciate ya I sometimes doubt that but nonetheless none the less steel aluminum and six and stakes stakes oh man I had I had a big big big steak it reminded you that a big meal I in fact I tweeted at you about it cuz it was so good oh yeah what was at 1600 calories I mean that's actually not that crazy at a restaurant no oh so tasty it was a it was kind of a smaller steak but it was actually really tasty it was like a five ounce state a steak I'm not sure what cut but on top of a bed of pasta that had a alfredo lobster sauce Oh Alfredo will do you an usually yeah any cream base is gonna just be way high-calorie but it was just so good and and it was kind of like I it wasn't at a premier steak place but I've been wanting to go get a nice steak in idea only do premier okay no like I'm just saying that's not what the place is known for yeah I gotcha but it was it was a delight at every turn I enjoyed it but then then I was instructed to lift heavy things I did I did advise that in you and and I took that under under advisement and so I did you and submit once the meal was done I managed to lift myself you know my half were you you were heavy at that point at that point I was very heavy and carry myself to a concert but that was saying you carried yourself to a concert yeah oh so you burned some calories like Raven or something right oh yeah yeah no I mean I I never sit down I'm just up there partying like you know the sweat pouring down my face and just I mean in the mosh ahead nine interconnects and more structure friends required anyway so the moral of the story is I found ascetics and you can have it thank you what is the inter connect it's a it's a terrible thing that you never want to have to deal with and I have I have absorbed this for you I is V wire the rest advised for your sins yes and every single block requires it like every single thing related to everything requires them and I have demonetised for your sins someone made an excellent point about the D monetization stuff though which is that in our random series where we were working on not saying D monetized we then promptly wandered around talking about the different dyes that we were collecting oh no I am aware of this contradiction I have been for quite some time that D ye is in fact a yeah it's it's a thing is it a thing it's a thing but but you know you have to carry on you can't let it stop you yeah no it's it's a thing so I realize that just saying die shouldn't be an issue because of your just mimin pretty much is how I take it part of it though is like I think if you say it enough probably it'll actually you know it could become problematic silver sheet metal which is a lot of silver a seat so silver plates gives me four and in order to make one of these I need twenty six which means I need eight so I need 32 that's a lot of math I'll be RP let's see anyway if I didn't catch up on all the notifications last time we gots Qaeda guy with the sub snake snack with the four months Bridgette thank you for the 200 bits I'm glad you got the water bottle I'm hoping that it'll be up to quality but I have not been able to verify so yeah BRP is usually I go pee when I say BRP but this time I don't actually have to pee surprising I know but anyway ramen and Zen jari thank you for the subs much appreciated and yeah I mean I I don't know if I can cancel Bridgette I mean Bridgette might be able to get I don't know I'll ask I'll ask I'll probably um ug I mean I pushed the represent that calm slash captain store slash cabins Fargas link like every video so they're people are bound to like go see the thing without me mentioning it specifically film and I'm not your evolved Bridger like you thought it was up for sale a and and you wanted to give it a plug here so I appreciate you giving it a plug I just um wish that they had how did I get fifty eight fifty eight wire in there yeah just one ball short of a set what do you do you just give me extra wire no oh but it makes you multiple out of each stamp because it's more efficient than doing it by hand oh really oh it doubles Oh dang-son dang-son dim sum dude are you do you have all the wire you need cuz I'm waiting I'm going too soon but I just want to let this go through because I'll tell you no matter how many interconnects you think you need you're gonna need ten times more just don't worry about it I am I am as like a lot of interconnects not gonna lie yeah yep yep rammer is like I've told you before that you need lots of lots of interconnects oh whatever mate there we go okay you're gonna perpetual state have I told you so no it's it's fine Oh Dustin it was Dustin gotcha the other the other all-knowing entity the all-knowing entity okay so I got my plastic got that going on got my plastic in the back my hose in a bag or something I don't you got your hose in a bag dude Wow what kind of person is mean we were finding out all kinds of new things yeah what other things are you finding out tell me your stories no you're the one who is telling us your stories wait are you telling us we might I'm sorry who goes for me I go first this room is starting to look like we're making a freaking circus tent oh just with all the wires like I kind of want like to be able to drape some cloth across it you know and then like get some marshmallows and some pillows and tell a story while living in a fort yeah yeah that is me maybe there's a resource pack out there that can I can turn basalt into pillows of pillow fort sure there's probably not it's probably optimistic but it'd be cool certainly no basalt in here there's a single basalt Wow okay cool cool cool cool cool we need to every time I will redirect you I know it's in the drawers I realize there's freaking 1,700 I'm gonna put them in the thing because I keep needing it and I want to auto craft things I am I am the efficiency King with my thing that you ignored for a little while but now you now you know it's a thing I mean I know it's a thing it's still a pain in the butt as soon as the other thing but it's still what other thing an Emmy system which we don't have access to I didn't say that we had it I just said it's not as good as that Rick I need to make more I needed to make a stack of them because I don't have jei and search synchronization if it had that then I'd be a lot happier that and if the X button didn't crap the stack what the heck is that okay you're still salty about the redstone servos you're still salty about the redstone servos no I just like to bring it up to push your buttons because you get angry about it I'm not angry it's fun times oh I need signal him don't I that means I need remembered how to make signaling which is always complicated I need redstone inside copper and things and blend and stuff what the Frick what the Frick dude sixteen more so three copper that's right it's three copper across and then one silver and then the redstone and we got redstone out of the thing didn't we which was good I think more lapies lazuli lapies lazuli whoa that's a lot of lap ease that we got in there and it's well not going anymore because we run out of glass there is so much to do holy crap it's gone through like a third it's gone to plaid it's gone through like a third oh yeah that's a Tesla thing now because of space balls yeah I mean that truck though Lou you want to talk about the truck you want to talk about the truck real quick because I am nice about this it's so pretty it's it's I will say I like my very initial reaction was just like what the heck like this I thought it was a joke when I saw I woke up and I'm looking at Twitter and I'm like what I'm like a wet where I can't imagine if I was there at the press conference or something I would have been like huh that's a funny joke that you guys just brought out like it's the one clay truck yeah you're gonna bring out the real one now oh my god I will say that it is grown on me a little bit like I'm not I'm not like thrilled with it and I still think the front like they could there's room for improvement but it is growing on me and it's been pretty cool to read about the engineering that goes into it cuz there is some cool stuff there oh yeah it's gonna be fast it's it's good of the top one's gonna do 0-62 2.9 seconds despite it probably weighing 10,000 pounds which is just weird but it's it's gotta be the world's most uh narrow dynamic thing that's ever been created it's not it's not extremely streamline but it's not the uh narrow dynamic thing ever created that's a little hyperbolic little hyperbolic time chamber is that anyway it is growing on me a little the more I thought about it particularly the price point like the it's it's to get into the the electric ecosystem at that price point yeah it's probably really cheap to make that body yeah well that's that's one of the reasons that was a it was cool about the body is just like and again like I was saying like just as I read about it and kind of learned about I was like that's actually kind of neat it's still it's a it's a look it's a very interesting look but here's the thing I think it's gonna be it's gonna be novel in the beginning when we see it and stuff for the first time but now it's gonna be cool the first time you see one roll by you're like it's a freaking tank yeah but then you're gonna be like okay that's so yeah so once every because it is everyone is all the sudden going to have it and I guarantee you at least in LA that the purchase it how do I make the lumina from this in LA at least I would bet you that the majority of purchases are gonna be from people who like don't need a pickup truck they've never even owned a pickup truck before they're just like yeah that's that's it right there dude no no no so I'm saying you're gonna see them all over the place and so it's gonna be like okay all half the cars on the street are this same colored silver box I mean you can't blame Tesla if you think it's actually gonna sell that well no no not at all it's good it's good for them for them the you know the the Windows thing is a distraction it was funny and it's sad that you know like never do a live demo I've done enough coding demo never do a live demo yeah it just ends badly but the reality is is you know as much as everyone enjoys talking about that there was some kind of cool tech behind it it's just really get our thing Philip who's Philip oh oh oh we ran out of fuel for the first time Oh fuel for what for the the thing that turns the glass into not what I want I can't so related the exploder yeah the exploder what the there we go got it just have the most if you so you're out of the you're out of the no no or finite way to put some : that's all parent : that's funny dude this disappointment your noise that's funny ha ha ha ha you need a funny dude I get it come on redstone let's go redstone here we go can I make the upgrades for this I forget what the upgrades are but I want to make them yes I wonder if these work on the basic stuff too because these are thermal foundation alright so a hardened upgrade kit would be just in var and Bronk the explosions are really annoying like I know that I don't know what to tell you man you're trying to think through things you're trying to work through problems in a boom boom boom stop stop god this is annoying like I feel like you have enough of the crystal stuff you don't need the the explosions going at this point no actually I do cuz it's uh that's not right that's right it actually ya know I I do um because we ran out it goes that it goes that fast oh it's our 400 efficiency now yeah but there you go it's it's still it's actually still using this it's oh my god this is nuts oh yeah I just need to make 2 buttons and put in my ear yeah it's uh yeah Wow ok it's it's we we actually do need all that so I'm gonna but no nevermind to break the basalt in it what ended no that's fine I just muted the game ok game over man oh I need an induction smelter with sand that's right ok ok well I need to make all of the interconnects on the planet so I'm gonna be using the the press mold thing for a little while yeah I'm good with it ok cool now and now my clients departing again oops I need more aluminum okay it's safe what's safe its secure I I could turn the game sounds back on without the boom boom oh yeah yeah yeah do you mean to have the induction smelter pumping into the or the redstone furnace pumping into the factorise er sometimes that's useful okay I did you want silver plates yes but they can just hang there until I need them sounds good sounds good well actually makes another ten thousand dinner connects I will be able to wire up more power so that will be good that will be good gosh darn it what's up my dude I just need to make a block of signal and it's like first you need to make the powdered stuff and then you got to make the blend and then you got induction and it's just like at some point just yeah a lot of stuffs work yes just make the thing you know what do I need to do to make there apparently your muffler in-game so I am being told I need to cast a no I'm not saying there anything called a muffler one moment's terminal thank you for the nine months scoff and thank you for the sub and hey if you're here from the homepage or passively tuned in or what have you and you feel like doing a fall if you free to do that if you'd like and also if you're just watching this as you normally would you're not yet following on Twitch you should probably do that and stuff like that Oh rammer you were thinking of our L craft which we were we were actually playing that or right before this so that's I yeah that is what you're thinking yeah you should be okay well now we're getting our aluminum I'll be able to make more interconnects at some point possibly it's a stack plus four there and then yay yeah it does help against the sirens as I learned very recently switch Challenger you on right now I'm working on the plant so er oh right right cool cool but we're running out of time on this one what do you mean we are it's been 45 minutes oh I was looking at the actual up that's when you start a little late sorry Saul Goodman Saul Goodman looking at the real clock oh boy this is gonna be going for a while well anyway I guess uh let me make more interconnect so you could never have too many interconnects if there's one moral of the story here that's what I want really take away I feel like you have too many interconnects though no I I don't I just you can't you can never have too many interconnects yeah but what if you had too many like stay with here with me here don't think you can you can but and hear me out what if you did okay so we will make 8mm full-stack for you inductor of course full stack EU o stack at you oh we're out of aluminum iam aluminium aluminium dude just niobium ingots in here there's pulverized aluminum inside the no I got it we're fine we're fine don't you worry I apologize for making an attempt to assist my bad oh it's chill dawg BRR okay now plant so er I have got more interconnects whoa will it be enough the world may never know who whoa horton hears a who ooh what no no no oh oh I need like all of these Wow okay cool boy oh boy no shortage of things that we need no shortage of things that we need gosh darn it weird we have no bricks I just don't know where they are that would be annoying bothersome oh my bad is low how do i oh my cookies I forgot I would like you to not do ya no cookies no this is dude this broadcast is not intended for children yeah dude we talked about mature topics here like dog bean that was actually and that was offline for me but it was on your end yeah yeah everybody who's watching is just like what the heck yeah don't worry about it Jordan just was like is that a dog penis with what holding in my hand that's you don't need any more context in that it was as weird as its cuz it looked like a red rocket ship okay the man the man has no filter you despite the fact that he filters himself every day it's weird it's weird he's like he keeps himself from using the language and then he's just like so is that a red rocket ship it's all good crap okay one more one more though with the right things okay we got nine all right oh nine all right that's not how you make cookies that's a it's a lot of cookies I'm so close to actually having all this stuff that we need now we need to know modifier a not a fire a not a fire yes I think I got it I think I have acquired everything we need nice hey whoa that was quick now I have to do the assembly assembly or however was assembly the assembly so how did I make that because if I could do that and that would be better than not doing it bronze gear invar ingots and redstone what do you think I should put this right over there but where would it actually be most helpful like I'm thinking up there okay I buy the windmills would be my guess maybe on top of the windmills God you got you wait I'll put it underground I you were the one asking like up um okay so I assume that uh rammer wants us to use some lead stone here probably well okay so hopefully we can do an output that's does all your stuff feeds into the energy cells I'm assuming it okay okay solar array Tier one do we know how many blocks off the ground this thing should be probably four or five possibly one to ten in copper well let's just do it Hey we're just gonna do it look at you go it did the thing reader one we made it always gives me a weird ratio isn't it we we make D we D D so now uh hey that's pretty nifty we just probably have to wire up power something like that so the alloy mixer doesn't actually do stuff but three two one on copper and tin stop being highlighted tin wire it to the energy so got it got it got it so that should be do we know if this thing has to have a power output out of every single solar cell or is it just one Oh where'd you go it's just me reset my client don't worry well we're what was the question I don't know where the power output is it just connects into the side I think the array oh the controller okay flux duct is what we want to use well he's been trying to give us his Flex tux for a while right he has it's true we've resisted temptation I need to do all this stupid hardened glass thing though is the annoying part Jesus and the members initially looks okay but you you have anything as far as a tank here empty oh you got your your signal yes this does not appear to be working cool all right I'm putting the signal I'm in the storage area in the in the storage thing where what what where was the signal it was in the induction smelter oh yeah yeah yeah just threw some in the right okay copper and then tin let's let's see if it works with ingots I'll have some of this see if that works instead big money fill up my win-win way yeah that tends in there the other side doesn't be working oh oh look at that thing fill up oh look at that thing fill up dude what are you getting that power do we in mad power from the solar array you like to see it you like to see it oh my gosh what embers I think we got mad power now I think I need you to do the connecting thing with the numbers connecting thing where one of the two groups goes into the one of the schwab swoops yes yes is that you need yeah troops into this one of course I mean of course yes into the melter the melters not getting swooped as this right melter seems to be very cold-hearted um which which one are you looking to get into yeah melter no okay so this this this receiver right here yeah yay okay cuz the coppers just sitting in there like ah and I'm catching me top huh oh yeah yeah oh look at it it's it's you did you did all the work I did it you did all the work I you take credit you take credit for everything what I give in to you it's my guilt you know I thought that sounded like an insult you you just take credit for everything holy crap I just got another three stacks of laughy's from a single a single dust yeah I mean you know eight-eight efficiency is fairly efficient you mean 4624 efficiency well no there's it was that's the efficiency of like speed but there was like plus eight hundred percent right no that's the eight hundred percent is a speed four thousand six hundred percent is the efficiency so pretty if we get four hundred sixty-two more than we would normally which is why we're out of glass the story that's why we're out of glass yeah okay story took a turn I wasn't expecting upgrade glass how do you upgrade last Oh to endure iam oh dude only only the finest of upgraded glass here yeah I need bronze for oh I need a bronze gear no yeah I don't I don't know what the next tier up of glass is but uh jeez it's it's it's that's definitely not what they were used it's literally one single crushed lap ease one single one goes through all of our glass and that's us like four stacks what ya know literally as that little crushed lap ease gets us four stacks of laughs easy that doesn't sound good it's too much for the glass it's too much sax of diamonds with one dust whenever we want so you know that glasses to the glass game is 2stronk okay so it just can't be handled yeah oh boy that's that's a bit much I know I don't think we needed that alright well we never need to go beyond the endear iam I'm pretty sure at this point I forget how to turn this on it was right there yeesh okay now that should have well you um you want to wind things down now since I know you were starting to do it previously I didn't start I was just commentating on the comments oh that's right this is on now flow flow darn you flow so interesting thing about this challenge is that yeah in order to unlock part two I had to be in possession of ninety-eight literate it didn't credit me with that but it allowed me to unlock part two which I've now completed but the challenge is not complete so I can't move on to the next thing huh yeah I don't know I don't know either it's it bugged out or something like that um do I have any more why is this not glowing I want you to flow I want you to pump just pump and flow pump just pump you pompous anyway we'd like to do get yourself a server save some money also in that same link we have a you ruin me in that same description you find a link to the playlist so you can catch up on any
