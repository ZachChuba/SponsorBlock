okay I think it's time take some
questions let's see whoa Oh vert link asks when
sorting your Legos do you disassemble and mix the parts from various Lego
builds I did do you also mix in the non official Legos no no I don't in sorting
the Legos it turns out that some folks had given my boys what is the other
what's the non Lego what's the non Lego the main one I can't remember I know
you're yelling at the screen and I should remember now it'll come back to
me in a second but when you are touching Legos all the time and you touch a non
Lego that could work with the Legos boy you can tell like that what you don't
know about poker chips and casinos is that they sound a specific way and it is
really hard to replicate that sound and it actually helps the people whose job
it is to work with the poker chips know when they've gotten one that's
counterfeit and the same goes true Mega Bloks Mega Bloks Mega Bloks look I don't
begrudge the fact that they make a product based on the fact that Legos
patent on those pips just expired that's fine that's that's commerce that's
totally great but when you handle non Lego parts and Lego parts together you
just really get to see the level of precision and accuracy that is in Lego
blocks so part of me has just been thinking about mega blocks and like I
wanted to make a t-shirt that said mega blocks not even once but I don't really
feel like that like if you want to buy mega blocks you should totally buy and
expand your collection with mega blocks that's fine with me I find them
abhorrent abhorrent but that's you know that's just me that's simply an opinion
so that's why I've never gonna make a t-shirt that says that I don't want to
interrupt interfere with their commerce I'm just expressing my opinion that's
all alright let's go back to the beginning Steve Keller says
can you tell us what your top three favorite places in san francisco are hmm
I've been thinking about this a lot because we've been doing we've been
taking Maggie our dog to Golden Gate Park on a fairly frequent basis over the
last two and a half months we we started sequestering about a week before me by
we I mean in my house we stopped contacting going out of about a week
before the lockdown and so we've been taking Maggie to Golden Gate Park and
Golden Gate Park is endlessly amazing it is a true gem of a park I think it's the
largest public park in a major urban area I could be wrong about that like
that could be one of those things that the locals say that's not actually true
but things like places I love in San Francisco
I love secret steps there's a whole bunch of them on Lion Street and all
over the city there are secret ways of getting around oh my god the steps up to
Coit Tower some super super beautiful vistas there is this house if you go up
to Coit Tower and you face East there is this house with a glassed-in deck and
then below that deck is this room that has a commanding view of everything from
the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to the San Mateo Bridge it's kind of insane
I mean that's the thing about San Francisco that is so awesome as a city
and I have my issues with San Francisco as a city but on a physical level is a
gorgeous place and full of tons of little gems that you just don't know
about there's a whole secret neighborhood up behind UCSF over there
off of Parnassus it's like really cool little little Enclave but then there are
plenty of enclaves in the middle of everywhere Schrader I mean if like yeah
Schrader Street on Halloween is magical so is Fair Oaks so much of what I used
to love about San Francisco is gone I used to love the industrial areas I used
to find it really relaxing to go through the dumpsters down on King Street
before the ballpark was there before UCSF built a whole new city down in
Dogpatch that was in wasteland there was nothing there and there was nobody there
to literal tumbleweeds I kind of missed that I mean I've been in San Francisco
long enough that like a lot of things I used to do are not only gone but the
buildings they were in or gone I did a lot of hanging out and a in the Upper
Haight at a friend's house on Rivoli Street in the early 90s and remember
Quentin Kopp our state senator Quentin Kopp he had a son named Brad and Brad
was a good friend of mine back then awesome musician awesome human a force
of nature and Brad had a place on Rivoli Street and I drove by it the other day
we were heading back from the Parkman's like oh I'll make it left unruly and
looking look up the old haunt cuz we had a lot of fun we had a lot of shenanigans
in that house gone gone or they built they tore it down and built something
else out to the street the one story I remember about really Street is we were
we were driving around in my Volvo one evening and we passed a dumpster out in
front of Japan town bowl and japantown Bowl was throwing out all these bowling
pins so of course I opened the back of my Volvo station wagon
and we just shoveled him as many bowling pins as we could fit in my Volvo
given that it was about like 1:00 in the morning we're like what can we do who
these bowling pins this is this is the best description of being 23 that I can
possibly imagine so we drove over to Brad's house on rivarly Street and we
set up not ten but like let's see tennis right we set up like a much bigger
triangle of bowling pins and we're almost done setting this thing up and we
thought this was hilarious it is it gets like 1:30 in the morning and then one of
us tripped knocked a bowling pin and all the bowling pins fellow
here's why that's the funniest thing that like ever happened to me up until
that moment because when bowling pins fall over you know what they sound like
they sound like bowling pins falling over but when you're standing on the
corner of Stan yin and Rivoli at 1:30 in the morning to hear that like coal that
like classic hollow sound of plastic coated wooden bowling pins doing their
business it's so incongruous it's like the funniest thing that ever happened to
you that wasn't really a that wasn't really just about three favorite places
but I've been I've had a lot of time recently to reflect upon the things that
I loved about the city I loved driving up to Twin Peaks I loved going on to
Alcatraz I mean the headlands I know they've
closed them right now the headlands are surpassingly beautiful did I plant any
Easter eggs in any of my models at ILM oh and a wants to ask yes wait right
there I haven't okay I'm gonna run over and see if I can find this thing and
then I'm gonna bring it back damnit I couldn't find it I'll find it
and I'll do a show-and-tell about it I built Newt and runes shuttle for
episode 1 that's the spider legged thing that lands on the plaza of Naboo and
I've talked about this before on tested but I built that with Larry tan an
amazing and wonderful guide I'm sorry model maker and guy who
separated me through my early weeks and Industrial Light magic in mid-1998 when
I got there to work on Episode one and Larry brought me into the Newton ruin
shuttle I started working on it and then he had to move onto something else and
so I ended up doing all the finished detailing on the loading bay and the
opening doors and the ramp it was some of the first laser cutting I was doing
and Doug Chiang was or quickly saw that I could be self-directed so he gave me
less and less guidance and was just letting me cut loose with some of the
some of the detailing which again like dying and going to heaven
on the underside so you only ever see the rear of the shuttle like from a
lateral like from level with it and I needed some detail an underside of the
of the doors open the ramp comes down and I needed some ceiling detail there
so I added some and I kind of noticed the detail I was adding looked a little
like a dancing bear and so I leaned into that and years later Jim Fong who hired
me to build some models for Galoob toys years later a couple years later Galoob
toys made a model of Newton's shuttle and sure enough my dancing bear is
visible on the underside I mean it's not it's not like a you know it's not like
the Grateful Dead bear it's still like a it's imply it's an
implication of the dancing bear but that's what I was thinking about cartoon
arrow asks besides Miyazaki's movies do you like any other Anning anime series
I love metropolis Akira is of course seminal II important to me
Satoshi Kon paprika holy crap what an amazing film paprika is insane and
really beautiful millennium actress is another one of his I got turned on to
his work by Tony show of every frames a painting those are the main ones those
are the main ones I love ghost in the shell' I mean the classics I'm
definitely I'm definitely a fan of the classics okay let's see here Easter eggs
I'm sorting here Legos okay the demon the demon I feel like I'm being forced
to say something wrong but apparently not the demon wants to know oh he says
it's my he or she its my 26th birthday and I have to make some long-term career
choices in the next month that could take me all across the country how do
you make big decisions like when you moved out to California I don't know
that I'm gonna have advice that's really like germane to your specific situation
but I'll explain what was going on I moved to San Francisco in August of 1990
prior to that I had been living at home with my parents for about 18 months so
in the know for just just under a year actually right because the previous
summer in the summer of 89 I visited San Francisco right that
sit I visited San Francisco and while I was gone my landlord checked out had to
do some repair in my place I lived in this fifth floor walk-up on Carroll
Street in Brooklyn next to Prospect Park eight at eight Avenue and Carroll Street
there and my landlord went into my apartment and it was so so messy that my
landlord wondered if I was actually living there or if it was like a
homeless encampment and then they kicked me out so I went to San Francisco right
I went to San Francisco and left like 10 days before the Loma Prieta earthquake while I was in San Francisco the topic
of square Parks riots happened that which was a huge deal I always I felt
like I was missing the important things traveling across the country and then I
got kicked out of my apartment and then I moved back home and it's like
everybody kind of moves back home for some period of time it's just it's like
par for the course and I moved back home and let's see it was it was lovely
moving back home I think it was less lovely for my parents I know my mom's
watching this right now and she would say oh no it was great to have you back
home but I also remember at one point my girlfriend at the time Tara who's still
a good friend of mine Tara a friend of hers got married Emily got married in
England and so I had saved up some dough and I said to my dad
this is an early 1990 oh I'm gonna head to London with tar to go to this wedding
and he was like you know he was like man he goes May he was like you know what I
hear when I hear that all I hear is that you're just gonna be living with us for
another six months like when I use that money to get the hell out you didn't
quite say it like that but as a parent now I really get where
he's coming from that's totally understandable so I was living at home I
was still working in the city for a graphic design firm that's still there
Laura is still there anyway and my best friend at the time my closest friend
called me up and he was he'd been living in San Francisco
about a year and he was like listen I never wanted to live with you and I
still don't but you can't possibly be worse than my current roommate so you
want to move out here and live with me and the thing is is that I had like I
said I'd spent the previous three weeks the previous summer in 89 visiting San
Francisco I had visited for the first time the summer before that in 1988 and
in 1988 at 21 years old I thought this is the most beautiful city I have ever
seen and I was standing on the corner of Gulf and Lombard which is like if you
can follow him up with San Francisco on the corner of Gough and Lombard you're
in for a treat man because it gets all uphill from there literally and
figuratively thank you everybody I'll be here all
week so I came out for three weeks to stay with my brother on 16th Street and
my brother's roommate still lives there in that same apartment yeah did you
really want a story Lanie didn't you do money to walk down story lane anyway um
how did I make the decision I it just was the right call at the time I love
San Francisco I had a built in place to live I knew my
friend had a nice place over on Broderick Street and I moved out and he
kicked me out after a year because I was still a terrible roommate I mean I was
super messy and not very considerate and I was you know myopic like all young
human beings can be just like the Stars kind of aligned for that you can recover
from any decision I think that's the thing I'd like to tell you you're a -
you're 26 years old it's your birthday you're still really young to be honest
adolescence has only just finished or still roughing out and it's smoothing
out the rough edges of you as they now know adolescence lasts way into your 20s
and when you're a parent as I am now and you see your kids be young adults you're
like wow we were such babies back then but you have time to recover and you
know if the decision you make isn't the right one there's time to try another
one I don't I hope that was helpful sorry I went a little too far down there
like talking about the old days did you ever
meet George Lucas super Maggio wants to know what was it like I think it's safe
to say that everyone who worked at ILM when I was there met George not
frequently but you met him at the parties he was there he was approachable
he stayed the whole state most of the time and again like you everybody had
everyone who works there worked there when I was there had a story about like
having some random conversation with him because it's a life --all person to talk
to I did get to actually be in the art
department for Episode two for a few weeks mark Segal and I got to join John
Goodson and John Duncan in the top floor of the big house up at the ranch and I
got to be in a couple of meetings with George as he came in and made changes to
the models that we were making I mark Segal and I built the very first foam
core mock-up of the arena from episode 2 super focused super super super focused
the very first time I met him we knew he was coming up for meeting Rick McCallum
came first and George came up the stairs and they were just looking at a walking
with dinosaurs had aired on television the night before and they were looking
to hire some of the animators from that so that was the first part of the
meeting was Rick's fast-forwarding through Walking with Dinosaurs and
George going who ever animated that let's hire them you know for whatever
you think of the movies for whatever you think of some of the movies versus
others of the movies the fact is the George gave an amazing gift to our
culture with Star Wars franchise and continues to I loved watching all the
behind the scenes stuff on the mandalorian and seeing how present he is
with Favreau and felonious that feels right I mean and I mean that feels right
I mean the mandalorian itself feels right and when you look at the mood that
was clearly going on behind the scenes of kind of real love fest for the for
the original material from the creator as well as all these directors
interpreting it it was lovely and when you go to a party especially at
the ranch I went to one party there I brought my twins when they were 8 months
old yes no five months old five months old they've been born just a few months
prior and when the fourth of july party happened up at the ridge and i pulled up
in the car and i was like here's my invitation in the garden was like the
invitations for two people and there's four of you in the car and I'm like
these are babies they're not gonna eat anything here and I promise they will
never touch the ground through healthcare here they're like you can go
in so you're sitting there in the ranch with all your fellow employees and their
spouses so like 3,000 people and it still feels expansive and quiet and you
just any time you spend up at the ranch looking around you just I think to
myself man I'm not thinking big enough about the world cuz George took up one
movie and built all that like for real that's that's a real real thing so it's
like it's easy to make fun of some of the stuff involving the movies and I'm
as guilty of that as anybody else but mad respect to the dude it was it was
heady and delightful to be in a couple meetings with him thank you for your book rad fracked asks
thank you for your book the concept of mistake tolerance has been life-changing
for me do you have any tips on self forgiveness for absolute failures though
not for just mistakes let's parse that question for a second absolute failure
it's like you lost a friend because you screwed up because you really boned
something or you lost a job for the same reason things were the course of your life or
somebody's life was changed by your mistake
all of those have happened to me do I have any tips on self forgiveness man
I'm as bad at it as anybody else you know I try and remember there are things
I try and remember I try to remember that time will make this feel better I
try and remember that everybody goes through this then nobody escapes it's
it's that simple and that's the hardest damn thing that there is it is that
simple tips I it would be it would be improper for me to give tips for self
forgiveness because it's we're all terrible at it it's not easy to do its we are our own worst critics right and
we know deep in our hearts exactly how jealous and venal and lazy we can be when you screwed up the only thing you
can do is resolve 10 leads I set it in the book the only thing you can do is
resolve to not replicate that same set of circumstances again and that's real
and the people that you love they see that like that's well I'll say this
Heinemann and I in our association in their long association had lots of highs
and lows and there were times we just felt super glowy about each other at
times we wanted to plunge a pan into each other's necks but one of the things
I will give it up for for that guy and he said the same to me that we both had
this quality of like something's not working and you bring it up and you talk
about it between the two of you he would he would he would alter his behavior
he'd hear what I was saying and like adjust a bit that's the thing you're not going to
avoid the mistakes but the real shitbirds in the world the people that
the toxic people that you just don't want to deal with are the ones who are
just gonna continue to do the same thing to you every single time so the very
fact that you're like asking questions about how to process an absolute mistake
is progress because there's a whole bunch of people who don't I'm thinking
of one right now look being able to process your mistakes
and learn from them is that's another thing that I think of as being a person
but not everyone thinks that that's real okay Dan UCF fan says Bladerunner I've
never watched it all the way through I know I'm sorry
which version would you suggest as the quintessential version to watch that's a
good question I mean I'm inclined my inclination is to
say watch it the original release the American release with the voice-over and
the happy ending cuz that's the version that it feels like the right one to be
but that's only because that's the one I grew up on I love the final final
director's cut I love Ridley Scott's cut that has no narration it's beautiful the
unicorn shot still bothers me just the tiniest bit but it's tiny tiny I'm I'm
I'm picking nits the final director's cut is the final cut is brilliant and
actually there is a reason to watch the original theatrical release and then to
watch that one because it's quite educational it was to me to notice in
theatrical cut Harrison Ford is narrower all sorts of stuff sushi that's what my
ex-wife called me all of those little speeches that feeling in me for her what
was happening to me all that stuff I don't mind the narration because I I
mean that's the version I grew up on but when the narration is gone I went and
watched it at the Opera House theater and when when it came out and I felt
like I was seeing a brand-new movie and I'd seen Blade Runner like dozens of
times but there's a way in which when someone's talking at you your brain
shuts off some of the visual faculties in order to process the Lang narration
there were aspects of the film I could see also there's all these shots in the
spinner when gaff and Deckard are flying around there's more of those shots in
the final cut and they're beautiful and there's I don't know there's just it's
the place in which Ford seems the most unlike Harrison Ford not that that's a
good or bad thing but there's a way in which he seems sort of young and the
character is not sure what's gonna happen and that's so extent in the scene
and the way that he and almost are playing it I just I love love love those
scenes yeah but also the compromise cut is super thrilling and weird and awesome
look basically the the the the DVD set of all of the versions is an education
in film there's there's a lot to learn from seeing small and large iterative
changes to something that you love and the nerd asks what was your favorite
project some of your kids so one of the one of the very few magazine covers I
did back in the days of Mythbusters was I did a cover story for Wired they were
doing a geek dad issue and I was the cover cover guy and they the the back then was that Chris
Anderson or Scott date it was running it back then I think it was Scott remember
at any rate they they called me up it was either Chris or Scott and said hey
we'd like to do a geeky episode what stuff have you done with your kids
we'd love some of the projects and I was like I am a terrible dad I haven't built
very much stuff with my kids at all and they're like well if you build anything
I'm like yeah like three things and then I described them to them they were like
great put those in the article I had a friend who wrote to me names like thanks
for making me look like a bad dad and I'm like those are literally the only
three things I go with them I built a hovercraft with them after we
built the hovercraft on Mythbusters I brought the boys over to the to Jamie's
shop one weekend and we built a hovercraft together that was a lot of
fun that was maybe the most fun thing we did together yeah yeah later on each kid
has been over here to the cave to make something that they needed and I give
guidance but I'm also a bit of a hard taskmaster master I you know I want them
to figure it out and so I show them how to use the tools safely and then I let
them scrub it's like that's how you that's how you do it and both are really
intuitive makers of different stripes than I am but they both have the ability
to put something in their head and render it out with their hands that's
really neat it's neat to watch happening it's it's fascinating having a
relationship with adult children yeah it's very cool let's see how do you
decide when to throw out stuff whether it's material or other stuff no cave as
a TARDIS where space is infinite I have this problem from time to time yeah I
throw out a lot of stuff but still it's a process right when I
need to clear space I start asking questions not just about the things but
about categories of things so there's all these like I had the mechanics of
three pianos that I've been stirring for somewhere around 20 years
why why why do I need those they're beautiful they're gorgeous I let them go
to a local artist but why did I need to store them if I really needed the
mechanics to a piano that is something that I could go get that they exist you
can purchase those you could buy a junked piano you can go to urban or
there's probably two in there right now and you could just buy them and pull the
pull the mechanics out that helps inform so for me a lot of the stuff I stored it
was because I had no money and I had to get my materials where I could find them
so if I came across the dumpster that had some bowling pins and and I grabbed
a bunch because well that's it I could I might be able to use that and I don't
need to store everything anymore I still store weird stuff that I can't easily
get elsewhere but I have been more like stuff that I've been saving for years
for like material usage is like I let's just let that one go look it's a it's a
process I don't have hard and fast rules about it and right now I and moving some
stuff around the cabin I've got to get a bunch of stuff out of here and I'm
getting rid of a whole couple of categories up in in deep storage
upstairs and I still never done a show-and-tell up I I mean it's it's
awful right now it's all low pipes bang your head every single time look I I
love Murray condos whole ethos of like does this do I still need to be the
steward of this thing or can I let it go it's a great question to ask all the
time sorry I don't have a really specific
answer to that question it is a good question but man it's just it's a
different process for everyone for everything
for all the places and yeah I actually have one less storage space now than I
had a year ago because I have been consolidating and I'm still trying to
consolidate enough to get rid of the other storage space I have in San
Francisco so that I can end up with only one storage space in San Francisco yeah
that's how bad it is I also have a storage space in New York I've got to
get that stuff out here at some point yeah someday joseph jordan says like no
question do you keep the boxes and instructions for sets do you keep them
in put-together mode or do you ever disassemble I do not keep the directions
I think I throw them out about as fast as I build the kit I toss the box to I
don't keep boxes for things when I buy new electronics I'll hold on to the box
for a few weeks just in case I have to ship it back because something went
wrong but um no and in the Lego sort I went through the collection of assembled
Legos that I had and I disassembled a couple I don't need the Flatiron
Building I don't need that Flatiron Building so I took it apart and
distributed among the various color categories and that felt weird I have
not done that before that this is the first time I have dismantled a kit
specifically for the express purpose of spreading it among the collection but
it's a good thing to do there's again it's a great thing you
said no shop is a TARDIS that's it's lovely because those of us with shops we
wish they were TARDIS we really do it would be so delightful
if you could put an infinite number of things in it would it be delightful
would it be delightful would you feel like you're just carrying that chain all
the time that could be the case all right Hikari
Yamato asks I recently relist into your audio book every tools a hammer thank you
listening to it again I'm really happy with that audio book hmm by the way
before I went and recorded the audiobook which was super fun took about 12 hours
14 hours maybe misses don't try this my wife played for me some of Elisabeth
Gilbert's book big magic and there's a way in when she reads that book that is
really really neat it's almost like SM our IMS are ASMR you know what I mean
it's it feels like she's it feels like she's almost like talking in your ear
it's really nice it's very it's very intimate and it's very it feels like a
audio hug to a certain extent and she said I think you should consider
recording your book like this and I agreed so we really tried to make it
sound like a like a personal experience you were having with me so I'm glad you
listened to it but you had a question and the question is what would you say
was the easiest and hardest parts of the book mentally to plan out write about oh
my god writing a book there's no is everything about it was
super hard everything about it was a slog 90,000 words give or take a hundred
thousand words a lot a lot of stuff it was really hard to figure out what to
illustrate and what to not what they like what to include photos with and not
I I went overboard on the photo the editorial paired be back and I'm
totally fine with the pictures that are in the book as far as the storytelling I really there was no part I found harder
than any other part it was just the robustness of telling stories at that
depth for a book so that they really resonated when material have some
cohesion across across the length of these stories that was really tough
there were chapters like to glue chapter that came together very quickly at the
beginning and then the problem is my the problem is my
material knowledge is very specific and while I am a generalist that means that
there's very few things I really know a lot about right I know a little bit
about a lot of things but I know a lot about just a few things and glue is one
of those ones in which I had a real trouble so first I started by writing
out about all these different glues and then I thought this is ridiculous I'm
starting to do researchers I don't even use to talk about them why would I write
about things that I don't use and that's what I understood the frame that I
should be taking which is here's the glues I use and if I had to choose five
glues here they are and here's why I like them here's their limitations
here's the way I think through them the glue chapter was a sea change in my
understanding of how to write about my own personal Authority and point of view
about material science and the engineering that I do because I'm very
careful not to pretend to be an authority about stuff I don't know about
or to give caveats to the stuff that I do feel like I have some some point of
view on and to be honest my the the team I had working with me on the book was
phenomenal and they made the process a lot easier
the people at atria yeah but man that was a slog I look I have another book I
want to write another book I've got a reasonable outline in my head and at
some point I'm going to take it out and pitch it but but right now III it was
like a couple of years getting that book across the line a lot of stress felt
like a homework assignment that never ended and I tell my wife I'm like I you
know I've got another book she's like really you want to go back in then you
want to go back into that room into that slog because they kicked your ass no it
really did and yet I feel like I have more to say so there will be a I think
there will be another one at some point Tom Turin says how often do you get
recognized and stopped in public well now
now now I'm like I don't get recognized at all we're all covered with masks man
there's no fame anymore plus it's been a long time since I've been on television
so even before the lockdown it only happened I don't know every two or three
days I'm pretty ubiquitous in this neighborhood I'm around I go to all the
places everyone kind of knows me is not that it's not that special I'm not that
special I did have someone recognized my one-wheel the other day I was riding and
they were going the opposite way and I saw them see the one-wheel and realize
that it had to be mine and they looked up and they saw my hat and even though I
was wearing a mask they could tell that it was me that was funny iron Wheaties
asks I know a ton of people are digging into digging deep into home improvement
during quarantine has the same happen for you or are you satisfied with making
things that you already would have been making oh no no I've been doing some
home improvement in fact one day build that's coming up soon involved a
bonafide piece of furniture that I made for the house and it was read there like
I I can't wait till this one goes up because you haven't seen me make things
of this strength before I was not trying to make like a beautiful piece of
furniture I was trying to make something that was aesthetically pleasing but I
was really I was really trying to solve a problem about an area in the house
where stuff happened and it was like you know like in your foyer where you take
off your coat and you put your hat you should have some hooks right for the
code and the hat and if you don't you might put them up and that's the kind of
improvement this piece of furniture I built was it was for entering the house
and for holding on to some things and again
I wasn't interested in making a piece of furniture that was like hey look at me
I'm a beautiful piece of furniture I wanted to make it kind of a boring piece
of furniture Otis but then fit really well with the house
and that was a super interesting tactic take I also did real woodworking I did
real mortise and tenon joints for it clamped it included and
it's real that the piece of furniture will last for a lifetime it's well-made
i if I say so myself I even cut I even did some of the cutting on the milling
machine and woodworking with a milling feels like cheating man it's so awesome
so no I have been doing some home improvement I'm also working on our
garage because we have a ton of crap in there that we don't need have in there
we are just two adults who ride bicycles so why do I have four bicycles in the
garage we can move two of them over to storage or just going to happen soon so
yeah in fact actually the house is better organized now than it has ever
been and that feels lovely you know you get into routines in your living space
you get a new year routines you you you occupy the same parts of your living
space right and sometimes that feels like sometimes he feels like you're in a
rut for me that sometimes they can feel like you're in a rut and a couple years
ago my wife pointed out that we were under utilizing a part of our living
space and so we sort of engendered a we moved where our bedroom was and just
that simple thing kind of changed our lives and made us feel much more like
we're inhabiting the whole space that we live in and that feels really lovely yeah I I'm very lucky I I'm very happy
with our house and really love it and I've deep like affection for it right
it's a it's a it's a lovely space and I'm incredibly lucky to have that it is
a real privilege and yeah so home improvement absolutely I've actually was
noticing we have on the side of our house we have some planters full of
plants and they're irrigated and they drain into the side of the house and the
floor drain out there and what that means is that after that over the ten
years that we've been there the the where
the irrigation runoff goes down is a path of like like any green and brown
and all of that and it's basically ripe for a pressure washing video like those
ones on reddit all the time so I was thinking yeah I'm gonna call Jamie up
and borrow its pressure washer and do one of those videos of pressure washing
beside the sidewalk on the side of my house mad coinage asks what is the earliest
prompt project that you have kept around I'll show to you give me just a second
I'll be right back I think I did a show and telling us on testin if I did when
we break this out we'll uh we'll include that this right here is one of the
earliest things that I know earliest physical objects that I made I made this
in shop class in seventh grade in seventh grade I was 12 years old yeah
give or take I was 12 years old so that would be 1970 70-79 yeah and I wanted I
on the little rascals they were on all the time when I was a kid and they
there's this whole episode in which they're driving around in a Model A Ford
and hitting people with a boxing glove on the end of a big accordion arm like
this and I wanted to make such a thing and so the shop teacher showed me how to
do it these are hammered rivets and as you can see my hole spacing is terrible
but yeah I still have this think this isn't the oldest thing that I have hold
on wait I do have one older yeah okay so this is from let me just
see here as if you are not familiar with my with my past my father was painter
and this is a piece of art that I made I was six years old and noticed that my
dad actually signed it for me by Adam Savage April 1973 portrait of
jingle-jingle was my teddy bear and here is jingle this is my portrait at six
years old of jingle this was made while I was supposed to be napping I snuck
downstairs out of the house into my dad's studio which was the modified
two-car garage behind our house and I traced my teddy bear
onto a piece of construction paper and then I gave him all the things that I
aspired to which was a cool vest a gold belt buckle and Superman shirt and then
I wrote my name here no I wrote his name jingle ji ji le savage s on the bottom a
Vig Savage this is like a spelling equivalent of talking with your mouth
full this is what I could achieve and at six years old but bless my parents for
saving this I still have it I wrote a whole article and I had a column for
Wired magazine a few years ago and this was I think the very first column I
wrote for them was about jingle hear this you can never go wrong saving some
of your early stuff or even just taking pictures of it yeah those are those are
definitely the two oldest pieces I have in here Andrew Barth hey Andrew
how's it going Andrew birth has a question is there any project you've
been putting off for years waiting for the right opportunities to come together
yeah yeah there is yeah there is and there's one I'm still dying to do man I am the obsessed and delighted owner of
a 1982 Toyota Landcruiser BJ 42 diesel right-hand drive I love this car so much
during lockdown right now thing too is driving it and he's pretty happy about
that as any young human being would be to drive such a fun car but come on it
can't be too long before Diesel's just out long right I mean we got to stop
driving gasoline cars that's that's totally clear so I want to I want to
electrify the Land Cruiser I want to electrify the Land Cruiser and I want to
film the whole process it's an expensive process
I've looked deeply into it I've talked to experts I've talked to all sorts of
different folks bran Ferren and Danny Hillis and the CTO of Ford and Simone
and yeah all sorts of great people have consulted with me about electrifying
this Cruiser and I still never gotten around to it
but someday soon I'm going to electrify that thing absolutely it's going to get
electrified that that's definitely one thank you Andrew it's good to hear from
you let's see em mr. six 507 asks what is your start and end of day procedure
for the shop I always see all the lights on an individual tools do you flip one
big breaker at the end of the day yes I do I have a lot of these are on some
sort of modified x10 system or something like that like the home automation has
been plugged I have all a lot of these individual lights some of them are these
like 4 watt LEDs I just need them on but over at the front of the shop there is
both a master switch for the fluorescents and then a remote that
turns off all the late cabinets and and a lot of the smaller lights bubble
factory asks what do you feel are the pros and cons of having a shop in a
separate location from your shop from your home this is a great question hmm
pros there are no cons to having a shop close
to my home honestly I love having a shop close to the house I love it even more
than having a shop in the house I have had shops in my house I prefer a shop
that's outside my house but close by there's no constitute honestly this
place is like I breathe here right this is like this is this is where I inhale
the world and exhale my thoughts about it and it's only a few blocks from my
house here and that's that's oh my god I feel so lucky to have that I feel so
lucky to have that especially at this time where I can come and have something
to do yeah there's not really look having a shop in your house is amazing
and if I had a giant house I would love to have a shop in there but I don't the
cons of having a shop in the house are worth talking about because when I first
had a shop in the house and I had kids I thought well this is great I can be down
here all the time and yet I'm still home so I can kind of do both things and the
answer is no you can't yeah when you're raising kids you got to either
concentrate on raising kids or you got to be not concentrating on raising kids
if there's no half concentrating on raising kids so the house the shop in
the house didn't really afford me more time in the shop in fact I found more
time in the shop when I put it away from the house it's there's a little there's
more to discuss here than I can really go into it this moment not nothing
because there's Blake personal details I don't want to reveal but it's it this is
sort of long arc of my discovery about the levels of consciousness about
wanting to work in here and also being part of your house and being part of
your family every every everybody struggles with that balance of life and
work and so have I and so do i but interestingly I have found having the
shop outside the house to be a real boon and it's really nice that those two
spaces are separated and even during the short
journey I make from here back home at the end of each day that journey allows
me to transition to being home it allows me to put my head in the space of being
in my house and seeing the people that have been there all day and wondering
what life is like for them and interacting with them for the rest of
the evening I find that to be a real grace and I like that okay last question
Thank You minutes already man this goes so freaking fast mate P says is there a
silver lining that could come from this pandemic as it pertains to the maker
movement yeah totally there are there are so many potential
silver linings to this and by silver linings let's be clear like if
something's gonna kill hundreds of thousands of Earthlings it is incumbent
on us to see what utility could come from that right like that's honoring the
dead thanks for real the maker movement specifically has been remarkable the
number of different maker shops and makers that number of tens of thousands
of 3d printers around the world making PPE and helping to solve problems that
frontline workers and other people suffering for all sorts of different
reasons from the lockdown and it has been the makers moment and that's been
really really inspiring all the potential that was in all of these
amazing devices that truces of the glow forages of all of the different pieces
of equipment that are so amazing that have so radically changed the approach
to making over the past decade and a half
have really sort of met their moment at this point in time and I think that's a
great boon I think that's really important and good it's what's about to happen to the
economy is really scary and I say that like I like there's I don't know what's
gonna happen to the economy I have no idea that didn't of itself is freakin
terrifying so what economy what what what grows up
in the place of what we have lost because we've lost a lot and we're gonna
continue to lose a lot it's not lost on me that like you know the regular the
regular bootstraps crowd is like everyone should have six to eight months
of savings to whether a bad a bad occurrence and if you don't it's your
own fault that you got evicted from your apartment meanwhile the airline
industry's was like begging for dough two weeks after the lockdown started so
apparently that like that bootstraps you should have six to eight months the
savings doesn't apply to corporations that's ridiculous
there's an aspect to the lockdown that provides a really interesting societal
control to me by that I mean it allows us to look at things from a perspective
we would have never gotten under any other circumstance and it behooves us to
learn from that so as a point of comparison when they stopped all planes
from flying for two weeks after 9/11 weather scientists got this incredible
set of data from having no contrails in the air for a few weeks and they were
able to really see exactly the effect that airplanes and other modes of travel
were having and compared them because they were able to get a control against
their data sets this is that's for a scientist that's fantastic and the same
thing is happening here I hope that we never again have to have the debate
about working productively from home just as I hope we never have any more
debates about are you really reading when you're listening to a book go argue
that with a blind person yeah so I say that
by the reason I bring up the maker movement in relation to to control that
the the lockdown provides us societally culturally humanity wise is that the the
biggest promise to me of the maker movement over the past ten years the
thing that I've been most excited about is the idea that the the continual
lowering of the threshold to entry for making beautiful and interesting things
is a net good for society and the better this equipment gets the more we get
deeper and deeper individual views on what things should look like and when we
can print metal all of a sudden we're gonna have the most amazing kitchen
utensils ever when cheap metal printing becomes something you could purchase on
a desktop I know there's a few models out there but I'm like talking on a you
know with the when metal printing is as ubiquitous as current as cutting is in
plastic I like the idea of a world in which I could buy my next iPhone case
from a kid down the street and get their point of view and collaborate with them
on on on that product I might have talked about this on this broadcast a
few weeks ago but when I was in at the end of the Obama administration I was
doing a lot of work with Tom Kalil and Office of Science and Technology helping
promote making around the country and I visited a place called the Elizabeth
forward school where the teacher there had been given a bunch of 3d printers
and told start a 3d printing um class and she worked with the young women who
who went to that school and over the course of a year they figured out how to
use it 3d printers and then she took them across the street to a assisted
living facility where each student adopted took on and as charge of one of
the residents of the assisted living facility and then spent that year
iterating something to make to improve the life of that resident I saw a lot of
inspiring things when I was traveling around the country
visiting makerspaces I've been to the shop where Miele wolf builds their
things man the artisan's asylum there's been some incredible groups of
enthusiasm that I got to visit but there were a few things that I found more
moving than this incredible teacher inventing a whole cloth like one of them
greatest lesson plans I've ever heard in my life - to adopt the resident of
assisted living facility and iterate a product that improves their lives and
that to me the reason I find it so moving is that it is using the
technology to answer a specific a specific need in a specific moment which
is what the maker movement has been doing during a long time and I hope that
the economy that we build post this continues to accommodate that because I
think when we train a generation of digital natives to make things based on
their point of view the more people in a culture that are doing at the better and
more vibrant that culture is yeah that's that's how I feel about it um thank you
