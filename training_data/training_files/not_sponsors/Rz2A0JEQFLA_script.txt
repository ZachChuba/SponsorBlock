Society today is trying to stop men like me from being men. Well, I can't remain silent any longer. I'm here to reclaim true manhood. Here's how to be a real man. Step one: objectify women. Society tells you that you have to "respect women" and "treat them as equals." And that's all well and good. A true man takes care of his woman. But these people want to act like I'm a bad guy for acting on my most primal of urges. Hey girl. You're smoking-hot. KELLI: I wish you wouldn't do that. Do what? I'm just trying to pay you a compliment. Are you kidding me? I would've accepted a thank you. If I see a hottie, I'm gonna stare at that hottie. I'm gonna let that hottie know that I think she's a hottie. What am I supposed to do, suppress my manhood? You gotta be kidding me! No, I gotta wear it loud and proud. That girl is very attractive and she would be very lucky to have a sensitive guy like me taking care of her. Step two: glorify violence. If you're a man, you should love violence. Blood? Death? Carnage? You live for it! The idea of holding power over others is just ... (LAUGHS) well ... But you have to restrain yourself too. You're not an animal! But you could be if you had to be. Uh, excuse me? Did you just disrespect my girlfriend? I just got to this party, I swear! Oh, okay, okay. Because (LAUGHS) if you had, let's just say it wouldn't have been pretty for you. (GRUNTS) Step three: hide your emotions. If you show emotion, that's a way of admitting that you have emotions. And you should never do that because women want strong men who don't cry. Wow, there's nothing hotter than a man that I can't connect with emotionally. The only time it's okay to show emotion is during the Super Bowl and when you get something out of it. In which case, you're not showing weakness, you're showing strength through manipulation. Step four: laugh at dirty jokes even if they aren't funny. If someone makes a joke about flatulence, excrement, or bodily functions, as a man, (DISTORTED VOICE) you must laugh. It doesn't matter if it's the laziest joke you've ever heard. You're required to at least chuckle. Like if, right now, I used the word "poop," that's automatically funny. - ... a massive dump!
- (JORDAN AND JOSH LAUGHING) Come on guys, that's gross. Oh, come on! It's guy humor, okay? You don't understand. I understand the joke. It's just not funny. And finally, step five: force your insecurities on others. Okay, let's talk man-to-man for a second. I know there are some things you're insecure about. Do I have what it takes? Am I strong enough to take life's punches? Does my father love me? Now listen up: it is crucially important to make sure no one ever knows that you have insecurities. Just swallow that weakness and double down! Dude! How are things going with Lucy? Oh, Lucy? Psh. I dumped her, man. Oh. Well geez, what happened? Dude, don't even worry about it, okay? I'm a strong man! I'm pressing on! It's what I do! All right, so those are some of the very basic things you need to know to be a real man. Look, I can't explain everything in one YouTube video, okay? There's a lot to learn about being a real man. You may have questions along the way, but don't ask anyone for help. Just figure it out for yourself. You're a man, and that's what men do. BLOOP BLOOP BLOOP BLOOP BLOOP BLOOP BLOOPERS Did you disrespect my girlfriend? I saw you a hundred yards away. I—I don't even know who your girlfriend is. Oh, okay. Good. Good. Because if you had ... - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- I'm, like, I'm turning into Big Head Kid. - Hey, bro, did you just disrespect ...
- (JOSH LAUGHING) You were like, "Holy—" Hey, uh, excuse me? Did you disrespect— (BOTH LAUGHING) - Hey, uh excuse me? Did you ... (LAUGHING)
- Oh ... - Maybe you shouldn't hit me so hard.
- Oww ... Hey, uh, excuse me? Did you disrespect my girlfriend back there? I don't even know who your girlfriend is. Oh, okay. Okay, good. Because if you did, I would've turned into a horrible monster. - (LAUGHING)
- I would've ripped out your intestines. KELLI: Uh ... Uh, excuse me? Did you just disrespect my girlfriend? I don't even know who your girlfriend is. Oh, okay. Good, good. Because if you did ... Well ... (GRUNTS) - (LAUGHING)
- Sorry. I forgot my line, so I was, like, just trying to make it up. (GRUNTS)
