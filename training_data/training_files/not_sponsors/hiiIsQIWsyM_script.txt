sorry excuse us having car trouble wish I could tell you but I am in an our ace in this episode we are reviewing a 2009 happy r8 old it's a little it's 10 years long in the tooth 10 years old we're doing this because this is part of a serious about budget supercars the i8 yes this is definitely a budget supercar yeah right now on CarGurus I'd just checked with about 25 or 30 thousand miles like this has is going for about sixty five seventy thousand dollars land pricey for a nine ten-year-old car yeah well I'd for sure its original cost was what its original cost with the automatic like this as the s-tronic automatic was one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars it's a less than half the original price yes so in 10 years this is depreciated by a little over fifty percent okay so the quest for this episode is this a better budget supercar then I used 2014 BMW i8 and that is what the answer to that question is what we're hopefully going to figure out by at the end of this video [Music] three-two-one yeah that's a bit of a delay yeah that's just delay but there we are at sixty complaining there if it shifted faster that would have felt a lot quicker I think yeah I mean I was doing that manually yeah be fair I didn't have it in purely automatic I was shifting the paddles myself yeah but there still is that delay I mean yeah it's like when you hit the paddles it takes a second it feels like it's like a full second for the shift actually happened which is slow like that is really not good yeah it takes a lot of the fun out of it because it's like you're not it's not really new it doesn't feel super precise [Music] I really like how this car looks I do - it's very refined and classy look yeah I think it's not like too flashy like a Lamborghini or a Ferrari but you still know that it's cool yes like a todos yeah there's a reason they put Tony Stark and riots what Iron Man I forget its techy especially the newer ones are very techy and like you can't really tell the difference most people like 90% of people are not going to be able to tell the difference between this a 2009 and a 2019 no and they'll certainly not be able to tell you this is a ten-year-old model right yeah if you were to show this to somebody they will not say this is 10 years then $65,000 now they would think that its new in like over a hundred yeah for sure jinx you know yeah anyway 4.1 4.3 it's a 4.4.2 liter v8 they were just yeah it's so gorgeous and pretty back there I love the the back side with the headlights are not the headlights rear end it's the rear at the taillights I just looks mean and aggressive and from the front that really looks mean to also kind of understated which is so nice I do like the - it's got like a I don't want to say that's leather I don't know what that is it's like a cushioning material yeah it's a little interesting this does feel dated yeah on the inside and I feel like that's an interesting thing to bring up be us on the exterior it doesn't feel dated yeah it looks modern yeah but on the interior it's definitely data there's sloughs there's this there's this case of point yeah primarily a CD CD player this screen is data s it's real primitive and are you obviously like it's ten years old like it's not like a knock against it no it just looks like it looks like computer BIOS or something it's just yeah kind of old the - though is brilliant yeah I really really love the - the - feels modern looks clean feels you know it's simple its elegant you got chrome-lined gauges it shows you what you need and nothing else I really like that yes it's not the most practical of interiors it's a tiny tiny tiny little uh box you do have cup holders in this yeah it is so nice and tightly they have a triple cup holder I don't know what on earth could fit in this tiny middle cup holder but it's there it's there I think this I wonder if that's for like if you took an actual coffee cup and that's for the handle that's dumb who would take like a coffee cup in this thing would spill all over the place yep this thing is violent they're small you have a bench back here no seats obviously the better it back there I don't know we can give it a shot we can throw you back there see how comfortable you get there you know we already tried with a fro tried with the Franck and it didn't go so well steering feel is very heavy yeah I do think it I mean this fits into the handling this is all-wheel drive yeah so it grips the road very precisely does yeah when you're going around corners it feel so firmly planted onto the ground it's great I love that they've known at this round of LLC oh look gonna get gonna get prevented they're still out it's too nice of a day it's a beautiful day this is a single clutch transmission also dual clutch automatic for really a thing certainly not a common thing ten years ago so even with the paddle shifters when you when you shift it's going to take a second to change gears yes I noticed that when when he hit the paddle it takes like one second it feels like it takes about a second when he hit the paddles to shift yeah but the i8 was kind of the same way and that was more recent yeah it's it's slow I would rather in what was interesting about this model so now they don't create ah rates with a manual transmission any longer you can only get the automatic S tronic transmission right now when this was in 2008-2009 you could get a manual transmission yeah and the manual transmissions cost ten thousand dollars less than the automatics so they were 115 of that yeah they were $115,000 compared to the $125,000 price of these yeah that's crazy to me that anyone would buy an automatic that performs just as poorly if not worse than your average person shifting gears manually yeah this it's it's very curious for ten grand less yeah I'd take this I yeah for sure it's kind of like makes me question if this was a supercar does it look like a supercar yes does it perform like a modern-day supercar no no it doesn't match up with the supercars of today and again that's to be expected it's ten years old of course it's not going to be able to compete with current-gen supercars yeah I mean that's that's the thing when you're doing it an episode like this where you're dealing with a car that's very old at this point ten years old ten years old is very old it is very old for a club yeah it's not gonna stack up to its peers it's not gonna stack up to like the next run down usually yeah so but again for that budget for $65,000 I don't know man this is pretty cool I will say when I get out of this car and look at it and like yeah it's worth it and then when I'm driving it around I'm like hey then the doubt starts to creep in yeah I'd agree with that completely I know for that price a Camaro zl1 is about that price and the deal one that's like 600 horsepower and a manual transmission and a zero to sixty of three-and-a-half seconds and a convertible yeah like that's a lot that's a lot of boxes checked there yeah but it looks like a Camaro and it doesn't look like a cool r8 on the outside ten years we've had a quite a horsepower war that's happened you've got Camaro or we've got forward and Chevy just trading blows over who can one-up the other we're up to like 700 horsepower and the newest models the newest Mustang yeah the gt500 which the gt500 is probably from what I've read gonna be priced around 70 or 80 which is like this again this is like 65 or $70,000 so if it were that like if I were forced to choose between the 2020 gt500 and this I yeah there's no competition I would take the gt500 I haven't even driven it yeah I would I would play for 8,500 they have to wait a year to get it before I would buy this yeah that is not to rag on this car this is a cool car it just doesn't stack up to a 2020 model year bright high powered skaara gets 12 miles a gallon in the city mmm gets 19 miles a gallon on the highway for a combined MPG of 15 miles per gallon on average that's rough that's real rough you'd expect that though yeah this is a supercar it's thirsty it's a thirsty full-hd boy yeah takes premium gas too and premium gas so you know this is kind of punchy in the wallet yeah even if you you buy this at the depreciated value it's an expensive car to maintain and that being said it's an expensive car to maintain but not compared to rivals yeah the whole point of the r8 ever since it was first created and it's still the point today is it's like a daily drivable super car this is a supercar that is somewhat practical that is daily drivable that's comfortable or fine it's refined you don't have to deal with a lot of like BS it's in like Lamborghinis or Ferraris that are more expensive to maintain that have like outrageous maintenance prices this is more reasonable and affordable and as comfortable it's not a brute like you can drive this thing around we're driving and we're not getting bounced into oblivion with these palms yeah it's tough it is comfy to drive it's the suspension doesn't feel like super tight it doesn't feel like you're on a track and it's getting like thrown around just when you're driving on the streets now I'm hesitant to say this cars not that great I wouldn't say it's not that great it's great this is a great car yeah 100 card still for the price of like 65 or 70 grand and here's the thing that's funny brand new Audi r8 they have different models they have a rear-wheel drive model that cost 135 thousand today they have an all-wheel drive model that starts at 165 so then they have the r8 + all-wheel drive which is about 200 for $135,000 the new one I think is a steal yeah I think that is such a bargain would you say that's a better deal yes and they already know what you're gonna say yes I think for a brand new with a 135 that's a better deal than this at 65 to be fair I think this is the best budget supercar we've driven so far on a budget yes but that's the thing is this really a supercar yeah because if you say this is a supercar and then you say okay well the Camaro zl1 and the Mustang gt500 are better than the stable form better they have more horsepower and they're about the same amount of money are those supercars and the common I don't know most people would say no their sports cars their muscle cars but like that's not fair yeah not really yeah this was a supercar for the time and it came out in 2009 but is it a supercar still like basically the philosophy I'm trying to get across here is does a supercar get to a point where it's not a supercar I lower his status that's an interesting idea yeah like if you got PC you built like top-of-the-line PC in 2013 yeah and then you went for at five years six years to now done their power yeah it's underpowered is it still a super powerful PC of course you'd say it's not yeah so why do we say with supercars that this is still a supercar I would say it's a veteran supercar it's a supercar goes over the hill it's yeah so in today's market it is a supercar now it was yeah so I will say this is not a supercar yeah alright so with everything we've just said we're gonna get into the ratings now I've already got a foot forward he'll clip everything we're gonna do so to begin we're gonna start with performance how do you feel six I'm gonna rate it a little higher just because zero to sixty of 4.4 seconds is still fast and I think the handling is good but it suffers from the clutch and the transmission transmissions track yeah the trans I think that takes forever to shift on the paddles I'm gonna go slightly higher on a 6.5 that sounds fair and now we're gonna go with the seven oh yeah that's pretty high I will do seven because I rated the Miata a six oh and this is better than the Miata practicality for four yeah cuz it's got three cupholders technically you don't know what that is yeah you do have cup holders you have tiny amounts of storage space but you do have decent amount in the front yeah I'm gonna go up to 3.5 another thing I'm giving it a little extra for is because of your visibility it's amazing that's good for a supercar for a supercar but it's still a supercar and it takes screaming I mean it gets horrible fuel economy yeah so I'm going with a 3.5 yeah that's I don't think it's super practical still that is fair next up comes value which is slightly iffy yeah I'm gonna give it a four and a half four and a half yeah JT you know I think I'm gonna stick with that exact same actually I think a four and a half is pretty warranted it's nice it's cool that let you get the looks and everything for sixty five thousand dollars with this used still a used car with like 30,000 miles on it though for 65 grand and it's like ten years old I don't know cool factor which is high that's what's next solid I think it's pretty good this gets a lot of attention people do think it's really cool I think it's really cool looking at it I totally agree I'm gonna go with the 7d I was gonna go throw me yeah all right so sevens for both of us on cool factor qualities next which this is dated it's old but nothing is broken but nothing's broken that's true it's always hard rating like older cars on their quality yeah this is miles better than the 25 year old Dodge Viper yes definitely way better probably on par with the i8 I probably go with a 5 it's right in the middle it's even I feel like it's fair because certainly even like new cars that cost like 30 or 40 thousand dollars have more advanced features inside of course but this does feel luxurious with the Alcantara and little that leather seats give it a 5 and a half just because I am I am genuinely amazed that nothing is broken on this thing yeah it is impressive next up is fun factor that's our final box here that we need to figure out which is reasonably high you know I'd probably compare it again like we've been a lot to Mustangs but it does have all wheel drive and it does feel much more planted and the handling is better than a Mustang and it's as fast as the Mustang and it looks cooler than a Mustang it sounds better than a must it does sound great don't cross the road there person that's a bad idea anyway all that said fun factor I'm gonna go with the 7 I'm gonna go over me high I think it deserves that 7 I'm gonna go with the 6 6 yeah a little harsh there it is a little harsh but like the problem with this is if I'm gonna pay 65 grand for a ten-year-old car I want it to be a little bit more fun like it's fun but I had just as much fun in the Miata probably more and that's half the price and brand-new way less than well actually yeah but the art of the art it's about half the price yeah this so for me that's that's a challenge to reading it super highly because price is always gonna be a factor for how much fun you're having for me for me fun is more about like fun yeah with like fat like speed and performance it's also about how it looks in the theater yeah and the noise and all that factors into it for me that's so that's why I went with a 7 yeah 33.5 I'm sorry ever score out of 60 right yeah 33 502 16 how that compares to other cars we have reviewed so far interestingly we rated this 0.5 points higher than the 2017 Mazda Miata RF just a smidge just a smidge now we rated this barely higher than the Miata I think that's fascinating that is fascinating us on the one hand we got us half the price on the other hand this is a ten-year-old car that just beat the modern car but then the Mustang was we rated the Mustang 0.5 higher than this and I think the reason why we did that was because of its better practicality and its back seats yeah and what we were comparing this most to the BMW i8 we rated the BMW i8 a 39.5 so 6 entire points 6 whole points higher than this and I think that's right yeah and I think that earns it because I would definitely take an i8 over this yeah hundred percent anyway that's all we've got for this episode I hope you guys enjoyed it this was this car was pretty fun I think this is the first time I was about right with how I felt about the car coming into it and how I feel now at the end would you say about the same yeah I'd say totally the same I feel pretty much exactly how we did when we started cool so that's it for the r8 10 years old still stands up pretty well not the best budget supercar howdy if you're watching you boys up with more modern or its we'd love to compare them directly to this and see how they stack up this is your first time watching thank you we hope you stick around and out of my way we hope you stick her out and watch the next episode and until then we'll see you guys next time peace guys I'm not so good I like the ending the link below we promised you'll love it
