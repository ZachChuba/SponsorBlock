hello everyone and welcome to internet comment etiquette i'm eric your host this is the only show where we learn how to leave proper and respectful comments online now today i want to talk about a recent internet phenomenon called the mandela effect well what is the mandel effect i barely know let's head over to mandelafect.com to learn more the mandela effect is what happens when someone has a clear memory of something that never happened in this reality right off the bat i want to point out the redundant usage of the word happen in that sentence see if it were up to me i would lose that first what happened so it just reads as the mandela effect is when someone has a clear memory of something that never happened in this reality see so much better but grammar aside allow me to give you an example of the mandela effect in action do you guys remember that old 90s movie with simbad in it where he plays a genie shazam right and he's on the poster like this with his arms crossed like hey doing his sinbad grin well guess what that movie never [ __ ] existed that's right fake movie even sinbad himself had to get on twitter to confirm that he was never in a genie movie in the 90s let alone one called shazam so for hundreds perhaps even thousands of people this was a memory of something that happened that actually never happened [ __ ] i did it this time god damn it just got done just ah so what is the scientific and psychological explanation for the mandela effect well heading back to mandelafect.com we can see the leading theory for this is that ah parallel realities exist and we've been sliding between them without realizing it yeah okay well i thought maybe there'd be something in there about how we create false memories but uh it looks like alternate universes are the likeliest culprit in the mystery behind sinbad's missing shazam movie it's got nothing to do with the fact that people might just be misremembering the shaq movie khazam where he played a genie and was on the poster doing this nah nah universes all right i gotta tweet for sinbad explain this [ __ ] sinbad and attach image yeah that's a good image universes and shazam now the name mandela effect comes from the fact that there's people out there who remember nelson mandela dying while in prison nelson mandela of course is famous for getting out of prison and then becoming the first black president of south africa and also for his work and putting an end to apartheid but hey never mind all that let's take a look at a youtube video where a guy's trying to prove that he actually just died in prison proof that nelson mandela died in 1991. explain this by planet nibiru i could swear i've had this channel on the show before but that could just be the mandela effect anyway give me that man some people who experience mandela effect remember nelson mandela dying many many years ago um well before the funeral in 2013. but to that end there was a book written uh back in in 1991 i believe show me more of this book and the book is called english alive and that book um specifically states that uh nelson mandela did die in 1991. why is it in a book and this is a non-fiction book a book on english it is an educational book for south africa stupid universe has left a book behind why would someone write that in an english book hey that's crazy let's look at some comments whoa holy [ __ ] i remember him dying in jail i do too wow not a lot of people do i remember my family talking about it so when the news came out that he died again i was confused anyone else remember louis anderson hanging himself back when he was the host of the family feud and now his on a tv show he can't fool me he's been dead and all the other things that have changed i remember ain't no planet x coming cause ain't no space cause ain't not globe earth mandela effect is real the globe earth and meteors in outer space is [ __ ] i remember hitler winning the war oh wait that was just a dream ah there's always one there's always one as someone who produces videos and someone who has done technical writing in the it community um you know you have to do your research the book you reference is a collection of literature pieces from high school students the authors are editors the story is a historical fiction story about what would have happened if mandela had died in the how peace did not come about because they lost the leader oh that's where the that's where the books from okay that explains the book then yo great video but it sounds like you might be from an alternate reality where nobody went to high school anyway listen i'm mandela effecting all day up in this [ __ ] like i'm constantly hearing about people dying and being like [ __ ] i thought they're already dead they were old as [ __ ] but that's just mandela hitting me with his multi-dimensional moon beams that evil african time warlock has been [ __ ] up my memory all my life nobody believes me either when i say i'm not the one who's wrong i've got a great memory it's just mandela keeps [ __ ] changing up the universes on me and for the love of god does anyone else remember shakira butt chugging a beer on stage during a concert in germany oh look out ufo invasion and bam and post shazam his ass who's next mandela effect red hot chili peppers under the bridge lyrics and mandela the city i live in city of angels as i always remember it is now it now says angel was it never a plural form or am i just having bad memory yep that's it it's having a bad memory the lyrics right there clearly states uh you know the city of angels well it's too bad we can't ask anthony kiedis ourselves because uh he died back in 2000 and uh nope up he's still alive huh that's weird i could swear whatever it's send him a tweet yo welcome back bro i'm from the parallel reality where a stingray got you and under the bridge said angels not angel and shazam hey you guys remember in snow white how the evil queen says uh mirror mirror on the wall right right wrong it's this magic mirror on the wall who is the fairest one of all i know crazy right so then how do you explain this scene from shrek mira mira on the wall is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all weird huh and i think most damning of all try explaining this song by hip-hop artist zero i [ __ ] knew it was mirror mirror thanks zero hashtag mandela died in prison and shazam now evidence like that seen in shrek and the hip-hop song by artist zero is what people refer to as residue in the mandela effect community in that certain references to what they remember still exist in physical form left behind in the collision between alternate realities now for more examples of residue let's go check out the thriving reddit community r mandela effect ah look at it nelson mandela's greatest legacy well here's someone who believes our colliding reality slightly changed the lyrics to we are the champions by queen okay saying that the ending no longer contains the phrase of the world well i guess this instance where they actually do say of the world at the end is uh just residue and not proof that you're just remembering [ __ ] wrong anyway i'm gonna jump in here as my favorite new reddit account curious betsy and let's see if we can merge some realities together hey y'all ever hear nipple modifications am i in the wrong universe post pictures of yourselves in the replies everybody i want to see your faces and mandala what's that oh we got another example of mandela residue on the loose mandela effect residue mandela effect proof number one and mandela the mandela effect residue that we want to focus on today is for the thinker many people think that his pulse has changed people remember him having his fist under his chin or on his forehead now it is more of an open hand with his knuckles pressed firmly against his mouth oh this first residue image we have a woman posing with the thinker which raises the question did the statue have a different pose while she was taking this photo and now the statue has changed in this reality did it change in the photo and leave her untouched oh that's a mandela is this some kind of evidence that something might be really going on what do you guys think about this oh mandela hey guys i hope you guys enjoyed the video and we would really appreciate some feedback yeah i got some feedback wow pretty ironic that the thinker has a mandela effect right considering the mandela effect is you know dumb i'd probably be less harsh and more tongue-in-cheek about this if the president wasn't out there making up fake terrorist attacks which seems like the perfect gin to your ability to believe any stupid [ __ ] that comes your way gang all the while presenting a larger problem with how gullible we are as consumers of media and how scientific facts have become boring and stupid in the face of wild theories and exciting what-ifs i'd blame the kardashians but in my reality they're all dead because oj got him you can call me a non-believer all you want but maybe i'm just from the alternate universe where the mandela effect doesn't exist worse listening is the new reading sorry universes and shamsam oh and in the case of the snow white mirror mirror residue here well that's actually easily easily explained because uh the original brothers grim version of the story had mirror mirror and then when disney made their version they called it magic mirror so just like everything else associated with the mandela effect it simply goes to prove the frailty of the human mind all right well normally in one of these lessons i'd only you know feature three or four examples of the topic at hand but in this case there's just so many [ __ ] videos and posts from people who are blaming their shitty memory on what equates to a bad doctor who plot that i just can't help myself we're gonna need some sort of comment montage let's kick it oscar mandela effect oscar meyer you are now oscar mayer what in the hell stop my boy's dog to this on his dick for hours and post and post mandela effect captain crunch i remember captain crunch i distinctly remember never eating this cereal because it tasted like [ __ ] btw i'm from an alternate reality where blow jobs make me angry and people can't poop unless they're holding hands with their sister so stop judging me and shut down huge shocking mandela effect it's not tostinos anymore it's totinos hey i got a crazy theory too and then i believe you're thinking of tostitos the popular corn tortilla chip here's my source it's always been to tito's and m night shazamalam the simpsons ultimate collaboration and strange things i am your father i might look like a young old jeff bridges but i'll still kick anyone's ass who doesn't believe in the fact that multiple alternate realities of collided changing my new details about junk food and song lyrics from my hard to remember formative years and shakira proof mandela effect is actually a certain quantum effect they're ripping apart the fabric of time and space i [ __ ] popped to know when this dude started talking about fabric and shazbot mandela effect raccoon ran oh what's he doing here r-a-c-c-o-o-n oh my god he's blaming the mandela effect i'm not knowing how to spell raccoons whatever it was never rack holy [ __ ] oh those things are sneaky too hey you know what else is sneaky early onset alzheimer's and shamwow wow even youtube celebrities are talking about the mandela effect like this guy onion's son who apparently films all of his videos inside a futuristic spaceship dell effects the end concord goodbye our brains are just silly this guy's [ __ ] cia and shia labeouf mandela effect check your rocks i hope my meteorites aren't gone fifty shades darker hd full movie shady link and show spam and back to reddit background or background sorry the word background never existed why why the [ __ ] even post that dude get in there curious betsy everybody post pictures of your house and shook keel o'neal in kazam next up is memory conformity wait what the hell is this memory conformity also known as social contagion of memory refers to a situation in which one person's report of a memory influences another person's report of that same experience this interference often occurs when individuals discuss what they saw or experience that can result in the memories of those involved being influenced by the report of another person research on memory conformity has revealed that such suggestibility has far-reaching consequences with important legal and social implications it is one of many social influences on memory oh let me just edit that real quick sometimes it is the mandela effect though and add citation send it to salviaeric.com insert and post briefly describe your changes huh made it better and yes those were simply minor changes and infatuate oh look i'm a wikipedia editor now okay well i think i think all we learned here today is that the internet uh can ruin your mind although i could swear we all learned that back in the 90s it could be that pesky mandela effect at it again yeah anyway at ted cruz yo you like my new nipple mods an attached picture oh yeah now that's a good picture boom you know what else is a good picture this official shazam movie t-shirt that we got our hands on
