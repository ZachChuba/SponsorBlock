greetings mortally boys and [ __ ] girls my name is edgy chappie and today we're going to be peering into the darkest coldest edgiest racial culture of this side of the Underdark the lives of the drow this video will be branching off from the elf guide to explain what happened to those elves that took the plunge underground and it will go over the vastly different society that drow have has compared to the surface elves keep in mind however that some fools may try to discredit me with facts and evidence supported opinions and other such ill supported nonsense these people are just posers and should be ignored whenever possible for I am truly the only true leading source of D&D no atala tude but before we get into the video proper allow me to take a moment to give a brief shout out to my newest patrons of Davies Da'Ville Isha's five-dollar patron Richard people who would otherwise be forced to use Google but with that out of the way let's begin yeah so if you see my ELF guide then you understand the events leading up to loft taking her followers into the Underdark but what you don't know is what ended up happening after that much like how coral on created his own pantheon of gods known as the sell Doreen loft to her own favorite followers and created her own dark cell during to rule her lesser subjects and shaped them into the perfect warriors and killing machines these killing machines built huge beautiful cities within the caverns of the Underdark to live in which are only made less beautiful by the dagger that'll be in your eye by the time that you'll get anywhere near enough one of the cities to look at it in fact drow society revolves an awful lot around murder while drow are born in a specific drow household and so share loyalties with other members of their own household this relationship is tenuous at best and the drow have no attachments that can't be easily severed with a short sword and even then murdering members of a drowse own household is very commonplace and generally seen as a normal pastime the more people you murder the higher up on the totem pole you'll go up until you become the matriarch of the family and rule with an iron fist until a more powerful drought comes along and then severs you from your iron fist droughts have become so detached from their original elven roots that even their trance has suffered as a result instead of seeing past lives their present life or even the lives of any other elf a drow elf can see only darkness during their trends and this darkness serves as a quiet respite from the otherwise exceedingly deadly day-to-day trials of their regular lives if they ever do dream the dreams are relatively normal I'll be it with much more elf murder in them or whatever it is drow like to dream about and the drow will constantly search their dreams for clues that loath may have sent them a hidden message on who among their family members to stab next in fact a lot of at rouse life is spent reviewing wealth and looking for their spider mom signs about who to stab next due to Lofts teachings drow believed themselves to be greater than all other species especially the surface elves and their adoration of their spidery godmother leads them to search for signs of lost favor and everything that they do did the blood from that gaya stabbed pool into the form of a spider dope did a rock fall and kill your best friend well he must have either been holding you back or he was gonna kill you first thanks lofted the slave you just captured have a spider crawl on it better make that one boy toy and speaking of boy toys it's worth noting that the drow are very cast system II with males in their society pushed down pretty low on the totem pole they're treated like second-class citizens although it is possible for a male in the society to raise their social standing either by being a vicious warrior or by using some extreme boney to get whatever they want however it should be noted that no matter how good they are at extreme boney they'll never reach the success that drow females attained in their lives there's also the chance that loft herself will test the might medal of any lucky drow order hour that she sees fit and she will pull that drow spirit down into her demon web to compete in loathes favorite reality television show where contestants have to complete one of an infinite amount of lofts puzzles and challenges for the honour of not really all that much except for bragging rights honestly though that's not a bad thing since winning one of losses judgments elevates you into a higher social status among Society and even if you lie about going to the demon web and successfully completing one of Wealth's tests as long as you managed to convince everyone that you're telling the truth Ulf still looks at you favorably since lies and deceit are just following her proper teachings but for the people who are taken into the demon web and fail you can lie all you want but it's not gonna work out for you very well on account of the fact that failures are cursed with a mutated spider body indeed failure in the demon web results in you being cursed to become a rider which much like how the centaur is a half-human half-horse ad rider has all the Tippie bits of a normal drought but they also have a spooky scary spider body from the waist down you'd think that with lost admiration of spiders it would be a blessing to be the physical embodiment of arachnophobia but no if you are cursed to be a spider then from then on your life sucks the absolute worst because now drought society perceives you as being so weak and ineffectual that law herself had to make you more powerful just so that you would be able to survive and as we know getting help from other people as a drow is the greatest insult one can give dried errs are immediately cast out from their city and forced to live in exile where everything is dark and you are likely to be eaten by a group in fact the only reason why drivers aren't murdered immediately by the drow is because their punishment is specifically to live in exile as a malformed abomination and to kill the driver would cut short lofts punishment and possibly cause the drought who killed them to be punished with spider legs themselves luckily for those adventurers who find their way into the Underdark drivers are naturally inclined to dislike those dickbag drought who cast them out and any dried er that survives for a period of time in the catacombs of the Underdark will get used to where to go and more importantly where to avoid this could prove invaluable to would-be spelunkers who require a guide to keep them away from the more dangerous parts of the dark but heed my warning when listening to ad rider because no matter how cursed spurned and hateful ad rider has become inside that is still a drought and it will teach you that lesson the way all droughts teach lessons if you are careful it might even lead you home in a misguided attempt to regain some status with its house turning you over as a slave in the process of course this could never work but being enslaved by the drow is always a very real concern see drow are very big on the idea of what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine and you are mine so the point where slavery makes up the backbone of their productive workforce humans dwarves and especially other elves are captured in raids against the surface world and taken back into drow societies to serve in forced labour camps where they will almost certainly spend the rest of their days until their malnourished bodies atrophy to the point where they can no longer work at which point they're killed and replaced with new slaves that will eventually wither away themselves this endless rotation of slaves requires drow too instead of doing you know the reasonable thing like maybe stop murdering all of your slaves it forces them to go and commit raid after raid upon the surface world to capture more and more people to serve in their metaphorical slave machine and those slaves can forget about praying to whichever God they believe in because the only pantheon that will hear them is the dark cell terrine made up of lofts original favored followers who ascended to godhood to assist her in ruling her masses drow have a very particular set of gods in their Pantheon such as Gondar the witch that lurks an oozy Muenster that is equally likely to reward its followers with a true treasure trove as it is to reward them by devouring them in a gelatinous cube then there's kept Olaf's favorite consort in the quintessential male drow job that is equal parts pecks smoldering swordsmanship is key our Anna Solley the spirit of vengeance that most drow go to only when seeking way to dick over their fellow dick back drow there's Malik the God of rebellion and chaos that is not allowed near the good furniture Selva tarm the warrior God with eight arms each ready to smack that ass they rune the other male drow God that acts as a foil to kept Tolo by representing superiority arrogance and all other things that make drow edgy and is therefore considered lofts favors son and lastly there's in Zarina the goddess of assassination stealth lies misdirection and mind decree making her a fan favorite among drow although technically there's also illud tread a lid tree although technically there is also a lid tree but you'd be hard-pressed to find a job that worships her outside of the surface world because she represents the edgiest thing ever to a drow a good drow she calls to the drow when they are on the surface world and the moon is out and she tries to convince them that hey maybe shank murdering things isn't cool which inadvertently has turned a little tree into a hippie child that just wants peace and love man of course any drow who do decide to go rogue and make a new life on the surface will have to deal with constant suspicion and rampant racism from anybody who knows what the drow are and that drow will always be looking over its shoulder for the day that it's people come looking for it ready to make another sacrifice but that'll about do it I hope you enjoyed this video leave a like and comment if you did subscribe if you want to be a cool dude and maybe support me on patreon so that I can slowly make my entire life
