Squarespace and you squarespace.com slash cow to get 10% off why are some bad words considered more bad than other bad words like have you ever seen a video on YouTube where the youtuber is cursing and swearing freely but then at some point they use the f-word and then they bleep out that one word why are you scripting swear words into your videos if you're just gonna censor yourself hey guys I just wanted to make a video specifically to tell the world that you cannot censor me I will not be being censored by this world I will say whatever the I want and if you're gonna bleep out one bad word why not bleep out all the bad words I mean why are some words considered worse than other ones like who sitting there watching a foul-mouthed youtuber thinking man I'm so glad to that video only bleeped out the f-word that's the only one I'm offended by know if you're offended by the f-word you probably gonna be offended by the other bad words too I mean maybe I'm wrong maybe there are some people out there who are only offended by that one word why I'm the f-word okay I'm cool with everybody else here at this party except for you all right well if you get mad you need me I'll be over here okay I mean apparently this isn't the case though because there are a bunch of words that they censor on TV oh we don't censor here at the FCC this is a free country we live in we just subject you to mandatory fines uh-huh so apparently at least according to the government there are acceptable words and there are unacceptable words like at some point was there a list created to let people know which words are the bad news all right all right everybody I've been working on this for all of America for months now here's the list it has every bad word on it and it ranks how effective each one is for your convenience the PDF is available online I also have a clean version available that replaces them with the letters of each word with AD strings so that you don't actually have to read the offensive words so I guess I just really don't get it but I also don't really get people who think they are so bad because they swear all the time oh so these are the words that our culture has deemed offensive well guess what I'm gonna start using them all the time to prove that I don't live by society's standards except you kind of still are it's like you're constantly validating them and also proving that you have a very limited vocabulary I mean me truly subversive people are the ones who just make up their own bad words like global let's just say that from now on fool is a bad word where are they I'm starving oh I just got a text they're gonna be 15 minutes late Oh flip oh I'm so flippin hungry hey hey hey I know what you really mean when you use these replacement words you think you're being so clever what is using an emphasizing word inherently wrong I mean pick the word darn no one gets mad if you say the word jarred but what if suddenly one day people decided that the word darn was the worst thing you could possibly say I can't believe that movie said the D word twice it's rated pg-13 see you can say the D word twice in this rated pg-13 but any more than that and it's R oh my gosh I thought you could listen to D word what not pg-13 times who decided all these arbitrary rules we do it for the kids to protect them from a cruel world of profanity on television and in the movies okay well anyone who's played Call of Duty online knows that ship has sailed if there was a war on profanity bad word guys won so maybe we should just start thinking about this differently like at a fundamental level what makes one word worse than another one well words are just a way for us to communicate with others so with the word you used to communicate does harm to the person you're speaking to that's bad so to me a bad word isn't some stupid list that the FCC will find you for saying on TV it's when you say something hurtful to someone like I'm Way more offended if I see someone tearing someone else down with their words than I am if I hear someone say a bad word it'd be kind of like if one day we decided it was socially unacceptable to carry rocks I mean I don't care if you carry a rock just don't hit someone upside the head with it hey have you been thinking about your first purchase that's squarespace.com slash cow I'm so flippin hungry
