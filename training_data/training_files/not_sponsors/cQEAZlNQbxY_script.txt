[Music] what's up wisecrack michael here and today we're talking about cinema's other coin flipping nihilist while most agree that no country for old men is brilliantly made somewhere frustrated to see a high-octane western end with an unsatisfying monologue about dreams and not with a hotly anticipated showdown how'd you sleep i don't know had dreams well you got time for them now anything interesting there always is to the party concerned so what gives what on earth does this conclusion mean and why did the film end not with a bang but with a whimper let's find out in this wisecrack edition on the philosophy of no country for old men and as always spoilers ahead all right guys let's do a quick recap adapted from author cormic mccarthy's settlers struggle to tame a chaotic wilderness similarly classic westerns often deal with justice as settlers attempt to erect societies and administer law and order these movies rely on neat binary archetypes and symbols film scholar will wright lists some of these simple oppositions in his book six guns in society a character is inside or outside of society strong or weak good or bad these clear divisions imply an absolute morality that the lawmen must justly enforce enter sheriff ed tom bell who wears an actual white hat a classic indicator of virtue and comes from a long line of sheriffs grandfather was a law man father too throughout the story bell believes that as an agent of the law he is bound by a strict moral code what is it says about truth and justice oh we dedicate ourselves daily anew something like that i'm going to commence dedicating myself twice daily it might come to three times before it's over with belle is an almost flat representation of the justice seeking good sheriff in contrast anton chagura seems to represent the classic western bad guy he's dressed in black when we first meet him he's in handcuffs immediately indicating his lawlessness oh and if you weren't sure he does this later we see sugar shoot a bird for no reason another hallmark of the western villain often called a kick the dog moment famous examples of this include the searchers [Music] and hondo all of which feature bad guys killing or abusing a dog letting us know that they are the worst this trope is also spoofed in blazing saddles and even in the coen brothers own raising arizona so at first glance it seems like no country could be a classic western but the cohens quickly complicate things part two revisionist westerns sheriff bell's opening monologue hints that times have changed and so is crime you can't help but compare yourself against the old-timers i couldn't help but wonder how they'd operated these times later he and wendell find the burning car trigger left behind and when bell theorizes that trigger changed vehicles they have this exchange that's very linear sheriff agent flatten the man wendell here bell acknowledges that this old dog can't keep up with the new tricks of the modern west in other words belle a relic from classic western's past can't comprehend this new reality which seems to be more akin to the next phase of western films revisionist westerns starting in the 1950s and 60s westerns began to shift away from focusing on lawmen to focusing on outsiders and anti-heroes these movies sometimes called revisionist westerns depict a morally gray or morally relativistic world in which people have to adapt to survive in his book the six gun mystique sequel historian john g kalady explains that revisionist westerns often display critical and ironic attitudes towards some of the most traditional myths associated with the western such as that of the heroic gunfighter in other words revisionist westerns are modern stories in a classic western setting that grapple with america's disillusionment and soul searching so in no country for old men belle is juxtaposed with llewellyn moss the actual hero or rather the revisionist western anti-hero of the story who does dubious things like steal briefcases full of money but then returns to the crime scene to bring a dying guy some water rather than a white hat-wearing paragon of justice moss is an opportunist attempting to navigate a morally ambiguous world another kick the dog moment further distinguishes our two heroes early on moss is forced to shoot an aggressive dog minutes later when belle and wendell arrive at the scene of the drug deal they're horrified that the bad guys also killed a dog oh hell's bell they even shot the dog one that looks nearly identical to the one moss shot here bell's clear-cut ideology is complicated by the morally ambiguous situation moss encountered another important aspect of revisionist westerns has to do with the nature of justice in these movies justice often takes the form of karma or a you reap what you sow kind of cyclical retribution rather than coming from the law thus people who live by violence often die by violence we see this version of justice when moss on the verge of death crosses into mexico and is extorted for money look you gotta give me this money i got no other reason to protect you the scene creates a kind of cyclical moral logic moss is reaping what he has sown when he wakes up in mexico the song a mariachi group sings translates to you wanted to fly without wings you wanted to touch the sky you wanted too much wealth you wanted to play with fire in the revisionist western tradition no country seems to suggest that justice might come from outside the law but it does still exist and is understandable but there are still elements that complicate this understanding and perhaps suggest that there is no justice to be had part 3 chaos reigns let's get back to sugar at first he seems to be a flat traditional villain but he's actually much more complex take this pivotal gas station scene a traditional baddie would just murder the station owner but instead choker leaves the man's fate up to chance is something wrong with the world with anything is that what you're asking me is there something wrong with anything here he mocks the very notion of right or wrong in other words sugar is not in fact a strictly evil force but rather an agent of chaos similarly although we see triger shoot the bird in a classic kick the dog moment then next time he encounters an animal the cat in the hotel he leaves it alive chigurh's actions again seem random and don't follow any apparent rules except the rule of unmitigated chaos sugar explains this to carla jean moss at the end of the film when he insists that she call a coin toss to decide her fate carlo jean attempts to reason with sugar but he rejects her logic call it the coin don't have no say it's just you i got here the same way the coin it in jakur's mind there is no order only chance another way to cohen so chaos is by introducing interlopers characters who functionally introduce unpredictability or chance author h.h monroe aka saki popularized this idea with his 1911 short story the interlopers in the tale two men face off in the forest to settle a family feud but after getting pinned under a fallen log the men instead make peace only to both get eaten by wolves the eponymous interlopers at the end in no country for old men there are many interlopers who randomly and unexpectedly interfere with the plot we meet our first interloper right at the outset mosh shoots a deer but a black dog comes out of nowhere and steals the wounded animal for himself in fact the dying man moss encounters warns him that more interlopers lurk nearby i lobos there are wolves moss insist no lobos but when he goes back to bring the dying man some water he does indeed encounter wolves in the form of the mexican drug cartel who function throughout the story as unpredictable interlopers clearly in the cohen's west chaos reigns but the film's strongest rejection of all western tropes really coalesces in the third act as things get even weirder sugar has the opportunity to reclaim moss's stolen money but he's like nah you can have the money anton why because as we've seen chager isn't here to make money or sense his violence is chaotic and nihilistic and rooted largely in the notion that fate is an uncontrollable force ruling over all our lives enter the neo-western note that genre terms are constantly contested by theorists who might call no country a new western late western post-modern western or any other number of terms that exist to make us feel a little crazy but others consider it just to be the next phase of the revisionist post-western tradition but we're going to use the term neo-western as it's conventionally understood to mean contemporary-ish stories that incorporate generic western themes and tropes to critique the mythos of the west while also incorporating other genres ranging from noir to horror so anyway the neo-western of which no country is basically a poster child is often characterized by a much darker vision of the american west importantly as scholar lee clark mitchell explains in his book late westerns these films will typically trust that its viewers understand the language of the western and use our familiarity to undercut our expectations because the cohens know that we'll register the cinematic language of the film from the stetson boots to the distinctive texan draw as western they can have fun playing with our minds and hearts this is where we need to note that neo-westerns including no country often pull heavily from the traditions of another classic american film genre film noir this is nothing new for the coen brothers who have been called the epitome of the neo-noir impulse in the 21st century their genre [ __ ] instincts are certainly on parade in no country this is clear from the opening sequence we already went over the way wide angle shots of sprawling landscapes are shown to situate us in a comfort zone of the classic western at the same time though these images are accompanied by sheriff bell's 90-second voice-over about his own life feelings and reactions to societal violence he killed a 14-year-old girl paper said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it this technique is far more characteristic of noir films which frequently make use of voice over to establish mood and give insights into the psychological plight of a protagonist you say to yourself how hot can it get an acapulco you find out i knew she had to wind up here because if you want to go south here's where you get the ball this immediately establishes the two genres with which the film will wrestle the cohen's noir intentions are also signaled to us when carla jean watches flight to tangier on a black and white tv a classic noir film that actually mirrors the plot of no country featuring a hunt for a massive amount of money and three central characters zipping around in automobiles and crossing country borders throughout its tense hours no country fully employs noir language if i was into cutting deals why wouldn't i just deal with this guy sugar oh no you don't understand you can't make a deal with him even if you gave him the money back he'd still kill you just for inconveniencing him so much so that mitchell argues that the film basically has dueling genres with the western literally facing off against the film noir in a way that our villain never fully faces off with the hero this is seen in a number of ways the film quickly abandons the open desert for the dark interiors of motels and cars far more typical of the film noir which frequently explores themes of lost morality in the labyrinth of modern life high contrast lighting also abounds with many a lone character sitting in a janky room lit by a long suffering lamp there's also extensive use of high and low angle shots which serve to disorient us and disassociate us from our characters at the same time the film leans heavily on aggressively intense close-ups that create a sense of profound isolation which is only magnified by the tendency of each character to be alone on screen what's more the plot rather than being straightforward is filled with cul-de-sacs that serve only to disorient us like the late introduction of and near immediate disposal of carson wells all of the above again are typical of film noir viewed this way sheriff bell is basically a classic western character airdropped into a neo-western hence his utter bewilderment at the violence and depravity that surrounds him luellen moss as a revisionist western character who is morally grey but still someone you can root for has also been transported to a neo-western world where a fundamental sense of justice doesn't really exist instead the film ultimately stays true to more classic noir themes that the world is filled with inexplicable evil and that humans are helpless against the forces of fate as scholar christopher wells put it every film noir is the shadowland of a lost paradise a fallen state depicting the american city's underbelly as a world of violence and chaos sound familiar but the cohen's ultimate subversion of audience expectations happens during the climax whether we're watching a classic or revisionist western or a comedy thriller about a diaper-clad senior executive we expect the hero and villain to face off but instead a random unknown character takes moss's life off-screen no showdown with sugar no reunion with carla jean just the ultimate narrative blue balls and this is where we have to talk about violence in the western typically violence in classic and to some extent revisionist western films can bring about justice the good guy kills the bad guy and all's good in the world but in no country violence does nothing it's so purposeless in fact that eventually it just disappears entirely with both carla jean and llewellyn's deaths occurring off-screen with violence ultimately amounting to nothing there will be no justice in the cohen's dark vision of the american west or will there be later we're teased with the possibility of a climactic confrontation when bell goes back to moss's hotel room and we see chigurh waiting inside it's time for a face-off right not so fast instead all we get is nothing more than his shadow on the wall a nod to the showdown we all wanted the shot perfectly shows the film's fundamental tension between western and noir tropes featuring classic noir shadows while depicting your typical western cowboy who has literally become a shadow of what he once was however there's one last opportunity for cosmic justice when trigger gets into a random car accident and we can hear the police approaching is some kind of higher power providing justice nope he just pays off some kids who like all the other characters fight over the money and trigger chaos personified walks off into the sunset like the western hero he most definitely isn't in the end it's a lot of wtf's for the audience like bell we don't understand why higher powers i.e the filmmakers are denying us any morally sound sense of justice if any form of justice prevails it's triggers who at least makes good on his promise to kill carla gene i'm a man of my word this perverted vision of justice feels a much more film noir than western meanwhile bell is given up essentially admitted defeat almost as the western admits defeat in the face of the nihilism of film noir later when bell reflects on the inexplicable crimes he expresses his desire for meaning from a higher power again sounding like a character from a film noir regretfully looking back on his life i always figured when i got older god would sort of come into my life somehow he didn't i don't blame him advise him to have the same opinion to me and he does bell's closing monologue reflects on our desire to be comforted with morally satisfying outcomes but as we're about to see that won't happen for belle or us because chaos but what do you guys think is no country for old men borrowing from western tropes only to confound our expectations by concluding as a film noir or are the coen brothers just cinema's most successful
