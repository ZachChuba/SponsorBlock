hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with honey mustard roast chicken that's right not only are we doing a
super delicious and super easy recipe for roast chicken i'm gonna show you how
to do one of my all-time favorite poultry techniques and not just favour
to do favor to say and of course I'm talking about spatchcocking okay there's
a reason for that old culinary school saying if you start by spatchcocking
your chicken will be rocking and this one certainly was and to get started
we'll go ahead mix up our marinade in a nice large and as you can see a very
experienced bowl and we'll begin with a whole bunch of yellow mustard and if
you're noticing sort of a two-tone effect that's because I finished off the
squeeze bottle of one brand and then started another but anything will work
including Dijon and then to that we will add the honey of our choice or the honey
of our honey's choice along with some rice wine vinegar or any vinegar and
we'll also do a nice squirt of hot sauce in my case sriracha which means we don't
really need any cayenne sorry kids but we will add a little bit of smoked
paprika also known as the bacon of spices and then we'll finish up with
some freshly ground black pepper and of course some salt and that's it we'll
simply take a whisk and give it a mix and once combined our marinade is done
and we can move on to the aforementioned spatchcocking and what we'll need is one
large whole chicken all right something between about four and a half and five
pounds is perfect and what we'll do is flip that over breast side down so we
can identify the backbone which is very easy to find since it's right in the
middle and all we're gonna do to remove that has take a pair of scissors and cut
along either side of it starting at the tail bone going all the way out past the
neck and yes of course you can do this with a knife but I really do find the
scissors a lot easier and so as not to waste me make sure you're going as close
to that backbone as possible and that's it once that's been removed we can go
ahead and do a little trimming of any excess fat or skin at which point we
will switch to a knife because what we'll do is find that cartilage right in
the center right with that vyas form where the wishbone comes together and
then using the knife we'll make one shallow cut right through that cartilage
and then by pressing down on either side the chicken
will flatten out and that breastbone should reveal itself and if you have to
make another little cut in that cartilage to make that happen go ahead
and then once that happens we can just run our fingers along the breastbone
until the rest of the cartilage pulls away which is gonna allow our chicken to
sit nice and flat as it roasts speaking which I think it looks a little nicer
after it cooks if we remove that flat part of the wing right at the joint
all right that's definitely optional but I do think it looks better plus we can
take those and the backbone and make a little bit of stock so I do like to cut
those off but you decide I mean you are fowl the Larry of your
bird and that's it we'll go ahead and transfer that into the bowl of
marination and we'll toss around until it's very well coated including and
especially any and all nooks and crannies and it was right about here
when I remember something we should have done on the cutting board which now I'm
gonna have to do in the bowl which is much harder and that's take a sharp
knife and make a few shallow cuts into the thigh and the leg and also if you
want near those wing joints and not only will that allow the marinade to
penetrate better but those are also the spots that take the longest to cook so
by doing this theoretically it does cook a little more evenly so please do as I
say and now as you just saw me do do those cuts on the cutting board which is
way easier and that's it once I was completed I continued on making sure
this was well coated and if you're wondering do you have to do those at all
well no you don't have to do anything but I would and then once we feel like
that's been sufficiently slathered we'll make sure we end up with the breast side
down at which point we'll clean up the edges of our Bowl a little bit and then
transfer this into the fridge to marinate for anywhere between 4 and 12
hours and if you are going overnight you might want to cover it but I was only
gonna do mine for like 4 or 5 hours so I didn't and then what we'll do once we
pull it out of the fridge is transferred out to a foil lined baking sheet of
course with the skin side facing up and do not under any circumstances throw
away that excess marinade all right we're gonna use that to baste with and
also use that as a sauce later and at this point our bird is ready for the
oven although I generally like to sprinkle on
a little more salt so I did and that's it we'll go ahead and transfer that into
the center of a 425 degree oven for about 50 minutes or so
or until it's whatever you would consider safely done and then what we
should do while it's roasting is transfer any of that excess marinade
into a small saucepan and maybe thin it out a little bit with some stock you
made with the wings in the backbone that you had simmering while your chicken was
marinating and all we have to do here to make this safe to use as a sauce is
simply bring it up to a boil and really that's it that is now perfectly safe to
spoon over our chicken later but before that let's go ahead and use it for a
little bit of basting since after about 40 minutes or so your chickens gonna
start getting dark in certain spots mostly because of the caramelization of
the honey so what I like to do for the last maybe 50 minutes of the cooking
time is give it a nice basting with our sauce formerly known as our marinade and
that's going to protect those spots from getting unpleasantly dark and also of
course build up a nice glaze and you can do this as many times as you want
although I only did mine twice like I said during the last 15 minutes of
cooking at which point it looked like this and then what we'll do once our
chicken is cooked to perfection is take that same brush but this time
we're gonna brush over any of the rendered chicken fat that's on the pan
along with of course any accumulated juices which is going to shine this up
beautifully and also of course add a little bit of flavor and while I do this
let me go ahead and give this a turn so you can appreciate its beauty from all
angles and by the time we finish that our chicken will live perfectly rested
and we can transfer it to some kind of serving platter possibly with some
roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts and I went ahead and finished up with
some sliced green onions mostly because I had them but also
because they're good for you and that's it our honey mustard roast chicken is
done and ready to enjoy which I'm gonna do right here without even plating up
and that my friends was just a magnificent roast chicken right a little
bit sweet a little bit tangy with a little touch of heat Plus that very very
subtle hint of smokiness from the paprika so the flavor really was
incredible and of course since we sterilized our marinade we can go ahead
and spoon that over as a sauce and the big advantage of that spatchcocking
technique besides that it looks super cool and it's fun to say
is it because the chicken lays nice and flat all the parts cook nice and evenly
and the breast meat ends up just as juicy and succulent as the dark meat
so really is a technique you wanna master although as you saw there's not
really much to master okay all we're really mostly doing is a little bit of
scissoring oh and definitely feel free to double those marinade ingredients if
you want to have a little more sauce on him and if you're wondering why I never
played it up it's because the Sun was going down and the light was perfect so
I didn't want to risk it plus sometimes I like to pretend this is a normal sized
plate and I'm kid size again but mostly it was the light and if you think that
breast meat was juicy and flavorful just wait until you try that dark meat oh by
the way you know what else honey mustard sauce is good with roasted potato wedges
in Brussels sprouts so this really does work on every level
but anyway that's just a bonus the real point is how amazingly well this chicken
comes out and please do me a favor knead the scan it's like the best part but
whether you leave the skin or not or whether you plate it up or you just eat
it out of the platter like a savage either way I really do hope you give
this a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amongst a
principle written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy
