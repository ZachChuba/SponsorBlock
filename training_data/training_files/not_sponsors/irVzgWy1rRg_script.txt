gimme gimme gimme product launch kickstarter [Music] there you are welcome back that's right i said kickstarter i said the word kickstarter oh boy have we had a storied past with kickstarter but this is different hang on back in august i received an email from a place called mythic roll hi i just stumbled upon your youtube channel was wondering if you also do reviews i do do we do reviews sean we do reviews we are working on an upcoming chaos project that will include 3d printable dice towers and dice boxes and it would be amazing to have a review on youtube i'm conflicted at this point but i go on currently you can get one of our models the observatory dice tower for free upon sign up and it can be downloaded at our website okay kickstarter 3d printers i get it i get it i have a number of them that i'm i'm waiting for them to get to backers before i even open the box this is different this this is a 3d printable thing this is a digital file this is not a 3d printer what joy it is to be able to 3d print dice towers they are some of my favorite things to print hence the intro with these awesome dice and these were sent to me during a fan mail friday and at the moment i can't recall the name of the person that did but they are incredible dice look at that there's magnets it's printed in my blue beautiful dice awesome so we have dice now we need a dice tower so what did i do i got my sidewinder x2 from artillery up and going and i loaded it up with poly alchemy elixir filament it's gorgeous gorgeous filament and i hit print and it printer printed and it started moving and doing things and it took a while and we ended up with this wow hot diggity dog look at this this is gorgeous this is a dice tower the observatory from mythic role a free free model you just have to sign up for the mailing list which uh at the time of recording i got two emails about one of them was an update to this model oh what's this it comes apart this is incredibly well designed no supports needed anywhere this is gonna be the telescope the lens the the thing that lets you see into the stars this is going to be the top this is the thing that houses that in fact now that we're filming i can i can attach it that's good to go this is the base this is really cool they've actually put mythic roll in the geometry but it's there for decoration it has registration marks here and registration insets here kind of sits in there all nice and pretty and then this also has registration marks here and here so you just add it to the top obviously we have to test this this is amazing oh i love it i love it so much yeah it's a kickstarter but this is a free model and obviously if you go to the website i put it down in the description you can get this model for free they have some artwork on their website where i'm like i can't wait to download some other things i'm thinking about pledging for the kickstarter when it's active just because i love high quality models that that are easy to print that are fun to print that are fun too and large so if we were to break this down into its component parts i think i've got a plan so this one right here what we'll do is we'll size it up 2x and we'll print this on the artillery sidewinder x2 this one over here what we could do is size this up 2x and we could print this on the any cubic viper this one right here i i think sized up 2x leaves me with one option and that is my g create g-max 2. we'll get it started on that finally the actual stair steps the things that allow the dice to tumble and then poop out at the end through this door uh sized up 2x it's a cylindrical shape i i think i think we use our simi cnc artemis for this let's get printing here we are at the artillery sidewinder x2 and hey it's done look at that that turned out great you can look at the if you look at the geometry it looks like there's pockets of just kind of looks like it's deformed but that's not deformed that's an action that's actually part of the geometry here's the viper according to this it's at 64 percent and that's looking pretty good boy we consumed a lot of that build plate right there that's fantastic there's that mosaic film at the speed minute i think we got enough left in there it wanted like 300 some odd grams i think there was 400 on the spool left it's looking pretty good this is awesome wow that is 23 hours later and it's looking pretty good of course when you've got a one millimeter nozzle on it it's just gonna go through that filament that was a one kilogram spool that's almost empty and i got this red spool standing by jeez i might just swap it over while i'm here but that's gonna finish i mean we're at 85 percent so that's gonna finish i really really like that that looks good i mean it's all gonna get painted but wow that's looking good the prints are done but you know if you think about it filament that's been printed it's dead right in a former life at least with broken anvil miniatures i was a geomancer but to bring dead filament back from the dead i think we have to practice a little necromancy let's see if we can do it [Music] we did it we did it we've got ourselves a 2x sized telescope this is the lens that lets us see out into the stars okay that worked that worked so next we have to try for the top the thing that the lens attaches to here we go [Music] this is getting tough this is getting really hard i didn't think raising things from the dead would be difficult but we've done it together you're a part of this this is going to be the top oh this looks cool this looks cool and it'll join this obviously but there's two more parts to get these parts are big and i might not be able to do this cheer me on please please start clap sing do whatever you can [Music] [Music] there it is oh this is difficult but look at the size of this of course of course this is going to be gmax sized hot diggity hot diggity okay this is cool last and certainly not least is the stairs now 2x sized it's ginormous and so i'm going to need your help let's do this together here we go it's coming coming [Music] here it is look at the size this is insane oh my gosh this is huge i love it i love this this is the mythic roll observatory dice tower sized up 2x let's see if it works it'd be a real shame if this didn't work like if if i assembled this all and then it was like nah so this will put okay that is forever attached that is never coming off there it is look at this this oh my goodness oh my goodness this is amazing this is so wonderful four dice into the dice tower this one escaped this is this is so cool let's take a look so side by side it's it's just it's silly it's absolutely sil look at this look at this look at it i'm torn i'm torn it's true i'm torn because i like the look of 3d printed things i like seeing the colors of the filaments that make it i mean especially this this is gorgeous but this i i like it because i get to see how it's made part of what i do here is teach instruct and inspire that's why when i did that thanos sword one side was left unfinished so you could see the various parts it took to put it together let me know in the comments should i paint the small one should i paint the large one should i glue them together or keep them separate what do you think should happen to these two awesome dice towers well listen uh stuff like this is a lot of fun i just i enjoy printing things that are large and i'm unabashedly in love with dice towers and this model is free and i'll put a link in the description so you can find out more and honestly yeah it's
