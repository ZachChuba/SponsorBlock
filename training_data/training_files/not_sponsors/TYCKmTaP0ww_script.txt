this video is sponsored by Squarespace that is is that like you know no matter how anyone is like born like whatever like it was like physical appearance is right there's only so much you can do with this but one thing that you do have power over but you have to work at it as confidence and like confidence is sexy like knowing who you are as sexy you're such a sweet guy and you do have a lot to offer but if you don't make it seem like you know that you have a lot to offer like no one else is gonna really like give you the time of day right it's my hair look insane yes yeah it does but it's for your side okay I like most people have always looked at reality TV as being mindless media it's content that you can put on and most of the time not walk away with anything beneficial it's rare that I ever seem to find a significant amount of substance through reality television that is until I decided to join the bandwagon and watch queer I if you're somehow unaware queer is a show where five gay guys aka the Fab five makeover straight guys who need it Bobby deals with design kar amo deals with culture tan with fashion my sweet baby boy Anthony deals with food and last but not least Johnathan deals with grooming from the first episode you can't fix ugly it's evident that this isn't a completely mindless reality show who your eye is about more than just providing an entertaining and easy to watch experience it's about self-care and becoming a better you while I definitely see each member of the fab 5 as being critical to what makes the show so special there's one member in particular that stands out to me is being incredibly overlooked and that's Jonathan Van Ness can you believe no you're probably thinking oh but Karsten Jonathan is clearly the fan favorite he has the most followers on Instagram he is anything but overlooked sure from a popularity standpoint Jonathan is far from underrated but I feel as though he is without a doubt the most essential member of the group there's much to address so without any further ado I'm going to dive into what makes Jonathan Van Ness the best member of queer I Ezri oh no Jonathan so Lay's egg grooming we can all argue who does their specialty best in my opinion it's obviously Jonathan but that's not what I'm here to talk about I'm here to talk about the importance of grooming and how that is arguably the most important aspect of the process for one grooming is relatively simple affordable and easy to remember as opposed to the others designing a home is expensive nice clothes cost money and I love my sweet angel Antony but do you think any of the contestants are going to make these dishes jonathan recommends like three or so products to you that are easy to remember easy to use affordable and make the contestants excited to use them that's only half of why I see grooming is so important though a common theme in most contestants in queer eye is protectiveness they are usually very protective of their space and what bigger space to be protective about than your body with the other members of the fab 5 a contestant simply has to agree and say yeah I can do that I can do this whatever one could argue Bobby is an exception because he literally changes their entire living space but that doesn't nearly seem as personal as Jonathan contestants gain a sense of trust and connection with Jonathan by allowing him to literally take control of their faces by doing so I feel Jonathan more than any other member is able to truly bring the contestant out of their show which leads me into my next point it can be argued that Kurama Brown is the true mind behind addressing mental health and character on the show and it's true Kurama is amazing at what he does he clearly knows his stuff and he manages to get certain information and perspectives out of the contestants that is crucial for the sake of their growth oh and not to mention his smile I mean Jesus but something I feel the other members including Kurama failed to find in the contestants is the human within them I'm no mental health expert I'm studying film but it doesn't take much to understand that growing as a person learning how to self improve is impossible if there's a lack of self-knowledge what I think makes Jonathan Van Ness so special is his ability to take this a step further by not only helping contestants realize who they are but bringing that personality out whereas before I talked about how Jonathan is able to bring them out of their shells physically here I want to address how he does so mentally it's hard to make this sound pretentious or deep so I'm just gonna come right out and say it Jonathan is just a fun and goofy guy that's really all it is again Kurama is amazing but he is also more on the serious side when he has to do his job and rightfully so to get serious answers he needs to be a serious person but I think the other half of this job is bringing someone out of a shell and creating a comfortable and fun space and I think no member is better at doing this than Jonathan whether it be an uncomfortable hug playing with hair trying on clothes or cracking jokes ever you accidentally knock your wife up you have to name the baby Jonathan because it's totally my fault because I got you this haircut Jonathan manages to create an open and inviting space by automatically making himself the most extra in the room by doing so everyone naturally channels that enter and feels more comfortable bringing out their own personalities now that the bar is so ridiculously high as a result you get something as beautifully simple as a shy contestant cracking a joke which as someone who has been and still is shy around new people is a pretty big deal and it feels good oh my god what I think truly separates Jonathan from the rest of the group is how he is on the inside something I've noticed about Jonathan is that while he may be the loudest and the most extra in the room at all times he is a little bit more on the quiet side when it comes to him talking about his own past and what he has dealt with being that he is technically the most flamboyant and Breaks gender norms more than any of the others it's fair to assume Jonathan has faced a good amount of bullying for being who he is this is by no means media legitimizing what the others have been through everyone has had a tough past it's just that Jonathan has remained pretty silent about his you get an answer for the silence in his vulture conversation with Justin Theroux oh yeah I remember what it was so essentially my friends like really mad about this thing that happened like this thing and they can't stop talking about the thing but I was like if you got more into the solution of that than rehashing the problem do we care about what the thing is or no that's just idea that like you know getting into the solution is cuter than me rehashing the problem because like Eckhart Tolle talks about how like our brains and our bodies like our bodies don't know the difference between like reality and a thigh so if I'm like replaying like the state of our of the world right now and I'm not really like actively thinking about a solution I'm just like you know titrating on the problems like over it no right like I think that just dresses me out Jonathan lives by the philosophy of rarely addressing the problem or at least dwelling on it and focusing completely on the solution in progress I think this is especially important when we're talking about something like queer eye and self-improvement when you look at the other members they approach the contestants flaws in a way that's like okay this is what's wrong we need to get rid of it Kurama will address every corner of a problem tan will make sure a graphic tee never sees the light of day again Bobby will sometimes just straight-up get rid of your furniture and Anthony oh my sweet honey bear antony he will look in the fridge and go what is going on here this is very bad and just throw  out what jonathan does is take what is looked at as a flaw and builds off of it rather than destroying it he embraces the fact that no matter who you are you're beautiful he truly lives by the Tim Gunn motto of making something work not throwing something away that is unless we're talking about a bad care product which in that case honey you got to get that out of your life between creating a comfortable environment doing his job the best and living a progressive lifestyle it's safe to say Jonathan is without a doubt the queen of queer I it's easy to look at Jonathan as a silly gay guy who can be funny and looks a little bit like Jesus but I think beneath that is someone who genuinely cares about making the world a better place and it can start with something as simple as a good haircut when I first started watching queer I and heard the corny reality show EDM music I'll admit I was hesitant but after plowing through both seasons I can safely say it has been one of the better decisions in my TB viewing history who has made me look better feel better think better all with just a few small tips so seriously give it a shot you might just come out of it with a new avocado related recipe everyone thank you so much for watching before you head out I want to say two things one we have merch now we have a
