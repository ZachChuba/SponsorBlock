[Music] number 128 the exact drop rate where we should get one item uh we got two our middle chest plates no helmets i know i'm still very early is it 127 oh it might be 127. oh well either way we're rocking one kill trip so we're gonna have to find a solution so you know what i'm gonna go to lms and actually get a rune pouch and then go to get bones to peaches and i'll probably increase my trips by like two kills [Music] so we're here at lms oh [ __ ] we're already starting crap i didn't even brew up what's going on here oh okay i've never played lms on an australian world but that was a good first kill um this is my only viable way to get a room pouch lms 75 lms points for a room pouch now keep in mind i'm terrible at pking i'm on an aussie world which is not gonna help me one bit and um i'm terrible at pking i haven't said that yet so uh here we are trying to get that rune pouch because otherwise my armadillo or my cree trips are only gonna be one or two kill trips and i kind of want to extend that to like three to four if possible i saw pulverized videos link in description and he's doing like three to seven kill trips with bones to peaches and blood barrage so i kind of want to follow in his footsteps because otherwise this armadillo grind is gonna take years okay here we go boys this is where we turn it around this is where we turn it around uh hello how's he not frozen come on baby how did that how was it a poke kill yeah there's no chance this guy hit me through prey about a billion times dude what the [ __ ] but that comeback was almost epic it was almost epic dude if only i could just shoot this guy or something with a gun you know that'd be to make it much that's fast no no the web spec [ __ ] easiest with spec of my life dude [Music] oh come on whoa that was a clean kill to be fair after that whip spec i'm not gonna lie that was not too bad i'll wait for this guy real quick and then we're going in baby [Music] he's going upstairs was he gonna hide was it what's he doing this guy was gonna hide for the rest of the game hello finish him off please jesus about time noodle whip dude [ __ ] off this is not very fair is it okay the comeback boys to come back [ __ ] the ballista man that thing is [ __ ] off i'm gonna be salty i'm gonna be salty right there i'm gonna be salty look that was [ __ ] this guy didn't give me a fair fight in the middle i'ma be salty i allow myself to be salty right there okay so he does the same thing every time remages and switches to range oh my god that was a chance and a half i'm i'm gonna risk it yeah it doesn't really matter oh i got full derog oh boys yes yes dude this is so above my paycheck but i am going to try the full down boom arrange for a bit [Music] dude the ballista is insane man i switched that right i switched that right oh no i wasn't that was a bit ambitious i'm not gonna lie boom [ __ ] i'm so slow dude there we go instantly to the next guy dude [ __ ] it did i just i don't know i'm not really sure what just happened there i'm going in boys for the kill yoink that's four kills already this game what the hell all right ambitious dude ambitious why is he maining the dark that's what trying to switch the melee yes come on man that was well calculated [ __ ] you come on man i'm working this guy so hard right now come on yeah of course that's a poke i knew it it's ping is so annoying just stab bashed me man is under stress okay i just gotta keep calm and collected and i got this jesus i got this boys i still got this i believe in myself that was bad he's eating how can he crossbow hit me stop dude holy sh i'm not gonna lie i'm i'm so triggered but we have 77 points so you know what i'm buying myself a rune pouch and um you're not going to see me here in a long time anymore let's go i can't i can't damn it dude not even with anxious a two-kill trip come on i hate this grind so much so i did promise you guys that if you subscribe the last episode that i would learn how to treat tick uh chins and stuff and to be very honest i feel like this is much chiller than actual hunter i don't know i'm one of those people that rather picks efficiency over lazy if canis and even though the afk is kind of the same it just takes a little longer to set up the traps but i'm really enjoying the street thinking i just said tree thicking that is um it's i meant three three ticking jesus okay english is difficult i'm sure i'm going to do it like this on my hardcore too if i ever go for 9900 um it is a lot of xp per hour i wasted a little bit of time like efficiency time wise um it is not actually 119k per hour if you do it properly it's about 140 if not a little more it's crazy i've done 350k xp uh today and we are about to hit 8900 so that's super nice we can instantly go and hunt some lucky implants i'ma put the cc to work and i'm hoping that we can catch some lucky implics today so that's it 2100 chins to throw at armadill when we are finally going back there i know i know guys i know this episode has been very little armadillo since the last episodes i've not killed that many but i just want to do it efficiently so we're done with this grind and we can open clues again also picking up some dragon dragons in the process yo shout out to charlie for first binding him or snaring him well first calling it out and then snaring it what a beast dude he's helping me catch some lucky implying so big shout out charlie see you in a bit dude come on boys i might have my first lucky impling here this would be big uh west side i'm coming charlotte has scouted this one for me no don't tell me despawn please man it apparently despawned that [ __ ] sucks all right better look next time please charlotte you're the best i gotta go in i don't have snares charlotte please have snares please you're the best you're the best oh my god you're the best i got it yes the first lucky imp oh my god charlie's been scouting for me all day yo boys under the link in the description under the frag link charlotte's channel check it out she's making great videos she's helping me out a shitload so big shout out to charlotte she's been literally hopping for four hours no wait even six hours i think mad shout out to charlotte holy [ __ ] that's insane first lucky imp is in boys hey shout out to gripee for the dragon always nice to catch one of these two every once in a while because these drop a leak lose 1 in 50. thank you very much beast shout out to gripey and we are done with mta i saved you guys from all the nta grinding um it only took i want to say four hours maybe a little less actually this isn't as bad as i remember it being but we finally have oh oh you're gonna be kidding me oh this just snuck up on me 96 mage that is getting really close to 99 that's a cape that i have never gotten yet so that's pretty cool even though we're most likely i want to say never going to hit that um unless i spend an awful lot of time elkin all the stuff i have in my bank eventually passively maybe we'll get 99 but i don't think there is a possibility in me getting 99 mage unless you guys know something leave it in the comments if i'm overlooking something but i don't think i'll ever have to kill a boss with mage again or need to actively train mage again there's no slayer steps so there's no bursting maybe i can burst for hard clues on jellies and get it that way actually that might be the way getting hard clues from jellies is a very good way in the catacombs of kren so maybe that'll be the way for me to get 99 mage i don't know if there's any other way though get me the [ __ ] out of here man all right as i said it's not too bad i think i dislike the alchemy room the most i rather do the telly room and the graveyard room than the elk room oh well either way we are done here forever probably bones to peaches let's finally do armadill properly i am now an armadillo killing machine all right all that we have left is just grinding out i think i maxed out the account now in terms of what i can get except for the armadillo bottoms of course but we have bone step peaches we have a bunch of shins we have blood barrage i don't think we can do any better and now it's just straight kill count let's go in let's hope we can get three kill trips now i really really really hope so please here we go boys just one straight line to the armadill helmet now the thing is i kill cree and the flight kalista about at the same time so i usually cannot really blood barrage on the flight calista considering it's usually almost dead already so i don't know how that the blood barrage does a lot but you know what every bit helps of course look at me go almost a full inventory of food again dude i'm getting slaughtered i'm actually getting sloshed all right two kill trip not horrible if that is like the absolute minimum we can do i'm not too mad we've got another scout we've got another scout run run before the yoink can we get two lucky implings there he is there he is oh he was just looking it was not catching snipe it before it despawns oh god oh god oh there we go yes dude it's going to be a very close one this one but is the 150th kill be incredible if we can get it in a three kill trip i'd be really happy with that screw it dude we just picked up a range and a defense spot i'm pulling them both no please not again this happens too many times 44 hp in a dream 20 hp in a dream screw my chins 11 hp in a dream 11 hp in a dream coins what the hell is this no as if i missed the flick no that was way too close we did it boys we done did it three kill trip 150 kills on the dot baby all right 150 is where we leave it for today but now we only have one straight line to the orbital helmet there is going to be nothing that's going to be stopping me now from just getting armor kill after arma kill ecumenical key after a communicable key it is now finally time because i know i've been slacking to get a bunch of kills 200 more kills in the next episode i have to otherwise we're never going to be done with this step however we have two lucky imps that we got from charlotte basically that we got scouted today in this episode so to celebrate the milestone and all the upgrades is there anything unique remember i got a gilded axe from the league hey yo that's not even off bad that's a hard clue unique and a medium glue yoho that is good let's see if any of them were unique uh so hard the ruin helmet tea was actually unique yo i'm spooned and the boater the boater wasn't but yo that rune helm was a unique let's go shout out you guys are legends thank you so much for all the support boys and i'll see you guys in the next episode [Music] you
