no matter who you are whether you're an IT administrator a computer enthusiast or just a regular old gamer there's probably been a time when you've needed to do something remotely on one of your systems and you're not in a place where it's very convenient whether it's power cycling updating your software or just troubleshooting a program but if you're like me services like TeamViewer never fully scratch that itch due to limited functionality or the dreaded commercial use suspected shutting you down thankfully for us the guys over at pulse way offered to sponsor a video showcasing their management software and we thought it'd be a great fit for you guys so let's check it out shall we here on the roof of our building because why not so Pulse way is what's known as an AR mm or remote monitoring and management software which sounds really really really boring but there's more here than meets the eye so the main idea behind pulse way is simple but powerful computer match off crap that still sounds boring doesn't it okay no wait so once you've installed the pulse way software on your system systems or like your entire office base although we recommend using their deployment tool for that last one you'll be in full control of those devices using Bare control interfaces and you can do it remotely so we're gonna start with the web version and save the best the pulse way app for later once you've logged in right away you're going to be greeted by a list of the systems that you set up earlier in our case we installed it on a couple for demo purposes here first is our patent-pending Google Recker followed by our steam caching server Jake's workstation and then of course our main production storage server Wanek because who doesn't test software on their most mission-critical machine yeah well it's your idea clicking on any one of them is gonna reveal a ton of monitoring goodness so by default there's actually quite a few unique controls and monitoring like what we'll call them tabs that you can play with so here we can see CPU usage ran the temperature of the individual cores of our processor what motherboard is running and even what BIOS version that the system is running so you'll know which units like let's say you've got a whole deployment of a bunch of systems you can tell which ones need updating against security vulnerabilities like Spectre for example you can also view the total and remaining space on your drives view and kill specific processors like say if they're pegging the CPU at a hundred percent rendering it unusable and you can even send a test print page from that system to see if the printer is actually broken or if it's just yet another ticket from like that one dude in accounting who doesn't know the difference between printing to a printer and printing to a PDF this is there's no option export to PDF there's not an option to do it on here oh did I mention that you can view execute and schedule updates with it even down to specific types and that's all before you even go into the features that aren't enabled by default so with network monitoring we can see who's using up all the bandwidth torrenting at work and with the notification system this is really cool we can go through the literally twelve tabs of different notification options that can be customized on a system by system basis so that for example you'll be notified as soon as your server room sets on fire and not when Colton shuts off his PC after getting fired for the 380 third time but you've probably noticed by now that at least a couple of the machines that were showing off here aren't running Windows compatibility is another really strong point for pulse way they've got clients for most Linux distros raspbian mac and windows and the software has a full fat rest api so you can actually code monitoring and management functionality into the services and applications that your own company develops then you can control those with the regular pulse way web interface back to more regular users though pulse way also has this really cool automation tab so basically what it includes is a bunch of sample scripts that should complement any power shell or bash scripts that you import and that can easily be scheduled like checking for and installing any critical updates outside of work hours ensuring that you never have to look at another Windows Update or using it as an easy way to run that screen melting executable that you've been cooking up in Visual Studio to prank your co-workers and all of this can be done on their app for iOS and Android as well it is basically a complete copy of the web interface except in mobile form so you aren't sacrificing any functionality when you're on the go for example you could turn on your plex server via wake-on-lan download your favorite show and basically prepare yourself for a flight without ever thinking about breaking out your lap which admittedly probably isn't a very common use case but I think you guys get the point it's very very versatile so thanks to pulse wave for sponsoring this showcase of their rmm software let us know down in the comments if you have any cool ideas for how you or we could use pulse wave maybe it's finally time to set up monitoring on all the servers so yeah so stay tuned for the next server room update because yeah we should definitely do that so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join let us know in the comments if you want to see a tour of our roof we actually were counting and we have almost as many rooftop cooling systems as the entire rest of our building and the two other buildings in our complex combined because we're ridiculous like that we just care about our employees comfort Brandon's comfort in particular and Tyler they got they have the highest HVAC investment per per person or person in the company yep
