so Elon Musk has been going off on Twitter no I'm not not talking about that and we are learning all kinds of new things that are coming to autopilot really soon so let's check them out one of the biggest things that Elon mentioned on Twitter is pretty soon Tesla vehicles are going to be reading speed limit signs with their cameras now this seems pretty obvious when you have the car surrounded by cameras and it's seeing other things like cones and garbage cans why isn't it already doing this well there was a lot of talk of mobile I having a patent if you didn't know mobile I actually helped Tesla develop auto pilot 1.0 and their sensors were used with that well mobile I has some patents on reading speed limit signs a user on reddit quickly pointed out that mobilized patent is very specific and a bit obsolete and if Tesla was to read these speed limit signs in a different way than the patent mentions which there are a bunch of ways to do it differently then Tesla can read the speed limit signs and not have to worry about that patent now this is great news because currently Tesla's use map data to know the speed limits and on main roads roads that are traveled a lot or updated frequently it does work fine most of the time but I know for me I travel on a lot of backroads and the speed limits are wrong on honestly I think a hundred percent of all the back roads I travel regularly I'm not exaggerating I think every single Road is wrong and most of the time it's actually in my favor because the wrong speed limits are higher so I can go a bit faster and that's good with the flow of traffic around me so I'm really excited for this one I think initially probably won't be perfect like a lot of things we see with these software updates but as time goes on we know it gets better and better and it's gonna turn out to be way better than using map data now this next one isn't about functionality but I am so excited for this third rail podcast ask Elon if we can have something next to the odometer to show how many miles were driven on autopilot and not functional but so cool I have wanted to know this info for a really long time if you drive a Tesla you know most of your miles are on autopilot even if you're not doing a lot of highway driving if you have a long stretch of straight road you want to use autopilot it's just better it's just better most of the time my normal driving to work I Drive 70 miles a day 50 miles of that is on the highway and 99.9% of that mileage is on autopilot every single day but even the roads getting to the highway are straight enough with pretty much no turns where I'm using autopilot on all of those two for me personally I would guess my miles on autopilot has to be in the 90% range probably greater than 90% that's really what I think especially since we've taken some really big road trips of course almost all of road trip driving is going to be on autopilot let me know down in the comments what you think your percentage on autopilot will be once you get this update and if you're enjoying this video please hit like and get subscribed so this next response from Elan I think he misunderstood the tweet a little bit but Tesla owners of Silicon Valley asked if they could get both percentage and miles of the battery left displayed in the car and in the app so as of right now in your car or your app you can either see miles or percentage battery you can't see both at the same time while you're in the car you can change between these while driving or at any time but you have to kind of dig into the menus and when you're using the mobile app you can't change this setting at all it's just whatever it's set to in the car that's what you're stuck looking at well I don't even care that it seems he misunderstood this because his response is way more exciting than just saying oh good idea let's add this he basically said he wants a detail section in the app that will mirror every setting available on the car and mention that then you could use your phone instead of the car screen to edit these settings I mean this is huge there's a lot of stuff in the car settings that would be nice to change from your app while you're sitting at home maybe before you off for a drive you want to make sure you're not forgetting to change some settings you just do him on the phone but another cool thing is you could hand your phone to your passenger or in my case if my wife is driving with me she's logged in to the same app she could be in the passenger seat or even in the backseat she could control the entire car from her phone I mean man if we could give some kind of guest connectivity to people in the car they could connect to the car through bluetooth and then they could control their seat heaters in the backseat maybe control their rear heating and cooling turning that on and off they can adjust the temperature but they can turn it on and off this is a really exciting improvement so another update on what's coming to autopilot soon it looks like turning on city streets is gonna be next this is pretty crazy I think this is gonna be one of the hardest things for the car to handle we've been talking about the auto pilot rewrite coming up Elon mentioned this in podcast with third row Tesla that they're doing a full rewrite of auto pilot to really take advantage of that hardware 3 he hasn't really mentioned it much sense and everybody including myself whenever we see these kind updates were like oh my gosh it's coming with the rewrite the rear it's gonna be here soon I'm excited for it a lot of people are excited for it but anyway getting back to the tweet he said turning on city streets is next which you know if you've ever tried to let your Tesla turn it fails most of the time I've had a few right turns and left turn through intersections and when it works it's really exciting but most of the time it's just not really equipped to do that and then another thing that comes along with this especially for our European friends is roundabouts the Tesla right now cannot do roundabouts actually with the latest update it knows it's going to an intersection it can see that it's doing some kind of intersection but it still usually gets confused there are videos out there of a Tesla on autopilot going through a roundabout but just like the right and left turns intersections they're mostly flukes they're exciting when they happen but they don't happen often and they're not reliable so Ellen said that roundabouts are no problem it's dodging all the other drivers and this you know kind of puts a lot into perspective for me I've really wondered why auto pilot isn't doing roundabouts it seems like a gradual easy enough turn for it to do besides the lane changing which autopilot currently can't do off of the highway but it just struggles so much and man the car needing to stop at a yield sign see if a cars coming decide whether or not it's safe decide whether or not the car is going to let you in or plow into you if it pulls out I mean that's a lot of decisions autopilot is gonna have to make and same thing when it's coming up to stop signs making turns I think we're gonna have this confirmation thing for awhile where the car stops at the stop sign but you have to hit the stock or the accelerator to let it know all right safe go ahead and drive through here but once you let the car know it'll make the turn because you kind of confirmed nobody's gonna run into us go ahead and take this intersection if you're new to the entire website the link is in the description now one response from Elon that was a bit of a bummer he was asked about bringing up the side repeater cameras when the turn signal is turned on and he said this is harder than you think but he's gonna check with the team this is kind of a weird response so my memory he doesn't normally respond in that way he usually either says yes or I've seen him say uh it doesn't make sense for us to do that so I guess for some reason this is harder than people think maybe it has to do with blocking information on the screen or something like that also I could swear he had responded to somebody earlier that asked for this and he said something along the lines of will do it or will look into it but I'm not sure this feature is coming and I know it's something that a lot of people are asking for I think part of the reason is if these cars really become full self-driving there's really no point in this feature you don't need to look at the screen or see the blind spot if the car is doing everything I mean even at this point yes you are in full control of the car you should not be changing lanes without looking but if you're on autopilot on the highway or even not on the highway and you hit the turn signal to change lanes and a car is there the Tesla will not do it the car is displayed on the screen it's shown in red the Tesla will just leave the blinker on until that car is out of the way and then it will change lanes if the car never gets out of the way the Tesla just won't change lanes so even now if you're using autopilot or auto lane changes the car's not gonna do it if cars there you don't really need that display now of course if you're driving the car it would be nice to have it but with the safety features you do have the red car on your screen which not everybody you know thinks is that good or notice is it that well but the car will beep at you if you're gonna change lanes into somebody and in an extreme scenario where you ignore all that and you go to drive into somebody and change lanes into them a lot of times the Tesla can actually correct you and try to help you avoid that accident so these are a lot of exciting updates we got all in one day usually these things come out over days or weeks where he's just responding to people here and there but you down there and you will see me in the next video well a user on reddit pointed out that mobilized peten is actually really specific and as long as Tesla does things in a slightly different way a user on reddit was a user on reddit was a user on reddit quickly pointed out but it just struggles so much I mean even at this point yes [Music]
