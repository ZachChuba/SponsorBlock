[Music] well hello everyone it's me Christine again or should I say you know I've seen some comments from you guys asking me to do my nails in Reverse and I thought I absolutely hate that idea I must do it I've also seen some booty gurus do their makeup in Reverse so I guess it has become somewhat of a trend here on YouTube but I feel like this trend started decades ago because I remember back in elementary school when it was backwards day or opposite day did anyone else used to wear their clothes backwards with her hat backwards or do stupid things like eat dinner for breakfast or say goodbye instead of hello write your name backwards on your chest did you know that January 31st is backwards day Wow I can't wait to leave work at 8:00 a.m. hey what's tea backwards e8e eat man get me some food anyways I am curious though for nails what it means to do your nails backwards I think there's a few different ways we could interpret doing our nails in Reverse but the most literal way for me would be using a base coat as a top coat and using your top coat as your base coat so let me start by doing the steps of a manicure literally in Reverse first we gonna have to peel backwards day hasn't started yet okay it starts when I peel these off [Music] all right so my nails are nice and naked and now I'm gonna start my manicure with available now on our website hollow taco or the link is down below oh this is exciting finally you can use what I'm using all right let's see how super glossy taco works as a base coat [Music] I mean it looks nice super glossy and shiny and I could leave the house like this if I want it but I wouldn't leave the house without holo so the second to last thing I would do in the average normal manicure to myself would be at a hollow taco all right now that my super glossy taco is dry and we are using flaky hollow taco this kind of looks nice and naked now with a dash of hollow taco very sexy now the next step would be to add my base color often times I use a dark base but if I put black on top of this you'll just see nothing so I want to try a lighter base color let's try this bleached peach neon creme yeah doesn't look like we're gonna see any hollow through its a chimeric hollow underwear it's my little secret that's okay because I think the biggest research question I have personally in doing my nails in Reverse is does a base coat work as a top coat and does a top coat work as a base coat so we're gonna be able to test that regardless of the pollo taco in between and now I'm gonna put a base coat on top of my manicure I think trying this with the regular base coat like a long-lasting base coat is the most standard way to test this because it would be the fairest way to help us answer the question does a base coat work as a top coat but at the same time I'm still curious how a peel off base coat would work as a top coat so I'm gonna use both always over complicating things yes hi so I'm using a peel off base coat as a top coat on these two nails but I suspect this will behave a lot differently than a regular long-lasting base coat because peel off base coats are usually water-based solutions that help the nail polish peel off so what is it gonna do on top of my mouth will this seal the manicure at all will it make the top layer of nail polish peel off even though it's on top of the Polish this is information that no one needs to know except me and over here we're using a regular long sting basecoat I predict that the long-lasting base coat probably won't appear much different than a top coat just less shiny but we'll find it we're gonna have to give this some time to see how each base coat works as a top coat so I'll check in with you later on that both base coats are dry to the touch and then I did a lot of things with my nails I chopped the vegetables I cleaned the kitchen things and later that night it was clear that the peel-off base coat was losing as a top coat she became matte within a few hours she dented very easily and it literally started collecting dust or cat hair whatever it was it was sticking to my nails and that kind of makes sense because the peel-off base coat is designed to stick like an under seal to your nail polish which you would under normal circumstances then pop off like a pili shell except now my peel off base coat is on top of my nails and it's sticking to random things I touch in life I am dirty I am unsanitary the long lasting base coat on the other hand was holding up okay it was still shiny it was not collecting dust however I was able to dent in my nails even several hours after applying the next day I went to work with these nails I went to the gym with these nails yes that's me I'm a badass [ __ ] and I showered with these nails surprisingly both base coats held up through all of that and although the peel-off base coat has top coat nails were definitely matched looking the fuzzies from yesterday are mysteriously gone I guess the shower cleaned them up I tried to scrape up the peel-off base coat nail and see if it would actually peel but I guess it doesn't really work that way it's kind of like underwear maybe it has to be worn under something or else what's the point the long-lasting base coat top coat still looked pretty good obviously it's not as thick or as smooth as a real glossy taco but it was glossy enough I guess and it didn't dent on day 2 and so in conclusion I think if you had to you could use a long lasting base coat as a top coat if for some reason you lost your glossy taco in a battle as long as the long lasting base coat dries clear and shiny that being said I only wore these nails for two days so it's possible that on day three you might have regretted everything my advice is to stick to wearing your top coat as your top coat and your base coat as your base coat it's just like shampoo and conditioner they both have two very different purposes just follow the directions you know so this was a literal interpretation of doing a manicure backwards but there is more of an artistic interpretation of what it means to do nail art techniques in Reverse such as the reverse in gradient a reverse gradient or a reciprocal gradient as some nail artists call it is when you have two of the same gradients usually the same color scheme going opposite directions of each other usually with the use of nail vinyls I've done this technique a couple times before it's one of my favorite nail art techniques I think it looks really cool it's like an optical illusion on your nails to achieve a reverse gradient you basically have to do a gradient one direction first using a sponge then you seal that with a quick dry glossy taco let it dry then you'll put on nail vinyls to make a pattern and then you'll do the same gradient as the first gradient but going in the opposite direction on top of the nail vinyls after you peel the vinyls up you get a really really cool looking optical illusion style nailart this technique can be very time-consuming but I think it's worth it because it has everyone wondering how the hell did you do that I have a few videos that show how I've done reversed style gradients so I'll leave some links to those down below if you want to check them out now what other artistic interpretations are there of nail art in Reverse what about speaking of nails you know how typically you would put a nail vinyl down put a color over top of it and then peel it off to reveal a stencil what if you didn't peel the nail vinyls off shocking I know let's try that up just start off with the regular base coat so let's stick the vinyl down on my nail and we'll trim this edge off so it sits flush I'm thinking is when I put the polish over top of the vinyl and we don't peel it off it'll look like an embossed stencil all right now we're gonna put our nail polish on top of the vinyl and now we're gonna let the vinyl dry inside of the Polish this is the opposite of the advice I would give normally I would say peel that vinyl up right away do not hesitate it's actually not that bad as long as the vinyl doesn't start popping off this could actually be a cool concept it's a little bit 3d a little embossed and a little Martha Stewart and you could definitely play around with different types of nail vinyls to use underneath as well it's kind of an interesting concept though it's similar to what some Gel manicurists do where they put dots of gel and then cure it and then add a color over top to get kind of like a 3d dot effect on the nail actually I did that once when I did multi chrome raindrop nails using Joe anyways would you like to see what happens to the trapped nail vinyl the next day well for starters the nail polish started chipping off part of the vinyl and now I'm going to peel 24 hours later [Music] I'd have to say this was painful but also very satisfying painful because the Polish broke off in tiny little dried paint chips everywhere but satisfying because this kind of looks cool hey look it's negative space nail art I don't think I've ever done that before intentionally anyways so there you have it this is what happens when you don't peel off the nail vinyl until a day later so there's another kind of not necessarily backwards but inverse nail art technique that I've seen where you paint the underside of your nails this actually was a trend that I'd seen going around for some time and did you know that in 2014 christian Lubin Luba Christian Louboutins came out with a nail polish with a smaller brush specifically designed to paint the underside of your nails it was called the Looby under red nail color pen what an awful name the loo B the loo B no and no I don't have it the last place I want nail polish is wedged underneath my nail making my skin adhere to my nail it does look cool though I'm not gonna lie it does look really good on people with long nails on the other hand and you have to have long enough nails obviously for this to work so sorry other hand but you don't measure up so let's try this on my main hand so the first thing I'm going to do is put some nail oil under my nails because I feel like this will help protect against the nail polish sticking to my skin maybe it'll be easier to rub the Polish off but now I need to take the oil off the underside of my nails the nail close the stick man it's hard thinking backwards you know you know how you've seen in movies where cops asks someone who they think is intoxicated to recite the alphabet backwards as if that's going to prove that they're not drunk I feel like that test is unfair because even when I'm not drunk it is hard to recite the alphabet backwards like I need to write it down first sometimes I wish I could be like Benjamin Button and just live my life backwards start off as a really old lady and then end as innocent child feel like most big youtubers live their lives backwards because the peak of their success happens when they're so young and then they just get less and less popular and less and less rich as they get older one day I'm gonna write a book actually no I'm not no I'm not writing a book on average it's true not not for everyone but on average all right we're worried oh yes painting the underside of my nails red so I've taken a paintbrush that's a bit smaller and easier to handle than a nail polish brush and we're gonna attempt this very carefully oh it it puddled at the bottom now oh this looks like I really hurt myself this looks like someone tried to rip off my nail and now I'm bleeding [ __ ] YouTube you're gonna pick this up for a serious injury and blood and de monetize this video wouldn't be the first time this is so weird and does not look right red was a bad choice red was a bad choice anything asked what happened to me I'll just say it's designer right is that what people say - excuse how ridiculous they look no actually it doesn't look so bad from far away but up close no just no ready what do you think of my nails I mean at least I picked a red hollow so I can say so that was a few ways of doing my nails backwards wow what a beautiful manicure Christy is it worth it let me search it do my nailer backwards and reverse it but other than that do you guys have any more ideas for what it would mean to do your nails backwards or nail art in Reverse leave me a comment down below nails check them out the link is below and if you'd like to know how to use a topcoat definitely don't do what I did in this video because it's it's not a base coat it's a top alright everybody don't forget to subscribe to my channel and then watch this video in Reverse just for fun should I play my outro backwards thanks so much for watching and I'll see y'all [Music]
