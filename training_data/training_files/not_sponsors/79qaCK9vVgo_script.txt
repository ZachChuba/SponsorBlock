polyphonic to check it out today somewhere in the black of space deep in the hull of a hulking ship a slave uprising begins the start splendor and misery clipping second studio album splendor and misery is a high concept hip hopper telling the story of a slave aboard a ship adrift in space not only is it one of the most compelling albums in recent memory it's also a wholly unique presentation of a sci-fi story the album was even nominated for a Hugo Award for Best dramatic presentation short form and I think the strength and splendor and misery is neither in the story nor the music alone but in how they both play into each other to create a new kind of narrative experience let's take a closer look splendor and misery opens with long way away a haunting song that Orient's us adrift in space it lays out the story themes that clipping will explore throughout the album and also introduces a musical theme traditional gospel and blues chants these chants are reminiscent of feel chance once sung by African slaves leaning the history of slavery to its future in this far-off world the chants are mixed with deep mechanical sounds an open reverb auditorally this places us deep into cold hull of a spaceship surrounded by metal and machinery with the setting in place the story starts in the breach or daveed Diggs raps as the ship's onboard computer generally operating normally a small anomaly has become evident in proudly should be noted they were spiking in the post of a member of the cargo but the coup and other passengers had not begun to notice the facility his rapping is fast and mechanical blind the in human nature of the computer in the scene slaves that were being brought as cargo on the ship are revolting the end of the scene is cut short by alarms gunfire and then stabbed this is followed up by all black all black everything in this song we learned that the revolt was a success but only one slave remains cargo number 2 3 3 1 is commandeer the vessel 1 the song the motherships AI watches cargo 2 3 3 ones first days of the helm of the vessel not turning all keys he puts the ship through paces and paces the halls pacing his badness patient as virtuous patient of these observations alone he passes his time polishing weapon as and wrapping his sanity and always keeps the weapons magazines clean despite the sci-fi nature of the story the song is full of references to contemporary hip hop dropping lines that call back to big is juicy and name-dropping Kendricks control verse post Kendricks control first infuse this vitriolic to the echoes of the bowels of this floating metal a reference that drives the song though is Lupe Fiasco's all black everything Fiasco song imagines what the world would look like if the transatlantic slave trade had never happened clipping song is amused on the inverse of this a world where the slave trade is happening once more throughout all black the mothership ai's opinions of 2 3 3 1 change in the beginning their spiteful of 2 3 3 1 but in the end they've sympathized with him and they end up falling in love with the former slave and threatening his pursuers warning mothership reporting if you continue to pursue will be no choice but to destroy you morning mothership reporting this love will be defended at all costs do not [ __ ] with it all black didn't we get an interlude where we here two three three one freestyle rapping to himself not an impression to be from you trade on the trailer so we've got you and blew up the window makisi word on the radio on special thing the song shows off how the production of William Hudson and Jonathan Steitz are essential to the narrative using white noise echoes clicks and beats the producers create a clearer image of the vastness of space and the cold empty metal of the ship the production isn't just part of the music it's an essential part of the storytelling in splendor and misery it depicts the scenery and creates the atmosphere that make the narrative feel that much closer that much stronger it helps the listener sympathize with two three three one situation it puts us alone and cold moving through the void finally having escaped his pursuers two three three one realizes that he needs to go into a hyper sleep if he wants to survive we see these realizations through the eyes of the computer on wakeup the computer lays forth the grim reality the chances that two three three one will ever reach another world are slim to none the chance that he ever reaches any place suitable to support life in his lifetime ever seeing anybody that he knows we've been over always making up nevertheless he puts himself under the watch of the computer as he sleeps and dreams of an idyllic life on earth as he travels we get another slave song singing of the long lonesome journey this is the journey through space but it was also the journey through the Underground Railroad hidden pathways in a dark night leading to an unknown destination one of the key themes that splendor and misery shows in its music is the concept of inherited trauma the idea that atrocities like slavery can have far-reaching impact spanning generations in this sense the slave songs of centuries ago are echoing through the story of two 3:31 this experience is in his blood at the end of the interlude we get a scrambled radio signal sending a coded message and then we hit the middle of the album in true believer this song could be the subject of a video all on its own it tells the story of a sprawling and vast mythology drawing on Central African lore in NK jemisin z-- the inheritance trilogy he vomited the Sun which tried the water leaving land and soon after came moon and stars and Adam and this seems to be the mythology of the slaves in the story or a mythology that to 331 is creating in asleep and then it draws this mythology together with the history of this world it tells of man's space exploration colonization and finally of the new version of Sethos race to define his ways of being back in hands of time inside other bodies levator fell into the one thing in the universe no one held this new version speaks of slavery in terms of time the duration of human lives being traded as a resource this is a discussion that goes hand-in-hand with two three three one who is currently in a long cryo sleep through hyperspace the thread of slavery is musically woven through this song to its hook is an interpolation of the slave song I know when I'm going home [Music] just as clipping recontextualized slave songs into a sci-fi context they also take a sci-fi spin on another kind of black resistance music gangster rap error mount reads like a sci-fi interpretation of that genre peppering the lyrics with references to sci-fi greats like Ursula Ludwig Octavia Butler and Samuel d'Alene anybody plug and get it and Amanda [ __ ] got a problem better hit them on the answer book ain't nobody playing just because they fly here you could trip sets real players trip write the first verse opens with the line we who are about to the title of a sci-fi novel by Joanna Russ that novel takes the form of an audio diary kept by a woman abandoned on an alien planet Russ's protagonist initially has other survivors with her but she's forced to kill them when they try to rape her the rest of the novel is the protagonist philosophizing on her life and trying to survive in the cold of space a clear influence on the direction of splendor and misery and just as Russ's protagonist reflects on her situation so too does two three three one in the album's third interview [Music] we hiccup in between eventually the desperation of our protagonist situation starts to get to him we hear this in the ominous break the glass two three three one is in a state of emergency and losing his sanity he's trying to call out to a computer that seems to have helped him but only as a silent observer as he loses grip on his sanity he decides to start breaking the computer monitors to try to wake it up in the penultimate song baby don't sleep two three three one goes into a series of random jumps and sleeps desperately searching the universe for life finally the AI wakes up telling to 331 that he needs to formulate a clear plan if he's gonna have any hope of surviving but you gotta make a choice of where you're going because thinking it's the render of instance you might be the last not enough to get this [ __ ] together loverboy stopped looking at the clock in the final song a better place two three three one execute the ai's plan his last hope he's gonna put himself into another cryo sleep and tell the AI to jump through space until they find a civilization he can return to the AI must stand witness to this alone like two three three one was once and two three three one must go into a sleep that he's not certain will ever come to remain in the whole ship maybe get this time bound conscience that keeps him out pushing for nothing with only the hope of a vibe is belief that there was place to be body else it's a tragic ending but it still has a shred of hope for a better future splendor and misery is a unique story and it does what sci-fi does best it pulls from the present and past to paint a picture of the future and to ask questions about what it means to be a human what it means to exist in the world we live in now and what it will mean to exist in the future world to come if you ever find yourself alone on Wix know that I sent you and to show your support for my channel [Music]
