it off today just picking fur off the camera mom and I just about to walk to a big Tesco get some food and then mum's going home she's actually been at mine for the last few days look at this little special boy enjoying the sunshine is it lovely to be war [Music] hello I can't shake the simplest even beyond go we stand on the opposite show hello Irish to mysterious ceilings my home I look for the things I don't know [Music] [Music] all in this high standard show me where the dingoes mornin's harness sleeping I should be the last all ended hostage [Music] the last good morning everybody I have singing today I need to find some more classical music so I'm gonna go through my draw which is here this is my drawer full of music and I need to find something a little bit more classical because I've decided I don't want to sing musical theater aren't missing in lessons right now I want to sing something a little bit more difficult I have so many German songs I used to love singing in German I don't think I ever did this one though I don't remember this that was so much easier than I thought it would be they were pretty much just in the first pile that I came to so I've got Oh mio babbino Caro and then I'm also taken a speak softly love which is a theme from The Godfather I don't know this in English and they were in Italian so I'm just gonna ask if my singing teacher can play the music and I will sing this so I'm also going to take greenfinch and Linnet bird from Sweeney togs this one is really really hard to sing and it used to be my audition song so I want to get this like good again there we go those are my three for today I'm a little bit miffed because I spent literally the last hour trying to make a pizza pizza and it's just not nice at all I've got the other half in here still but now I don't have time to eat anything before singing me I'm gonna go to singing now and then I'm gonna go on a walk curse I know when you're done my 10 K steps I don't need to do them [Music] [Applause] see [Music] [Music] [Music] I've just sawed my fridge out and I feel like I need to show you it's actually so tidy so I've got my meats at the bottom with Nelly's tuna and some hummus and Philadelphia and stuff like that and on this row I've just got my vegetables in here I haven't got throwing money right now and some strawberries and grapes and watermelon then this row is like my sweet stuff so I've got jelly yogurt and these little chocolate pots which are so nice I love them this row has got drinks so I've just got cokes and milk and then up here I've got my naughty stuff I put it up here because I'm quite sure this is my eye level when I look in the fridge so hopefully I just won't look up there and if also sort of my sources out how exciting is that can you tell this is my favorite thing I have it on salmon and I can't find it a lot of the time so I just bought three we just make myself a nice little bacon sandwich for breakfast I'm gonna sit and watch something on YouTube and then I want to sort my bowls and plates out over here look at that I've got so many of them and I just want them all sorted out I'm gonna give some away and yeah keep the ones that I really like for an afternoon okay I've emptied these now I put everything on this table so I know that I'm gonna keep these these are like my favorite dishes they were from Marks and Spencers but the only annoying thing is I only have three of these bowls because one of them broke which is actually really sad and then my mom wants these she's redoing her kitchen at the minute and she just has a mishmash of like 15 year old bowls and stuff so I'm giving her these ones these are from Sainsbury's and also with the matching bowls I love them they're like spotty on the outside then I've got these little balls which I want to keep they're the perfect perfect snack balls they were actually from ASA then I have these ones which I bought really recently B is a good for my what I eat in a day video is for like taking pictures off because they're all different and they're all different inside as well so I'm gonna keep these and then I've got these plates which I've had for so long I literally got bought when I was like 11 something like that and I love them but I think I'm gonna say goodbye to them we will see so those are all the dishes that I'm keeping is this the most boring segment of life I just thought we'd sort them out I am gonna keep my little spotty plates for now I do actually have these dishes and these ones as well which are for Nellie's foods and now I can pick them yay hello everybody I am shock horror on my way to edit in Starbucks it's Saturday I don't have any plans this Saturday so that is literally what I'm gonna do because I have work to do but I packed myself a little container with watermelon and honeydew melon in and I've just actually made myself kind of a cheese toastie with the Warburton's then and some cheese and I'm just waiting for it to cool down I don't mind like cold cheese toasties just waiting for that to cool down and then I'm gonna take it grab a drink have my lunch do some work welcome to my exciting life are you scratching my sofa that I've told you 25 times not to scratch look at him he gives no poos he's just carrying on so I would show you what I actually take in my bike with me he's so little what's in my bag I've just got my laptop my thing that connects my memory cards to my laptop and my lip balm and then in this pouch which was from glossier I just keep my portable charger for my phone so I actually do vlog a lot on my phone now so I always have this with me then I keep some tissues my headphones and these are the ones that I can make normal and iPhone knee if you know what I mean because my laptop has a normal one well my iPhone has this one then I've just got my purse that I got from Primark and I've got the Lulu Guinness mirror on it and then obviously I'm gonna take my melon I'm a cheese toastie and that is everything that I'm gonna take with me and I use this bag when I go and edit it's just a long shot or just an old black one it's really good I also usually take a reusable bag with me just in case I buy anything and I'm actually gonna go and look for some more watermelon pots from Tesco so I'm going to take as well and there we go everything fits perfectly in this handbag I love it and I've got my little cheese toastie now [Music] [Applause] [Music] where do I start [Music] that was an absolute fail of the Starbucks trip it was literally it so busy and there's nothing more awkward than editing your face on a video when people can see here there's like three seats that I like to sit in that face the wall but they were all taken so that's cut it short and I'm coming home Scott since Berman I'm ABC I am the worst in my [Music] you know I just got my tea I'm having salmon oh good morning everybody today's a big filming day for me it's actually a Sunday so I've just washed my hair I'm just about to dry it it's past 11:00 I was meant to be filming by now but I didn't happen I'll be back when I look different to this hello I am back I filmed one video now I have two to go but it's okay cuz I'm actually really enjoying filming today some days I have days where I'm like me don't want to film but today I'm enjoying it which is always nice just importing this footage though to check that it's all okay I don't want to film like three videos and be out with focus yeah which means that I'm now okay to film my next video let's go and I am back in the room I've done all my filming now I'm actually so chuffed I've got everything done that I wanted to get done but now I actually have to edit a video for today so I'm literally just gonna sit down edit I really want to go out it's 2 p.m. oh did I tell you I've changed the strap on my Apple watch to the fancy one yes 2 p.m. I have a food order coming between 8:00 and 9:00 but I really do need to get this video done and I also need to eat lunch and that's going to take half an hour to cook so I think I'm just gonna stay in and do my work I am back it's half past four I've just edited the last of my video and that's gone live because it had to go up today and now I'm gonna go on a daily walk but I'm gonna take my makeup off which is kind of bittersweet I hate going out with makeup on it just feels like a lot on my face I don't know why I think so just rarely wear it when I do have it on I can really tell but if you didn't see my last video it was a big old P o box haul but at the end as she tried on some stuff from what had been sent to me like a little tutorial at the end just to try on the products and stuff kind of a mix between a pure box whole and a first impression video so definitely check that out if you want to good morning everybody Here I am again in this black top my favorite top of all even though it emphasizes my double chain that's alright we've all got him I'm just about to
