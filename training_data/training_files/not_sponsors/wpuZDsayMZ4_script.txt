so go hand world anvil a few minutes of your time now about those mushrooms Mike and Ed's are one of my absolute favorite monsters so far I don't know what it is about a walking sentient mushroom family that makes them so adorable against all odds and the general nature of fungus my kids are the most welcoming and enjoyable company the Underdark has to offer no one knows where the heck they came from or why they're so nice but I'm gonna assume the demon queen of mushroom trips accidentally pooped them out or maybe had no effect and it's just a coincidence they have these neat little social groups called colonies which isn't even really a social group at the top of the colony is a sovereign a really old and slightly rotten mushroom as in it's made of several other new types of mushrooms or fungus growing on its fungus anyways this big-ass mushroom the size of a horse brings its brothers and sisters together and they all get high as these little clans that make up a colony are called circles which is like 20 cute mushroom dudes being one of the few plants to grow their own arms and legs they've opened up a new world of possibilities to explore like [Music] walk around the book says that they work but what grueling task does a mushroom have to tend to maybe gathering compost ok so groups of 20 Micah needs hobble around the Underdark looking for poop or dead things to stand in while they eat and then promptly return to their home cave to get absolutely up on spores their main hobby which I assume is what they do 80% of the time is called melding melding is the sole reason for these mushroom men to exist and is what they see is ascending into a higher way of living in order to meld each circle of mica needs or the entire colony gathers around each other then they ask blast the chamber until you can't breathe anything but their own spores what wait do they just nut all over each other all the time that's gross man one cool thing about my canids is they produce a variety of spores a variation that grows with age the little sprout babies who move the most adorable distance of 10 feet around learn the type of spores needed to meld repor spores rapport if you didn't know is the secret to a perfect marriage it's like the paragon of relationships and entails harmonious communication and understanding they also come equipped with distressed spores little fart clouds that scream in agony to all other local shrooms if they get hurt Mike and Ed's can feel the pain of every stuffed or sauteed mushroom you've ever eaten also they can kind of punch you like in Dark Souls older Micah needs learn how to create paralyzing spores which are good for avoiding a fight with any of the Underdark denizens oh yeah they also detest violence what kind of creature that lives in one of the most perilous regions in any realm and grows off the death of others is a lawful neutral pacifist they're so baked off their own spores if you aren't an to them they'll extend a generous hand and play host or guide to you and your party I I need friends like mushrooms the great old fungus has two more unique spores one that makes their melding even more awesome and and one that raises corpses as eternal half mushroom slaves these walking talking table fungus can guides are extremely environmentally conscious believe it or not they'll never overpopulate and keep their numbers and clicks very very tight they'll only use spore slaves to guard and protect themselves only eat naturally killed bodies and only smoke their own homegrown ganja the unique spores their sovereigns bring to the table adds a hallucinogenic angle to their meld sessions instead of communicating as a unified collective the mind-altering effects allow them to enter a sort of dream state this is where the colonies sit entranced by massive amounts of plant jizz in the air reaching the ultimate oneness this is what they all work toward this comfortable state of Ascension is what they believe to be their ultimate goal as a species to be safe be together and to think not as individuals but as a network of their combined hopes and dreams because that's basically what mushroom people do [Music] you
