[Applause] [Music] this video is brought to you by curiosity stream and has spoilers for the run of the office it feels a little weird to start a video about an episode of TV I love with something negative but I'm gonna do it anyway I think most can agree that the u.s. version of The Office didn't exactly go out on top it really limped along after the departure of its star Steve Carell the show eventually transformed into a more cartoonish and less funny version of itself not exactly new for long-running sitcoms but it was still pretty depressing to watch especially when sitting through subplots like Pam almost having an affair with a cameraman remember that that was actually a thing I promised to me the last season of The Office that had the energy and high highs of the early years was season four now it's not perfect it has some episodes that are an hour long because NBC just wanted to fill a bigger timeslot which resulted in some over long episodes but when it clicked it really really worked giving us my favorite back-to-back episode to the show the deposition and of course dinner party and that's what I'm gonna try to dig into today what this classic episode does well and why even after all these years I still put it among some of the best half hours of TV ever made one of the smartest things about dinner party is the way that it builds on the episode before it I think it's safe to say that without the deposition the episode could have come off is too broad and over-the-top even for Michael and Jan but we find them at a very specific point in their relationship in the deposition Michael is hilariously back into a corner where he's put in the crossfire of Jan's lawsuit against under Mifflin and both sides humiliate him but Jan using his journal for evidence without him knowing is a bridge too far and he ends up siding against her but they're still together and from the end of that episode it's pretty clear they're not even gonna talk about it they're just gonna let all that anger and resentment it and stew which is just about the best possible set up for dinner party hanging out with Michael and Jan under normal circumstances would probably be awkward but now all of that is turned up to 11 with every old argument and embarrassing disagreement coming to the surface like David Brent before him one of the things that makes Michael Scott so funny and uncomfortable is the fact that there's this huge gulf between what he tries to convince us and himself his life is like and what it actually is he wants us to think everyone loves him he's the most funny boss around and he's actually really good at basketball but he's just having an off day when the cameras are around at least his entire life is kind of defined by trying to sell us the version of his life that he wishes he had and that definitely goes for his relationship with Jan the episode begins with Michael pretending everyone has to work late just to make sure Pam and Jim aren't able to find an excuse to get out of his party which is a very Michael Scott move deep down he knows his guests don't want to be there but if he has a chance to pretend that Jim and Pam are his close friends for a bit he's gonna try to make that happen but let's get to what I really think makes this episode so great and it has to do with horror author HP Lovecraft what was that okay only sort of let me explain the best part of my favorite Lovecraft stories is when we see that the horrors of the universe are so much bigger than we realized entire vistas of the unknown open up to the main character as they begin to see they're only scratching the surface of something terrible that they cannot begin to understand and if you're sitting there going is this guy really about to compare Michael and James relationship to Lovecraftian horror the answer is yes I absolutely am which genius about dinner party is we only get small glimpses of how dysfunctional Michael and Jan are there's just so many details big and small packed in here from the fact that they clearly had a fight over whether Michael could keep his dundies to seem that Michael has to sleep on a tiny bench below Jan's despite the fact that they have a whole room going unused it just gets worse and worse as Jim and Pam are there to slowly witness the unraveling of just how deep these issues go if that's not love craft story structure I don't know what is I probably don't have to talk about how great Steve Carell is in this episode that's obvious but I also wanted to highlight Melora hardens performance as Jan because I think this is probably your best episode Jan's character arc is a minor one in the grand scheme of the show but it's a surprisingly well-executed one when we first meet her she's purely there as a foil for Carell to bounce off of the generic no-nonsense corporate businessperson but starting in midseason - the show really starts to crack that facade showing us a character who's barely holding things together going through a messy divorce and who obviously has a ton of issue she's trying to shove deep down and just not acknowledge at all which kind of makes her the perfect awful match for Michael like most the rest of the cast Jan would slowly get more cartoonish and two-dimensional over the years but I actually don't think that's the case in dinner party she doesn't says some very over-the-top stuff here but it all feels in service of the character not just a cheap gag I don't think later seasons of the office would have included this moment at the end where Jan tries and fails to glue the dundie she threw back together it's a funny humanizing moment and more than a little sad which is always where the office operated best in those early years there are so many stray lines in this episode that I laugh about to this day maybe the biggest one is and then when you said you definitely didn't want our kids it just suggests so much about what Michael's life has been outside of the office just really bleak and hilarious at the same time Dwight and Andy are two characters who i tire of pretty easily and i think they take over the show in a pretty bad way later on but they're both used well here Andy is mostly just playing the straight man to Angela who takes every opportunity she has to snipe at Pam and Dwight saying that his relationship with his childhood babysitter is purely carnal we'll never not make me laugh maybe even better than that though is the way that Pam is used in Jan and Michael's uncomfortable psychosexual mind games Jen is always using her relationship with her old assistant hunter to make Michael jealous and again I have to applaud Harden here because her awkward dancing is just incredibly uncomfortable it makes you want to hide under the couch but it's clear that Michael has been doing the exact same thing using Pam to make Jan mad the difference obviously is that Michael never actually slept with Pam and the scene where Jan calls Angela and Pam into the kitchen and Angela immediately tries to throw her under the bus is more subtle than some of the big blowout arguments but probably even more uncomfortable I've always loved well-done cringe comedy those early seasons can be really hard to watch in a good way the show would kind of lose that edge eventually but dinner party is definitely a great example of it almost every moment in this episode has Jim and Pam stepping farther and farther into these awful situations from Michael pitching Jim on investing in Jan's candle business or Jam letting Pam know the food will be ready in about three hours I really do think that cringe comedy taps into that same part of us that enjoys horror movies in this episode maybe the show's best example of that it's a train wreck you can't look away from and ultimately I kind of wish the office ended here don't get me wrong there's a decent chunk of episodes after this that I really like I mean chair model is literally the next episode and I think that's another highlight of the season but this montage at the end is great like this is how I wish the show went out not with everyone's lives becoming amazing Michael becoming this like Zen guy who has everything figured out Jim moving into this like really cool job that always felt like too much to me the heart of the show I think was always watching these characters just try to get through the day working this boring job and putting up with all the small and dignities of work but also taking the moments of happiness and connection where they can find them it's exactly what this final montage is these aren't big moments and they're definitely not the kind of syrupy sweet everything turns out great scenes that the show actually ended with but they feel true to these characters in a way that those didn't and I think they put the perfect cap on the best episode the show ever did oh by the way one of my favorite goofy little character details the show Dead was giving Dwight a 1987 Pontiac Firebird which is objectively the most white car on earth if your you'll find a link to in the description and pend comment below join one because there's a big adventure ahead the thing to do now is to get started because we're going to have not only barrels of fun but loads are free gifts and prizes too
