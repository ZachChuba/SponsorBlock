please seek help at your country's helpline I'll babka that my dude sometimes Russ can be a frustrating game and out in the field of a combat one side of the fight is always going to be frustrated look at this prime example oh my god these guys are [ __ ] loaded [Music] sorry [ __ ] over there I'm sorry yes there's so many how many wonder they try so one in front of you one to your right and then those ones in my left yep sent back to the base like little kids sent to their room for being little shits only when we go back there were people outside you see it like [ __ ] three times we loaded got him you just he said I didn't try to kill him I killed him after this we decided it was time to go for a fly the first person we saw was a neighbor now these guys are kind of like a side story I don't know if I was recording at the time or not but they came over and told us not to sleep because they were going to offline Raiders but that's a bit further down the track but I could believe it they were offline reading everyone in the area was satchels so any our base was relatively safe by their high walls but the threat was said so we took delight in fighting them oh you go I got in I don't my life is over on it well it's not Charlie boy should I Oh yeah let's go first love our home this was a rental okay we're gonna have a look at this compound be on your toes I'm getting
