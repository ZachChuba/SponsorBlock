everybody knows that robots don't feel pain well except for Roombas so in order to sidestep a little bit of that old existential dread we're gonna be making some deaf music like a bunch of punks first thing you need is a roland tr-909 drum machine these can usually be found in the trash but don't be fooled one man's trash is another man's revolutionary techno and house rhythm sound great so now to program your drum make sure you pick a tempo between 117 and 130 bpm hit your base on every beat hit your claps on every second beat and hit your hi-hats on every sixteenth beat now your claps then set up the hi-hats what's going oh la abut that's fine great now just play your whole bean you've got it you've got yourself a whole thing great so you have your drums now let's figure out the key in the chord progression generally Daft Punk likes to have a major good time also they generally like to follow this chord progression two four six and five for the bass all you need to do is follow the root note of each chord and you've got yourself a Daft Punk hit single [Music] you know switch them around so you don't exactly copy everything [Music] great that's your baseline now we need to find a disco or a funk record between the ages of 1969 and 1989 once you've got your Hall you want to pick a sample that's funky but not too funky because we don't want to make the toes curl we want to make the feet whirl go ahead pop once you find the one sample chop it date it warp it kiss it shift it loop and play it next bust out your old prophet five and plug it into a source of meaning there we go and ask it what the meaning of life is you know while twisting its knobs prophet five what what's the meaning of life great now play the melody and repeat it at different parts of the scale some people call this lazy others call it ostinato then if you're doing it right should ah there it is yeah that's a good stuff right there cool now put all your sounds together [Music] see this is nice and all but just like your life it's still missing something though coping is the process of poorly dealing with your emotions and search for meaning mmm where the vocoder so the first thing you need to do is go on a long and contemplative walk where you think about your issues and while your lack of singing skills are making you feel hopeless and insecure then after a healthy amount of self-loathing you decide to commit to a 12-step plan toward self-help so you start drinking more water start going on two minute jogs every Monday you read the power of now your life is dramatically turning out for the better one day you get home tired after a long exhausting day of self meditation you feel a little anxious when you realize that still can't sing everything was going so well and now you feel like you're struggling to cope in this moment of weakness you relapse you go to your place of worship and can't help but help yourself to some good fortune to take the edge off you're in too deep all you can do now is voco [Music] this moment is crucial because you only have a short amount of time until the fortune wears off so grab your Mike and vocoder plugin and start reciting the lines [Music] and lastly to master the entire mix just add some multiband depression to every channel and you've got yourself a daft dunk check this curiosity stream sponsor signup process so do it [Music]
