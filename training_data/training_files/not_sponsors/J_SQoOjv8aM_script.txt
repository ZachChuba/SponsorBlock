Catering to the lyrics is when your
artist says "yeah I drive a Lambo" and then you literally at the same time they
say that you show them driving a Lambo number one mistake a music video
director can make. A video that I'm most proud of I want to hear about this I just wanna take a sip of water. What's gonna on Indy Mogul my name is Ted today I'm here with my buddy Justin
Jones he's an amazing cinematographer that shot music videos for people like Diplo
Tyga G-Eazy he was also the head of production over at create music group
which reps people like Marshmallow Porter Robinson the Migos as somebody
that has seen like a million music videos that has been a part of a lot of
music videos what are the five biggest mistakes that music video directors make
and they're just starting out but also walk through what does it actually take
to make a great music video in addition to that I actually want to walk through
and watch a couple of the most famous music videos out there and hear from a
music video directors input what actually separates them and what does he
see we're not seeing as well. Ready to do this? Let's get it. Let's do this. Alright
so like what I really like the main kind of categories of music videos that you
see coming out these days? So definitely the narrative. The narrative is the
number one I think what everyone tries to go for. The next one would be
performance started off with like live videos and they didn't see like oh how
can we record this music video to show the artists having a visual that
somebody knows rather than just hearing somebody really adds to their brand. A
person actually playing it and singing the song. So next I would say would be
experimental, right? The artist doesn't have to be in it at all
it could be animation it could be imagery put together to invade emotion
but it doesn't necessarily have to make sense but it has to have a creative
concept behind it it's like in any film right you're setting up the world when
as long as people get the rules that you show them yeah then you can do whatever
you want. So this could be more just like visual montage stuff basically all music
videos fall in really these types of three categories. These three
categories or mix of them so now we're getting really deep into it so a mix of
these music videos would be a narrative performance video right which is 90% of
videos I think a guy's in a warehouse he's got a gun this and that right he's
like doing a bank robbery cut to the big atrium of the bank beautiful lighting
performance shot with him performing in there cut back to the bank robbery it's
really just keeping the audience engaged right it's giving it more content and more umph. You've shot too many of these videos. A lot of hip hop videos. I think the things that are
overused and it gets tiring: falling asleep the music video happens and then
waking up at the end time and time again a director will say alright but we got
to remember to shoot at the end the guy wakes up and it was all a dream that way
everything makes sense right? I mean I think it's just a easy in and an easy
out to a video right so if someone messes up on anything it's like well
we'll just have him wake up and that was that it didn't make sense but it's okay
cuz it was a dream first time it was done cool second third time okay but now
it's like years later right a bunch of other kind of cliches are like well I
shoot a lot of rap videos so strip clubs, Lambos, house parties, it's just all these
things that are continuously used over and over and over again it's like you
got these really talented directors and artists coming out with this content
that has none of that involved and they're the ones you're seeing kind of
rise to the top. Another one that's actually very recent and new would be
the whole shooting your video it doesn't look that great but we're gonna spice it
up in post we're gonna add a ton of effects alright we've watched some
YouTube tutorials you know now we're gonna make this video insane right yeah
so it's cut up like crazy like crazy cuts now another one is kind of like
tracing lines right like so you're animating lines onto the footage and the
line can like trace somebody a guy named Ruff Mercy started that his work is
amazing but now people are taking it and they're not taking the time like he does
to actually master the craft they're just like learning it on YouTube and
applying it so it's like these single frame animations go on their footage and
it looks like crap. This kind of stuff yes this kind of stuff is so popular in
advertising right now popular right now. And so Ruff Mercy is kind of like the-- guy that
invented-- the guy that invented it he did this and now everybody you know
some guys like oh I know how to do this let's make a tutorial on it right so I
think that's like another really bad effect that everybody's copying and no
one's taking the time to do right and if you decide to do that before you shoot
yeah then it's a creative idea right yeah if you go after your shoot and
you're like oh man it doesn't look that great what can we add to it yeah that's
another thing that's just really kind of destroying these videos yeah but then
another one would be adding in all these taking a free
scaling that frame down I've been seeing that a lot and the other like
do-do-do-do-do all right-- no it's like I think final cut
one-- had that as like a reset transition it's like no. I guess my question is
really when you see this many videos like what separates the ones that take
off and are like seems like art? I think it really starts with being an innovator
finding a new way to show something yeah is really refreshing right so if you're
making a video and you're like oh I seen all these ideas I'm gonna do that idea
yeah your video is not gonna pop as much as wow that idea is cool but what if I
mix it with that idea and then add this camper movement and then I make
something unique that when I show people they're gonna be like I've never seen
that before right it's like the first video to put
quasars in the background I'm afraid yeah no seriously
I use a stare a tube a lot so I am guilty of this but use them in a new way
right so now I'm doing stuff where I'm lining like hallways to where it looks
like a spaceship right and the lights are flashing at me instead of just
having them straight up in the background right yeah look some of these
videos that we're watching obviously you know we're not asking you to make a
Taylor Swift video or some write full team those have the money to be able to
polish and do a proper really polish it for hours and hours and hours to make
that yeah there are tons of videos up ready but how do you know when this is
going to be a solid video and this is not going to be a slaught video you're
not even talking about the video the way that the treatment is laid out if you
get a treatment from someone and it's like made in Microsoft Word or
PowerPoint and it like it looks like the idea is gonna be and it's gonna come out
like then again I get a treatment from a guy that I work with every treatment he
gives me he puts so much time in because it means that much to him right because
then it's like a slippery slope because you get that and then you start reading
into it and all of a sudden it's a pretty starts with a guy falling asleep
on his couch in terms of music videos where it's something that's so intensely
visual and it's so about like one concept for a short period of time yeah
it's like you better make sure that concept is fresh because if it's been
done before then the video is officially already old you've officially just
started in aged videos well let's watch oh let's watch a couple videos what are
like the takeaways from HP and what are you seeing here all right all right
okay let's do this here we go now before to the video oh yeah this is a classic
so Dave Myers is a director he shot a ton of Kendrick videos consistently just
solid on all levels this church with this big light beaming through it I've
never seen that and I when I first saw this image that it like burned into my
skull I got goosebumps looking at that that is an incredible image so all of
his videos have like these tiny little vignettes some dudes hairs on fire or
like he's using motion control to go from one thing to another thing and so
here so they took three cameras when I'm right next to each other same exact lens
mm-hmm and then they focused them all exactly with him centered you know and
then they're cutting back and forth and every other frame so I just got a new
camera it's called an ashika yeah and it has four lenses and then in post you
just do one on top of another on top of another on top of another yeah and then
you just make a gif out of it it's really cool yeah how does that like a
really cheap way to know that the cameras like $200 and you can literally
make this effect another thing you really don't want to do in music videos
is cater to the lyrics but I feel like he does it in a tasteful way right yeah
it's only like on one or two things catering to the lyrics is when your
artist says yeah I Drive a Lambo and then you literally at the same time they
say that you show them driving a Lambo number one mistake a music video
director can make it's like listen to the come on there's metaphor like think
of some kind of metaphor to explain that rather than just showing that but he's
talking about Grey Poupon this day Grey Poupon the AV
yeah so it's like get throw it in there it's funny yeah oh yeah I love this
frame because this to me is such a great example of you don't need huge gear huge
budgets to make something visually amazing right you can make this effect
happen with like four people some of the most iconic shots and these shots that
like burn into your eyes not super expensive no you know they didn't have
to be for the und you guys cuz they're new there's something that no one's seen
before and that is really captivating ya know that's good so what is this video
that we're talking about so this is from the same directors hardcore Henry so
hardcore Henry and his other film were shot on GoPros this one he I read an
article he wanted it to be way more cinematic obviously less like Distortion
so they used the codex action cam but strictly speaking the camera is not the
most high quality fast image rendering no needs period out there this is not
reliant on the camera that they're absolutely not it's reliant on like four
major things right first off how will the stories put together right this
entire video is shot like a one-take yeah right so already you're like as a
filmmaker are drawn into it it's got visual effects yeah it's got car chases
explosions yeah so for you that's the thing that stands out the most is really
just that one that's something you haven't seen before right and two how
much time does somebody spend on seriously this okay now this is an
example of money of an expensive very expensive video you should always strive
to make something that you can't because you might fall flat but you're gonna
learn way more than if you stayed in your lane what I'm saying is that don't
try to copy something if you aren't sure that you can surpass it in the like
greatness of it that goes back to what we were saying right you copy this
they're gonna be like oh well that's far as possible arm that's a knockoff but
you know it's different if I think you know you're but then you won't take
you're gonna do like a space heist or something you really think you have
something you can add to this style he looks at himself in the mirror at the
end and there's no it's like all right moving on this video
Turner what nice how do you know it immediately
cuz I've seen it a million trillion times and it's very inspiring back when
I was in film school they're showing this video as far as like experimental
it's a totally experimental narrative music video there's a version of this
music video that just sucks and this is its far surpasses yeah exactly what the
lyrics are about you know that this entire video was shot in one room what
so they just kept shooting hence redressing the room you kidding me oh my
gosh so boom same room if you just pause it
like you can find little like that door right there that or that yeah put a
thing over it yeah and then this is real this is just like what's the wildest
shit we can do to make people go what did I just watch right you think there
is a component there there's a completely there's a component in making
music videos in the digital age there's something to be said about WTF yes WTF
we'll stick in your mind for years and years to come
any okay go video those videos are like performance and experimental and
experimental and I think those kind of videos are an excellent way to do
something and they'll stick around for a long time and maintain their validity
right because this to this day this video can hold up with any video that's
when you as like a director or DP or someone actually start to pop you got to
step out of your comfort zone before you start to move forward if you stay where
you're comfortable or you stay where the company is comfortable then you stay at
that level pitch concepts that make people say WTF right so one of the
things you can do is you can shoot like a test sample have you ever done that
like shot a test sample of a visual thing oh yeah it depends on how much
time you have for your pitch but if there's this idea and you're like this
is the idea that needs to be for this video no do it for Dave Myers exist for
example right mm-hmm how are you gonna tell somebody about
that that weird trippy like just to do effect and that's also gonna help you
out figuring out if you can actually do it a lot of times I have an idea I'm
like cool I get to send I'm like oh wait maybe it's not gonna work out like then
you're screwed yeah actually never seen this one does this Barry a friend so
this one's directed by you Michael Chavez they built this rig where they
can mount the camera and her to an apparatus that spins from aluminum at
the same time right oh that is a visual that's not I'm
saying raisi visual build build images like that like that I can't that
that doesn't leave my head is there a way in which you can compose music
videos where you think about it visual by visual but you got to think of it as
like there's five points in this video that are gonna hit heart this is one
when she starts spinning that's another so create an image storyboard it draw it
out you know if a music video is composed of three to five three to eight
different sets and different looks at least each of those looks will have like
one killer visual yes that the set is organized around yes and I think that's
something that separates the amateur stuff the inter stuff is just like it's
all this kind of like blah they don't think about like pulling back and
showing this as its own standalone image and yeah this is the cases the rig yes
so this is the shot that we're waiting to see which is crazy yes
how can you blow someone's mind can we put a mind-blowing emoji right here all
right what is this video Oh Taylor Swift if you if anyone out there has any beef
you gotta respect some one thing that's at play the game in terms of just being
known by everyone and being she's literally the rockefellers she gets
together with Joseph Kahn Joe Kahn is probably one of the biggest names in the
game right now just killing it t did this video they actually will do a full
previous of the entire movie so literally Teleca be sitting there
watching the entire video before the end then she could be like no I think this
should be different before the shooting yeah that's so smart I wish everyone can
do that speaking of that cinema 4d is an incredible tool basically a previous
tool that I use to light my scenes before it actually gets a set location
scout go into cinema 4d build the set just how it looks same measurements and
everything working with matt worth any designer any designer he has all the
lights in there from like Asteras to sky panels you could put the light in you
can shine it through your window you could see what beams it's gonna make you
can see where it's gonna hit but you're saying that you never do a video now
with up revisiting it absolutely if if I have time when is this video you told me
inaudible oh wow does it keep going oh wow they
made them big holy crap this is an actual set that gets smaller and smaller
as it goes down way towards life-size and then goes down so this is not pasta
this is not running this is a bunch of look-alikes that's awesome oh he woke up
at the ah nevermind I don't care who it is now
this is an awesome video do you talkative how it's pretty close that was
rigged that's alright okay so here's here's a video I really like it's an
artist called Rufus due to soul song called say a prayer well they start off
slowly releasing new information right which is really cool because keeping you
engaged but they have lasers and so they strap these lasers in different
positions in the forest and created these like shafts of light in the forest
so it's like a mystical so these are sharpies these are lights like you would
see on stage they're pretty expensive and they have to come with an operator
and they're like they're very strict about your talent because if your talent
looks at them they'll blind you I mean you can you can get them in like you can
use lasers you can use my smarty store lasers will work they I mean they're not
obviously gonna work the same but it's what you do with them really all right
how many you have I did a video for Veronica Vega featuring quavo this
inspired me to do that video so there's these really cool art pieces that kind
of surround quavo stage then they made him I had a 900 watt laser on the left a
900 watt laser on the right and the cool thing about them coming with an operator
is I was able to dial it in see the set box on the right hand side mm-hmm I was
able to dial it in so the laser just spun around that and kind of outlined
that box and then you sync your frame rate to the lasers yeah you can actually
I didn't do it here because we wanted some movement with it but you can
actually make the lasers freeze in midair so like this right here I could
just keep it like that instead of it moving he has a little frequency thing
on the laser control yeah where as I was watching the monitor he's like bringing
it down and lasers going through faster and then slowed down and I was like
right there what something that's just starting to get popular right you've
seen recently first one would be probably the lasers right and so lasers
are really coming into fruition a lot of live performances are using it and I
think it's carrying over into the music video world and then the second thing
would be I think lens effects so lens effects are an extremely easy way to get
an image in camera right basically you screw on filters then I have effects
already tilt in right so you can just screw it on your lens it's a
kaleidoscope effect I use it in the trippy red video yeah and I like that a
lot because no one image is gonna be the same exact look it's a way to add visual
character without actually having to do the exact same effect that somebody else
did that's it yeah as a filmmaker it can be really
taxing on like your pride when you spend all this time in pre-production and you
make this incredible image and it gets 2,000 views on YouTube
that's gonna happen but that's also okay because you're building your real and
your these images at the end of the day the number of eyeballs on the video huge
portion of it is the artist and a popular song absolutely and as much as
it sucks like you just gotta power through that kind of thing next to me
we'll still showcases you as a filmmaker right so it's not like oh this artist
isn't big let's not try as hard kill it on everything build that real get up to
the bigger artists then you get the numbers you shot this for example I shot
this video Joe Joe sea-washed she's amazing she's really cool the videos
whatever right it was not really much direction other than this girl's like at
school and there's like this shy girl and these bullies and she kind of saves
the bully or saves the shy girl from the bullies but it got seven hundred million
views like yes I should have not taken a day rate on this video and just said
give me like a point five percent of the YouTube revenue but you never know this
some of those things like it also led me to three more videos for her right yeah
never underestimate the power of an audience that's not you
yep you should put that on a on a poster or something the video I'm most proud of
is the mamacita video mm-hmm for Tyga differing yg Tyga actually rode my
Harley in the video we also crashed it Tyga gets to this place meets up with
this girl Danny Trejo comes in I guess it's her ex-husband or something a brawl
breaks out Danny Trejo gets a chair snapped over his back funny story Danny
Trejo actually told me how to shoot a couple shots in here cuz I was gonna
shoot him a different way and then I was thinking about it and he's like no you
want the camera here I was like hold on hold on it's like no shut up you want
the camera here literally I bowed down to him and I said you know what you were
completely right this guy gets thrown over the bar boom
so another story the diopters I called for never showed up so we had to send a
runner to like a Walgreens to get a magnifying glass and the only way that I
could get those shots of him playing is if we sent somebody to go
get a magnifying glass and tape it to the lens you're kidding me dun dun dun
it worked and I went to me good I want free trial get started on your stock
