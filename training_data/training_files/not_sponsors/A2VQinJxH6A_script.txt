lose another password at the link in the episode description there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable youtubers to see if we could become something more okay that's a little dramatic here's the deal when this video goes live we will be less than one week from the release of Avengers endgame which honestly and I'm not trying to be hyperbolic might be the biggest movie ever made no other franchise has been able to do this string together 20-plus movies almost all somewhere between good and great with a nearly completely consistent continuity thanks Sony and end it all with one big extravagant largely secret bang so I wanted to take a look back at the Marvel Universe examine interesting moments choices and talk about what made this decade-long cinematic universe special and to do that I have assembled a group of some of the most remarkable video essayists I know each of them chose one scene to talk about and we are all releasing our videos at the same time we're calling this series 1 marvelous scene so when you're done with this video watch the others there in the playlist at the end of the video and in the episode description enough said so when the history books get written about the Marvel Universe this image will be on the cover and I get why it blew my mind when they spoiled it in the Superbowl trailer like a bunch of jabronis however it is not my favorite scene in the MCU I love the after-party about 25 minutes into Avengers age of Ultron the big six Avengers and a few friends all sit down and talk and i 100% believe it is not only the most fun scene in any of these movies but this scene does the best job of exemplifying everything that's great about the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I want to break this down into three parts three reasons why the after-party is one marvelous scene starting with the characters listen I'm not gonna spend much time on this I don't need to explain to you why Robert Downey jr. Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Scarlett Johansson Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner are the best versions of these characters that I can imagine 17 billion dollars stills a pretty good story all by itself but I do want to mention two things first people take for granted how many times the Marvel actors have played these characters but the I'm age of Ultron came out Robert Downey jr. had been Iron Man more than Harrison Ford would ever be Han Solo or Pierce Brosnan would be James Bond age of Ultron was Scarlett Johansson's fourth time playing Black Widow meaning at that time she was widowed more times at Tobey Maguire was spider-man Chris Hemsworth had been Thor more times than any individual actor would be Batman there was a stretch where every year for three years a major motion picture was released that starred Chris Evans as Captain America they can do this in their sleep and since they can slip into character so effortlessly the little moments happen on their own these guys have chemistry they genuinely look like they're having fun together which is not easy to do and the second thing I want to mention is that all of these actors deserve enormous amounts of praise but if there is one person to thank for all this it's Sarah Finn Sarah Finn is an absolute mad genius what does Sarah Finn do buckle up Sarah Finn is responsible for casting every single movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe except one want to guess which one bingo you think this guy is the perfect Tony Stark Sarah did you think this kid was the perfect Captain America Sarah did star-lord Zor rocket racoon Bruce Banner Peter Parker Gamora Doctor Strange okay to be fair we all kind of saw dr. strange coming a mile away but low-key to chala Drax we know Bucky Falcon are these the ones you would have picked no but Sarah did she deserves a statue in the middle of Disney World her face needs to be next to stand Kevin and Robert on the marvel Mount Rushmore Seraphin is a national goddamn treasure and every Marvel fan needs to be constantly thanking the Panther God that Sarah is behind the wheel number two writing the after-party is an amazingly well-written scene every action and every line in the scene are used to reveal something important about our characters and it's all focused around one simple question can the individual Avengers lift Thor's hammer which really boils down to are they worthy and how does that make them feel I'm aware that the hammer has called me all near but I'm gonna mess up that pronunciation so let's just go with Thor's hammer from here on out and the answer to that question not only tells us where that Avenger is now but it Telegraph's their journey throughout the rest of the story let's go through them one by one first there's Clint Hawkeye he's skeptical he doesn't believe Thor's hammer works the way Thor says it works doesn't make sense to him it's easy to forget but this was most of these actors third fourth fifth Marvel Cinematic Universe movies but this was only Hawkeye second if you don't count his blink and you miss it cameo at door so even though it's implied that the gang has built a rapport over a long period of time Clint is still the odd man out and Clint tries to lift the hammer fails and goes back to his chair in disbelief he thinks all of this is crazy so where does Clint go from there The Avengers fail misses Hawkeye tells Clint that these gods need a normal guy around to keep them together and then at the climax Clint tells the twins that okay he's flying we're fighting an army of robots and have a bow and arrow none of this makes sense Clint has accepted that the world he's in now is weird and he's going with the flow he finally feels comfortable on the team then Tony makes fun of Clint and Clint challenges Tony to take a shot at the hammer Tony confidently steps up to the hammer makes a joke about prima nocta which still blows my mind and then fails but Tony unlike everyone else in this scene doesn't give up he comes back with an Iron Man gauntlet tries to lift the hammer again then he enlists Rhodey wearing a war machine gauntlet nothing Tony knows he's worthy and he thinks his technology can get him there earlier in the movie Tony saw a vision of a disaster in space and he believes he needs to make more and more advanced robots to fight the army he saw in Avengers when it comes back that belief is what drives Tony need to create Ultron Tony saw an alien weapon and assumed he could program it into submission like the hammer and that's what creates vision which funny enough does end up lifting the hammer so I guess Tony kinda wins Tony does ask Rhodey for help when he's lifting the hammer but only after his tech has failed he'll play on a team but not before trying to solve the problem himself with technology but at the end of the movie Tony stops relying on technology and starts relying on people Jiri learns what the Avengers are all about bringing together a group of remarkable individuals and when Ultron asks how they could possibly hope to stop him Tony responds like the old man said together heart kept of Bruce Banner standing on the table trying to move the hammer it doesn't budge so banner decides to turn the moment into a joke and pretends to Hulk out this frightens Maria Hill and Clint the two people banner has spent the least time with and then the rest of the team laughs banner doesn't care if he's worthy or not in that moment banner just wants to have fun and be a part of the team but the Hulk keeps getting in the way later in South Africa banner is horrified at the destruction that the Hulk caused and then after the team defeats Ultron Hulk takes a Quinjet and flies away he believes he's too much of a monster to live the life he always wanted to so he needs to find a new life then Steve rolls up his sleeves grabs the hammer and it kind of moves which really concerns Thor and even though he gives up it's clear that Steve is objectively more worthy than everyone else at the table besides Thor although to be fair Thor had a 1500 year head start and as the movie progresses Steve is still good maybe too good and it causes friction within the team but at the climax Steve uses his Impossible goodness to rally the team proving himself to be the true leader of the Avengers then banner offers NAT a shot at the hammer but she turns him down saying NAT believes she is not worthy and over the course of the movie NAT opens up to Bruce that she thinks she's a monster too partially because of the sterilization thing which sure but mostly because we're past as the killer that every other movie is just alluded to but NAT sees a future being with banner the only other character that understands how she feels and believes there is good in her demonstrated by when he offers her a shot at lifting the hammer and at the end of the movie NAT is forced to tragically embrace the monster and sacrifice her happiness to save the day last one is stor who explains that it's much simpler and he picks up the hammer says Thor's on another level now extrapolating Thor's arc is tricky since he is it nearly as much of a part of the rest of the movie as the other five he doesn't get to go to the character development farm because Thor needs to go to the exposition pool but so we're lifting the hammer that none of the humans can lift is symbolic of the future of the MCU phase 3 is where things really start heating up or spending more time in a scart and in space and learning about magic in the quantum realm the scope of these movies is widening dramatically and later when tour comes back from the exposition pool he tells the team about the Infinity stones which become the focus of Phase three the Avengers need think bigger if they're gonna stop what's coming in a way that really only Thor understands in that moment we get all of this in two minutes two fun light quip filled minutes on top of that the after-party sets up the rule that's revisited later in the movie how can we explain vision to the team in the audience have him effortlessly lift Thor's hammer now everyone is on his side the after-party is a terrifically written scene and number three the directing now it's tough to talk about this scenes writing without also talking about the scenes direction since the same person was responsible for both Joss Whedon according to Joss on the DVD commentary this was one of the first scenes Joss pitched and it wasn't a set up for the vision moment because he didn't come up with that idea until way later in the game this was just a fun scene where we learn about our characters and that's what Joss Whedon is best at I was like Firefly and Buffy and probably dollhouse haven't seen it I've heard good things are built around space cowboy or Vampire Hunter action scenes but they live and die based on the moments where regular flawed people sit down and talk that's what you take away from a Joss Whedon production and that's why he was the perfect person to direct an Avengers movie and the after-party is a particularly interesting scene because it doesn't feel like anything else in age of Ultron or really anything else in the MCU handheld's camera jazz drums crosstalk it's unique and apparently it almost wasn't when Joss originally shot the after-party was much more elegant like the banner and Natasha conversation at the bar and the energy just wasn't there no one was having fun and after a conference with his assistant director Joss called the shoot for a day and he took the night to figure it out why wasn't this scene working why doesn't it feel like a party but then Joss realized he just shot much ado about nothing a movie that's essentially one big party why wasn't he filming the after party like he filmed much ado and then it worked there was improvising everyone was casual and then even little things changed the more active camera helped to create clear contrast with the static hammer the camera is bouncing around while characters are talking but every time someone tries and fails to lift the hammer the camera freezes adding a visual weight to the hammer the Marvel movies really shine when they play to their individual director strengths takeaway TV brought absurd escapism Joe Johnson brought an old fat and esthetic James Gunn brought angsty misfits the Russos brought a bunch of unlikely friends arguing around a table Favreau brought swingers style dialogue I know he didn't write Iron Man but there were apparently a ton of rewrites Kenneth Branagh brought Shakespearean drama and Whedon brought a funny flawed family this is as good as it gets great actors embodying classic characters using a terrifically crafted script being expertly directed and if you aren't convinced that this scene is the movie look at age of Ultron shooting title and that's what's so great about the MCU a scene like this can be the movie heard a great quote about the MCU in a video by Patrick Coulomb's go watch his Marvel series it's great it's a quote from AV club writer Tom Brian who said about age of Ultron there's a certain logic to action movies you tolerate the scenes of dialogue and exposition to get to the fights standard logic says you need scenes where you build a character in chemistry and plot and motivation and these aren't easy to do in the context of an action scene but the action scenes of the reason why people turn up to these movies the movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have inverted this whole dynamic the action scenes are grand and elaborate and impressive but they're not what gets anyone in the door instead the bits of Marvel movies that people love the bits to keep them coming back are the scenes in between the action they're the throwaway jokes the deep breaths the moments of quiet bonding superhero movies are about characters and at least the ones I love are about relatable human characters even though their gods and super soldiers the Marvel heroes feel real - flawed scared alienated insecure powerless and that realness those flaws and that vulnerability allows you to connect with them you care about these guys because you see yourself somewhere in that team you aren't watching a movie you're on that couch drinking cracking jokes and celebrating you know it's a party and the whole point of this movie is you're at the party you're invited so that's why the after-party is my one marvelous scene now go find the other ones tons of some of the best creators on YouTube all made videos talking about an interesting scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and once you're done with those make your own what scene do you think is interesting once you make one tweet it to me at
