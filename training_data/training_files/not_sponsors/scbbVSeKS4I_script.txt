[Music] this is Montero Hill you know better as little nas acts this is his track Old Town Road this is how many weeks it's spent as number one on the Billboard Hot 100 cock-blocking Billy Eilish from reaching the top spot and destroying des besitos range it's gone platinum in Sweden Portugal Italy Austria Belgium New Zealand Germany Holland America the UK and Australia eight times it surpassed Drake's weekly streaming record here he is winning song of the year at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards performing at the Beatty Awards Glastonbury posing on the cover of Time magazine and this is how long little nas ex has been making music all of this is what a dedicated kid can do with an insanely catchy hook a knack for making memes and a little luck but there's plenty an artist can learn from Old Town Road success this is how little nas ex traded the most popular song ever Montero Hill was born in 1999 joining a generation who grew up with the internet spending most of his teenage years making memes he quickly learned the art of capturing an audience's attention with dreams of becoming an online personality Hill took to Facebook and Instagram before finding his voice on Twitter there's some debate as to whether or not he ran a few Nicki Minaj fan accounts but one way or another he embraced music as his path toward stardom he dropped out of college moved out of his house and wound up sleeping on his sister's floor I didn't want to be at home because I knew my parents like you know you school to do music turning bedroom closets into studios he began recording tracks like nas arathi and vans [Music] until you found the instrumental that would become Old Town Road the site beat stars allows artists to buy and sell beats online it's where little nas acts found young Kiyo's 90 a country track beat that samples the banjo in nine inch nails ghost four little knobs bought the track for less than 50 bucks on Halloween night and by December he was teasing his evolution of country on Twitter you see lil now sex is very internet savvy he understands trends and how to wield them to create viral moments on December 3rd 2018 lil nas X self-released Old Town Road on soundcloud and itunes he listed the tracks genre as country an ingenious tactic in maneuvering the algorithm rather than trying to compete with songs in today's oversaturated hip-hop genre and this was fair game the song rides the fine line between country and trap and at under two minutes it's wildly loopable warranting a realist and in the streaming age were plays or everything Hill was using memes in order to promote the song and at this time Red Dead Redemption too had just come out and the internet was already filled with Cowboy & Western memes Hill jumped on the trend making old town roads original music video a montage of Red Dead clips the day after releasing the track lil nas ex was asking Twitter to help him feature Billy Ray Cyrus on the single but the track really began to take off after it saw worldwide release in mid-december Hill was still self promoting the track creating reddit posts asking what his own song was called stuff like this is called search engine optimization and if anyone were to ask Google this same question his own post may very well give them the answer by January 8th the track had a million plays but this was just the beginning when the track found its way to Tik Tok it took off like wildfire the farmer challenge erupted and had people transforming into cowboys and cowgirls all of this popularity placed the tune on the Billboard charts including the hot 100 hot country and hot R&B and hip hop the song blew up so quickly radio stations were ripping the audio from YouTube to get it on air he was playing on six different radio formats and had the industry scrambling to decide what exactly to call it but billboard decided they'd settle the matter themselves when they quietly removed the track from the Hot Country Songs chart genre definition and borders are complicated after further review billboard stuck to their guns in determining that Old Town Road didn't merit inclusion on their country charts while Old Town Road is influenced by country music and even contains cowboy imagery the country heads in Nashville saw the track is a gimmick the songs trap drums are one of those things that make people want to say it's something else but the music industry is still fairly old-fashioned in their definitions of genres not too long ago the Billboard R&B chart was titled race music when the music industry starts enforcing genre borders after the fact they begin to question who has the right to make what and in this case whether black artists can fit in predominantly white genres it seems country can borrow from rap and still be country but not the reverse in this way old town road is helping to expose the hypocrisy of Nashville after billboard removed the song from the Hot Country chart Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted his support for little nas in just a week after hitting number one on the Hot 100 the Old Town Road remix released featuring the country veteran she shot the Sox popularity into the stratosphere the original and the remix garnered 143 million streams in its first full week the accompanying music video launched and went viral he released his EP 7 which debuted at number 2 Wrangler announced a little nas X collection which came with its own controversies he performed at the Beatty Awards Glastonbury BBC and as if that wasn't enough for the country world the very next day he came out as gay the genre controversy didn't stop the track from reaching number one on the Hot 100 the Sirus remix only propelled the track further and his coming out only added more spotlight now signed to Columbia Records lil nas ex did virtually everything right at the right time including gaming the remix in a completely nonsensical rule remix plays actually count towards the original songs chart placement so when the popularity of one remix began to die down he released another must hear version these frequent re-releases helped the track maintain its number-one spot on the charts for months Old Town Road held off new tracks from Billy Eilish post Malone Taylor Swift and even a collab from Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber lil nas X's rollout of Old Town Road was extraordinarily smart and fun to watch he understood internet trends and joined the ride he didn't box himself into one genre and listens to all kinds he proved that there was no such thing as bad press getting his track removed from the country charts started a debate that only drove more plays and he climbed to the top with $50 and a computer and when he got there he milked it he pushed one single until virtually everyone had heard it he wrote it until he couldn't no more I'm sorry in his own words it was a short song that he made on a whim so why look for too much more Old Town Road is far from being a game changer or a masterpiece it's just good old-fashioned fun a pop song with elements of both country and hip-hop 100% popular like I said earlier Montero Hill grew up with the internet and whether or not he knew it he was implementing social media marketing tactics to tell his story and story online today with Skillshare thanks for watching ladies and gents if you enjoyed this video please give it a like
