hey guys welcome back to my channel so i i'm gonna be honest like i did not see this coming this collab i was really surprised when i saw that they announced it but i'm not one to like be disappointed or like to complain about this because i don't want to get ahead of myself but it's kind of almost logical that when you take iu and sugar together the final result will most probably be art i don't know i don't know i i don't know i just feel like those two artists individually you know are so big first of all and so talented and i feel like they both have like their own sensitivity if that makes sense like their own little something special about them if that makes sense and when you put them together see they're gonna create something logically incredible at least in my opinion i sound really biased right now i realized it too unfortunately i couldn't find any video with the subtitles like the captions i only have the veto from one decade at the moment so yeah anyways let's go ahead i feel like it's been a while since we've seen are you in the music video oh i mean not maybe i'm just losing like concept of time which is highly possible [Music] the teaser gave us nothing so i literally have no idea [Music] damn i thought they would go like a more melancholic route [Music] oh this is way more happy than i thought it would be [Music] so cute [Music] forever y'all look i'm gonna link everything to bts i'm sorry [Music] forever we young got it oh that was smooth as hello [Music] that voices work together really well [Music] actually [Music] [Applause] [Music] this whole thing makes me feel confused but the music kind of like [Applause] gives me an an idea of hope are you kidding the freaking lizard was a dragon all along got it [Music] oh damn that's beautiful that that was confusing so that was either like a dream or just like imagination or like a memory okay see you see how her face does that where he she just changes her emotions in like a split of a second that's insane in my opinion but anyways yeah she was happy for a second and then the the next one she was she looked sad um well as i said i was expecting something maybe more like sad or melancholic i don't know i mean i feel like both of them have this very yeah this aura about them that feels very melancholic sometimes but i'm surprised that they went down a different route which is surprising but no i'm not like complaining about it again since i don't have the lyrics i don't really understand the the like the whole idea of it but it seems like this is centered around either memory dream and like innocence and like you know forever we're young so live your life or something like that i don't know as i said i felt like this song gave me what is it like hope i don't know how i can describe it to you guys how i feel but like it's weird music is weird it makes you feel things that you can't really describe and this is what is happening right now but anyways the whole thing is just it's just screaming artistry like as i said at the beginning right and like even though suga's part was rather short it was like the transition was perfect it was just it was blended you know blended perfectly and i would love whenever he uses his more soft voice if that makes sense also i want to add that this is not your typical like kpop music video like this is not kpop i would not consider this as being k-pop honestly this is like i don't know what you would call it but this is not k-pop like this does not scream k-pop it doesn't look k-pop it doesn't sound kpop so it's not the type of music that i would reach out for honestly i enjoyed it but i would not like listen to it on replay if that makes sense but the experience of watching the music video and listening to the song is is different it feels great you know forget to subscribe to my channel and i will see you soon bye
