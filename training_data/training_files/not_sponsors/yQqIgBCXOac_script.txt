hello and welcome to some more star citizen talking about some Kevlar ships and gameplay associated with them the recent Fleet Week gave us our first ruler at the massive interest m and javelin capital ships for a lot of players this is the apex of what star citizen can potentially offer dozens of crew working together to operate a ship with high risk and reward or at least that's the plan when they're in players hands the Idris is around 250 metres long it's a frigate it's got some quite big guns and room for a few fighters to operate out of the javelin is half a kilometer long and is a destroyer class ship and covered in a massive array of large weaponry and turrets and room for a larger ship but not the same sort of fighter compliment that an Idris can muster it's also the larger ship that is available for players to purchase even moving around in these large ships will take some time and for $2,500 for an interest it's not something sensible to buy for a normal human when in game and purchasing them with the in-game currency they are going to be a significant investment for a large or get and be that Idris or Chaplin or interest Pele whatever version of the interest that you're going to be getting the interest pay is these more civilian version it's gonna be a lot cheaper and more available the HSM is the military version much more rarer although they're going to be upgrade kits and other sequence sort of like much really change your interests to whatever suits your needs but it's gonna be expensive both of those ships the address and the javelin though they dwarf the current largest flyable shipping game which is the 890 jump and that's only 200 meters long and I say only 200 meters long that's a ridiculous thing to say because that's massive that ship is massive the 890 jump it's got a full luxury like spar and swimming pools and and things like that on it theaters and javelin were flying around during Fleet Week though and this is sort of a partly an excuse to have some of my javelin an interest footage shown off because I just wanted to have a bit of a tour of these ships or a bit of a look around on the exteriors these beasts were only partially combat ready though we had organizations and groups of players taking out these Titans too and they were supposed to be new and vulnerable they did patch this sort of like out halfway through Fleet Week though making them and tougher and actually fight back more appropriately because they weren't really fighting back before they stick away a little bit of the fun because I did want them to be sort of like properly engage about and if you can Abed to destroy them and stuff cool it's something silly you can do during the Alpha but it was a very cool experience what ever and it was even call them and they fought back I suppose the ships didn't have interiors though it was just the turrets and externals of the ship and some very basic AI controlling it at that stage anyway so when might we see them again well it's supposed to be that in three point nine we had an interest mission that got pushed back the interest wasn't really ready for that it was supposed to be part of this Arlington gang mission that's currently in game actually the Arlington gangster admissions but the end one doesn't have are you fighting an idris which eventually it will have and that's going to be quite a hard mission it's gonna have you fighting and interest and you're going to need a lot of support to do that like a large percentage of the server will have to join you also once you've done that mission they sort of said that it might only be uniquely acceptable once by each individual person so after you've done it once they'll have to join another group another party to do it again so someone else that's already doing it BAM you go in and join them I'm really interested to see what sort of reward this is gonna have as a mission because if you're getting a huge amount of players to do it then it needs to have a huge reward or some other sort of like little if these for completing it and I'm hoping that we see that interes mission in 3.10 as the interest is obviously at least partially functional to be in Fleet Week another potential for seeing the interest is when Zeno threats turn up an anti alien outlaw group from pyro we saw some leaks showing that they're gonna have sort of like large-scale incursions with this see no threat group turning up with addresses and supporting fighters and moving around the planets in the stanton system in a very similar sounding way to that of the Navy fleet during Fleet Week there ten other areas they will bear to attack them and assault them though there'll be sort of like looking down areas it seems and there might be some public missions that you can join in with now obviously that was sort of like leaked information and that might have changed heavily that might not ever be used by CID although I would expect it to be it's sort of like something that looks like they've got planned again these stages is only planned to be the externals of the Idris being functional no boarding and flying the ship yet yourself but even just NPC combat against an interest that's still going to take a huge force to take out and still be a pretty cool thing so when are we gonna be able to fly in Atrus ourselves well these are unlikely to be in player's hands properly until after squadron 42 episode 1 drops when in players hands these large capital ships are intended to have large crews as well so bear that in mind and because of that it's likely that we need some more sort of server tech the current server limits are if you have like a javelin or something you're only gonna have 50 people than javelin you might need more than that or how are you supposed to fight the javelin against a javelin if - sort of like orcs on a fight if you can only have 25 people in each traveling well you could probably manage but they want to have large crews so cloud imperium had previously said but even like having 70 M pcs on a ship during a test on a javelin or a terrace seemed to make them feel pretty spacious still like you could pack a lot of people on these capital ships if you wanted to if you wanted to do assault importing or you have other purposes that you needed a lot of people for so it's interesting because we need server meshing we need a network and server improvements and that's what stuff before it's in player's hands really as well capital ships are going to require crewing to run even moving from place to place might be difficult for a single player and to actually just move a capital ship because you're gonna have issues potentially with components breaking and needing repairing and there's gonna be maintenance work to do stuff like that what if you do get attacked if you can organize it getting a full player crew for the interest is probably ideal but at least player crew for the major positions once we have it in game makes sense so what sort of positions are we talking about on a capital ship that you'd have well you'd have the captain you'd have the pilot and you have the Gunners you'd also have the engineers so you'd have people for lots of different sort of engineering / that's sort of the station work so this would be engineers for repairs but also engineers and people working on stations that just control NF the multifunction displays controlling shields and controlling countermeasures stuff like that so the basic operations of a slaughter ship but on a larger scale you'll also have security forces maybe someone that literally looks after the permissions on a ship opens and closes doors even bats or stuff detects to see if the doors been opened command and control planning out assaults and sort of commanding where other ships if you've got an interest where your fighters are going to attack that's or stuff will make a hollow globe or some other form of map you're gonna need crew for any of the ships that you've got on board your ship whether that be like a little runabout or if that's fighters then there's lots of other tasks that you could sort of roll into any other role that you want so communications officers or people just run in communications logistics moving things around the ship our organization admin cargo management maintenance do you have enough food for your journey there are probably quite a few more including like scanning management's people doing detection and that sort of controlling your scanners detecting points of interest detecting enemies NPC crews will eventually be in-game to hire they will have to be paid but to what extent they require access to food and drink and that sort stuff I would expect as players need to eat and drink the NPC's will need to eat and drink as well they're put most certainly going to need access to food and drink and that could restrict the sort of long distance of your ship and that's one of the other things with these sort of capital ships they can have a very long distance compared to other ships they're going to be effectively mobile bases and even if you've got a crew covering the main positions on a ship you might want to get more npc crew for a redundancy or to cover all the other positions because having redundancy could literally mean the difference between winning and losing a battle some people might be sleeping some people might be offline the fats are stuff so and you might not bear to operate at full efficiency without to NPCs really computer and AI blades are another way of managing a ship and its systems as well cloud imperium are currently building out core computer systems that will allow you to have other functionality for ships and you're gonna be a bad like AI modules that are help control turrets pertain we manage some other systems on your ship as well with those sort of things costs of AI modules and their running costs are unknown at this stage as are the costs of MPC crews as well and exactly how that works exactly how you purchase them exactly how you maintain them we don't know yet however cloud imperium have said that player crew would be the sort of like best possible option you could have for a ship then getting NPCs and then AI modules so AI modules I suspect will be relatively derpy or very simple the costs of capital ships are likely to be incredibly expensive not just for the actual purchase of them but for their components as well and for their day-to-day running fuel maintenance insurance components cargo supplies all that sort of stuff is gonna cost you a lot of money to repair to maintain and you're unlikely to want to deploy them constantly where exactly they go when we're not using them that sort of remains to be seen can we just log off with them in a safe area do you need to take them to a capital ship dot can you land them somewhere we don't 100% know yet we know that landing on planets and moons is not advice though with such a large ship as in some cases you might be too heavy to leave the atmosphere yourself there will eventually be the Argo srvs their tractor tow ships that will help you out of atmosphere if you are planet bound though again as well we don't know exactly what's gonna happen with the safety of our capital ships when you're offline evil when some of your crews are flying or the owners are offline but others aren't things like that so we're still waiting on statements for them but expect to see them in-game and this sort of stuff in this gameplay to be iterated on quite heavily there are permission systems that are planned that are being worked on that would allow different crew different access to different areas based on the captain or the security staff settings I don't expect that will allow you to trap players in rooms though after you've sort of given them a mission and then cut off fishing from them with no possible way out there are questions that need to be answered though how will crew leave a javelin when they log back in and that none of the main crew around so you've logged off earlier and on the main crew around you've logged back on Oh what could I do all the doors are locked so things like that so what does a crewman like that do can they always have access to certain areas or are they basically a stowaway how about stowaways handled well cloud Imperium has actually sort answered that briefly before with the current thinking being that if you are not part of the crew and the security or the captain issues a leave order you have to leave the ship you can literally and even leave the ship normally or maybe you can sort of like pick a button and it will respawn you or move you to sort of like the docks nearby or whatever then if you still remain there you would be a criminal or you'd be able to be engaged by the crew without them getting a criminal rating so they could they could punch you to bits or whatever because you in the face I suspect there will be a sort of like doctor locked and protect a kind of thing while you're safe in a dry dock but we don't know for sure and you could probably still get very clever players boarding your ship and things like that potentially in the future we'll capital ships spawn and despawn all persist when logged out we don't know yet I just think it's important that players will be able to leave a ship whenever they need to whether or not the main crews online or not if they were part of there there's sort of like engineering staff and someone forgot about the more janitor on board and you will logged off and a couple of you log back on you need to get out of that ship somehow so what sorts of uses will capital ships have well they'll be used for mobile basis for orgs allowing you to run missions out of them move between star systems have somewhere to rearm and rest they're going to give you a huge amount of distance and supply at those distances at those longer ranges and if you want to go to sort of like the Wild West areas that nan UE ESO zones the unclaimed sectors of and planets and you're probably gonna want to take a capital ship in some situations I would expect them to be very expensive to deploy though constantly for the like missions and for fights but they probably will be needed in larger scale missions or raids to fight against NPC fleets or enemy capital ships another org you might want to attack their capital ships or just launch one of their bases the full extent of the gameplay that's going to be there with base building on planets and unclaimed plants and unclaimed systems that does remain to be seen but I would expect orgs and capital ships to contest those areas when in player's hands the javelin and Idris P will come with a base loadout it was originally said that the javelin would be an empty hole that you had to completely outfit that does now seem to have changed so you will get a load out of some kind so you can fly it straight from the off I'm looking forward to boarding actions though when we have physicalized components for ships we're going to see ships much more often disabled rather than exploding and crews may attempt to repair their crippled ships or use escape pods or whatever so it might be in some ships interests to engage a ship and disable it and then board it and if you're boarding it maybe your capture it as well you might have to fight the crew that's going to be really interesting types of battles and that's the sort of stuff that I want to get involved with also it's very likely we'll see capture the idris or capture the javelin type levels for theatres of war in the future as well which is that more arcade objective-based and battle for esque sort of gameplay mode that starts listens going to have and they're working on at the moment we will see plans and gameplay evolve with these ships as starters and gets more development and it will be backers and players that help shape that but also the way that the development just goes with the technology that's star citizen has available to it we do need a bit more tech to come into place before we have the idris flyable by players we need that server meshing we need physicalized components better combat we probably need the interiors to be finished for the more civilian models or for for players needs rather than just the interiors done for squadron 42 versions of the ships but I'm interested to know what you think do you own a capital ship do you want to own a capital ship do you think we will see an NPC interest again in 3.10 do you think there's a chance we could see Zeno threat missions during alien week whatever your thoughts I'd love to hear from you in the comments below every month we have a ship giveaway for June it's for Anne Espiritu varam prowler drop ship and star citizen game package kindly supplied by cloud Imperium just comment on any of my videos made during June to be in for a chance of winning laughs oh what's that what am i filling based on what country and state you are in
