[Music] plan [Music] [Music] so my god man i'm struggling i have a couple more hours before i'm going to a friend's house party right and uh we're going to be doing a lan party trying to do a barrows drinking game if you're really interested the barrows drinking game really quick rules if you don't get an item you drink if you get an item you give out three sips if you get an elite clue you give out five sips anyway not the point i made in my deadline to get 70 prayer before i went back to barrows for that drinking game and so i have 55 prayer and i have exactly 70 prayer banked now i also realize that these insult dragon heads don't work because you need 93 magic for that which i don't have either way i've started crushing these into my uh pots here to get bone meal and this is taking way longer than i thought so i thought i'd take a little break i've got about let's say 12 more hours to get the 70 prayer i still need to make my portals i realize i have two super important things left to do which is all the mauritania achievement diaries i thought i only had hard left to do i have all of them left to do which have a couple of farming things that i should still wait for so i should do that right now and also i need to put the portals in my house just have 166k left i hope that is enough to build the portal room and then also buy all the runes for the two portals i need which is the carol's portal and the barrows portal carol's portal is needed for mauritanian medium so let's go to the house real quick barely holding on with my cash stack here but uh we should be good ah crap i forgot wizard mind bomb the boost for the barrows portal need one more level barrows yes perfect all right i don't know what i'm going to put there yet probably corenda actually i'll put that one there later why did someone make taran's lair this this place is hell challenge for any uim to make a torrance layer only uim well actually there's a bank in here so you could make a tarnish layer hardcore tile's done i'm getting out of here i hate this place okay jesus i am almost done i still have to do the prayer though so we take a little break from all of that to start working on the mauritania diaries and we're officially done with the mediums and we only have harvest these mushrooms over here and the piety step left to do put this on herb lore and then get back to prayer you're never gonna make it you're not good enough there's a million other people with the same stuff you really think you're different man you must be kidding think you're gonna hit it but you just don't get it it's impossible it's not probable you're responsible too many obstacles you gotta [Music] bye hey the first elite clue oof we've already got a sherlock um by the way i think i'm gonna go up to 200 caskets or for a full set i'm not sure yet but actually i already got everything i could ever want from this grind we got our tank legs and another gotham's piece now the only thing i'm still looking for is a full barrow set because we still have that monster clue in the bank and preferably that lost gotham set so we could do slayer with gotham's because i kind of want to continue doing slayer we're doing great uh now that i got the 70 prayer it's also going to go quicker for the time being i'm really enjoying a barrows now are we dropping this yes that's 87 crafting and that's going to be a long long time before we get that and i kind of want to keep doing barrows and have a chance at early clues any clue number two let's see if we can do this one though oh [ __ ] am i am i gonna catch one black salamander it's a pretty common pk spot okay sure the reason i'm doing this is because it's a one-step thing to do and then i can always do that clue step i'm scouting with my only trails account right now but it'll log out at any given moment please yeah get in no don't do me dirty catch it yes i don't even want my net and row back i got it nice not roon equip room boots across the light haulberg and a dragon stone ring well we're closer to room boots i'm keeping this one man i'm going back to slayer because i trained my prayer at the red dragons i got a bunch of grubby keys which is really nice because i could get brews and ranging potions from these so let's open a couple and see if we can bring some the issue is i'm gonna get a lot of like sharks and stuff so i don't know if i can even open four at a time this might be a very annoying thing to do what do we get there we go that's a range part boom and a super defense which i can't make yet or maybe i can actually but i don't have any yet so that's actually pretty good there we go that is a good one though we're also getting herbs which is really good i didn't know that so let's get the rest real quick yo i just got 200 law runes that's actually massive i'm also getting coins which is big because i didn't have many coins left and i need to repair my carol stuff so that's actually perfect last two grubbies please brew i just need bruise oof crystal key that's actually good oh man lost chest brew question mark dragon bones it's a little bit late not a singular brew we got a dragon stone though i guess that's all right not really a big milestone level but this is pretty cool to get on a superior get 77 slayer now that doesn't unlock anything but we just got that elite clue for the room boot so slowly but surely getting the 80 is really good to get now look at all these installed heads i am going to bank a lot of prayer xp while doing the slayer grind and as i said the next goal is get 70 or 65 smithing to get that correcting cables heart diary done so i can actually do some slayer toss on some lizardmen shamans and try and get lucky at that dragon warhammer i'm also going to be bringing my bone crusher every celery task i completely forgot it right now because i literally just got that mauritania heart diary done but that should also give some passive prayer xp because i am not planning on training prayer for quite a while because that small rush was not that fun making all the bone meal and stuff so prayer will remain untouched for quite a while and will only be trained passively through unsold heads and a bone crusher i just picked up my bone crusher i got 147 750 charges i think we're good i don't know why i decided when i was monumentally bored to go and catch some chins but we now have 7500 which means we can actually catch magpie implings without a butterfly net and i had to let a couple magpie implants go so i'm really glad i did that we also got 517 chins and at 74 we unlocked magic bird houses so let's do my very first magic birdhouse run because i've been waiting for that for a while there we go that's done you're ready for a farm run you see banana tree seed don't eat that i still need a magic seed since i wasted my last one and i still have a farming contract for it ah big moment for the account as you can see in the chat i just completed my 200th task and got a 450 point bonus putting me over 1 000 slayer points and the first purchase that i should make is i think a rune pouch i'm uh i need that thing for alcohols for many other reasons for burst tasks stuff like that boom there we go 750 points down to drain but fill that thing up with alchemy runes what's the next task all right we're skipping knight thank you's easy peasy i completely forgot i had a hard clue here i completely baited you guys for a second i'm not milking i'm opening it boom nothing in it obviously but that was as a celebration for the room pouch since the next long-term goal is raids and dragon warhammer might as well start knocking out these diaries for herbalore xp for the lamps uh so we're here in the fight pits now my guys have already joined in i don't think i can join but we're going to start on the karamjahart diary it's the one i can already instantly complete and we'll see what other diaries we can do right now i just got 87 hit points killing an umly for the diary all right fair enough that's actually a pretty decent level also 88 strength coming in and that's the last one there we go hard diary lamp let's go get it there we go and now we have unlimited teleports to the gem mine right is it unlimited i don't know if it's unlimited maybe it's three teleports a day i don't really know but this is incredible 15k 10k all right well 10k herb lorexp let's see what other diaries we can do while doing the achievement diaries i found a little time to do my tears of gothics and it's actually a big milestone level coming in for runes uh runecrafting i know i say that many times but now we have 55 which is the requirement for devious minds and framing exiles two quests i still haven't done i'm going to hold off from family heart for a little bit because i don't have grim tails done and i don't really have the time to quest right now because we got to move on to the next diary yo i didn't expect to get this many lamps from this guy still holy [ __ ] i'm racking up the kudos right now is that a 5k that's 1k all right fair enough however we're now moving on to varrock hart diary the only issue being i don't have a used seat anymore to grow a utree so we're going to be close to finishing this one but not quite i'm currently collecting some unicorn horns since i need to make some super anti potions if you guys didn't know under the tower of life you can actually do a couple of interesting things you can get pretty easy secondaries for herb lore for example i just got 14 unicorn horns and 14 cow heights and with that i can make a unicow i was going to say a cowy corn but either way they drop more unicorn horns than you put in so except for doing eclectic implants is probably the best way to get unicorn horns this was probably such dead content before iron man the prep for the shaman task slash dragon warhammer has begun and the first thing to do is get the current and cable's hard diary done for that we need 70 smithing so we need to go to blast furnace to quickly get that level up now first up we need the goldsmith gown let's boom done we have 300k and 4k gold or to work with hopefully this only takes an hour this is the last batch of gold ore we got actually the perfect amount of gold or almost 107 left and we're going to hit 66 smithing right now there we go 66 smith and ready to boost let's go and get the diaries done and all the quests that we still have to do on there so thank you very much sirius i should have left you in the cave to be honest there we go 15k hit points 10 000 magic and completed lunars 17 15 total and 83 magic yo that's perfect i hate it here i hate it here i hate it here i hate it here and by giving her or him her that scroll hundred percent lovican's favor is also done biscuit really is to go and then we should be done the lost bag of worms has been delivered and we have all 100 favors time for art to get art i'm tired guys i'm sorry time for architectural alliance and then the rest of the diary there they are the architects that are going to give me 10 000 free herb lorexp i thought this quest was actually a genuine quest but it was just getting all the favors so i'm really happy i never done this on trails either because uh i don't think i ever can really yeah when we're going to grind with listerman shamans i don't even think i need to teleport in my house anymore because i can just use this now for the rest of the diary right let's do what we got the smithing level for um i cannot bring many boosts since i need the coal and the element or to try and make the admin bar so i'm hoping to get my boost very very wait i'm no i'm i don't oh that was so dumb i just need the resources for one adi bar since i'm not going to be able to make them without a b oh my okay you know what doesn't matter because i'm going to hit it first try 70 baby all right avert your eyes from the stuff that was down there i have not went to get new boosts my cat just died [Music] i hate boosting for [ __ ] the sole thing that rests us to do is uh get that lizardman shaman killing for that obviously we need the shazian armor so give it to me baby tier five chasing armor this shouldn't take too long i guess there it is let's get to the shamans hug the wall and pray for the best we're going in boys for our very first shaman kill ever oh don't look at me boys i'm doing it i can hit twice right before this guy explodes and the diary kill is done if he dies do the purple guys die too no 1kc dragon warhammer what a scam man big moment for the account the dragon war hammer passive grind has started because right now we are going to be unlocking the task where is it can now do legend eight there we go 75 points down to drain neve just give me the shamans instantly iron dragons we're doing gargoyles though so as the final thing we can now finally start hunting for shamans if we complete this diary the current cables heart diary done rather blessing three ten thousand herb lorexp now fifteen thousand herbal exp that is going slowly to the rates requirement and now to activate this elizabethan shaman situation and then we're done you're don't give a damn if you say you disapprove i'm gonna make
