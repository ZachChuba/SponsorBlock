that's why they have these bolstered seats they hold you well you scumbag come on for those who couldn't see which is all of you that was a truck pulling out about two miles an hour and then immediately turned back into a lot right in front of it gunnery [Music] we're doing a 20-18 Alfa Romeo stell vo TI today I don't know how I feel about the name the Stella it's stell vo it sounds like a stupid supporting character in a Shakespeare play it really does last poor Stella oil fell down the stairs and died yeah it really does the nomenclature on these cars is kind of confusing this is the T I still view but it doesn't say ti anywhere on it it's a stupa says Q for work it is not the Quadrifoglio what you think q4 Quadrifoglio I'm amazed that you pronounce that yeah really recycle e a Quadra Fiocchi anyway this is a very similar car to the Giulia which we reviewed the same engine yep but it really it's not that much slower than the Julia you're looking at five point four seconds to 60 versus five point one neither of which is particularly fast but so this has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine to leader-to-leader that produces 280 horsepower yeah you do have these paddles so going around twisty roads like this is moderately fun for a big hulking SUV yeah you don't want to eat it around the roads but it's pretty fun I like that I really paddle shifters have grown on me and there's a very good girl on me - yeah like this thing it doesn't feel super slow on the back roads yeah [Music] three-two-one [Music] sixty there's and manuals and manual this doesn't feel super fast but I didn't see much delay like I was watching you when you get like and when a ship goes paddles those shifts were pretty much instant yeah I didn't really notice any laughs I appreciate that I'd rather have a slow car that shifts instantly like that then a faster one that's got lag yeah I would agree let's start with the looks looks the grill is very typically alpha yeah I love which I like I love Alfa Romeos front grilles yeah very very attractive cars now I noticed there wasn't a front license plate on this car and nor is there a license plate in the windshield mmm interesting so it was raking the law breaking the law driving us well overall like this kind of fits into the price of this because I think it for the looks it looks very exotic for the price it looks cooler than any other crossover or SUV in my opinion because it's different yeah the - it this is cheap material yeah I'm gonna go ahead and knock it a lot a lot of it is like everything up here feels kind of cheap it's like chief plastic feeling it's like Millennial flooring grey like it's like if you buy a house as a millennial and you want to put down hard quote hard woods it's gonna be this color it's like a grayish wood yeah looks really nice but you hit it and it feels kind of just gross it's not it's plastic the actual - the screen is I like how they integrated it I like that it's not just a square that sticks out it is it's got its own nice big glasses and swoops and it's got some swoop ease to it which is cool you do have cup holders in the front we found neurotic allottee yeah right yeah yeah we found them it takes maybe more than a couple hideous to discover what a couple others are that they do exist you do have that you have a USB charging port here in the front which is cool as well as a 12-volt right next to it yep not for cigarettes anymore a 12 volt charger the material on top of the - it's it's not it's like a that's no nicer than in my focus which is kind of disappointing for the for the price but it's not bad it's squishy rubbery whatever it is I don't know it's the standard material for the top of your - then you move down further on - like the side panels and the seats it's this nice brown leather or leather ish I'm not I don't think it's actually other ass yeah I think yeah but that's the look they were going for is nice leather and I'm glad they did that it's it's an impressive appearance it looks classy it looks clean you've got like pretty good storage space here in these bins yeah door which is nice yeah I was just thinking that it we got these actually nice felt lined side pockets here you got like a little coin pocket here you got a handle pocket here you've got a mesh pocket there there's a lot of storage in this car which I really appreciate yeah there's quite a bit of space I'm you have a lot of space in the back so yeah I don't know exactly how much off the top of my head but I'd say you could fit at least one of me at least I think scientific if that's a reasonable estimate I think yeah now my one gripe so far that I found with this is that I was like how do you open the center console there's no button or anything so I found out you just gotta yank it and that's kind of it it's kind of classless to me you do have that's the auxiliary cable port and another USB port in there you got a little dividers in here felt line dividers and it's it's useful there's you can put a little bit of stuff in there you can fit like I don't know for Wendy's cheeseburgers I think yeah that sounds about right yeah but you got to gotta yank it and slam it to open and close it so yeah [Music] that was weird yeah so I let off the gas the engine automatically shut off to save gas which I don't like and when I let off the brake and put my foot on the gas that took about a second - yeah there was notice there was a delay before like that's dangerous honestly yeah that was kind of weird I don't like that I feel about that I will say right off the bat this thing feels super smooth yeah it is this is a nice backup camera - actually yeah I like that that's a pretty nice high resolution yeah it might just be because it's a tiny screen so you don't need a super high resolution to look good maybe but it's not bad yeah this thing takes zero effort yeah it's very smooth yeah it's a really really really smooth ride I'm gonna put this in D which I assume is dynamic you'll see if it tightens up a little bit it does significantly Wow that's cool that you got those different features yeah like those different modes you can set them in and you don't have to go through a single menu to change your driving mode it's just right there yeah it's all in the little dial yeah yeah fuel economy is okay it's 22 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway yeah which I mean that's like about a lot ahead yeah it's about what I'd expect in this yeah and if you've seen our Alfa Romeo Giulia review you know that we talked about the paddle shifters in that the battle shifters are identical yeah I feel like in this to the Giulia they hang out here it's like they're not actually connected to the wheel they're attached to the steering yeah they're attached to the column and they just kind of float there which I kind of like it's starting to grow on yeah actually they're always in the same spot you know where they are yeah and I do still think it's cool to have paddle shifters in an SUV yeah I agree that it's fun if we could feel a bit like a boy racer or a girl racer while you're driving this in your crossover yeah while you're driving your kids to soccer practice yeah you can feel like your inner racer yeah I'm gonna go ahead and say like early impressions I prefer this over the Giulia really yeah why it's more sebaceous I don't like a julia felt cramped like I was like tucked up against the steering wheel no matter where I put remember the getting in the getting into the julia is weird open the door is it's like too far forward yes you far forward it's weird it's it's a weird part getting into this has none of those issues just feels like a normal car you can get it and drive it well it feels normal but it looks Italian yeah I will say now that I'm driving this I'm running into the same problem that I had with me with the Juliet I am I'd like to drive casually with my arm at my side and my hand at the bottom of the steering wheel unless I'm like in a dangerous situation so traffickers like what prohibits that and the the bolsters on the seats like all right oh yeah I should have a couple inches over here where I can just rest my arm so I have to either go on the outside of the bolster in which case I don't feel as relaxed or the inside-out bolster where I'm just like pinned to my side I never really thought about that until you just mentioned it right now but the elbows are like you got a pick yeah like maybe on the seat I didn't notice it while I was in the passenger seat but now that I'm driving because this is how I Drive casually yeah I would have to drive like a real person and put yeah sure just drive like a normal person just be normal no I'm the worst wow that's an easy problem that is such a nitpick like yeah so like the way that I like driving is kind of a comfortable Trek I like to drive with my knees and the fact that there's a gas pedal makes that really hard hair Alfa Romeo designed it like this can't they figure people like me this is the TI as we mentioned before which is a little more expensive than the base the base price tell view is about $41,000 really reasonable which is pretty reasonable this the TI is also pretty reasonable it's only forty four thousand dollars oh wow I'd say it's probably worth it yeah I think I think it's probably worth it that extra three thousand hi I'd pay it yeah I like the paddle shifters yeah I do - I just realized one thing I went to use my indicator and I hit the paddle shifter instead the the indicator is shorter than the paddle shifter yeah so you have to like reach around I do like that it's a little weird you have to do that for the one on the right - a new windshield wipers yeah it's a little weird that is interesting so then it moves up from there to the Quadrifoglio which is $80,000 Wow but the Quadrifoglio has over 500 horsepower yeah again this only has 280 horsepower yes if you're looking for a fast preferable or practically everything about double the price yeah ah there you go I haven't driven it but at that price I'd be tempted to look elsewhere I'm actually more impressed than I thought I'd be this is maybe the first car that we've reviewed where I thought that it was gonna be kind of meant yeah and I'm actually kind of impressed not gonna lie yes at last I'm not the only one who's wrong about everything yeah this is the first time I think that I've been like that very very pleased with this I got a soft spot for crossovers I don't know why they're ugly really yeah I hate him I hate him looking at him but when I'm driving him like it's kind of nice let's get into it starting out with performance what do you think better than I expected yeah I'd agree better than I expected the world orbits does not the best handling but for what it is or what is I'm gonna have to make a distinction here between fun factor and performance because this is a lot of fun but I'm going to give it a five for performance five yeah Foreman's alright guys interesting that is slightly lower than you rated the Julia yeah which is about accurate I guess and I think I'm gonna do the same thing also go with a five for this like a little bit slower than Julia yeah a little bit more cumbersome to steer and handle around corners but not much but still like quick enough yeah practicality I think it's good yeah I'm I hesitate to say like great oh well okay it's great it's not like really really great I mean you can like your mind wagon yeah could be a wagon could be a wagon I'd give it I give a seven so yeah back-slapping and a seven value pretty good yeah for a crossover at forty four thousand dollars for this particular model not bad yeah I think it's high I mean I know Alfa Romeos have a very bad rap with reliability issues so I think that the resale values of these aren't the highest in the world especially comparatively if you got like a Toyota 4runner yeah which would be about the same price of this that's true but still it's cool it looks cool for what it is it looks cooler than a forerunner yeah I'd probably go with a six on value yeah actually you know I'm gonna knock it a little high I'm gonna give it a five actually Wow okay well that frees me up to do a six then okay because I think this is that's a good value for the money like you won't be you won't find yourself wanting for much with this car yeah I find that but I still think if you were really getting something for value you'd get a Toyota 4runner yeah or something you would get like it's just hard to beat Toyota for value yeah cool factor like moderately high I feel like I don't know I'm gonna give it probably another five cool affection for me yeah that's that's so tough because when we say five that's not that's not that it's bad it's no it's it's average and I don't want to give it less than average because it's I mean it's cooler than other crossover there's cooler than other crossovers I think like as far as crossover is that this price range goes this is the coolest of them yeah it's the coolest looking one but it's still a crow it's still crossover and it's still not yeah that cool I'm no one turns their head so I'm gonna give it a four and a half all right quality is valuable it's acceptable yes it does have like some cheap feeling components and then long-term reliability is of kind of suspect in Alfa Romeos yeah so but I mean overall the paddle shifters are solid feeling the steering wheel feels good a lot of stuff feels good the leather seats are nice yeah as of right now everything feels great I think I probably go with the six on quality which is the same that I gave the Julia I think that's fair I'd say that's fair to put me down for a six as well all right and then moving on to last fun factor which is decent I was surprised yeah I was decently surprised I was thinking this is gonna be you know like four or five out of ten territory but I it's six out of ten territory what did I give the Julia you gave the Julia five point five and come to think of it I'm actually gonna go to five point five also I'm gonna give this a six point five then really I think it's a full point higher than the Julia Wow I think it's more if I had almost no fun in the Julia yeah not almost no I mean less than I had hoped in that one and more than I had hoped in this one oh my god is it the same score is it really I think I ready for flat Julia was a thirty four point two five this was also a thirty four point two five Wow pacifically that's amazing thirty four point two five is our average score out of sixty four this car for the 2018 stell VOT I yeah it makes sense it is the same car really it's just it really is this is just like this is the thick version it looks like you took a Julia ti and you stuck it with a B and I got a little bloated and you put it in Photoshop and grab the top handle and drag it up yeah it literally does look like that we rated the the Toyota 4runner TRD a little higher than this we rated that a 35 so a little higher there you go and I agree with that I'd get a Toyota over this seems about right if this is your first time watching thank you for tuning in hopefully you enjoyed the Stelvio there are a little Shakespearean Cossacks pierced LVO not the not the Quattro formaggio support cheese version anyway this has been fun please don't hate us Italians don't hate as a dance and see you in the next step you know see you guys thanks give it a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
