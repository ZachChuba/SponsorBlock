hi everyone hope you're doing well today we've got some really exciting news about the future of Call of Duty war zone two of the lead developers on the game from Infinity Ward and Raven Software did an interview with a website called game again and they revealed some incredible things about what's coming up for the game and for what they said it looks like cod warzone is going to stick around for a very long time this won't just be a game that's supported up until the end of the year when the new Call of Duty comes out so rather than make a script just like we did last week with the patch notes I thought that I would play a solo match and go through the highlights of what they said while do live commentary and attempting to win the game and in this one I've gone for the mp5 now I've seen a lot more people using the mp5 recently I've tried it in the past but it's never really worked out that well for me but I was watching nadeshot on Twitch and he was using it as a secondary and he had this build but I'm gonna be using it as a primary weapon some people run it with an AR and have this as their secondary weapon for close quarters let's say but today like I said we're gonna be using this as our main gun with that said let's jump into the game now and see how it goes this is gonna be a hot drop for this one see we can make some money and we do have a recon contract here that I'll attempt to get this dude is right oh this - right here get down a stupid love is about every time I get stuck on them well that God didn't really damage me that much where's nice stuff and power here so let's get those rounds in there so Opie can hear this other dude but I'm not sure where he's gone I want to check this side room here cuz I don't really want that hey this is in the building unfortunately that recon contract has gone someone's already taking it but see if there's anyone else around here how's the dude at the petrol station there or the gas station sorry does the Americans call it what Oh someone else killed him where was that from but absolutely no idea I don't like it though I'm gonna go I feel like I was robbed there though that was totally my kill so now we've got a bit of breathing room we're gonna talk about that interview and I did make a few notes on my over screen but there's a truck over there but it's whatever I'm just gonna try and get my load out here grab the mp5 so one of the most interesting things was that they basically confirmed I suppose the war zone will be supported on PS 5 and Xbox series X like the guy said something like you know their plan is that war zone is gonna be around for quite a while so as soon as those systems are available we're gonna support them well that's good because it shows that war zone their plan for it is a really really long shelf life and they do go into this a bit more further while in the interview why is that crate like 300 meters away from me what's that about I don't know where the guy is that got out of the truck there but I haven't seen him since so we're just gonna go miss dawn man was telling me about this like slide jump tactical sprinting I've not got it down yet but apparently you can move quicker with it so I'm out I know I need to get it down this area is horrible I was just thinking to myself that hay-bale there will be such a good way to check you up the stairs of this building because these buildings I swear every time solos squads just always someone in these builders in the Attic every time you just have to check them but I'm gonna go this by and get myself a UAV now one of the other cool things in this interview was when they were talking about how warzone connects to the Call of Duty franchise in a way and what happens when the new cod game comes out this year like is cod just then competing with itself and just cod warzone just stopped updating well from what these dudes said that's not the idea at all and warzone will keep being supported for a very long time I'm bit worried someone who's camping in this building here watching the Buy no I think we're all right so they basically said the warzone they've got like a big long-term story and content plan for it and pop you're strapping in a house I'll let this stand I've got to get this guy I'm gonna go dead silence here gasps is it bow he just jumped out for me it's gonna get the dog Oh apparently my dog is broken taco please there's a girl put that boy right we're gonna go there - its mp5 isn't gonna test itself out but it was pretty good back then so as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted Cod war zone will kind of be the game that connects all of the other Call of Duty games it will be the line through the middle the dude said see that dude over there we're going to chill in here for a sec so this is something we've talked about before but the fact that they called it Call of Duty war zone rather than modern warfare war zone I think that says a lot that quotes about him saying that it will be the line through the middle that connects all the other Call of Duty games that makes me think that when that new card game is out maybe war zone will be updated with assets or Maps guns from whatever the new Call of Duty is and it will just always be this constant thing that has its own game playing own elements but when there's a new cod game war zone will take elements of that and morph them into itself if you get what I mean like he was saying that some players have already discovered Easter eggs and figured out the attack road just rolled up there so now there's two people they're just camping they probably don't even know that they're there I'm just gonna keep watching though because I was kind of explaining this so he said some people have discovered that not everything is as it seems in gdansk and as people delve into the mysteries and the story of everything the map will evolve and change and he said that people have already worked out that this something else does like another area of the dance that's not even been senior and I do wonder like that's the bunkers I eventually will we be able to open the bunkers and there's like this whole underground city or you know big location underneath that we can go and explore like that would be so cool no hello he's got sulfurous can I get an angle here yes I can under the car oh man I think he was close to getting that that self rez then but unfortunate he was just prone attempted to buy something but little did he know that I was telling the story in a random hurt in the middle of a field just unlucky really I don't even know if we should attempt this last scavenger why do I even need the cash at this point not sure but I did mark that roof up there cuz there was someone there on the UAV I haven't seen the move but there's gotta be someone around me because there's only 12 other people left just very cautiously moving around here but I know that like mp5 at this kind of distance like in buildings like this is very good I'm just gonna hold this because if he is in there he's got to move maybe not there is so it's not bad from that kind of distance but it does bounce around a lot seems like there's a lot of horizontal recall on this considering the range though that was pretty fast time to kill what I was seeing that guy was full health and armor yes a pretty much covered like most of the important stuff in that interview although there were a couple other things like he said that Gio's is definitely coming I know a lot of people have asked for duos which is cool anyone in that Hasek know it doesn't look like it just about in the zone so yeah Joe's is coming really looking forward to that you know I'm gonna check this just in case better safe than sorry you know that's my motto with this game now in solos you just got to check everything you have to do it did I spot someone then I did give me a shot self res right damn it you know what I'm not letting go roadkill stop imagine being that guy I'm so sorry I'm so so sorry he's kind of bad though because people would have seen that on the map and probably heard my vehicle - known on the right by the looks of it I've got this Ridge that I can play Here I am kind of blending in as well cuz I'm a bush wookie nice to have an in-game circle like this when you've got the ghillie suit hello little fight down there now you guys sound phrase as well okay right now don't waste my gas mask so I'm not gonna try and finish that off I should be able to jump down here done it felt like I should just push and clear this type of snake shots not today right two other people left I reckon then either end of the bridge you're over this way I know there's only one left now where are you trying to keep moving and just make sure I'm not an easy shot I don't know where this guy is oh there we go alright mp5 let's go hey we got it nice or can i screen show as well yeah mp5 is pretty good I don't know if I like it as much as the mp7 feel like the the recall in the range on the mp7 is a bit better but not bad I think maybe I'll have to give it some more plays I'm that was good fun I think that we covered everything that I wanted to talk about as well I'm really excited to see you know the updates and what's coming next and evolutions to the map maybe even new maps we will see I do think it's quite clear though that warzone is here for the long haul and it's gonna stick around for quite a didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
