foodwishes.com with gravy stuff stuffin muffins that's right not only are we making muffins with thanksgiving stuffing we are also stuffing that stuffing with something and that something would be a delicious country gravy and i know it might sound kind of crazy because it sort of is but these really were truly amazing and they're a must try for any stuffing fanatic like me so with that let's go ahead and get started with our country gravy which is going to start by melting some butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat to which we will add any kind of raw sausage meat and what i have here is one link of mild turkey italian sausage that i remove from the casing and what we're going to do here is crumble this up as it browns but also brown it up as it crumbles and as usual with this kind of stuff i think the smaller the better and while you could certainly use a regular pork italian sausage for this or even the more traditional pork breakfast sausage since we're eventually going to shove this stuff into a thanksgiving themed stuffing muffin i thought the turkey would work out even better but anyway like i said we'll go ahead and cook that over medium-high heat until it's been crumbled up fairly finely and starts to brown up and take on some nice color and then what we'll do once it looks a little something like this is go ahead and switch to a whisk and we will toss in a little bit of all-purpose flour which is going to combine with that melted butter and the fat that rendered out of the sausage to create a paste we call a roux r-o-u-x and that's what's eventually going to thicken our gravy so we'll stir that in and cook it for about two minutes and then once we've taken the raw edge off that flour we'll go ahead and toss in some freshly sliced green onions and we will cook those stirring but only for like a minute okay i do not want to brown those onions because i don't want them getting soft and sweet i think here we want them to retain a little bit of sharpness and a little bit of texture so we'll only cook those for about a minute before pouring in our cold milk and because that milk is very cold and that roux is very hot we're not going to have to worry about getting any lumps okay we actually have a t-shirt that says that cold milk hot roux no lumps and then all we have to do here is cook this stirring until it comes back to a boil at which point as you're about to see it's going to thicken up beautifully so we will just keep stirring still on medium-high heat and eventually we should end up with something that looks a little something like this and right here i'm going to go ahead and switch to a spatula so maybe you can get a little better idea of how thick we're talking okay which is pretty thick and then to finish this off we'll go ahead and season it with some salt a few shakes of cayenne as well as some freshly ground black pepper and that's it we'll stir that in and just cook it for like one more minute at which point we can turn off the heat because we're done and all we have left to do is carefully transfer this into a bowl because we're going to want to let this cool all the way down before we use it and yes as you may have noticed this is a little thicker than your classic country gravy but for it to work as a stuffing for a stuffing muffin it really does need to be at least this thick and if you make it ahead like i did once it cools down we can wrap that up and pop it in the fridge until needed which if you have time is the way to go since the colder and thicker this is easier it's going to be to work with and that's it once our country gravy is done we can move on to the stuffing into which the stuff we just made will be stuffed and that's going to start with a whole bunch of butter set over medium-high heat in which we're going to saute some dye celery and onions along with a nice big pinch of salt and what we'll do is cook that stirring for about four or five minutes or until the onions just start to turn translucent and then once that's been accomplished we'll go ahead and add our poultry seasoning as well as a whole bunch of freshly ground black pepper and we'll give that a stir and cook it for another minute and in case you're wondering poultry seasoning is mostly just dried sage and thyme and maybe rosemary and a few other things and it's one of those ingredients that gives thanksgiving stuff in its signature flavor so don't skip that please and if you have to google how to make your own go ahead very important and that's it to finish this off we'll go ahead and add our chicken or turkey brother stock all right preferably homemade but as usual do what you have to do and a packaged broth will work out just fine and then all we have to do before we can use this to make stuffing is wait for it to come to a boil which as you know if you're staring at it will never happen so while we wait we can go ahead and grab our bread cubes which hopefully we have in a nice big mixing bowl and in case you're keeping score at home i did this with sourdough but of course your favorite stuffing mix will work and then even though we're using some dry herbs in the wet ingredients i think we also want to add some fresh herbs in here as well which i'm doing with some parsley sage and thyme and if you want to finish the quartet you could also add a little bit of rosemary that's up to you i mean you are after all the peaches and herb of your stuffing muffins fresh herb but be careful too much rosemary can really overpower things and then what we'll do once our broth finally starts to boil is we'll go ahead and very carefully pour it over the top and at first it might seem like it's too much but you'll see as long as your bread cubes were completely dry it will all get absorbed in very nicely and by the way you see all that steam that's being released as we stir that is a good thing because the last ingredient in this is going to be some beaten eggs and it would be really nice if those don't scramble so what we'll do is mix the broth in first and by the time we're done most of that heat's going to have dissipated and we can go ahead and safely pour in our eggs and then we'll give that one more final mix and basically that's it a fairly straightforward classic herb stuffing or technically dressing if you don't put this in a bird which we're not except stuffed dressing muffins don't sound as good so i'm going with stuffing here but anyway once all that's been mixed up we will go ahead and transfer that into a very very very generously buttered muffin tin and so as to get these as even as possible a good strategy here is to fill them up to the top and then go around with the extra topping each one with about the same amount and yes as you can see we are going to pile these up nice and high and then what we'll do once our muffin pan has been stuffing is take a wet finger and make a nice big hole into the center of each one and while we do want to poke down pretty far we do not want to go all the way to the bottom okay so try to stop about an inch from the pan oh and the only reason we're wetting our finger is it just helps prevent that stuff from sticking to our skin and that's it you've probably already figured out the next step we'll go ahead and pull our gravy from the fridge and place about two tablespoons give or take into each hole and because we made our gravy so thick we don't have to worry too much about it leaking through the sides but having said that try to get it as centered as you can and then once our stuffy muffins have been stuffed we will use two damp hands to sort of pull up and press over that excess stuffing around the sides hopefully successfully sealing all that gravy inside and there's basically two different ways you can go here you can use this method where we put all our stuffing into the muffin pan first and then just pull it up the sides like you see me doing here to seal or if you're into extra steps you could if you want to just reserve like 12 spoonfuls of the stuffing and then use that on top to cover the hole which is basically going to work about the same but either way as long as that gravy's centered and mostly covered by the bread we're going to be okay in fact because we're going to cook this in a hot oven even if you smear a little bit of that gravy on the surface it's still going to crust over and look amazing and work perfectly and that's it once those are set we'll go ahead and brush the tops very generously with melted butter which is going to help us achieve even a darker crustier surface plus when you're talking stuffing you can't really have too much butter and that's it those are now ready to transfer into the center of a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes or so oh and speaking of butter because these might leak a little bit i did put a pan on the bottom rack but anyway we'll do these at 400 for about 20 minutes or until they look like this oh yeah those are some handsome stuffing muffins if i do say so myself and of course it's normal to want to eat something this delicious right away but we really do want to let them sit and cool for about five minutes in the pan before we try to remove them otherwise they might break apart and yes of course you could use some paper liners if you want but i didn't bother because if you let them sit for about five or ten minutes they should lift out easily just like this and then what we'll do to finish these off is of course top them with your regular turkey gravy and in a perfect world i would also have all the other thanksgiving fixings around this but i don't but to hopefully make it up to you i'm going to top this with some freshly sliced green onions and that's it my country gravy stuffed stuffing muffin was ready to enjoy so let me go ahead and slice in so you can see what's going on and what's going on if everything's gone according to plan is a perfect muffin of stuffing with a crispy crusty buttery exterior with a soft moist custardy interior plus in the center a beautiful nugget of molten country gravy and speaking of gravy since that turkey gravy was right next to me i couldn't help myself and drizzle down a little more and that my friends really was tremendous are you hand me some plain thanksgiving stuffing and i'm a happy guy but when i get to enjoy one that has not one but two gravies that right there takes it up to a whole other level and as far as the flavor goes the funny thing is i'm not a huge sausage stuffing guy okay i really do prefer more of a traditional plain herb stuffing but for whatever reason having the sausage in the country gravy somehow seems to work out even better than if we put the sausage in the stuffing itself all right i can't really explain it so i'll stop trying but it really was fantastic so i'm going to go ahead and take one more bite before finishing up by showing you how cool these are going to look in a basket possibly next to a big bowl of persimmons on your holiday table and your family will be like what kind of dinner rolls are those and you'll be like dinner rolls those are gravy stuffed stuffing muffins or if you don't want to confuse people just serve them right in the pan but either way i really do hope you give these a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a
