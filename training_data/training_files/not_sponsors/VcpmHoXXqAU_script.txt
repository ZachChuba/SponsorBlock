greetings my name is monty martin and i'm kelly mclaughlin and we are the dungeon dudes welcome to our channel where we cover everything dungeons and dragons including advice for players and guides for dungeon masters we upload new videos on tuesdays and thursdays so please subscribe to our channel so that you never miss an episode today we're going to be tackling a topic that we have had many many requests to talk about on this channel and that is running games of dungeons and dragons for large groups groups typically involving six seven eight or more players now you've probably heard from us that we prefer smaller groups and if you watch our live play we only have three players and a dungeon master however both monty and i have ran home games for much larger groups for much longer campaigns and we have a few points that we think are important to note about the way that the dynamic changes when you move from three to four players up to six or more players i personally feel that three or four players is probably the sweet spot for dungeons and dragons but things like critical role have really recently normalized this idea of a massive dnd group and there are strategies that you can do to mitigate the problems that you run into when when running dnd for such large groups so today we're going to look at about five of these big problems that you can encounter when you are running dnd for large groups and how to mitigate them and i'm going to be very clear that we say mitigate because you can't fix them you can only make them less of a problem yeah there's a lot to discuss today regarding this topic so let's get rolling first and foremost one of the most obvious problems that you run into with a large group is going to be scheduling this is one of the most known nightmares if you look anywhere in any dungeons and dragons format on the internet you are going to see people talking about scheduling being the downfall of so many campaigns the more players you have the harder scheduling becomes strictly speaking when you have a large group of players you should have a consistent schedule and invite players to a group of that size based on their ability to make the consistent time if your game night is five o'clock on sundays or seven o'clock on thursdays that is the time that is when it happens don't change it this this allows people to kind of get used to a schedule schedule's easier to build when it's consistent and when the people can expect to go to a certain place at a certain time on the same day every week it means that you're going to get less of this okay when is everybody available i can do wednesday and thursday i can do friday and saturday i have tried that method it never is solved people are always busy all the time people make plans at different points but with a large group you're going to get this combination of all these different personalities trying to figure out how to schedule for them by being consistent you make sure that everybody is aware of what to expect and when to engage now for the solutions one thing to keep in mind about a larger group is that it's actually not as much of a detriment if somebody can't make it if you have six or seven players and one or two of them can't make it you still have a good group to play d and d with but what about those players that are gonna miss out one of the ways to solve this problem is to simply run a much more episodic campaign head adventures that are closer to one shots or slightly linked to each other where at the beginning and end of every game session the players start and stop at a base of operations and that way if someone can't make it next week their character is just back at home resting or engaging in some downtime activities with big groups i'd like to make sure that everyone always gets the same xp no one falls behind in that respect i don't punish people for not making it to the game session but you just allow them to fade out and fade back in if you are running a more story based campaign sometimes you just roll with it if their character's not there they're just kind of invisible and in the background for the next little while and once they're back they're there front and center i don't usually have someone else play their character when they're not present i am not a fan of that at all i just have their character fade into the background they're not participating they're guarding the camp whatever whatever explanation you need to be satisfied you kind of hand wave it though there's actually a lot of benefits that can come from this sort of of gameplay idea especially with a large group if you're doing a more episodic campaign style which is probably a series of one shots and you can have your player characters play a certain organization or group they are the avengers i'm gonna use that as kind of a template here the avengers have their avengers tower and for everything that's going on in the city of new york they don't send out the entire avengers squad if one or two of them can't make it and have other things they need to do the team that is available and ready to handle it gets sent out on that mission this also means that you can create a really cool headquarters and you can actually have the players engage with that which becomes a really important part of the table setting and they get to build up their headquarters and their guild together to help solve bigger and larger issues one of the downsides of this is that it does make it very difficult to involve an individual character's backstory and oftentimes when you do this it makes that person very very important and so if you're doing a character arc and tony stark can't make it you kind of got a little bit of a problem on your hands so be careful with those sorts of things and this actually leads into our next point about how you share the spotlight time when you have a group this large and for this we need to do a little bit of pizza math here if you have a group of people that are gathering together to play dungeons and dragons for four hours that time is divided up amongst you think of it like a pizza if you get an extra large pizza and are sharing an extra large pizza amongst eight people everybody gets less pizza than if you were sharing it amongst four players four people so in this way when you have a dnd campaign that has five players including the dungeon master every hour of gameplay everybody gets 12 minutes of spot light time but if you have a group that is now ballooned to eight players plus a dungeon master well you divide that up every hour up people aren't getting a lot of time to play d d or have the spotlight time they actually spend the vast majority of their time watching other people play d and d and so when you have a bigger group everybody has to be on board with this that they're going to spend more time watching and less time playing that can be tough to negotiate and just like ordering that extra large pizza for eight people you have to make sure that nobody takes more than their share if the last person goes to grab their slices of pizza and they're all gone they're gonna be pretty upset so just like that with the time you need to make sure that each player gets a reasonable amount of spotlight time it's going to be less than they would if they were a smaller group but you want to make sure that the spotlight is shared if somebody hasn't gotten a turn to say something in a while actually offer the question to their character specifically to turn the spotlight to them on the other hand another point that i really like to use with larger groups for spotlight is to present situations and problems that need to be discussed amongst the entire group and what you can do here is present the situation they might start discussing it and then after a few minutes of discussion you say let's go around the table and see what everybody thinks and you give each person the opportunity to present what they think is going on and what they think might be the best course of action once everybody has spoken they discuss again and then they decide what the final outcome is that is a great way to involve the entire team so even the person who hasn't had their turn in 25 minutes still gets to engage with a decision and work as part of the group yeah combat naturally enforces a turn order but when you're not in combat with such a large group you actually do want to think about is everyone still taking turns is everyone's still sharing the spotlight i am personally not a fan of using a sand timer to do this i think it's a little draconian and honestly i find it a hassle maybe that might work for your group i just find that as the dungeon master you kind of have to be the mediator or the camp counselor you have to be watching for who hasn't talked for a while who might be dominating the conversation and you know your friends who you're playing with you know who in your group dominates the conversation and sometimes you might have to address it one-on-one and say you know what hey kelly you're kind of taking over all the role-playing it's time to give mikey a turn i do that yeah it happens it's part of the group dynamic you have to know what your group dynamic is and sometimes it means that you have to kind of massage it a bit this whole thing actually moves right into our next point which is about the social dynamic of a large group you have a much more likely situation with a large group that there are people who are coming not necessarily just to play dungeons and dragons they are more there to experience a group social setting they're there to hang out with their friends and have a good time but these people are going to be less likely to learn and understand the rules be prepared for their turns in combat or be able to engage in heavy role playing they're more there to crack a few beers eat some chips and make some jokes with some friends while engaging in a fun table top game which isn't the wrong way to play d and d but it is something to be aware of at a larger group table one of the other things that can happen in the social dynamics of your group is that because players are spending more time waiting for their turns they are often more likely to get distracted they might start side conversations go on their phones start browsing facebook open up their laptops and generally get more distracted and more disengaged from the action that is happening at the table you might need to institute a phone ban at your table which can really suck you might need to shut down side conversations that are occurring between two people and you really have to be vigilant for how is this dynamic working out is everybody still focused on the game and the reality of it is is that this is a battle that you were constantly fighting when you don't have as much spotlight time it is harder to pay attention when there's more time between your turns it just is and how you're going to navigate that with your group is going to be a challenge unfortunately with this one there isn't a clear-cut way to solve this issue it is up to the players each of them individually to bring a sense of participation to the table and if you are playing with a large group you might need to broadcast this and i have learned that you might need to broadcast this multiple times session zero is a great way to say hey guys for this campaign i don't want people on their phones i want you to pay attention when it isn't your turn and engage with the story in a meaningful way i say this at the beginning of any of my campaigns i might need to turn to one of the players and say hey we're setting the scene right now would you mind paying attention and what's really hard here is sometimes two people will be having a conversation about the game which in a way is them contributing but the fact that they've turned to each other and are just having this side conversation even if it's like what if i use this spell to manipulate that guy and what if this hap and they could be talking fully about their characters in the game but if other things are happening at the table that are pushing the narrative forward and they're busy discussing what spells or abilities they might use they might miss the flow of what's going on at the table so even then it is a problem that needs to be solved at the table and if they want to discuss ideas they should wait till the right moment to engage with that at the table if you do have players in your group that are struggling to master the rules you may want to appoint some of your more rules savvy players to be their coach and to sit beside them during the game to be ready to help them for their turn and explain rules for them or just to be the person that goes that's where your attack bonus is on your character sheet so as we talk about slowing down the game we move on to our next point which is an aspect of d d that will always be slowed down by more moving parts more players and that is going to be combat combat in itself is a very slowed down part of dungeons and dragons it's both the most exciting and the slowest it's weird how that works out everything that's happening at the table is happening in a few seconds in our imaginations but the more people that you add in the more time it takes for each person to take their turn my rule of thumb here is that you as the dm need to diminish how long you are taking by being ultra prepared and there's a few tips on that that way you can give more spotlight time and more time to the players to figure out what they are doing on their turns this is one of those problems though that really is hard to solve because as you get a larger group of players you often need to have a larger group of enemies to challenge them so it is exponentially bad um one of the things that a big group of players can do is they can dog-pile a villain in a way that a smaller party can't one of the really simple ways to solve the issue of oh i have a party of eight characters is well now i have a dragon plus a small army of cobalts but that doesn't change the fact that that dragon is actually balanced to survive the assault of four player characters and so eight player characters can probably do some good battlefield control on those cobalts and totally dog pile the dragon and that dynamic is completely shifted so encounter balance just gets knocked out the window it is really hard to do and there is no hard and fast rule for doing this it just it's really going to depend on the dynamic of your group because yeah if you have a party that has a wizard a sorcerer a light domain cleric and a pact of the fiend warlock well now you've got four characters in your party that can lay carpet bomb the battlefield with fireballs there goes your cobalt there goes most of your encounters and it becomes really hard to balance that and so it is just a persistent challenge um i don't think that there's any magical solution for for doing this you just kind of have to be on point with it and the it it just gets worse and worse and worse because the obvious solution is hey let's add more hit points to all the monsters and in so doing now combat's taking longer it's just this awful seesaw there's a few tricks that i use when i'm dealing with a larger group number one is if your group goes past five people i switch to static damage all of the monsters in the monster manual and elsewhere you can find that next to how many dice you roll for their damage is a number and that number is the static damage the average damage that they do for bosses and big scary monsters like a dragon's breath weapon i'm probably gonna roll for that because it's exciting but for a lot of the minions and lesser characters and all of that static damage saves me having to roll dice meaning that it takes me less time to go through all of the monsters on the table my other piece of advice is yes you want multiple targets if you have the dragon and the cobalts they are going to just dog pile the dragon and kill it add more monsters but don't add too many different types of monsters i try to not go above three this way there is only three initiative counts one of the things that you may even want to consider with initiative is just ditching it all together and just going around the table so literally just have each player go in the order that they're seated around the table and then when it gets back around to you run all the monsters it is a little bit of a loss of losing that dynamic thing but i think you actually gain a lot of time by doing this because you don't have to have that whole roll for initiative recording all the monsters down recording everything down another way that you could break it is by by saying that this half of the table goes then the dm takes a turn for half the monsters then this half of the table goes and then the dm takes the turn for the other half if you want to have a little bit more dynamism and maybe you could have the initiative roll to determine just who's going to go first and then go from that player and then around the table you might want to avoid just doing traditional initiative especially with groups of seven and eight a trick that i've done that kind of really leans on that idea is sometimes if the player characters in a large group have dealt with a combat encounter and then fly right into the next one sometimes i even just announce we're keeping the same initiative let's go that alleviates a whole 10 to 15 minute process because if they're going right from one combat to the next we can imagine that they just flowed into each other in a meaningful way and that everybody's still on guard in the way that they were in the previous combat you might have pre-rolled all of your monsters as well these are little tips that can just help alleviate the stress of time if you pre-roll your monsters and keep initiative from one combat to the next that could be a lifesaver sometimes though if your players rolled really poorly on initiative the right choice is to let them roll again because it makes it more fun at the table so be aware of all the options and decide which one is going to work best to help alleviate the pressure of time at your table as i said before you also might want to seek inexperienced players beside your more experienced players to act as coaches or you may even want to appoint one of your players as the battle master and give them a little bit of extra responsibility the battle master's responsibility is to make sure that all the conditions are being tracked they're the ones that supposed to remember who's concentrating on spells so that the all these finicky conditions and status effects and and all those weird things that you have to track in combat you appoint a deputy up from one of your players to help you keep on top of all that especially with all the effects that are going around amongst your players if you do have a sharp player in your group that maybe has experience as a dungeon master or is a bit of a rules lawyer they might actually really enjoy being responsible in this way and helping you manage out things in combat also as a dungeon master when you're running for a large group you may want to stick to simpler monsters more often and avoid using multiple groups of spell casting enemies or multiple monsters that have tons of special rules if you're using monsters that just make one attack and can do a really really fast turn that can really be an important factor more so than even just restricting yourself to only a couple types of monsters just like combat another thing that can slow down a lot in a game of dungeons and dragons is tactical discussion the more people that you have in the group the more opinions there are going to be on what to do next you're going to end up with a war room table there's no yelling in the war room and they're all going to be yelling at each other i'm pretty sure we actually ended up in scenarios where half the table was yelling against the other half because we couldn't agree on what to do next we actually implemented a rule that i've grown to love for a large group and that is that every night when we sit down we elect who the party leader is if there is a disagreement at the table about a tactical decision that needs to be made they turn to the party leader and say you get to make the decision and each person pleads their case and the party leader makes the final call every night we change up who the party leader is if you have somebody at your table who is the captain america of the group and the party loves listening to their ideas and thinks that they are the best decision maker then they might become that party leader but if a lot of people are arguing over my ideas better if you have the tony stark and the captain america well now you're gonna have to pass that leadership around to decide who's going to make the call within this you may also want to draw inspiration again from that appointing the battle master appointing the party leader and you may want to have people that have specific roles of helping things out during play you might even want to grease the wheels socially as well you might decide that maybe one player's job is to be in charge of the snacks and making sure that everyone is well fed you might want to make sure that there's one person in your group that is actually responsible for just saying hey everybody it's break time we're going to take 20 minutes stop everybody takes a bathroom break and manages people leaving the table because with a big group of players there's going to be people that just walk away from the table too right that just don't partake in that way and they have to go get a snack they have to go to the washroom and so you could have someone whose job is just to make sure that that is all being managed and kept on top of so you don't have to worry about that as a dungeon master with a big group it is okay to ask your players to take more responsibility for making sure that things move smoothly it can't be your sole job because it is exhausting to do that and if you find that your players aren't supporting you as a dungeon master when you have such a large group that's when you really need to have a conversation because i think that that's the hardest thing about doing it is there's nothing worse than running a game of dnd for a big group of people that don't appreciate it as a final note one thing to consider when you're looking at a large group is if you have hit eight or more people you might be looking at a prime opportunity to divide the group there's ample space here for two groups of four players which might flow a lot better the question then becomes on do you have time to run two games but if you are dealing with a large group and you are feeling crushed by the stress and burden of trying to navigate the situations that we've presented in this episode the right choice might be to lower the number of players at the table because less players means more time for everybody and it does mean that everybody gets a chance to participate in a stronger fashion which means that even the dm gets that chance to breathe a little and participate even more in the game that they are creating and sometimes that's the right choice it can be an agonizing one i will say that one of the things that has happened nowadays is that when a person says that they want to run a game of dungeons and dragons players come out of the woodwork i've talked to people who introduce a few friends at work or at school to dungeons and dragons and all of a sudden a new dungeon master finds themselves with a group of 8 9 10 11 12 players because rumor got around that so and so is running the game of d and d if you are a new dungeon master you should really consider cutting it off at five i personally like i did it i my first d d game i ran for eight people and it was a mistake really think about how many people you want to invite that first time around and also particularly when everyone is new to the game it can often be a better experience and a better introduction to the hobby in a smaller group of players there is this phenomenon of having people that just want to get involved in playing d d because they want to be part of this whole social interaction and one of the ways to navigate that is that perhaps the solution is not to run d for all 12 people but maybe to once a month have a board game night where you play a board game that is well suited for a very large group of people and invite everybody but then the other nights of the month it's just the d d night where just the dnd players come together so just because you got a lot of nerdy friends doesn't necessarily mean that everybody has to be involved in the d d night particularly if the interest is middling from a few of those participants they might be perfectly happy just playing board games so this has been our tips for running d for large groups if you have any tips that we missed or have any advice that you think you could share on how to navigate large groups
