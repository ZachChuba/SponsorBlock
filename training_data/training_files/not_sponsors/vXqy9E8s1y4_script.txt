hey there everybody it's Adam here from Tesla Australia welcome back to another video well it is software update time so this afternoon actually while we're on a little bit of a break away during the school holidays we've had a new software release pushed out to the car thankfully I did bring my gear with me I did believe that we would get this software update kind of in the next few days or so since release after the wider roller in the US so I did bring my gear with me just in case just to keep the normal trend of trying to get you guys videos out around the same time as the updates kind of hit our cars here in Australia so like I said I have my gear here I do have the update I have freshly installed it so let's have a look at what's in this release I'm not going to do the full kind of navigate on a pilot test that I normally do just because I am away I am up in the Blue Mountains right now so I don't have my kind of normal circuit that I tend to kind of take you on when I get normal software updates but I do have something planned for tomorrow I do plan on doing quite a decent Drive once I get home back up to the Central Coast on navigating on autopilot to actually give one of the new super - I'm not supercharged is a rapid charger test tomorrow afternoon so that video will probably drop on Thursday so I'm kind of going to split my normal video that I tend to do in - so we're gonna do a bit of a review of what's in this release and we will do a bit of a quick drive as well just to UM to see if we see anything new in terms of visualizations and and that kind of stuff so stay tuned for that alright so we can see in the car the car is now running version 10.2 which is 20 20 20 4.6 4 you'll see here as well that this kind of your software is up to date as of July 7th at 4:03 p.m. so it kind of gives you that little timestamp in terms of showing you I guess the last time it's checked for an update and whether you are running that kind of current release if we move over to the release notes so you've probably seen some of these from other YouTube videos but I'll kind of reiterate them but we do have some improvements with the backup camera so now we're actually going to get the left and right pillar cameras will show in the backup camera which i think is awesome it's going to make such a big difference to parking and especially here where I am parked right now at the outside of the hotel I do have the tilt on the mirrors down when I'm going into reverse just to kind of help against curbing the wheels but that's going to be a whole next level of of kind of looking out in terms of making sure you don't get too close to the curb and other obstacles so there's going to make a big difference so we'll have a look at that the next one is dashcam viewer improvements which again I think is something that's amazing from Tesla to update so right now you will get a bit of a red dot will appear in the video scrubbing section just to show you where that century mode event kind of triggered so you can kind of skip straight to that rather than having to try and manually scrub through the video trying to work out where that particular event happens that's going to take a huge amount of strain off kind of plugging through a whole bunch of century events and just yesterday alone my park the car for a few hours I had 75 of them so I'm not going to go through all of them the car looks like it's in fine condition but again if I did need to look through any of those I can then obviously look for the red dots to to go straight to those so we've also got some tuning improvements as well so with this update we've improved the usability and discoverability of tuning stations and podcasts are there easier to browse you also have the ability to speed up the play of podcasts up to two times which is pretty cool so we'll have a look at that and then walk away door lock improvements as well so you now have the option to disable walkaway door lock when your vehicle is parked at home so really comes in handy for those of you that park in a garage and don't want to have to worry about going out to the car with your phone or your key card you can exclude your home as an area where auto look will happen I won't be enabling that cuz right now my car is parked in the driveway so I obviously want it locked at home so I'll be leaving that alone we also have the ability to select Portuguese as your language school so more I guess multilingual support is is obviously good as well so not something that I actually require but good to see Tesla improving the language detection in in the cars so that's uh that's pretty cool so that's it for the release notes so let's have a look at some of these new features and see what they look like alright let's go in and actually have a look at these features now in a little bit more detail but before we do if please do consider doing so as it does help my channel grow alright so if we have a look at the back up camera so really to do that while the car is stationary if you just hit the normal kind of backup cam and you will get the reversing View as you normally do but then if you simply kind of swipe up you will then get the left and right repeaters so kind of like I said to you before this this kind of spot I'm parked in right now is it's kind of on a curve so it is a little bit tricky to get in and out of obviously side mirrors pointing down are great but having a look at the left and right repeaters as you reverse will will definitely make a huge difference so that's something we've all been asking for for quite a while from my perspective the next logical thing I would really love to see would be the the top-down view or the 360 view of parking so when you're kind of parking giving you that top-down view to show you really half value out from the curb or other obstacles so but that's a really good start so it's going to come in very handy so we can swipe that down when we're done if we want to get back to just using the standard reversing camera so that's really cool if we now have a look at this century cam improvement so this will give me a view of all the different kind of things going on if we just scroll back through these are the bunch that I said before all kind of century cams that that kind of happened when it was dark but if we have a look at this one here you'll see has a nice white model three that was charging yesterday when we arrived but we've got this kind of red dot down here that that does show you when the actual event happened this event is actually me and my wife going back to the car when I'm or heading out to go for a to go for a walk but if we just go and tap knee the dot it will it will start to hopefully yep jewels down a little bit further and you will see once it gets to the dot it's actually my wife that actually triggers the triggers there's the century event to occur so again saves a whole lot of scrubbing through clips when you can kind of move straight to the one that you are after so a really good addition there so it thinks Tesla for that it's gonna save us a lot of time the next one is the improvement in tuning so you can see down here the tuning icon has changed so it looks really good and then as you go into that you've got all new menus on the left hand side so if you have a look at all kind of the podcasts and stuff that I listen to generally when I'm driving around again you can see those there quick access shows you all the latest ones that are there for you as well as popular in your area as well as local radio we can filter down on podcasts and different categories which is quite cool music so again different kind of music stations that you might want to listen to sports on Pinterest to have a look at the inner NHL one at some point news as well as general radio and then if you've got a chain in account then you can log in so that's a big improvement that looks really nice it was tuning was one area over of the the kind of display that didn't look amazing but has definitely improved so again well done Tesla on that one I guess the last improvement I'll go through is the kind of lock at home I walk away door lock so I've got a obviously set to on if you want to exclude your home address you can exclude that there just by checking that box so that's not something I am going to do like I mentioned before I park outside right now so I wanted my car to be locked at all times when I impact at home but again if you are park in the garage and you're constantly going out to the car this will save you a lot of time and having to not worry about your phone or your key card when you want to get into the car so that's that's pretty cool all right so now we just want to see how easy it is to get back into this parking spots using the new side repeater cam here which is quite cool so we are going to just let these people in there's Tesla out of the way nice new more or less looks quite new anyway and it's nice that the repeater cam here came up automatically which is pretty cool so this definitely does help in conjunction with the side mirrors I don't make it too close to the gunner which I haven't go forward just a little bit more and I think that's all right sorry that's pretty cool so that's that's definitely made that job quite a bit easier definitely a nice addition there from Tesla so obviously more testing to do with that I definitely want to give it a bit more of a test with Auto Park as well just to see if that makes a bit more difference at least from a supervision perspective as well just making sure you're kind of between the lines and making sure there's no other obstacles in the way so that's that's all very good but that's going to be it for today's video just a relatively short one like I said I will do a bit more of a longer video tomorrow which will probably go live on YouTube on Thursday night
