hey there Adam here from Tesla straya welcome back to another video well today isn't a software update day unfortunately but it is some good news because of the Cova drools relaxing here in Australia we are going to go on a bit of a road trip so we're going to go up to one of our favorite destinations to head in winter time obviously it's winter here in Australia for apologies for those of you that are watching outside of Australia in the northern hemisphere but we are going to have to the Blue Mountains or a bit of a road trip for the night so I thought I would do a little bit of a vlog of this particular road trip a little bit of autopilot testing as we go along some of the motorways it's interestingly a point that I want to cover whereby sumoto is actually merged so I actually want to see if the car will decide to take us from motorways a motorway as Tesla document is possible with the full self-driving functionality so stay tuned on this video and we will walk through a bit of a weekend road trip for you [Music] all right we are back so as I mentioned earlier we are going to try and see if the car will decide to go off the motorway through the interchange and onto a motorway like Tesla do advise as possible so we're about a kilometer away from our exit the car has taken this exit in the past even with the old broken autopilot computer but we'll see how we go and it also has been a quite a few software update since then as well so I guess I'm kind of expecting that things would have hopefully improved by then so 500 meters away or so let's see how we go indicating oh no complete fail complete fail let's see if we can handle at least the interchange here this is relatively simple so I wouldn't expect the car to have problems here but who knows now this stretch of road has also changed since we've driven here last time but the car does have updated Maps so hopefully it knows what's going on form what my answer there's a bit of a merge here which is fine do that pretty well not a bit of a merge car up front spewing smoke out everywhere [Music] I wants to move over which is fine and I think we're good so overall the interchange was fine but the eggs are there was a completely broken so maybe let me know if you've had a chance to drive that stretch of road and if you have success that eggs that it is a pretty major exit so I would have expected the Carter to probably do better there but it didn't so oh well we'll try again next time all right we are here at the Blue Mountains it is quite chilly here actually it's only about ten degrees right now Celsius so thinking as well I've just moved the car and I am actually going to plug it in to charge here at the Fairmont Resort it is it is complimentary for guests by a charge point so obviously figured those of you don't want to use that you will need it type 1 to 2 cable as well so I've got mine here at the ready so just have a look here here that I am using for my model 3 so basically what we'll do is we'll connect the type 1 cable into here and then obviously the type 2 cable goes in here into my model 3 so let's let's plug it in and have a look and see what charge rate we get all right so here we are in the car so we've plugged in as you saw before I had the type 1 cable from charge point plugged into my type 1 adapter which gives me a type 2 cable at the end which obviously plugs into my Tesla Model 3 so plugged in just a matter of simply tapping the the app or the card from your phone against the card reader it will unlock one of the ports or either or of the ports this particular unit has two and then basically the the charging will kick off so as you can see here we're getting a nice constant seven kilowatts six to seven kilowatts which is nice I've set the car to charge up to 90% which is nice and it looks like it will be charged in seven and a half hours which is which is cool so I'm gonna head back to the room and obviously get some sleep shortly and then I'll come out in the morning and move the car I will be checking in on plug share just in case there is people that come in and want to use this unit above and beyond the the I guess the spare port that's there already just in case anyone needs to reach me so which is a which is a good thing to do I believe with community based charges so if you haven't used the the plug fish plug share app I highly recommend it and obviously try and check in when you can when you are you when you are using these two public charges just just in case especially if you're going to be utilizing them for a long period of time like I plan to so really really good really happy it's a great service highly suggest if you are looking to stay have a look at the Fairmont resort up here it's like I said it is it is great but uh I'm gonna head back to the room and get the kids sorted for bed and I will chat with you in the morning when we unplug and head out on the way home [Music] [Music] all right we are back next day on we are going to see if the car will decide to go the opposite way so off the m4 onto the m7 which as you saw earlier in the video failed heading down the car has to make another lane change here which it hasn't indicated that it wants to do yet I might have to force that one myself potentially because it thinks this is the correct lane to be in which isn't right so there's no one around so I'm just going to give it a second but yeah no it hasn't it hasn't taken that exit correctly which isn't great it is a new stretch of road though so maybe that could potentially be why even though even though we've got new maps I would have thought it would have taken that okay all right let's see if we take the left lane up here to get us on which it's done that okay a little bit rough but it did it seems to be the trend with freeway exits unfortunately breaking for the corner which is good okay getting right into the Sun now see if we're able to navigate a lane change here which looks like that's a well I did it but it didn't indicate which isn't fantastic but it did it let's see if we can get on here okay it's gonna do that double lane change isn't it and I didn't left it very late but it did it okay so I guess maybe just a pass in terms of that obviously it failed to take the overall exit so we would have ended up on the wrong road unfortunately but once we got it on track it decided to finish it off which is which is quite good [Music] all right well that's gonna be it for today's video we had a really good weekend away up in the Blue Mountains and especially after Cove it and everything else that has gone on that area was also devastated by bush fires so if you're in the position to really recommend you trying to head out now that especially in New South Wales things are easing and we are able to get out but definitely get to areas that have been affected and try and obviously help the economy in those areas grow which is because what we had tried to do this weekend and had a really really good time doing so obviously got the car and gave it a good run as well first time while it's been out so we had a really good time just gotten home so time to unpack and get started editing this video when time prevails but as always thank you so much for watching really do appreciate it if you haven't subscribed already please do consider doing so as well as if you like this video and also please do give it a thumbs up as well it does really help get my videos out there and getting people to watch it that perhaps wouldn't have done so if the algorithm didn't pick it up so again thanks so much and I look forward to chatting with you on the next video bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
