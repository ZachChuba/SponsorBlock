all righty folks welcome back to another episode of eggs or yeah brought to you out thanks to them much appreciate it what's up dude do you have the hammer which hammer the one that you use to move this around when you were using it yep that I do yep I'm gonna go get some basalt and I'm going to use it in order to I have some basalt oh let's okay I have some basalt too dude all right sounds good isn't it crazy how they salt and salt Bay and sound so similar yet mean two completely different things yep that's pretty deep pretty yeah no no that's that's what I was thinking was that it was deep mm-hmm I knew you would I knew you know I always got your back man thanks dude thinking about food as well are you thinking about food I ate before we started do you pizza do you actually is you don't know it's Tuesday you do taco Monday but no I it's it I don't have a designated I mean Taco Tuesday is actually a thing I know I know that's a thing okay but yeah that's not that wasn't the what I was going for it was just you know just a way to express so you were getting rekt by miniaturization it was not getting wrapped by miniaturization I'm just trying to figure it out and now look it looks like we figured we have exactly don't demean me too late don't you do you mean me okay d me me me me I mean you can meme me if you want but don't D me me yeah I got you your way tracking is seems either the current mean is it a little bit I do like how I have seen on several occasions a post about somebody not reacting their weights on another subreddit and people will reference it there it's good make sure it makes you feel important and kind of know it just makes me feel like I've created a movement that has real good implications for the world yeah because I always appreciate it would be more important than making sure people react their weights not much I tell you exactly that's what I'm saying do that's what I'm saying all right so we got the miniaturization set up now which is fun times we have to figure out how it work that we do my friend right so the PAC machine walls have a hard foggy stone block of ender pearl and assigned an ender ender amethyst I don't know why I had a hard time pronouncing that yeah you uh you kind of went in the direction there how do we get him ender amethyst ooo that's out of the that's out of sifting isn't it yeah the compound maker which i think is what I need it should make some compound Sood machine case so I need silver sheet metal and block of signal them and then Ruby be thrown rubies away probably how to stop that but have you do you see any UI or anything to go with these I know it looks like it just initiates when you do whatever the process is you throw in the catalyst or something like that do I have to make it there's a 3x3 rights for you like this and then that in the middle it's at 26 doesn't seem like the right amount maybe it is maybe it is hard foggy stone is that different I have to go to a dangerous place oh yeah it said the misty world is dangerous if you start getting close to the core and I have to do that apparently well I wish you nothing but the best of luck yeah okay well I guess I will wish me luck because if I if I do monetize there could be bad bad time could be bedtime did all right you know like wishing me luck and it's it's good luck thank you thank you thank you appreciate it I guess I'll replace my filter Cole the brand-new one dude no I'm gonna I'm gonna go down there alright you go down there let me go down there know how to do it alright you do it I'll do it don't let anyone stop you using your dream you don't seem concerned for my well-being all right I'm not gonna I can't chunk mine all the way down to frickin bedrock no cuz I'm not willing to like you know do I'm not on chest duty again that's it's a hard no from blow no also like going mining down that far is kind of absurd it's absurd what I tell you okay well signal them I guess they can kind of dip whenever though so we've kind of avoided signal them up at this point but I think we can do it we don't have an alloy mix maybe I want you to make now a mixer I'm going down dude I'm going down I'm going downtown in an earlier round yes that's how easy we have Adobe though I do I know what's the bricks okay yeah I have I have Adobe - no you have it's true I actually I use Adobe Premiere and but I use on images okay I'm nervous fine oh wait I got hard foggy stone Oh easy oh this is cake just kidding not easy it's not easy at all nope it's not easy it's not easy being cheesy it's actually uh it's actually level obsidian well this is a this could pose a problem you don't have the ability to do not have the ability to mine it no no yeah so how are we gonna resolve that do you have your neo but if it dammit even UUM yeah that's what I'm trying to use to mine it okay so your beer you're flexible doesn't work and the neo deputy meme doesn't work yeah I guess the thing is I guess if I yeah I don't think I can chunk mine this far down hey wait well in that case how are we gonna get a hold of that stuff huh anybody have any ideas on that mm-hmm okay I'll make sure to make invert but that's gonna be melting recipe so inferring get a newer blend which is iron and nickel right now we're getting nickel out of this city and is there an obsidian pick can I just use I don't think I can use these chunks hmm Oh Stingo great or cool there is no exit there's an obsidian hammer but I don't know if that qualify I needed to get the dusts I'm gonna put our city in the u.s. real quick may or may not be worth anything but never did figure out that machine how do I get dusts and ingots are you okay I made I made a yep somebody made a good recommendation which is try out the block breaker on it so I will do that but can I have the hammer yep there you go alrighty cool that could be it family those don't go there problem is I have to break through Hey one of them Hey before I can do it what's up no you said I have to break through hey you know oh I have to break through hey as well dude it's an icebreaker that goes through the system or does it get stuck someone supposed to be smoking up a storm what do you got for me what do you got for me you work you know work what's the verdict what's that shoot where did I go down Wow Oh now why am I is this a so it's freakin acid rain god dang it my supposed to do with it you right-click melting okay they melt it no they said people put into a furnace to have to mine it because I can't find where I dug shoot sorry sorry Doug that's real annoying okay we'll mine down new place new plan alright so this does take cool so in theory if this is to work we should be able to take 1 & 2 right so to loop and one that was two so assuming this is working there you go let's see if this were keeper key you're making plates I won't it doesn't seem like you're working anyway I'm working exactly use me alright you got down to it again give this man's a try out here hey I think it worked yeah it works nice that's what I'm talking about and for once we don't have to worry about lava being all over the place where did my iron go dude oh there it is alright what do you got you got nickel you got iron I can't you why are you not that stays on why are you not alive it's a good question I don't know that state is on I'm not talking to you I'm trying to help you're not helping you're not helpful you're not this is now this isn't it's makes a super meme I'm a little bit what did I do to you that's a long list my friend yeah you want to lay down on the couch and talk about it yeah yeah I you know I just can't afford that much therapy Oh ed why it was an expensive therapy rate well no I'm just saying that to talk through all the things that you've done to me it's gonna take a while and hmm right of course of course it's a lot of it's a lot of cost do you have an expensive therapy rate I thought this went in the melter oh oh oh really is that is that the game and then I got it then I got a hand makes it yeah and then from there I can just smelt it okay we are up to 24 okay well perfect dude we got this I'm making mega progress here mega progress absolutely mega hey you know what on the plus side we actually needed the ender pearls I'm fairly certain oh wait I think we're gonna need a lot of enterprise oh well not not the dust that we were upset that I converted some of the dust into ender pearls you know we use we use the actual ender pearls too we do we weren't upset it's just we needed dust for a momentary thing and you and your haste had already used it okay well we need dust for the Litha right which requires 84 oh so we need dust again yeah but I thought I thought we did at that we didn't need dust no we do in order to get the little right we need the dust that's the thing so oh and ER pearls only four okay cool or the interval block anyway we're probably gonna need more of them in the future regardless okay I'm like 18 recipes down from where I started where I wanted to start what are you trying to make I don't even know at this point at this point it's alright listen things okay I gotta make this pulverizer and if I can get some power to it then I don't have to use that crushing thing anymore and then I have the thing it's it's been an adventure okay I started off on the solder and then we ended up on the compound maker and then we ended up making a signal one which then needed an alloy which they needed invar which then because the crushing thing I needed to like anyone use the grindstone so now I want to pulverizer in order to be able to crush the thing anyway it's been a it's been an adventure mm-hmm but we're working it we're working it okay it's it's progress it's a work in progress so you there that make oh no oh yeah why did I do that that was bad interesting reasons that's fine I can fix okay so I need 20 of those and how many did I make okay anymore all right you want to see me probably do this wrong are you gonna do the first miniatures I am gonna attempt to do it cuz I'm gonna do a miniaturization here oh you are sweet yeah okay see how this makes I get it I actually get how this works okay they're not cool so I can cool I hope that this works that I don't know how to start it but I do get how it do well I mean I I'm just making the structure it told me to make and then it said whoa would you look at that and then it shrinks it down to a single block right well no it made a recipe makes compact machine walls so I don't actually know how the multi block structure ends up being multiple blocks it's not the miniaturization I was looking for but right hey we got 32 of them and nice I should be able to use this method - this should help if I want to move my base to the mid wood we can move our base how do we move our base check if I know dude wait was that three or four six one two three four okay so I'm gonna have to look that up I feel like I don't trust myself with that kind of power I don't trust you with that power either that there and then this should circle around and then how did you activate it hmm there should be a thing listed in the bottom right corner of the recipe page and jei oh like a catalyst you throw it oh I need a topes so I need to throw a topaz at it yeah so we need to get back to those earlier staged meshes because it looks like we're getting him but I'm throwing him away right now cuz I was like we don't use these so oh so I just throw it at it Oh yep fire need power now I can make a polarizer it takes the power out of the Topaz Oh energy stored within the chemical bonds yeah this is taking a minute moment like uh oh wait is that that's just like a this is just a frame for me to be over the pulverizer oh my god grace yeah no no then all the machines every machine everything that we have good times ahead of us my god good times ahead of us compact storage now the design I have in mind gives me the opportunities for hundreds of stacks in one magical blonde okay machine machine a frame oh and they have to be gray good what my husband great the glass how do we how do we go the floral from Bataan yeah right of course it is that of course do we have any gray flowers let's see what we have out here yes that was the most insane like lead-up that I've ever seen it the most insane lead-up alright so we need some shears which I have and then I can pluck that okay so we're we're we're good we're out here I thought we had a way to mana in fuse in the mana pool but I guess not so I guess we have to use mithril for this we are getting mithril chunks now yeah so I'm gonna use some of the mithril I guess what else is it gonna go for if not that block of men they infuse myth oh yes thank you so much you went and then I need to tan it's pink it's couple ten gates dude um are there other graves we probably don't want to use all of our Grey's yeah there's bears okay cool I I am familiar with how to prevent that situation alright cool cool alright so I need to turn glass into per a glass look at all that glass that's just Auto crafted mm-hmm you've done it good thanks man that doesn't work all right so we get those and then we're able to I need a lever and the two ingots and then we should be able to build the piston got that and then I just need the redstone reception coil right which is have we made a mortal mortar and pestle I don't think it's difficult but I could be wrong and no it's not difficult but I just didn't want to waste time if it is it's in that chest over on your left the single chest at least that's where I wouldn't know of it yeah no well I'll put the one that I'm gonna make until there okay cool all right so there's the tin and that'll give me some stuffs there and like 14 levels down from the refractory casing yeah it's it's like I have bits and pieces of yeah I'll start that one and then I get down onto this next machine I'm like oh I got about this first like oh my goodness an entire stack of those didn't give me what I needed okay so what's right why why is oh it actually has to be it's shaped okay cool all right so you a circuit board which is two vacuum tubes and copper plates and to read some chipsets do we have written since we want so here's all right well this is cool I need a malachite do we have any of those huh are you talking Kolkata nice nice nice I forgot that you put those into there seemed like a good way to sort no you you bring up a good point it's a very good point that you've brought up and I agree all right you want to watch a new miniaturization sure okay I'll set it up I guess cuz I got to do a little bit of work to make that happen so piston liver in those three slabs that should be making something for me oh it's all right here's those lever and it should be everything the piston over the cobble do you take all over a cobble there's cool and then that leaves me with just the gears I like it when I accidentally place glass in the wrong spots and it was my only one now I have to do it again if if you get it in the right spot the first time you avoid that and whatever dog whatever Doug I don't mean you're bringing me down like that okay yeah don't bring me down dude all right well I'll do my best to not bring you down dude thanks man yep all right look at that pretty cool it's pretty cool are you ready would you like to witness yep hey that's very similar to what I made I know it looks pretty similar look at it it kind of it kind of disconnects everything when it's shrinking just a little bit I kind of like the idea that very walking in there and getting disease so what's going on crack have you weren't small enough already dude you get in there dude they'll be bring you down to my size there we go watching the frame RF tools compact the storage even more compact the yeas oh I need to make a modular storage now okey dokey oh oh I don't even have to miniaturize that one that's exciting no I still make the copper plates and the redstone chipset which goes right here where have we put our nether quartz another quartz is in the drawers Oh sweets with so many things it's hard to keep track of everything man along with so many things man is so demeaning what's the meaning of modular storage we gun done did it alright so or this it's or gold nuggets and then a sit in a carpenter and support money to anything else when we got the carpenter right now acid perfect huh all right modular storage what happens when I put the block down I wonder well you get the things for storing stuff so I assume it needs like dry it's don't worry I'll pick it up I was just seeing what it is hey or could I just know can't throw it in there and until probably I get something else but this is exciting oh this is a good path to work down I'd like to use this path oh I made a pulverizer what a fun path that is a fun bath Oh Chester valuables is full of valuables well I don't know what to do what do I do with now that I have this where do I make it do things for me I take it up to the machine room would that be my guess well no we probably if it's actually gonna store items we probably want easy access to it I just don't know I don't know how or what what to do at this point so it's hard to hard to guide okay you can store a recipe open Oh open manual yeah good plan why does a storage box create you where you use it if we're usually you must insert a storage module there are three tiers 100 200 300 stacks you can assert modules to make the chest work better with various types of items when you remove a storage module from the modular store X block contents copy to it okay we have over Iser now all right this is exciting storage module can we make it oh I wonder if pulverizers double up the those or chunks and stuff that's expensive it's so easy oh my god it's so easy to make it's so easy to make yeah what I've been working with is not what I would personally qualify as easy to make okay well I have exciting developments that are taking place and what's taking place well you know I feel like everything is too good to be true in this modpack like if you think you know what would how it's gonna work you're about to be in for like a terrible shock when it doesn't work that way happy surprise but what I like to think is that this will actually work okay that makes sense I too like to think that things will work out fingers crossed dude fingers crossed there we go I'm a couple of them see if it works and does the does the deed let's go let's do it tear 100 the rise Eid Medina but a doom Bumba ding I like it and I can smell tea it's melting cool I the only problem is I can't remember what I need an import you've got you've gone so far down the rabbit hole you forgot where you started Oh long ago I yeah yeah wait is this go into the mixer I like that you took maybe you didn't maybe this way I was about to blame you but it might've been me oh my god it's so easy see you it's so easy bro yeah yeah we out here we're out here we are out here dude we are out here RF tools is coming in hot RF tools is coming in hot dude oh my goodness wait I'll just put it here okay go RF tools Harper did you put copper in here no I probably not oh you mean did I like do that today no I did not all right so I want to squinty all right someone but I think it's me it's me you do melts interesting interesting I've never seen this before yeah but isn't it cool isn't it good yeah how do I get something I just click it out okay it's so easy that it holds up to 200 things yeah nice yeah nice bro and you could store recipes recipes you store recipes I gotta make that augment like if you if you just want to easy access to a recipe you just store the recipe oh my goodness bro I don't want to make the highest here is gonna be very very expensive to make I'll make more of the modular storage machines oh this is real good times dude it was the best of times yeah I put those tending gets done it darn it and so invite-only eatin should have been more you wit know all right I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make one more of those machines and see if I can pour out two of these I don't know make things they don't wear out oh that's what's up Alexis get up yeah I set that so I would know when to order some food actually I should probably do it in like another five minutes right so I need to pour two of these out grind it back up so that I can then melt them back down it's very verted process oh wait no you can't do that cycle to the next storage module I don't know what that means oh don't do that so now I have ten of those that I can put in here and wait but I don't want grind invar I want to grind nickel no wonder I'm a I'm so confused on why I didn't have enough suddenly but it's cuz I'm bright as a lamppost with a burned-out bulb uh-huh that's a funny one Thanks now hey now that one all right uh then that means that I don't want environment that I want I need an invar make a stamp okay so that gives me that what swap and which wah-wah man I need to gear or so to any two of those and then I should be able to put the plate back okay which means that I don't need to use the I can just use the regular furnace I don't need to use the pour out and the slow thing in order to do this okay cool that's nice is it that's a good thing yeah dude we're happy about that mm-hmm I'm making another because these are easy peasy lemon squeezy you're just as you've said all right so now that thank you timer I forgot I put on oh you put on timer to timer - what was your time timer time no a redstone timer oh okay I thought I thought you meant like you know it's a timer no no all right so the alloy I had the refectory the restaurant okay you've probably read stone in you did he's right there that's not permissible would have thrown it in here there alloy linearization - cool - cool for school all right we should get more mithril though cuz apparently mithril is a very useful thing so I have learned Oh apparently our chest is filled didn't take long good things yeah oh yeah also you know what pipes are fast yeah yeah I do I do know that room is missing one exposed concrete block are you okay hahaha are you kidding me are one of these a concrete block we do have decent amount of ender dust though so that's nice good [Music] so what do we do with the mithril chunks oh they just smell directs oh that sounds pretty easy yeah dude RF tools oh my god it's gonna be great I mean I suspect that we won't be all our of tools but we might be in a good shape I think we're gonna be in a great shape what it what a wonderful shape I've seen some good shapes okay and then we need to make end and dimming new minimum dust and sodium I'm gonna make and mmm I've made 10 cool two of the things go and make a that really reduces your output I even needed that weight but this so this got a set up over the over the melter and and be involved and all that now yeah maybe yeah cuz I look so that's where I was confused on those there's a lot going on up here we've got we've got machines Oh plenty but I don't my a my foundry I don't think my foundry is very founded I think you put something in and I don't know what it is I just accidentally click something in this frickin thing dang it ripp must not have been that important it's probably pretty important nah probably pretty important Oh is the glass okay let's be honest with ourselves here was itwas hmm that's not gonna bother anyone okay all right ordering some foods you order that food I have it all cued up ready to go if my data works and an order has been placed you know the thing about this place is it's actually wild the last couple of times have ordered from here they have it ready so quickly it's like I don't even have time to dry I wouldn't even have time to drive from the place to my house and somehow the delivery drivers showed up I'm totally gonna drinks it but it's been wild it's definitely not Kevin the delivery driver it no it's never been Kevin that's Kenneth is who you think Oh Kenneth Kenneth right right yeah so I have to build another foundry you did another foundry dude either move this one but I don't think you want to move this one or else I need to upgrade this one like expand it there's a lot going on I can tell you some straight with strenuous a word yeah yeah yeah strenuous that was definitely a word it was double let me check to see if this doubles ow why am I in fire take some rain take it did you light me on fire no I really didn't I'm up here I don't know how I don't appreciate your instant suspicion of me I actually don't know how I lit on fire that was bizarre every now and then I think you have a chance of lighting on fire from being over a torch where you want to torch oh that might have been it all right we got another modular storage and I'm just gonna use it over here I guess just Chuck a bunch of stuff into it just check it or just a bunch of a bunch of check oh that's the induction heater okay so that's where that is so in order to melt stuff effectively I need like four induction heaters which then I can use the melting trip but wait how did how do you sliders how do you stack induction heaters though good question I don't know the answer to I wish I did know what oh right cuz I put the induction heater on and it like barely heated it was like it was like a weakling induction heater yeah and so I need like more I don't know how to do more is that I didn't have enough power so I do have a lot of power we were trying to piss powered off over this off of the oh that's what it was it wasn't for induction heaters it was for of the thermo piles to run one induction heater that's what it was this is very exciting I'm enthralled what you just kind of like I just hear you like anxiously and eagerly rolling through various chests like just give me all the chests yeah yeah definitely give me all the chests Oh buddy dude I just Oh it's cleared I just cleared it dude I just cleared them all clear them all out bro I mean oh man it's good it's good good times look at that look at that look at that and then I guess I could potentially do one more thing like over here but I don't Oh God we could insert they don't connect to each other do they know that you can do a remote one though you could it's another modular machinery you can make it's a good question Who am I I don't know dude I don't know well I'm glad that you're excited about the storage yes it's always good to see you get into it you know mm-hmm they'll feel like you're contributing every now and then oh let's see how do we make an item oh we have so much lead all right oh yeah the leads not a problem ain't you got 99 problems but led ain't one of them is this underneath okay but I still don't want it get it I had to I had to say it with authority show it who's boss around these parts I thought you have to pee on it for that I have people apply before this is the mosquito but I would advise caution cuz that can get pretty itchy if things go hey what do you mean mosquito bite on oh no no I'm you're peeing utensil yeah I got you that would that would not be terribly fun I agree with you on that one why did you put a torch here it depends why what are you looking at and why are you asking me um you waddle him then you dab then you put a torch down right here just wonder there you go oh it's a closed it's closed room wait why is the room not closed okay well I'm working I'm working there what are you doing I'm trying to build stuff and you always catch me like I've had this room closed for like the last one I need that engineers hammer I just need the blocks inside here I know I it's okay whoops I didn't mean to that don't let me I can fix this okay I just I just need to tippy-tappy yes okay good and then go thank you and go do your business again um it was very stressful was it now it was so sorry I was stressed no you're not you don't you don't feel emotion I don't feel emotion oh that's fair yeah yeah I mean you know I feel like I feel like we're close enough we can we can finally we're close enough to not admit our motions we're close enough to not confide emotions in each other I mean yeah I I'm just gonna leave it here what we're just gonna I'm tapping out of the conversation okay you do that I'm getting so good at making this I have the structure memorized and then I hear that the malachite so I thought I was good at making it I'm so good at doing this I just goofed up yeah well no I just forgot it I forgot a catalyst I mean I forgot the catalytic converter write it down here and then I need to make the LV connector made out of these which are made out of the Las Vegas connector no but now instead of having everything in this large chest that I can just access now I can take the time to pull it out of here I just want you to know that I am taking one for the team here I'm making four of these things and I will tell I'll put a sign over each one of them telling you like what the particular arrangement is so you make two of these modular things yes oh there's the other one and it has so that's what's happening I was confused because I kept coming back and I'd have weird searches but it turns out that it just remembers your search like I'm like why is this a gla audit what's going on looking for glass yes okay be efficient don't type the whole word just type what you need to know you're fine you're fine so AIDS stone that's what looks for stone which is an right how do I make these of the saw the stone good yeah I kept like why is this filter here okay so there's that and I've got more of these and I need some cuts of the wire okay and then some basalt smiles and they look you and I will put you all right here right there there are yes I put you right there okay he's very good and then I just need to make more this one probably ought to be insulated if I had to guess we're just focus man we're getting we're making it have you better believe right now right now there are things that there's forces at work that people don't understand you better believe it dude now I do have this over ear which is in theory still connected I need a real Inc of that oh really let's burn some wire across the ceiling I was gonna go through the top which is how that's actually wired already Oh what if I what if I had you remember yes I'd probably forget I'm gonna try to put an additional feature to use here okay so I do want to come let's that means I don't even want this nice well done go me and I want this to be really instead I want to lose two relays a stove wire yeah and then tear to do that we store it and then make one oh my god that's cool that's cool that's really frickin cool dude it's really freaking cool like how cool on a scale of one ok so check it oh I want to make one of you use craft it let's wait no no no no ok let's do a little crass Q doodle oh yeah I made that oh that's pretty cool that's pretty cool oh what's that do we need a we want tier two let's craft one of those all you got there we got that dude we got that dude we got Auto Crafton boys I mean I wasn't there so it's pretty cool I can auto craft the storage things for the additional modular machines and there and then Oh buddy are we crushing out here up here alright I will be transferring all dimension related items from these couple chests here into this yep there we go go ahead and put it into that oops alright what temperature we have well we what did we do we really need all this soured soil I have no idea in fact I don't think so no okay cool so oh definitely just kind of throw that away see how power is doing if it's draining out oh oh what's so it's the temperature the the melter is still going up no I need to find it there I don't need all this it just what what's the issue just going through power a little bit faster we're making it oh yeah that's not fun how hot did we need to get this how did Cole get it - was it 1,400 1,200 did did all of our coal just go our IP in pieces didn't you be gaining you be gathering back up with me turning the power off guess not okay well uh power manufacturing not 100% at the moment but we can build more windmills or everything we can recover we will we will do that and many more things alright so you're building back up good we almost got enough power to do powerful things that's good wait but we didn't quite so not right but okay do you know how to make I don't want to make more the the Koch knows going on during the heo that - what excuse me what's coca-cola yes okay that's what I said burning okay it shouldn't be it's not my goodness I have no idea yes man is talking about uh it's just it's a heck of a thing bro alright well now I have gone and I've cleared out our large chests here that is taking the drops from the thing the sieve and I've gone and oh boy we are organized we are all organized here dude well I made figured out how to make a pulverizer and then also eventually figured out how to make invar managed to put that together created an alloy mixer and then promptly realized that the ally makes her doesn't run off power it needs to work off the melter and I've got to redesign that whole thing then I wired up everything to get power over to the melter the melting crucible and then prompt we found that we don't generate enough power to actually run that so I have disconnected that and put the other one back in place and it will pursue additional pylons windmills at another time so that's that's where you're where you're at and that's where I'm at you know hey man I feel like I've just opened up a lot more space in here you know yes I like it you you know if you had some windows in maybe we can make this work open the place up and when you break the modular storage it keeps the thing in it and you can score the to a new place it's amazing it sounds amazing and now I've got to deal with you typing random things I'll try to remember to right-click after I do that each time so that I can either not entirely but almost just as fast to just sort of like just go I'll grab this grab this I should actually if you do these sort by columns it does show more so I should do that on each of them there we go increases the viewability of it if there we go yes yes there we go sir my name you also can you start by a count oh but 64 is the max Oh sort my name is definitely better bro oh my god it's so good oh he made four of them yeah cuz I was like well we don't because it can't store everything we have to break them into kind of where we knew we were storing things before so I made one for you know we were storing a lot of the dust related things over in this side area over here so this is all the best stuff from the from the Sims this is all of the kind of dimension related things other you know different mods we have kind of like our ember stuff our misty dimension stuff some of the power stuff and everybody core stuff maybe you should come over where we store all of our what I mean we can we can work this out yeah I mean all yeah all you do is break the block and move it it's really or can you write no you can't do this shift right click you go just break and replace but it's easy but it's easy and that's what's important this is I mean it's way easier than refined storage it doesn't require power it's just it's way easier than what frickin Emme systems and all that stuff requiring a heck of power did I'd say we did good work you can still do it you can still do it man it's ok yeah ok oh all you need to do is make three machine frames so you just need to make two more I see in order to complete the next challenge thing ok don't act so sad we made good things happen today [Music] I'm sure that refined storage will be an improvement over this stuff okay let's turn that crouch upside down on three two one go we go alright well thanks to that you like also in that same description you can find a link to the playlist my cap shop on any
