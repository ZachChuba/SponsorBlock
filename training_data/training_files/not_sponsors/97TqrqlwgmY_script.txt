hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to dream catchers fly high and you and I again I already reacted to you and I if you haven't seen that here's the link but I am reacting to the story I think it's called a nightmare arc and you and I is part of that so I'm gonna watch it again I might cut together only like the highlights and leave only the highlights and because I have reacted to it before and I've heard the song even before my previous reaction it's like the third time or like the second time I would watch it so I don't know if it's not interesting I'm just gonna leave in the parts where I say stuff about the story or like interesting stuff in general so nothing just kidding I already filmed this intro but my internet couldn't handle to load a freaking three-minute video so I had to wait until it was loaded and then my camera battery died so hopefully I can film this reaction now i preloaded both videos so they should be ready to go if they're not I'm gonna scream I'm drinking coffee maybe you can tell before I get into this if leave a like but you don't have to I did a whole recap in my previous attempt my story that I understood is that they're like spirits or ghosts someone in the comments said that they're actually nightmares which makes a lot more sense because it's called a nightmare arc or whatever and each member has their nightmare listed on k-pop profiles which is a really cool idea but also I would be low-key terrified that some crazy person is gonna like you use that against them but yes I remember thinking that they were like ghosts or spirits and I don't I'm still super confused on who the guy is I don't know who that person is I don't know what he does I don't know if he's evil or if he's good I don't know if he's on their side or if they're evil or I don't know but in basically chase me they were like either they were just like playing around with him or they were trying to lead him um like two clues about them and then a good night well and good night I understood that they like switched places with him like this they are now in the real world and he's in some kind of parallel universe I don't know I'm really glad that I finally get to watch fly high I really hope it explains everything but also a lot of you told me that there's really no clear storyline that was like explicitly said that the story basically is just like interpreted by greens omnia so yeah I don't know I'll just let you know what I get from this if I can finally watch it that would be so great I'm gonna watch this and then read the lyrics the second time through so I've already seen like the first 30 seconds of this in my previous attempt okay let's do it hopefully wish me luck [Music] today we're saying in my previous one that the butterfly thing is beautiful [Music] that's uh pretty oh okay wait I need to get my head into the this is prequel [Music] [Music] that's a spider right mm-hmm [Music] okay so far this is just confusing them I really like the song it sounds a little like animes intro asks [Music] there was a bell shoe [Music] yeah [Music] Oh Oh that song is so good [Music] what's the sunny visual [Music] I wanted to pause it before it does that I hope it doesn't have to load again okay oh thank god okay first of all I have to say the song there are elements that I really really really love in the song but then there are elements that I feel like don't fit with the rest of the song but overall I really like the song this might be my favorite song of the nightmare series so far okay let me read the lyrics really quick I'd listen to it again but what a sunny visual it said sunny visual in the corner I was like thinking I was watching from a different account but it's happy face I'm drinking coffee yeah you can tell a dangerous rainbow is engraved unlike this part so much of course is so good honestly the only part that I feel like doesn't fit with the rest is the bridge because I'd like everything so far everything like so far I love this song so good but now we have the electric guitar which I love this is so good and then we go to this part where I feel like the instrumental just doesn't match like it's too shimmery I don't know that's the only part that I don't love about the song knowing that they're supposed to be the nightmares makes so much sense also with the lyrics like you can't fall asleep forever in the stream and then they're saying something like I'm gonna stay with you forever in your dreams and you can escape me and something like that it was just like if they're a nightmare it makes so much sense okay the video I like this video a lot visually this might be my favorite video as well so far I think it's very clear that's very like chase me and goodnight were really kind of like dark but not like dark like theme wise but literally dark visually obviously this is also the prequel so everything is like happier here so that's also why it's probably lighter but I just feel like this one is so much clearer you can see what's going on it's not super like there are fast cuts and stuff but I still feel like you can tell I don't know you can see what's going on there's not too much going on I feel like I don't know I've really liked this video and I really like the song in the beginning I didn't really know where it was going cuz it's a lot of different like we have this one with the butterflies which feels like peaceful but then we have this one which is like a horror film and then we have this effect here and then we have this which felt a little bit like I don't know like an anime plus the music as well like I don't know and then it made sense like we got into the story so I think so gu sees a spider she was gorgeous oh I have really I have the same earrings oh I have the same earrings as to you so geo sees a spider which we don't get to see right we don't we don't see the spider there's nothing here like if they wanted us to see the spider it would pour is this it no I don't think that's it so gu catches a spider and brings it into this room and then this all of this happens which I don't know so I don't know I feel like the spider I mean I know I have seen you and I of course so I know the spider comes back in you and I but there's also this hand and I don't know is it's this hand like also everyone is double oh my god maybe it's a witch okay so here's my okay so here's my here's what I'm guessing so G you caught a spider but the spider was actually a witch disguised as a spider so this arm is the witch's arm and she puts like a curse on all of them that they're gonna be nightmares or they're gonna live out their nightmares or something like that there you go like this is GU right I was so confused cuz I was like wait that's you but then also J was looking inside so everyone's double now okay I don't know what that's about okay so then the witch put a curse on them that created another version of them that was like evil and then killed off the real word Vorenus this is like too much there's too much room for interpretation here give me something to hold onto because this to like there are two you yawns right she and she and then we have this black stuff coming out here like what unlike the mirror which is a freaking cool like this is so cool I wish you could see it clearer I wish I had a closer shot of this or without the smoke so you can really see this because this is so cool well we also have the cult because they're gonna wear like hoodies here right so we're but then it says so the witch converted them to her side so either the witch like separated their souls from their bodies or something and their souls are like evil and they're stuck in this parallel universe in a cult now or she just created like another set which was then which is evil so they all have like an evil twin now which and they're all in this cult in a parallel and they're gonna maybe they're maybe they the cult is gonna like but banish them to the other universe I don't know I don't know this is too like this is too vague like I need some more stuff to go on and then she comes there with like a like what like what what is you young doing she was like going there with the American if a magnifying glass and then she was there and she was like oh come let's go don't look at it and then then she loves it looks at it with all these crazy shots wait is she burning it there's like smoke here is she burning it umm and then those butterflies I don't know what that is about like they're all vanished so I'm like is she so that's the good you you heard the good gu which is band into the other universe I don't know I don't know because then also it like she closes the gate as if like okay nobody can enter but then also they cut out like they cut this picture as if it's not them anymore you know so I'm that's what I'm going with that's what you and I I've seen you and I I've heard it I've reacted to it so I'm just gonna cut in my comments I guess but I really I was thinking fly high would give me so many answers because also the guy didn't show up at all the first time we see the guy is in chase me but then that doesn't give me any clues to what he's doing I'm guessing if the real girls were like banished into the other universe then I'm guessing that he is looking for them so this is would then be the real you yawn which is trying to escape back to our universe and those are the evil ones I mean okay no they seem so evil look at them they're so evil like she's like copying and like manipulating pictures look at her being all evil look at that evil smile but then they're doing this thing with you young X or you eight other exercise saying I exercise exort I don't know what that word is her I'm just confused if there are two of them or not because they're doing they're performing an exorcism but but they would only do that if they were good and they wanted the good to go the bad to go away but there are the evil ones right I don't know you look at da me with her freaking skills this is not a flashback right and whereas like we are now in the current timeline so this lady is then the witch right she doesn't have the tattoo on her hands but then she's the spider because she also like turns into a spider here but why is you John taking pictures of her like she's the evil yu-yan right so she knows but then she's like surprised and then this is again I guess that the witch spirit [Music] okay so maybe the other universe that we see here is a flashback because huge it looks like unions getting possessed but then she's also trying to escape yeah so you young was trying to go back to our world universe but she couldn't but then they did an exorcism on her like what is this then aren't they evil but they're also doing it in this world on finger no this doesn't help at all I'm still so confused I don't understand if there are multiple like there have to be multiple there have to be multiple of them because in every video so far we've seen them in two places at once so there have to be multiple but I'm here I'm so confused because they're exercising I don't know if that's the word you're on here right they're like they're doing something to huion but we already saw that she on with this red suit is evil because she's like laughing evil and she's burning the pictures of the girls like here right so she's evil so I'm assuming that they're all evil so then what is you young like maybe okay so okay okay I have a theory you yawn for whatever reason was not possessed yet like she wasn't evil yet what happened in good night with you young but she was over there as well okay so this video makes me think that for some reason Julian wasn't evil yet and then they were like exercising or whatever the word is and her good soul so that the demon could take over but their nightmares how does that work I don't know my god um I know that people say that this storyline is very vague but maybe it's just a little bit too vague I mean maybe the other two videos are gonna clear things up because also she's also running away but then the I guess the demon catches her I mean it doesn't here in this shot that we see with the mirror it doesn't catch her but maybe it does in the end so that's why what is she doing here yeah I guess she I guess the demon got her cuz she's standing there like all ominous and stuff here all evil so huion is not but then they're doing that here I'm guessing like they're all evil and they're taking over here yawn as well and but then what they're what are they doing here are they trying to go against it are they doing do they know that they've been possessed but they're wearing the same stuff as in the other one but is you young as well no huion is wearing something different so then do they know that that their bodies have been possessed in the other world or is that the same world this can't be the good the same world because they're literally wearing black here and white there as in like the good and the evil right I'm just so confused with huion I knew choosing yu-yan was a good a good thing I knew she would be the one she's the one to confuse the out of me gu is the one who does the ritual right gu is just dust you hear so she was the one who's doing the ritual on you yon then you yawn in the good universe opens her eyes maybe as in like her good soul entered that body and then in the choreography even GU is the one who like chokes you yawn as in like I got you but this is the evil no to you because she's wearing the black stuff so okay I don't remember exactly what was going on with with you yawn and chase me and goodnight if she but because I felt like they were all doing but you young was like I remember in one of the videos I think it was goodnight you yawn was like running away in the cold situation so maybe she was like pretending to be bad so she wouldn't get caught but then they did did they catch her I don't remember it's actually really fun trying to figure this out is actually a super fun you yawn is like entangled in the web as in like their like surrounding her and she can't escape or something then what's that does that mean oh they got her so she she's now a bad one cuz they caught her I guess and that GU is running away even though GU and the first one was the one who was closing the gate like in the first one in there in fly high she was closing the gate yet you was the one who closed the door in fly high so I thought she was already evil but apparently but then also GU was the one who had like she was playing piano but then she was also looking at herself so I thought you was already bad but then she's getting possessed by the spirit here I guess I don't know okay so I mean I remember not so good night they switched they got out of the universe right so maybe maybe in good night the good spirits got out of the bat like out of the banished world back to our world and then here the demon is taking over again I'm probably so far off and you're all just like what the are you talking about after having watched the last video of this storyline I'm gonna watch them again in the order of the story like chronological order yeah so that's all for this reaction I don't know if that was interesting it's actually really fun trying to figure out the story it's just I feel like I'm so far off I mean I know you you said that there is no true story to figure out because they never really said or like confirmed anything but I'm sure there is like some kind of story that I could get I just wonder if I am getting it I don't think so I really like fly high a lot so far I really like all of the songs that I've heard from dreamcatcher there it's not a song that I don't like so that's great and I really really like that there so like I mean they're not heavy metal at all but they're like in that direction like rock kind of music there's not a lot of groups I feel that do that kind of music especially girl groups so I really like them I really do like them a lot plus their whole concept with like the nightmare like horror like theme is really interesting to me and I like their videos especially like the later videos again as I said like chase me and goodnight the videos were a little bit too kind of all over the place but I feel like they're getting I mean I've already seen PD and I like I really like that video so I feel like they're going in like a direction and scream I've seen as well so I think video wise they're going in like a direction that I like a lot so yeah thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoy it feel free to discuss theories in the comments I'm a little less sad I guess that I didn't get it I I'm just kind of having fun and I'm excited to get to the end of the story and really try to figure it all out I hope that I can get close to what it's actually about because again like here I'm not thinking about the fact that they're nightmares it just doesn't like I don't see that like I guess those are the nightmares standing there then like even that it doesn't really make a difference I'm just trying to figure out the relationship between the good and the evil because I do think there are two but even not even that is confirmed I guess I don't know is it I don't know oh my god I don't know okay anyways thank you for watching bye [Music]
