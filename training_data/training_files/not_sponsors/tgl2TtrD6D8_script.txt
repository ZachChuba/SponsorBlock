what's up Greg welcome back to another episode of the war is one so a lot of you might not know this if you don't follow me on Twitter which you should but the last like week and a half of my life has been just filled with unnecessary drama it all revolves around the video that I posted last week about billion surprise toys if you watch the video that I posted last week you probably remember me saying something like billions surprise toys has been taking down every video that people make about them every single video they've been taking down because they don't like what people are saying they're turning them into a mean but for some reason they hadn't taken down my video that I made about billion surprise toys so I made sure to brag about that so I posted that video last week everybody was loving it the critics were raving the reviews were great most importantly though people agreed with me that they did Papa very very dirty they just straight-up replaced him with this new stepdad whose name is probably Chad I was actually getting really good feedback on the song that I made in that last video too which is very surprising to me because I I just sort of made that as a joke but people seem to be legitimately emotionally moved by that song so I'm sorry if it made you sad but you know what it is sad it is sad and I miss papa also a lot of people were trying to tell me that this this new stepdad was Papa and he just shaved to that I would like to argue unless Papa's really been in the gym lately and his hairline changed it's not Papa all right Papa's the doctor now we saw that in the video you'll also notice while I'm explaining all of these things I'm not using any footage from billions surprise toys I'm not even gonna use any pictures from billions surprise toys and that's because of what I'm about to tell you next if you don't follow me on Twitter and you got a chance to watch the video right when I posted it last week then you probably don't know this but billions surprise toys took down that video they copyright claimed it and actually didn't take it down they just had it blocked in all countries so I don't know what the difference is but the video wasn't deleted it just said blocked in all countries so I guess if you don't live in a country then you could watch it and guys this is where the drama really began I mean I guess I couldn't be that upset about the video getting taken down because I was just boldly Brad my video about how they totally missed the last video that I made about them I was [ __ ] talking them and they didn't take down that video so I got a little bit cocky I bragged about it so I sort of felt like okay that's fair I mean that makes sense but the funny thing is even though they took down that video they still didn't take down the original video the one that I was bragging about and that one has way more views it's got like over two million views it's one of my most viewed videos now but I think the real reason they took down this video in particular is because they were worried that step-papa was now going to become a meme and they would have to replace him too with someone even more ripped and hot if that's even possible I also took just the little song the music video at the end of the video and I posted that on Twitter and it was doing really well and then they removed it from Twitter also which really sucks cuz it was like it was one of my most liked tweets here's the thing though when you upload someone else's works to YouTube if you just straight upload a movie or a TV show or a music video a song something like that the person who owns that totally has the right to take down the video unless unless it falls under fair use which is like a legal thing I don't really know what it means I just know that commentary videos like what I made fall under fair use so my video was totally fair use and billions of prized stores probably knew that they really didn't have any right to take down my video because it was totally legal for it to be up so I was like okay I can just dispute the copyright claim because my video is fair use and YouTube will appeal it and then I'll be good the video will be back up but here's the problem YouTube's copyright claim system works in a very weird way where if I were to like appeal the copyright claim YouTube wouldn't look at it and be like oh this is fair use they would just send it over 2 billion surprise toys and be like hey a billion surprise toys is this guy right is this really fair use is he allowed to use it which is kind of dumb cuz billion surprise toys put the false claim on the video in the first place so do you really think they're gonna be like huh ya know now that you mention it this is fair use we're totally sorry we didn't mean to do that and it also said that if billions surprise toys decides to keep the copyright claim on it they could also give my channel a copyright strike and if you get three of those then your channel gets delete it so I was like okay I guess I'm not gonna do that there's no way that they're going to let me appeal it but luckily somehow my manager has a contact at YouTube and he contacted them and was like hey this video got taken down for no reason can you guys get it back up and to my surprise they were actually like sure yeah your your video is totally fair use it should be up so things were finally starting to look up YouTube was on my side and then we're gonna put my video back out so like two days I think after it got taken down I woke up and I checked Twitter and a few people had tweeted me saying your videos back up and I went to my channel and lo and behold it was the video was back up monetization was still disabled which was kind of weird but I was like as long as the videos back up and people can see it that's fine with me I just wanted people to see the video cuz I thought it was a really good video I made an entire song for the video I put a lot of work into that I also had a brand deal on that video so the fact that it got taken down was kind of a bummer because I was contractually obligated to have that video up but the video was back up and I was feeling good so I tweeted that the video was back out I think I had a little badass line in there like Papa will not be silenced or something like that like Papa's story must be told the video is back up and we are sticking it to the man I kind of did feel like a little bit of a badass if I'm being real with you I felt like a little bit of a savage honestly and I think rightfully so I felt like I was really sticking it to billion surprise toys so I tweeted out the video people were loving it for like one minute and then like one minute after I tweeted out the video I started getting tweets from people like it's not back up what are you talking about the link just takes us to Us page that says the video was taken down they took down the video again I don't know what happened it's like they were just trying to [ __ ] with me they were playing like mind games with me they wanted me to get a little cocky just for one second just so they could shut me down again and now I look like an idiot cuz I had tweeted about it acting all cool like Papa will not be silenced and then people click on the link and it takes him to a blank video page now look there were a lot of reasons that I wanted to have that video up to get views yeah get more subscribers of course that choline obviously but the thing that really got me the real reason that I needed to fight for this video was for Papa all he ever was to be a good dad he just wanted to sing songs with his son about eating sugar and getting out of bed and together bad thing and billions surprise toys just deleted him out of existence just because people thought he was a funny character they deleted him and then the second somebody comes along to call them out on it like I did in my video they silenced me no justice for Papa this was no longer a fight for me this was a fight for Papa so after this whole thing where they like put up my video and took it back down just to [ __ ] with me I was like okay I have the legal right to have this video up right they didn't have the right to take it down so I decided that the only logical thing for me to do would be to tweet I'm looking at my legal options against Billy and surprise toys to try to get my video back up because they didn't have any right to take it down and not even ten minutes after I tweeted that I got an email from YouTube saying that the copyright claim was released what I don't know if it's a weird coincidence and YouTube's really just fixed it like they said they were going to or if literally billions surprise toys was so scared of me even just reviewing my legal options that they just like release the copyright claim on spot the video was backup it was monetized again honestly I really don't know what happened and why the video got put back up I'm just happy it did it just goes to show you how much you can accomplish when you review your legal options you know I think I finally understand what those Instagram ads mean when they say legally skilled cuz I feel pretty legally skilled right now whatever the reason that they released the copyright claim on the video I'm just happy that Papa's story will live on so if you haven't watched the video yet because you didn't get a chance to while it was up originally and then it got taken down it's back up now it's totally monetized there's a song at the end of it that I think is really good and there's an ad at the end of it so please watch that there still is one problem though that I never got fixed like I said I posted the music video on Twitter the video that I used in it was heavily edited a lot of it wasn't even Billy and surprise to his video I didn't use any audio from billion surprise toys it was a totally original song I didn't even sample them but they got that video taken down and it really stuck because it was one of my most liked tweets I was getting really good feedback on it people were like legitimately enjoying the song as a song so we contacted Twitter to just like we contacted YouTube but Twitter's response was basically yeah your video does seem like it's fair use but it's kind of out of our hands they didn't really want to do anything they didn't want to get involved in this copyright dispute so maybe I'll just have to concede on the Twitter thing maybe the song is just something I can't beat Billy and surprise to a time I got what I wanted with the YouTube video the video is back up but maybe people just weren't meant to listen to this song is something that I thought and then also made it into a full song and got it on iTunes that Spotify and every other streaming service and then it got to number one on the iTunes comedy charts for like three days straight and also has over a hundred thousand streams on Spotify I'll link to it in the description there's a whole nother verse that wasn't in the original video I highly advise you listen to it if not because it's a good song then just because billion surprise toys doesn't want you to hear it so overall this was a very stressful experience getting my video taken down that I worked very hard on was definitely disappointing but in the end I think we all learned something with perseverance a lot of dedication and just a little bit of reviewing your legal options you can fight the man in this case the man being Chad [ __ ] you Chad this whole experience really got me thinking about Nursery Rhymes it seems like a lot of billions surprise toys are based around Nursery Rhymes the Humpty Dumpty one especially I got a lot of comments about that and how I kept saying that Humpty Dumpty is an egg and he's depicted as an egg and everything but a lot of people commented on that video that nowhere in the nursery rhyme does it say that Humpty Dumpty is an egg and that's a very good point it doesn't it just says that he's sitting on a wall he had a great fall and they can't put him back together so when did he become an egg like what how is he an egg but literally in every depiction you could find he's an egg or at least like a sort of a fleshy human egg hybrid I've seen that in a few places too so I really got to thinking like what is Humpty Dumpty supposed to be what is the nursery rhyme about is the nursery rhyme actually about a human falling off a wall and when he hit the ground he likes splatters into pieces and all of the king's horses and men are trying to put him back together it's just like his torso in his head and they're trying to like pop his arms and legs back into his socket like a mr. Potato Head also why are the horses helping it says all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty together again why would the horses be able to help the Wikipedia article for Humpty Dumpty actually says that nobody really knows what Humpty Dumpty is about there's lots of different theories that range from King Richard the third of England to a cannon I'm guessing they introduced the egg character because like the image of a human falling from a great height and splattering into pieces and people like desperately scrambling to try to put him back together and like I don't know put his intestines back into his stomach and his eyes back into his socket was maybe a little bit too gruesome for children back in the old days at least that's what I thought until I started looking at other nursery rhymes and their [ __ ] up I think that billion surprise to us actually takes a lot of inspiration from nursery rhymes because of how bizarre they are take this classic nursery rhyme the lullaby song rock-a-bye baby billion surprise toys actually has a video where they sing rock-a-bye baby even though they change a few of the lyrics from the original but have you ever listened to the lyrics of that song like the real lyrics cuz there's a modern version but then there's like the actual version first off what does rock-a-bye baby mean rock-a-bye baby it doesn't mean anything that's just like a string of random words put together I'm gonna come up with a nursery called string sauce camel baby okay here's the lyrics to the real rockabyebaby song rock-a-bye baby on the treetop when the wind blows the cradle will rock when the bough breaks the cradle will fall and down will come baby cradle and all so this is like a song that's meant to soothe kids right before you put them to sleep right how the [ __ ] is this supposed to be calming at all to kids hey so the second you fall asleep I'm gonna put you up in a tree during a storm and the wind is gonna blow you off and you're gonna fall and die goodnight why does falling from great heights seem to be a theme in nursery rhymes Humpty Dumpty falls from a great height kids are apparently falling out of trees while sleeping I feel like nursery rhymes in my head at least are supposed to like teach kids a lesson their little songs to help kids remember valley lessons was falling off of [ __ ] like a big problem in the 1700s or something I feel like every kid that listen to these two Nursery Rhymes probably grew up with a paralyzing fear of heights or at least falling asleep because they're worried that their mom's gonna put them in a tree why would she put them in a tree that makes no sense don't even get me started about ring-around-the-rosie because that shit's about the plague did you know that actually wikipedia says it might not be about the plague but a lot of people think it's about the plague and we still sing it anyway like the lyrics are like a pocketful of posies ashes ashes we all fall down there's also a version that's at issue at issue we all fall down it's about people sneezing and then falling down dead it's just like a fun little way to teach your kids about how a third of all Europeans died during the bubonic plague it does seem a little outdated though who thinks we need a song about malaria to teach our kids hit that like button if you agree guys I guess the way people raised children was just different back then because I feel like now you always have to be like happy around kids and teach them like oh if we work together we can solve everything teamwork and the world is great but back then we were just straight-up like yeah people die all the time from awful [ __ ] getting stabbed diseases falling off things mostly falling off things and those are just the popular Nursery Rhymes that we still sing today have you ever heard about Mother Goose people always talk about mother Goose like she's like the queen of Nursery Rhymes she's this great children's figure have you ever read a mother Goose nursery rhyme have you ever read like a real mother Goose nursery rhyme cuz I found this article full of like old Nursery Rhymes some of them are from Mother Goose and they're like 10 times worse than the ones that are popular okay I'll read this one to you old father longlegs can't say his prayers take him by the left leg and throw him down the stairs when he's at the bottom before he long has lain taken by the left leg and throw him up again I have so many questions who the [ __ ] is father longlegs is that like a spider like a daddy longlegs cuz I throw him down the stairs too if it was but if it's just some old man with long legs why why are we throwing him down the stairs he's just like this old man with abnormally long legs who's having trouble saying his prayers so we're like knit down down you go mister and then we sprint to the bottom of the stairs and throw him back maybe it's like a demon father longlegs that sounds like it could be like this creepy creature with really long legs like a Slenderman type thing in that case I'm fine with this one let's together throw him down the stairs in fact okay here's another one it starts off weird but it also stays weird die [ __ ] die shut your little eye when you wake find a cake die [ __ ] die I could not begin to tell you what this one is supposed to be about the beginning sounds like a 6th grader on Xbox Live and the rest of it just doesn't make any sense when you wake find a cake die [ __ ] die it's like it it starts off mean like [ __ ] you die [ __ ] shut your little eye like go to sleep and don't ever wake up but then it's like when you wake find a cake and so he's not so mean after all it's like and when you wake up I'll have a delicious dessert prepared for you and then die [ __ ] died alright here's one more this one I think has a pretty good valuable lesson for young boys and young girls okay here goes I married a wife on Sunday she began to scold on Monday bad she was on Tuesday middling she was on Wednesday worse she was on Thursday dead she was on Friday glad I was on Saturday to bury my wife on Sunday ha ha ha ha oh what a great little rhyme to be reading to children it's just a fun little nursery rhyme about a guy murdering his wife because she was being kind of annoying and gradually got more annoying probably because the husband didn't fix whatever she was scolding him about in the first place it's a great lesson for young boys and young girls for young boys it's like if your wife is being annoying murder her for girls that's like if you are a wife don't be annoying or your husband will murder you just the language they use in this is so weird she began to scold on Monday ok so I guess she was a little bit annoying bad she was on Tuesday she's just at this point she's it's the mirror just not working she's just bad eyed she's bad middling she was on Wednesday I don't even know what that means was middling mean moderate or average in size amount or rank so what the [ __ ] does that have anything to do with your wife average inside is that just like a body shaming thing okay she was bad on Tuesday but by Wednesday she was have Ridge sighs he believed that [ __ ] but it only gets worse from there as you can tell by the next line where she was on Thursday and then we get to Friday where she turns up dead and he was glad on Saturday night to bury his wife on Sunday well I think with that that's enough nursery rhymes for I don't know forever I just think it's kind of interesting that maybe children's content has always been kind of weird just in different ways and billions surprise toys is no exception so like I said over the past week or so I've been getting a lot of really good feedback on the songs that I put in the last video in fact I've been getting a lot of good feedback on that song and spooky guy and the bar ice cream wrap and a lot of music that I've been releasing lately which I really appreciate but a lot of and thank you to Skillshare for supporting me all right guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you're new here make sure you subscribe I'll see you guys I'm with a really interesting video where I challenge a clone of myself to a fight to the death but we end up realizing that we are deeply in love and we live out the rest of our lives as a happy couple bye
