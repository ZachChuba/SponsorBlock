this video is supported by brilliant dad work SpaceX recently has launched its second fleet of sixty Starling satellites the launch was a tremendous success but unbeknownst to most of us SpaceX is now in a precarious position whereas launching more satellites at a rapid pace may face international criticism of it being ignorant to the negative consequences but not doing so would confuse SpaceX investors who have put billions of dollars in this operation let me elaborate on this you see what star link is about to do is quite unprecedented 40,000 satellites in the sky is more than anything we have seen before one of the defining features of those 40,000 satellites is their low altitude this enables them to reach the earth much easier with shorter latency in force the quality of StarLink services however this also creates problems for astronomers those who are frustrated sporting Starlin satellites instead of stargazing though Elon dismissed the visibility of Starling satellites as negligible he followed up instructing teams as SpaceX to look into the albedo problems before it becomes a major issue according to National Geographic the latest reports indicate that the Starling satellites spend most of their time around magnitude 5 possibly as faint as magnitude 7 on the magnitude scale that the bigger the number the fainter the light in other words Starling satellites will be visible if Elon Musk doesn't do anything about it this has never happened before from time to time satellites have been spotted in the sky but never informations not to mention the eventual 40,000 of them this is an ethical gray area where there is no rule against SpaceX operations but people's sentiment against it is legitimate this is the first issue especially considering the huge size of Starling satellite fleet the second problem arises from the fear of collision a European satellite that measures the earth wind using lasers had a close encounter with one as SpaceX Starling constellation two months ago in a situation that illustrates the growing inadequacy of existing systems for global coordination and orbital issues and as ISA explained these maneuvers are actually very common but there most always to avoid debris and that satellites not active ones this causes concern of the higher possibility of collision were SpaceX to launch all of its 40,000 satellites in the next decade further considering the chain effect of a space collision where debris from one collision sets out more collisions in sequences we should take this problem very seriously again the huge Starling fleet size increasing total satellites in space tenfold is not to be dismissed easily thirdly while there is no international law against SpaceX launching its satellites we have to consider its business repercussions if 40,000 Spacek satellites were permitted to launch what is there to prevent the Chinese from doing the same how about Issa the Russians and the Indians if Starlin satellite constellation is justified to orbit Earth there will be no stopping other countries from doing the same 40,000 Starling satellites 40,000 Chinese satellite 40,000 European satellites so on and so forth we have not even started to consider the plans of private companies such as oneweb and Blue Origin this is not a sensible possibility going forward as the space is already crowded but what could be the best alternative StarLink is critical for SpaceX survival and Ilan's go of getting to Mars in a recent episode I've explained starlings critical role in financing SpaceX new starships and Mars trips it is evident at least analysts at Morgan Stanley the SpaceX a hundred and twenty billion valuation in 2040 depended on a successful Starling project but more importantly SpaceX has promised its investors of a successful StarLink I mean Google's 1 billion cash injection to SpaceX in 2015 at a time when SpaceX launched record was very weak was not charity Google expected SpaceX to keep its promises and Elon must dually follow-through StarLink success is also crucial to Mars plans where huge profits is needed to build bigger and better rockets it is the only way to get it funded this is the precarious position SpaceX is in balancing investor and financial objectives with legitimate ethical and safety concerns more importantly all are happening charted territory SpaceX could make the decision to slow down the launch cadence to make sure there's no negative effects of Starling but there's no rule that blamed SpaceX for not doing so so what could alam do well there are obvious solutions to mitigate certain problems they are also unsolvable problems in my opinion for example the light pollution problem could be mitigated by using different materials for satellite services to reduce albedo Elon has instructed his team to work on it there might be a solution soon as for the collision problem maneuvering in space will be a necessity in the future so it is rather a sign of progress in my opinion however the proliferation problem will be hard to solve as it concerns Internet infrastructure and national security now that the Chinese saw what US has done to Huawei it is very possible there's such a huge constellation of satellites over there airspace will be met with similar resistance perhaps a fleet of satellites providing competing services in terms of capability China is still many years behind by shoot the commercial value of starlings be proven Chinese innovators will quickly catch up considering China's superior space capability second in the world in my opinion for those of you who are not convinced of the Chinese capability let me just present two pieces of evidence to counter any skepticism first the Chinese bado global positioning system and second China's successful Rovers on the moon the most curious reality about the StarLink experience is the confusion of accountability and oversight we can talk about SpaceX moral responsibility all we want it is at the end of the day responsible to its shareholders and customers first of all therefore StarLink must and well be pursued but the concerns with light pollution space junk and satellite proliferation is nevertheless a legitimate one we probably need more international cooperation to solve this issue especially important is to involve the Chinese starting satellites in the sky at an unprecedented number would inevitably result in problems that we have not seen before such as light pollution and possible collision but the answer to progress should be more progress not aggression we should strive to use smart engineering solutions to solve those problems rather than abandoning Starlin we'll get 20% off the annual premium subscription
