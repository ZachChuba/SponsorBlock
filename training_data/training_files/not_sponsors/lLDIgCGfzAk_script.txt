coverage for even Lynas drop proof protection here we are Asus hasn't even set up yet in here in fact this is like they kind of pulled me aside from the pre briefing thing and they were like okay yeah that stuff's really cool but like come on in here we got this and I was like that's an ROG Strix Skaar - why are you pulling me in here for this everything about this is like basically normal strict star stuff so you got a bunch of ventilation for your cooling you got a bunch of heat pipes and you got a bunch of heat sinks because you got powerful graphics six core 8750 H processor you've got like a bunch of i/o SD card reader and you know RGB backlit keyboard and is this individually backlit yeah individually backlit cool that's good stuff alright so okay so we got we got RGB you know asus living up to their reputation clearly no Thunderbolt but lots of display we got you know wired networking and all that cool stuff and they're like no no no no hold on a second Linus don't walk away yet cuz I was half I was halfway I was halfway out of the room and like look you guys don't even respect me enough to put away your packing materials before CRA seuss are say soos breath is hiding he's hiding back there cuz he's like oh no I'm gonna get in all kinds of trouble for this but he's like no come back come back because this thing is what I have been asking for for so long so first of all they've added some better rigidity so the thing with Strix for asus is they can't seem to decide if it's a premium brand or if it's kind of like their value brand because they've got rog like the high-end rog and then Strix was like kind of this value one but then they're like no no it's like it's for gaming it's premium and they're finally taking that seriously so they've added more metal to the bottom of the chassis so this is now a really rigid chassis like it makes the overall device feel quite a lot better still a little flimsy up here room for improvement there but you know baby steps right but the big thing the big thing I've been asking for is watch this holy crap so for years now I've been saying the same thing that actually apples been saying and we don't agree on everything for sure but you don't need higher resolution once you get to the point where you can't distinguish the individual pixels and so while 4k displays make a ton of sense if you've got a 32 inch monitor because at the distance you'd sit you would easily be able to make out the pixels on cue HD or something like that for laptops this this race to 4k has just been frustrating for me we're sucking up extra battery we're making the screens dimmer because the closer you pack the pixels actually the harder it is to push the backlight through them like we're doing all these counterproductive things when what we should be focusing on is refresh rate this to my knowledge is the first laptop in the world with a 240 Hertz display and not just that but check this out so it's using a sharp XO panel that has among the best anti-ghosting that I have seen certainly the best I've seen on a laptop look at this like it's hard to appreciate it 30 frames per second through a YouTube compression filter but I can read this text as I'm moving it around on the screen that would have been unthinkable on anything but a CRT in the past I mean maybe a high-end TN panel but that's not what this this this is this is an egg's OpenAL it's not like just like bad viewing angle junk check this out so this is the closest thing I've ever seen to a zero compromises mobile gaming experience because high refresh rate is a true competitive advantage where higher resolution is not and speaking of competitive advantage unfortunately they had to have like someone directly over my shoulder the entire time to make sure that I didn't run any of these tantalizing benchmarks over but this is actually going to be equipped with an RT X 2080 max Q design or whatever in videos latest you know nomenclature for that is now a Seuss can't tell me under pain of death what kind of performance we could expect for this compared to a regular RT X 2080 but if I had to go out on a limb I'd say well the max Q ones last gen were about 10% lower so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw something along those lines now there's still room for improvement here this webcam bad terrible not only is it on the bottom its off-center clearly they expect absolutely no one to use it but other than that the keyboard feels better than last gen trackpad acceptable could be bigger but this is looking pretty freakin sick so my stylus fell it's you should just go check it out at the link in the video description so thanks for checking out this video guys if you disliked it hit that button but if you liked it get subscribed so you don't miss any of our CES 2019 content we'll see you in the next suite
