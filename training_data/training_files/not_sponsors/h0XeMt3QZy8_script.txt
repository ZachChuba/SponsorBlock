now before you say anything Yamcha isn't on the list nor is child suit we're gonna go in deep for this one hey guys massacre X here as 2019 is slowly drawing to a close I thought you would go with something quite weak as a topic no seriously really weak I'm not talking about the topic I'm talking about the topics contents that's right since the showing question is all about strength and power not as many people talk about the other side of the equation well not talk about it properly that is that was the idea that was sort of proposed by Travis Bailey on Twitter who was suggesting which characters are physically the weakest with the entire series of Dragonball that's a really good point Travis thank you for your suggestion Dragonball is meant to be one of those shows which sees the envelope being pushed when it comes to what people and powers can do if we wanted to see something weak we would look at my comedic time in jokes aside we tend to leave characters that don't quite cut the mustard power wise aside unless it is for the sake of a joke or to refer to a comparison or how useless they are we're not going to be going down the obvious routes that has become the backbone of the metter of the franchise we are not going down the avenues of Yamcha Raddatz Crillon and whatnot because um guess what in comparison to some of the characters that we're going to be talking about and looking at today those guys they're behemoths Raddatz can take out civilizations single-handedly sure he's no match for most characters in Z right now but can you honestly say that about yourself I mean I certainly couldn't what I can't say honestly about myself is that I have a merch store your time and let's get on with the show so what do we define as week per se well I'm gonna take Travis's idea partially into account here sure physical power is important within the show but sometimes if you've got a power that can counter that or supplement brawn then you can be just as useful we are going to be discussing care who have nothing to back them up I mean nothing you think the yard Ratigan's are weak well no especially if you've been reading the manga recently they've got some pretty cool perks to their makeup it's not all about instant transmission anymore what we're going to be doing here is talking about weak characters and also debunking characters who think a week but actually aren't as well as actually talking about who are the weakest characters relatively within their own field and one last thing the farmer is not here because let's be honest to him he is immeasurably powerful first up turtle okay technically turtle is the weakest being in existence if you want to be pernickety about it end off I could end the video here but I'm not going to resort to the obvious here because come on turtle is not a fighter we find out Turtles power when it is being measured when bomber tests out the Sailor scouted that she took from Radice and reads Turtles power to be point zero zero one basically a light breeze could perturb turtle here but he's 999 years old he don't give a hoot this is primarily for a joke of course and the reason why he doesn't really count for this list is because like I said he's not a competitive character he is not here to test his power or anything turtle is just there to be a friend to Roshi and to live out a life of peace and quiet that is if he doesn't get lost or anything as he so often does our first character who is not weak shouts ooh everybody likes to rag on this guy because he is probably one of the weakest characters within the functioning dragons but here the very least though is able to admit that that he's not up there with the big boys however he has some pretty neat abilities which make him a very notable inclusion in any group for a turn-based party he has like Goku intention Han the ability to mimic attacks after just looking at them Goku doesn't really counts as his ability is out of pure talent and innate skill as a Saiyan but tension on men shouts who can copy techniques through their own technique which is pretty useful it's just a shame that it wasn't really used to it utmost especially in Z and also Chan soo has really good telekinetic powers and granted other care just conduce things similar to this but the fact that this little dude can do it and has been able to do it for a very long time in fact as long as we've known him shows that he has some skill in use there are plenty of characters out there who can't control things with their mind or just don't so let's be pragmatic here Chell su he's not all that bad next up is back Tyrion this guy is weak bacteria's power of 110 is quite high for the early sagas of Dragonball higher than the likes of Nam run fun and a lot of the main cast of characters from the first couple of arcs but that can easily be taken away for him that power the source of his energy and strength like with the fabled Samson comes from something that isn't pure muscle his signature techniques are by overpowering his opponents with pungent aromas thus making them not able to compete that's all he needs to do to win stink out his foes sure he looks like a big brute but in truth he's actually a chef who just decided to not bathe himself and found out that he could work wonders on the battlefield or at least win some extra cash in turn immerse if he just chose to ignore his personal hygiene but what if he decided to wash himself if he met somebody well he'd be powerless at least in theory I am sorry but if your hook is affected by hygiene then your place as a fighter is seriously brought into question the next person isn't weak Hercule Hercule has got to have at least a modicum of strength here if he was able to win the World Martial Arts Tournament a lot of people here like to think that he offers nothing to the table when it comes to martial arts but he does he's a great motivator for the people of Earth and he was able to use that ability to save the universe from majin buu and even against cell if you want to look at it from another angle his assistance with goading Gohan into transforming into Super Saiyan 2 was a major factor that has to be considered yes for the majority of the time that we see and he may be labeled as a coward but he was able the stomach the thought of carrying Android 16 to where he needed to go in a place where he was massively outclassed he can step up in a crisis also you wouldn't want to go one-on-one with him as he would win he just needs to resort to less of his bluster and fame that's all he to do next dr. Cochin but Marco he's not a fighter he's a man of science well yes but there is nothing saying that you can't be both I mean just look at Bartok with a brilliant scientist just kidding the point of this discussion is to talk about those who pitched themselves as fighters or actually defended themselves against the dragon team actively so in some capacity Hank Cochin did just that in movie too he wasn't just the Lackey in the background for dr. wheelo he had his own prowess and defense when we found out that he kicked out one of his arms as a cannon despite this twist addition his power level of eight according to the movie six pamphlet which offers up a lot of statistics for us fans his woeful if only he hadn't have resorted to his arm he would have been assured from this list he wouldn't be considered but now he's just been left disarmed and on the list sorry guys but earthling armaments just don't cut it in dragon ball in fact they never have as shown by Ballmer in the first episode you think he would have realized that by the second movie of Z now come on next up that's not week Krillin the armchair attention basically every human in the dragon team I'm reppin these three together because they can be interchangeable in terms of the overall meta one of these three at any one time are labeled as being weak in the eyes of many but they so aren't these three are the strongest humans ever to have lived you could call Gohan stronger yes of course but he is only half human remember so he is not considered here tension Harmon Yamcha are weaker than most of the dragon team but they have plenty to offer with their own techniques and when lackeys and minions come a-knockin to threaten the planet they can easily clean up and do it well just don't put them up against the main bad guy unless your tension han against semi-public cell that was pretty awesome I am 110 percent done with hearing about these guys being labeled this week and especially Krillin I mean hey you could even consider yard to row Bay on this list he's not that weak he does train he just does it on his own terms and on his own he's just very antisocial Toyota taro Krillin some more time in fact do that with all the human characters perhaps let me should make a discussion video about these guys i'll save more of my thoughts about this for them next monica massacre Monica isn't a fighter I know that we all know that nevertheless thanks to dearest wishing to impart Rosie's old lesson on Goku he recruited the likes of delivery boy Monica to pose as one of the strongest beings in the entire universe not just the galaxy universe somebody who beerus could take pride in and pitch to goku as a being worth at this time he succeeded and as far as goku is concerned he still is the figurehead that beerus made him out to be he's pitch that's worthy of going up against hit and as far as the rosters and the official history books show Manaka is stronger than hit most beings in the original Dragon Ball series could probably take on Menaka and win turtle you listening you want to take him probably could again if beerus have just simply overlooked Menaka and got a proper fighter not get Minako roped into these women's and dealings the little alien would have also been overlooked from this chart beerus you got some splainin to do another one that's not weak Roshi bro she is not weak indeed poor Terra showed that he isn't he could dodge urine apparently ultra instinct Roshi confirmed ok that's a little bit of an exaggeration but the fact that Roshi was considered and in the roster per team universe 7 in the tournament of par one of the most important tournaments of the multiverse is testimony but he is at least competent in terms of martial arts there are a lot of things that he knows and he hasn't afforded to be able to provide some kind of support when times get tough granted his immortality could have happened to any body in the right circumstances and can be extended thanks to some paradise herb but that allows him to be continually improving his power without the effects of aging and after all Goku thinks the world of Roshi and of the main character respects the guy for what he taught him next table oh yes yes I know table is the same and Saiyans are strong beings even likes of game a had a place at bar oxide at one point will be very briefly according to - despite this the reason that table is here is because of where he came from he has rural connections being the younger brother of Prince Vegeta he's nowhere near his brother in terms of power despite having the same chances to develop them King for jutsu the third sent him away at a young age and mostly his potential was never shown he could pick up that power again and become stronger but he shows no signs of wanting to he has a life a wife gray and he wants a life a piece and to not get involved with brawling all this despite coming from the toughest and most adaptable beings in the galaxy when it comes to Saiyans Tarble is the weakest in body and in mind and as well in terms of narrative scope since he's basically been replaced by Kaba not weak who long and poor yes yes yes yes the power levels of 10 for both long and poor should make them be labeled as weak but the one thing that has kept them off the main list and being considered truly weak is the fact they can shape-shift into anything and that is a major power to possess even if you could be bested by almost anyone in the dragon world well everyone except Cochin apparently POIs is a better transmogrifier of course being the bookworm of the duo and succeed in being able to hold a change form for as long as he wants Ruhlin can change form too but only for a certain amount of time before then reverting back to his true form all this because he slacked during class that is a major crush sure but he has enough time to do what he needs to do and get outta Dodge after all he was able to pull up the stump four years in our village as we all know can you transform no the neither of these two are truly weak next mighty mask yes according to the likes of Keira and jewel mighty mask did very badly in the twenty fourth World Martial Arts Tournament the same one where the champ one is belt and thusly gone at his reputation out of all the known fighters had got a name and were featured mighty mask is one of the lowest of the low the only reason he even got some recognition was because Goten and Trunks stole his costume but aside from that there seems to be little going for this guy it's because of mighty masks thats Popovich in Yama aren't on the list because they at least got to the second round they did better than mighty mask here's the honorable mention for you now banana and sweet these two are considered to be the weakest in the freezer force but since the fact they are in the freezer force they get an honorable mention instead of a full posting to the list their exact power is not officially confirmed but according to thousand choose seven these two are the only guys in the main squad that follow freezer around to have a power below 1500 their combined power is 2,800 so it puts them at the same level as Raddatz I hear you ask why these guys considered and not Raddatz well Raddatz was a-sayin and part of another group who were way stronger he was carried by them and had the potential to get stronger and as we just talked about tarball was weaker than rabbits as furred bananas suey they were so bad they were pushed up to just doing recon work and were unlikely to get stronger unlike our long head same bestie and yes Baumann is that one freezer soldier from the Tenkaichi games that everyone talked about and at least he got some kind of spotlight though and finally the weakest character in Dragon Ball who was posed to the fighter captain chicken at least my team asked was willing to have a go at fighting captain chicken hightailed it out of there before the first round at the tournament that he was in after seeing Goku a noob and just go like no but he is as far as I know the only guy pitched to a benefit er in Dragon Ball who never even got dunked on he bailed and made excuses on top of that nobody else on this list is weaker than that even turtle doesn't make excuses so you could say that captain chicken is arguably the weakest fighter in Dragon Ball yes cochin technically is weaker in terms of overall strength but he at least actually defended himself captain chicken didn't even do that but anyway what do you guys think do you think that this discussion seemed fair is there anyone else that you might think might be weaker that I didn't cover or who got short shrift leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
