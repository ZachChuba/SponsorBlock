I think it's more exciting than the Corolla just a smidge in the same way that ranch is more exciting than mayonnaise I guess you want to start us out I don't ever get at this I'm always awkward and clumsy you just got to lean into it and make it bad watch this good morning / evening / whatever time of day it is for you guys thank you for joining us yeah Oh gross do the color bar thing so today we are reviewing a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta yeah that's it justjust the 2019 Volkswagen Jetta that's it no special edition no frills no just uh folks basic bare-bones entry-level Volkswagen Jetta however on the bright side this cars cheap yeah nineteen thousand wait I'm sorry I think it's less than that I think eighteen thousand seven hundred forty five dollars [Music] who drives the Volkswagen Jetta who do you imagine is a person that drives this car people who are invisible okay because not quite what I was expecting you because I don't I've never noticed a Volkswagen Jetta in the wild ever in my life that's fair and I think it's probably because they're just so intensely boring what do you picture um that's a good question I picture somebody with kids yeah picture like a family I can't believe how slow we're going right now this is even about the top speed of the Jetta though person I imagine the drives a Volkswagen Jetta is like a father or a mother who has kids who need something economical this gets like decent gas mileage this needs it's like we talked about in the Toyota Corolla somebody who views a car more of as a appliance more than something too more than a toy yes there's nothing wrong with that that's fine no definitely not I mean this is a great car if you're just looking for something to get you to working back and pralaya bleah yeah it's smooth it's comfy you know like I mean there's not any complaints about this car to be fair except for that it's boring yeah [Music] three-two-one almost there I don't know if we're gonna hit 60 but we did it there it is oh man Wow I was getting worried we're gonna run out of track yeah I was two before the big swoopy yeah that was a it's a very gradual acceleration yeah it doesn't have any pull to it you don't get that butterflies feeling or anything but we didn't expect to know I was kind of impressed with the sport mode it didn't shift on its own before I shifted it so props there because some cars do that and I hate it so it's an 8-speed automatic transmission and I do have a complaint about that now the gears feel like they shift at odd times it doesn't seem like he makes a lot of sense man that's so crazy I literally have to hold the gas down for like two or three seconds so funny I was impressed there for a second because I thought you had just you're just Preston I realized oh wait no you pressed that like two seconds yeah I'll tell you so here we go down oh my goodness holy now it doesn't start picking it up like almost dangerous like if you need to hurry and a speed up pass something on a highway or get out of the way well I believe this only has 145 horsepower that's about right what it's about right now and it's just a four-cylinder 145 horsepower you don't get this is not a performance car you don't get this for from the orphans now so listen yeah get that other way just look at something else if you want performance this is not what that is and that's okay that's okay handling is uncomfortable yeah it's comfortable you know the steering wheel feels fine like a steering wheel feels like a steering wheel it's responsive I I don't notice not a lot it's quite responsive actually yeah gets 30 mpg in the city which is great yeah and 40 on the highway that's solid yeah those are really solid numbers and then again in factors into what this car is it's a good it's an excellent commuter car yeah I think the front of the car is a little bit more aggressive than it looks a little Trani from the fro I can kinda see that Tron esque yeah it looks like iLike well I have a love/hate relationship with the black accents on the front because they're not functional it's like not louvers or an air intake or anything it's just like black plastic that they've slapped on there it does help it look a little bit more sporty but it doesn't do anything so yeah silly but a nice dodging Dave and I say I mean other than that like you said it's a Jetta it doesn't like I've probably never noticed one in the wild before either to be entirely honest yeah so it like the looks is fairly bland the one thing I can say is the seats look cheap it's like that it's like the perforated leather like the leather with holes in it yeah I don't even know if it's leather but whatever leather Eska material it looks cheap but it's a little comfy yeah I mean when you're sitting in it no complaints at all because this is like around the same price as what my focus was and this is a lot more comfortable than my focus yeah good space glovebox is fine trunk space is excellent trunk space this is quite a practical vehicle I would say oh yeah you could fit like six of me in the trunk easily six JT's the cupholders here are interesting they've got little pinchy boys in there to hold your cup in place I don't know how I'd feel about that like if you take a chick-fil-a cup like if you're familiar with chick-fil-a their cups are styrofoam and if you try to smash a cup down in there I feel like it's gonna punch right through the side yeah I could but I don't know I'm sure they've tested it with all sorts I mean they're German they've tested it with every cup known to man something tells me I kind of doubt that now they're pians underestimate Americans gluttony with the drinks all the time yeah they ain't never seen a 15 ounce double gulp from 7-eleven that's 5 drinks that's five sodas when I was in the trunk for our test when you close the door there is an escape latch but it's not illuminated so so if you get kidnapped in this you're gonna screw to screw do you know you're not gonna be able to find it are you scrambling around in there and then the little suit looks about yea though you're dead you're just dead if you get kidnapped in a Volkswagen Jetta yeah just be aware I'm not putting the pedal to the floor and I am breaking around all of these turns because there's a quite a bit of body roll go a little car yeah this is the type of car that like as a high schooler when you didn't really care about what you were driving you just pile a bunch of friends into and you'd have a great time yeah I feel like when I was a high schooler though I wanted something like cool I guess so a little more fun more than as an adult I feel like this is more of a very adult that's true though I grew up driving my mother's Volvo station wagon which yeah - most people isn't cool but I thought it was the dopest thing in the world fit like twelve people in there this would be a great road trip er yeah again the only complaint is that it's boring yeah but just kind of what you want for a road trip or something this stays out of the way and lets you be comfortable yeah this is like this type of car is the last line of defense against electric cars because it's got great fuel economy and it's cheap yeah the electric cars can do everything that gas-powered cars can do pretty much they can do performance they can do style they can do speed and stuff but they can't do this kind of price they still tend to be a little more expensive I mean I know there's the Nissan Leaf yes pretty much Penny's but it also has like trash rain yeah okay I think it only gets like 60 or 70 miles worth of range yeah so this thing is still king in terms of quiet affordable comfortable daily commute right that's why these types of vehicles are like the most sold vehicles oh yeah and don't lie make sure not everybody is a speed junkie or cares what kind of car they drove yeah I mean mode most people just want something to get them back and forth to work yeah and this is perfect for that all right so let's talk about the competition to this competition to this so the Toyota Corolla absolutely for disposition and the Camry like toyota corolla toyota camry the Ford Focus like the Kia Forte I mean there's a lot of competition in this segment it's a very crowded sec the the entry level like sedan segment is very crowded and I feel like every automaker makes something like that and they make them pretty well honestly I mean I feel like this is I would take this over a Corolla yeah the only reason I might take a Corollas the reliability is legendary of that this being German and European and Volkswagen the reliability isn't necessarily as high true I would wager as the Corolla but while this is running it's much more comfortable and a little bit more upscale yeah I do prefer this over the Corolla driving and the curl is about the only comparison and maybe a Ford Focus that I've had to this yeah I would take this over either of those just in terms of the comfort inside yeah in terms of quality like overall ride quality yeah written stuff yeah this I think this one wins yeah I would definitely take this over any of those yeah we keep saying and that's okay it's not we're not trying to be condescending or anything it's just it's just not it's just um yeah there I mean I'm not gonna go out and test drive a Jetta and say wow funny that I just drove the best dang car it's just not our thing like that then yeah that's it yeah I love many other people's things yeah I mean I would be perfectly happy if my car was in the shop and I got one of these as a learner which is what I'm doing right now yeah this is my loaner car for a few days it's just nice to live around in it and be comfortable you know that you'll never buy this car but hey you've driven a Jetta driven a Jetta let's get into this let's do it though starting out performance to you yeah absolute trash yeah those two points come from the nice steering the extra over the one yeah yeah I think I probably agree with that yep black practicality this is it strong pretty good very good honestly I'm feeling a eight on the practicality side of it because it gets good gas mileage does it get good gas it's the 30 mpg city 40 highway that's good another cavernous trunk yeah I'm gonna go seven and a half just because I I do think eight and above is reserved for something like a wagon I think this was about as practical as a sedan can yeah absolutely totally agree with that which is why I'd give it an 8 and III also say I would not only I'd ever give us a Dan over an 8 yeah seven and half for me value pretty good which I yeah honestly I'd say it's pretty good for just like 18,000 745 yeah I mean you get some solid stuff it's comfortable great sunroof yeah this ain't bad for a 19 year and now I think it's a pretty reasonable value probably give it like a like a 7 I'm feeling yeah I think it's sevens a fair value I'm gonna give it a seven and a half seven and a half cool factor one one yeah definitely a one and there's nothing nothing is remotely cool about this at all quality reasonably high pretty good better than some of its competitors for sure yeah oh yeah I'd say in this segment it probably is the best quality I'm obviously that's the best interior quality in a sedan under $20,000 for sure it's definitely six and a half I'd go with the six I'll go with the six yeah that's fair I think it's like it's it's decent and then fun factor which is also almost non-existent yeah one one and a half one and a half y one and a half because I do enjoy driving it like fun isn't the word that comes to mind but like just driving it around its pleasant that's true it's not unpleasant like I don't hate driving it it's just not very fun yeah okay one half you've convinced me yes I'm gonna give it a 1 and a half as well okay time to add this all up bit of quick maths so average score is a 26 not a 60 which is kind of like goofy yeah yeah under half that's that's under half yeah that's like among the lowest scored vehicles we've ever done but it's merited yeah and to be fair yes the score that we do is geared more towards sports cars and luxury cars and performance cars this was the 2019 Volkswagen Jetta it's a car and you can drive it and that's that thanks for tuning in and we will see you next week see you guys [Music] Jetta could beat if you stop and think about it a very cool exotic cars name oh absolutely imagine like the porsche jefferson Jetta aston Jetta aston Jetta see you like there are brands right that beforehand if you didn't know that Volkswagen made the jet if you didn't know about this car at all and you heard that name associated with another brand you would think it would be dope no yeah it's a very it's a pretty name alternatively with Toyota you don't think that with the Corolla for example the Aston Martin Corolla yeah it doesn't exactly have the same ring to it for some reason or like the Jaguar Corolla yeah and maybe that's just because we're so familiar with the Corolla maybe but you're right it's not an attractive word yeah the Ferrari focus for example yeah like no this doesn't quite roll off the tongue that's the same way of the Ferrari goes royce beetle the rolls-royce beetle yes I don't know I'd Drive that rolls-royce Jetta like it I feel like Jetta fits in a lot with these other brands but like other stuff like focus and Corolla and civic civic don'ts give it a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
