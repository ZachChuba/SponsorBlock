we start talking about this yesterday about how the Cincinnati Bengals were the organ is the only organization that could potentially ruin this set up that is set up for them right now they're the only organization that could potentially miss out on an Ohio kid coming back to Ohio riding this incredible wave of w's to potentially bring the bangles back to relevance when they disappeared especially after this last year whenever everybody thought other teams were tanking they were trying and sucking I mean the Bengals are a very interesting situation the Bengals fanbase is one that we know a lot about we did a show in Cincinnati we have a lot of fans in Cincinnati we're very thankful for Cincinnati but that bangels organization I think is the only team at this state now granted the Browns to you can always lump them seeking now back to the magic but the Cincinnati Bengals are the only franchise that could potentially mess up this layup that they have for a new face of a franchise which is Joe burrow a guy that I think would relish the opportunity to turn around Cincinnati would relish the opportunity of going back to Ohio that would be able to maybe bring some attention some notoriety and some positivity to the bangles they're the only ones that could potentially fall into the hype of a trade to think that they can get other players that can make them better as opposed to a franchise quarterback that's from the same state that would look to do good for them I mean there's no way right maybe that they're the only ones that could do it they would have to like Carolina would have to give them a king's ransom to get rid of that pick you don't think you would think you don't know how the bank was operating that's true the Bengals don't have an indoor practice facility 2020 I tell you I don't think they know that you're allowed to trade draft picks
