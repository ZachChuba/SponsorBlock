[Music] this video for me at least is by far the most exciting video we've worked on in 2020 so far and that's because I'll be covering all the latest updates on Apple's upcoming pair of augmented reality glasses now in case this doesn't sound like much these glasses are what Apple actually considers the follow-up and even the replacement for the iPhone so yeah sit back relax and enjoy the future of okay so we are currently at a point where smart phones cannot really go any further if you look at the latest iPhone the latest Samsung Galaxy has 20s they're all essentially the same they're all a piece of glass with almost no bezels that we interact with ensure phones will be getting thinner and thinner to a point where a few years from now they could be as thin as a piece of paper and then fold well phones are now becoming a thing so again a few years from now we will have extremely thin tablets that fold down into a smartphone but the idea behind that still remains the same and by this fact I mean that in order for us to interact with virtual world we need to have this book this piece of glass in our hands so yeah we need that specific device instead of you know the digital world being merged with us so to say and this is what AR is trying to do so AR comes from augmented reality and I'll like VR or virtual reality which fully immerses you into a completely different world augmented reality simply adds virtual elements to the real world imagine assembling a PC or a car and seeing arrows that are floating in the air that point towards which components you need to put it next or imagine being surrounded by 12 massive monitors that are simply floating in the air even though in the real world there is nothing there or imagine seeing the weather outside right in front of your eyes without even having to pull up the curtain or walking on the road and seeing the arrows that show you which direction to take right on the road itself or just floating in the air how cool would that be well this is what AR is truly capable of Annapolis currently fully invested - bringing us a pair of air glasses that will indeed allow us to merge our digital worlds with a real world and they're actually stream lis serious about this in fact according to the information Apple held a presentation for their employees in late 2019 where they told him that a our glasses are indeed the future and something that will eventually replace the iPhone now don't get me wrong the error glasses will not fully replace the iPhone when they get released instead more and more companies will be focusing on AR and AR is the evolution after smartphones just like laptops and tablets have pretty much replaced desktop PCs for most people now we've had a ton of info about Apple's error glasses over the years and we ourselves made quite a lot of videos on Apple's error glasses over the years so our last video was back in November 2019 but since then we've had a lot of major updates first of all the release date has been moved significantly ain't she cool pretty much the world's most reliable analyst when it comes to Apple stated back in october 20 1977 in q2 2020 now this is something that bloomberg has also stated that a glasses are targeted for 20/20 release but unfortunately this no longer seems to be the case the information published a report back in November which went through all the details that Apple has told their employees during that internal presentation and apparently this presentation was given to around 1,000 employees which is a lot and it was also held at a Steve Jobs theater which means that the presentation itself was very likely similar to a product launch you know an actual Apple event just two employees or them you know the public the report claims that the event was led by Apple's recently appointed a head of AR and VR Micah Rockwall it seems like they talked about how 3d scanning would work on the glasses and how advanced human detection would also be present interesting enough it seems like apples glasses might actually match the oculus quest in terms of the design and also the functionality with a sleeker looking build and more ease of fabrics and lightweight materials in order to make it more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time now this is very very strange because you see the oculus quest was actually one of my favourite products of all 2019 you can watch a full review of the quest here and I loved it so much they actually bought one for my entire team it's it's an incredible technology literally amazing so definitely check out if you get a chance link in description to check out the oculus quest and also support channel by doing so but anyways the quest is a VR headset meaning that you are fully immersed in that virtual game world whereas AR would be something very different the reports say that Apple's headset will have a high resistant display and cameras that will allow users to read small text and see other people standing in front and behind virtual objects so from the looks of it this will either be a very bulky AR headset or it will be both an AR and a VR headset according to this report Apple executives said that they plan on reaching out to third-party developers as early as 2021 in order for him to start building apps for the headset which would then launch in 2022 however something that they've got me quite excited is that according to the information Apple has also talked about a second headset codenamed n4 to one when the first one being an 301 now the second headset would actually resemble high-end sunglasses with thick frames that house the battery and the chips at least a prototype does look like that according to some anonymous Apple employees who decided to come forward so it seems like Apple might be releasing two headsets in that case yes a VR and AR headset first which will also be made for gaming and watching movies which should sell more units because of this followed by another model which might be AR only which will need to be that pair of true Apple AR glasses but those are only set to come in 2023 now walking with a pair of glasses with a bunch of cameras in them can be very intrusive for some people so I'm quite curious to see how Apple would market this actually remember when Google glasses were bashed for being able to record a video whenever their users wanted as is basically removed all the privacy that people around you had well something similar might happen to Apple even though Apple does have a very good privacy policy so I'm guessing that Tim Cook will make a statement saying that the glasses will not record a video at all as the cameras will only be used for 3d positioning go something along those lines now this is a side topic wouldn't again and thanks in nor pass for sponsoring this video now back to our glasses there's a way you can already try it so Apple launched a our kits the API back in 2017 with iOS 11 an API is essentially a library a collection of functions that developers can take you so when developing an app for example reading developers having to manually code 3d death mapping using the back facing cameras on the iPhones they could just invoke a specific function in a are kids and they can do all of that in just seconds something that they would have spent maybe a few weeks or even months working on can be done in just a few seconds by simply invoking that function so does not only saves developers a ton of time but it also results in the same experience across all the apps that do take use of a are kids and Eric aid 1.0 was absolutely incredible so it featured real time shadows that were actually cast by objects and even real time reflections that were being cast by other objects from the real world to the virtual objects like that's absolutely insane the arkutu which came up with iOS 12 a year later this one improved the object tracking significantly and even added a new measuring tool for iOS which allowed you to measure objects in the real world with a surprising level of accuracy and then just last year in 2019 with interactive is 13 Apple launched Erica 3.0 which introduced something quite extraordinary and that was people occlusion essentially virtual objects can now detect people and other objects in the real world and they can actually avoid them so for example if there was a plane or a car driving around the person it would drive around the person rather than you know through it which is just an unbelievable technological achievement I mean virtual objects being able to interact with real objects this is the future of AR and interesting enough it's already here I mean you can already try to sell an app such as IKEA plays which I highly highly recommend or see exactly how certain piece of furniture might look in your home and there's many more AR apps available in the App Store which you can try on your iPhone or your iPad now Apple just filed for a brand new patent for their ARS light of your headset just last week so they're constantly improving under current prototypes and according to this patents Apple will be using something called wave guided display system in order to deliver exceptional optical performance now this patent also states that the HMD or the head mounted device will need be fettered to an iPhone an iPad or a Mac like we've seen previously reported so you need to have an iPhone an iPad or a Mac in order to use this thing it only a separate device will be basically an accessory to one of those devices at least for the time being this will not be a standalone device probably due to the fact that Apple wants you keep this device as thin and as light as possible as if they do include a powerful processor they will need you know probably cooling a massive battery which will get quite uncomfortable and you know it will be heavy and bulky so they're probably trying to avoid that this way your iPhone will be doing all the processing or your iPad or Mac and then the data would be wirelessly streams to the headset itself fun fact this is actually something that seen ads has also reported back in 2018 they released a massive reports would intend of details inside Apple's upcoming AR heads a project so definitely read that report it's pretty amazing link for dots in the description so that's from back in 2018 that was probably the biggest and also the first major yeah definitely the first major report that we've had regarding the Apple error glasses now margarin from loom Berg has also released a pretty detailed report recently with a lot of extra details on apples AR and VR plans and according to him Apple will actually start including a new 3d sensor system in the upcoming iPad pro and the 20/20 iPhones which will allow users to create 3d reconstructions of rooms objects and even people what it says is essentially a time-of-flight sensor or at the o F sensor it's like we've seen in the samsung galaxy note n plus the SN 5g and the noonas 20 plus nes tony altra so this rate has an infrared receiver and an infrared transmitter so the infrared transmitter sends a beam of infrared light which then gets reflected back by objects around you to the infrared receiver which based on the number of rays that got reflected back and the time it took for the Rays to be reflected back it can calculate a listen between itself and an object and therefore map it's in 3d now on the row 10 plus you can indeed map objects in 3d but honestly this feature works maybe five or so percent of the time it's extremely unreliable and you can't really use it in many apps so it's a massive gimmick and once use it once then you'll probably completely forget about it apples town flight sensors will be taking full use of air kids and it's brand-new 3d mapping engine which will very likely be the same one that the AR side of your headset will be using in 2022 and in the end I do believe that Apple's ear headset has a ton of potential however this potential is heavily reliant on the developers and the apps that the purpose can make Google and Microsoft have both trial the airspace and unfortunately both of them failed mostly because none of them were actually focusing on everyday consumers but instead they are focusing on more specialized workflows for companies for than individual consumers Apple will be focusing solely on the everyday user now there is of course the downside of hey if I want a R I'll have to wear the headset all the time which is you know quite inconvenient because maybe I don't know wear glasses however this might not be the case anymore because there's a company called mojo vision a tech startup and they've developed the world's first true smart contact lens that can actually project AR elements onto the real world yes contact lens AR contact lens how cool is that and they actually have a ppi of 14,000 yes 14,000 PPI compared to the 458 PPI on the iPhone Levin pro max for example also you could apparently seen the dark thanks to these so yeah exciting times are definitely coming and if we do need to get useful apps that improve on our daily lives by combining meaningful productivity apps into the real world then this will indeed eventually replace smartphones entirely but yeah let me know comments what do you guys think about the possibility of not just wearing a player glasses but also a our glasses in general replacing smart phones today do you think that it will happen if so when would you say that would happen my guess would be probably around 2035 that'll be my guess but let me know comments what do you guys think if I enjoyed this video and you want to support a channel definitely consider becoming a member for only 0.99 pounds a month which is actually less than a cup of coffee you get access to while you support a channel and then you also get is a really cool badges next to your name but actually evolve the longer you've been a member for and everyone can see the badges including me and you know everyone else so that's pretty cool and also if you want to see more videos like this one definitely subscribe and hit the bell icon so that you get notified whatever brand new video comes out but yes I've been pretty much it for this one I'm Daniel and I'll see you guys in the next one so don't thank signing out [Music]
