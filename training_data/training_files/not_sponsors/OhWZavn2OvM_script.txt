that out of the way at least so what I'm funny now I'm a funny guy just cuz I'm dressed like a clown I suppose you think I shouldn't have a gun either jontron predicted the Joker film well done jontron well played mission to the next meme the next meme needs a little bit of context it's a whole dispute with the Hong Kong and China for those who don't know Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous state from China it has his own lost lost Testament or jurisdiction I don't English is hard already and I don't know exactly how it works but it's sort of like its own state and in China obviously wants to change that and Hong Kong is like nah we want to be free and then I don't know where someone from NBA tweets something saying I support Hong Kong and then NBA is like oh god we need Chinese money so they it just spirals out of control and then the exact same thing happens during a blizzard livestream we're one of the contestants who won the tournament calls out his support for Hong Kong I think he said like liberate Hong Kong ethnically or something like that and these two people the coasters gets fired and blisters response to this because obviously China is like that one person on Twitter that can't take any criticism and just blocks everyone so Blizzard to appease China fires the hosts and vans the winner and takes away all his prize money because blizzard needs Chinese money obviously the biggest amount of sales in mobile games always comes from China remember when Blizzard announced that the habl√≥ mobile version and everyone's like is this a April Fool's joke well from a business standpoint no it isn't it makes perfect sense to get that Chinese mobile market and that's really all they care about I think it's very important to remember this because companies they might put up a face they might put up a rainbow flag and yes that's good in a way but at the end of the day their goal is to make money they don't care about you they don't care about freedom and unless people push back at companies they're not gonna do anything South Park which also at this time made fun of this whole concept god bless you South Park how Disney and and many films chain they're Chinese version in cinema just to please China it's all about pleasing China and following Chinese rule pity pipe cheap fuel flavor lingonberry is out link in description buy yours now it is a
