the generation of dirty dishes is probably the number one cause of resistance against home cooking that i get and i've always written it off as laziness until i saw this otherwise reasonable person washing dishes apparently this is a popular method but it's dangerous how can you see sharp knives underneath a veil of suds it's gross who wants to be submerged in dirty dishwasher up to their elbows and it's just plain inefficient i will address and improve each phase of the process but before i get into tangible action please allow me to spend some time on three conceptual steps that can re-establish your mindset first acknowledge that having dirty dishes means that you just made a nourishing meal that feeds you and or your loved ones try to see this as a privilege second acknowledge that no job is complete until you clean up and tie up any loose ends it sucks that my own personal belief in meaningful work being part of a life well-lived makes me come off as some kind of radical trad confreak but i'm not the type to believe that uh get rich quick no risk no effort no compromise messaging leads to self-actualization so suck it up and quit being a baby snowflake third you might want to do some research as to how soap actually works i'm convinced that most people never bothered to learn how soap works otherwise we wouldn't have a whole segment of consumers paying extra to quote unquote wash their dirty cheeks with bars of lotion or lather up with pesticides labeled anti-bacterial the short of it is real soap things labeled soap soap will bind to germs act as a surfactant and then pull it all off of your skin when you rinse i used to think that you could only clean raw meat germs off of something by using bleach but what happens after you touch a chicken thigh bare-handed you wash it off with soap and you live to tell the tail phase one of your transformation is now complete next i've got to address your workstation as with most manual labor you'll need to select your tool of choice i think that these are popular because they aim to keep your scrubbing hand dry and clean but the bristles are relatively inflexible and the built-in soap dispenser always breaks these bottle brushes can come in handy in certain cases but if i had to choose just one cleaning implement it would be the oh cedar multi-use scrunge it's flexible enough abrasive enough it doesn't have any moving parts to break and it's easily replaced i trusted america's test kitchen's recommendation of the scrunge and never looked back these people do more testing on all of their recipes and gear than all of the pseudo-scientific n equals one experiment charlatan's put together so that's good enough for me try as many tools as you need to and choose whatever makes you feel happy to do dishes whether it needs to look cute or last forever or be handmade by artisans another way to make dishwashing more enjoyable is to use a soap that smells really enjoyable meyer's clean day seems to be a real crowd-pleasing brand and they have dozens of cents to choose from my last product recommendation oh no watch out he's getting dexter's thick mom with it that's right bright pink rubber gloves and judge me all you want but these protect you from cuts and hot water to the point that you might forget that you're actually washing dishes they even have this long flip up sleeve that prevents water from dripping onto your arms i used to hate the idea of getting my hands all soapy wet dirty and clammy again and again but these are big enough that i can slip them on wash a single utensil and then pull them off leaving my booty grabbers completely unaffected the final element of my ideal dishwashing setup is not necessarily a product recommendation but do try to have some kind of basin nearby to hold clean soapy water you probably noticed in some of my videos that most of the time i have this low profile enamel dish nearby for this exact purpose if you used a big bowl while cooking you can clean that first and then fill it with soapy water from this point on nothing goes into the bowl other than the sponge don't dip your nasty spoons in here and taint your soap source with detritus if you find filling the bowl to be too laborious and ritualistic you can simply take a squirt bottle fill it up mostly with water and a little bit of soap shake it up and now you have soapy water on demand whenever you need it for smaller dishwashing sessions everything up until now has been premeditated work to make this phase the actual work frictionless if you keep it up you can get to a point where dishes get washed quickly and easily enough so that they never actually end up in the sink however i will assume the worst and start with a big sink full of dishes prioritize what to wash in this order dangerous delicate and then everything else so this knife can get washed first followed by this fragile wine glass and then everything else just load up on clean soapy water scrub until clean and rinse afterwards let each clean dish hang out somewhere to drip dry in my first apartment i had this beautiful simple human rack that i was comfortable leaving out all the time but now that cameras are often in my kitchen i use a cheap collapsible one that can be put away easily if you've got a dishwasher you can honestly just pull out the top rack and use that for drying as you wash switch to the more abrasive side for difficult gunk and don't be afraid to put something extra difficult to the side while you clean something else that is soaking not the lie that you tell yourself to justify leaving a six quart pot of pasta water in the sink overnight if you really honestly truly have some pots with super stuck on gunk fill them with water add a little soap and boil it for a minute before cooling and washing consider it a turbo soak in a tenth of the time these are all now clean and you can wipe them with a towel if you want and put them away if you leave with a sense of that being too difficult use it as your motivation to clean your dishes as soon as you can next time it's like they always say empty sink don't gotta think too good that's how you should wash dishes if you have a dishwasher i'm not going to give you any tips on that partially because the debates get unnecessarily divisive can you run it even if it's not totally full do you have to pre-rinse your dishes and partially because your dishwasher comes with a manual that you can just read whereas all of this does not any dishwasher specific advice that i give you isn't going to apply to all users depending on whether or not they have dual level sprayers or automatic soil sensors i'm going to be honest with you it's midnight right now and i've spent the past previous several hours drinking hey i thought this could be an easy video to knock out before bed and b if i can wash a sink full of dishes in this state of mind you can do it after dinner so make a habit out of it keep a can-do attitude and before you know it you will be the kind of person who likes washing dishes and thus the kind of person who always has a clean kitchen good night
