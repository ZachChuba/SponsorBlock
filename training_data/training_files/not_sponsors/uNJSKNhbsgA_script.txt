hello hello everybody my name is Akash Dakar and this video series is all about using Reaper for game audio now some of you may be wondering how to actually use Reaper specifically for video game sound design because you may have heard a lot that a lot of sound designers use Reaper specifically for video game sound effects and rightfully so it's super super good for that it's in fact basically built for it at this point it has so many features that are perfect for working in video games sound which is why it's so popular now if you already know how to use ad aw and it's working great for you then there's no reason to switch to Reaper Reapers not some a god like D aww that's gonna make you a great sound designer but if you are interested in learning it and if you are interested in speeding up your workflow with sound design this video series is for you now before we dive in I'm going to keep three things in mind throughout this entire series number one I'm assuming you already know how to use a D aw a little bit maybe you're an advanced 2d aw user great but I'm assuming you're coming from some other da W environment already so maybe you know a little bit about Pro Tools or maybe your master of Pro Tools or maybe you know logic inside and out or maybe you're coming from FL Studio anything like that I'm assuming you have some basic digital audio knowledge so you know what a VST is you know what a plug-in is you know what a mixer is you know what an audio track is you know what MIDI is those basic things if you have those basic things down then you are totally set for this series number two this series is going to be broken up in such a way that every single video is going to give you a result at the end of it so you're gonna be able to walk away and say oh now I know how to do this thing in Reaper and it's gonna be bite-sized and extremely manageable so you're gonna be able to binge this essentially so that's the whole point of this it's gonna be more fun and it's gonna be binge worthy I hope and number three I'm gonna be using the default Reaper theme for this so we're using Reaper 6 in this series and we're using the default theme so if you want to follow along exactly just make sure you're using the default Reaper theme and you'll be good if you don't know what I mean by themes don't worry about it we'll cover it in another video and lastly I'm gonna be showing you some workflow tips in Reaper such that you can kind of build your own way of using it Reapers upside is that it's ludicrously customizable if there's something you want to do in it there's a way to do it pretty much guaranteed so the ways I'm gonna be showing you to work aren't the only ways you're gonna be seeing other sound designers on Twitter on Instagram whatever using Reaper in completely different ways than me I found what works for me extremely quickly but you may find another workflow for the way you design sound and make music that works better for you and that's totally okay so I'm gonna be giving you broader strokes that will help you learn from other sound designers as well because you'll be able to see what they're doing and copy them immediately because you'll have the basic understanding to know exactly what's going on now in this first video we're gonna be diving into setup because setup and Reaper is actually really really important so it may seem kind of boring and made seem kind of slow to go through a da w tutorial and just like set it up but honestly Reaper is probably the program that you need to make sure to set up right before we get into things because it's so customizable like I said that you want to make sure that everything is good to go and honestly some of these settings might be already set for you and some of them might not be so just follow along and we'll dive into it and make sure everything is all set up and good to go now in this series I'm actually going to be using a setup procedure that's set up by a sound designer named and Sophie mojo she worked on games like shadow of the Tomb Raider and a whole bunch of other stuff at idose Montreal and many many other things she wrote in a great article about Reaper setup and I'm basing this video off of her work so I'm posting her stuff in the description below as well because she's an amazing sound designer she's given great talks about wise and her sound design on games like shadow of the tomb Raider's so I recommend you check her stuff out full credit where credit is due this is based off of an sophie Manzo's work so I highly recommend you check her out she is an incredible sound designer so here we are in Reaper and I want to first show you the project settings now these are the settings that are basically going to go across all of the projects that you're going to be working in so we're gonna start with file and going down to project settings right here and if you're on a PC this will all be very very similar as well this is both Mac and PC compatible it looks pretty much the exact same so here in project settings the first thing I'd recommend you do is go over to media and in this media tab I'd recommend this path to save media files making a folder for that so basically I type in audio so that means basically when I drag in any audio files maybe I'm dragging in stuff from my sound library it will make a folder inside of my project called audio and save them there I'll copy all those files there instead of using the original files that I'm dragging in so it'll make copies of every single file that I drag in and save it into this folder named audio you can call it whatever you want just type in something here and it will automatically make that folder for you so very very useful very very handy just make sure that's there because then you'll make sure that all of your stuff is copied in without any issue now if it hasn't been set up already I recommend that your wav bit depth be set to 24-bit PCM because that's you know higher quality and it's also very very standard in the game industry to work with 24-bit files not all the time but more often than not you'll be working with 48k 24 bit files now what we're going to do is save as default project settings so what that's going to do is make it so that these settings that we just set up are going to apply to every single project that we make from here on out so we just click save as default project settings now before we go on any further though there's something really important I need to do and that's make a latte [Music] next we are going to go to the Reaper preferences so we're gonna go to Reaper in the top left here and click preferences you're gonna see a whole bunch of stuff and I recommend you poke around here because there's a lot here for you to look at but the first thing you want to look at is paths now this is very useful because you can set where you want things to be safe and where you want things to go by default so that's very very handy but one thing that is recommended that you click on and check is this one called store all peek caches so basically whenever you import an audio file into Reaper it makes a cache of the peak file so basically it saves the image quote-unquote of that peak file meaning the audio file so that it can display the waveform of that audio file much much quicker when you move it around and play with it so it's basically not redrawing those Peaks because it saved that peak file somewhere on your computer they're very very small and it's a good idea to save those and store those because then your project will work a little bit faster but what I recommend you do is click this box and you can save it wherever you want basically you want them outside of your project though I recommend having them not be in your actual project folder because if they are though this kind of clutter everything up and you'll have a ton of peak files and don't ever really any use for them you're never gonna touch them but it's nice to have them so that Reaper runs a little bit faster and a little bit smoother next up is this section called device now if you're using an audio interface like I am you can click which sort of audio output you want here and you can choose which sample rate you want and all that sort of good stuff and you can click the audio MIDI setup of your computer and see what's up and check what's going on all that sort of good stuff now what you can do is change this however you want and you may want different output and different input devices as well that may be something that you wants you may want to play outside of your audio interface but record using your built-in mic for whatever reason or vice-versa whatever it may be this is an option as well it's says it's not recommended so maybe don't use it but in case you want it it's there next up I recommend you look at the plugins section of this Preferences and I recommend looking into your VST section specifically so you can see where all your vsts your virtual instruments and your plugins and all that sort of good stuff are being scanned by default usually this works fine but in case it isn't make sure it's pointing to the right folder and you can hit rescan in case you add any more plugins in the future and make sure that that's all set now there are just a couple things to take care of before we finish up this video so I'm gonna hit save and you're gonna see a dialog box pop up I'm actually gonna edit this out because you're gonna see a bunch of secret projects if I just show you so let me just hit save and then go somewhere else so you don't see all my secret projects that I'm working on okay so when you hit save you see a dialog box like this come up so one thing I recommend you do is you click create subdirectory for project now what this does is it makes a folder for that project every single time you save a new one so it packs it all into a nice folder it doesn't just leave the files strewn everywhere so that's really really nice now also you want to copy all media into project directory so this is a very useful one as well because again when you're importing audio into your project it's going to copy it instead of just using the raw files the raw originals you're gonna actually be copying the audio files that you're using just so that you are working with copies of those files and if you take that project folder and move it elsewhere it's going to work just fine because it's copying those files not moving them and we're not working with the originals it's keeping them all in the same folder so that's really really really important so make sure that creates sub directory for project and copy all media into project directory is all checked and your projects will be a lot cleaner and you can move them from computer to computer without too much issue and lastly before we dive into actually using reaper in future videos you need to know about something called actions now actions are what reaper calls hotkeys so they call them actions instead of hotkeys or shortcuts but if you go to actions and go to show action list you'll see all of these actions here now by default reaper doesn't have a lot of actions mapped it's kind of up to you to map these and make them actually work for you so what you're going to need to do is actually go through and make sure that you have actions set up for things that you're going to do on the regular but don't worry this video series is actually gonna go through a bunch of actions that are going to be very very important to you in making custom actions as well that will help you work in reaper super super fast so the stuff that we're going to be using as game audio people as game audio designers isn't by default mapped to any keyboard command but don't worry in future videos we are going to get to that it's gonna be no problem now speaking of actions before we wrap up there's one last thing to cover there are things called SWS now these are extensions that basically give more capability to Reaper for free so you can download what are known as the SWS extensions and then work with those as well and have some really really really cool actions that you can work with that Reaper doesn't come with by default so if you go to the SWS extensions website that i've linked in the description below you'll be able to download them but just so you can see what the website looks like here they are so you can download these for whatever operating system you're using and they work incredibly incredibly well and give you a lot of custom features within Reaper that you wouldn't have had otherwise okay that's it for today that's it for the setup that's all we need to do and then we're gonna be able to dive into Reaper in every single video and learn a cool new thing every single time if you found this video with that I'll see you the next one
