P n more on that later Jainism some color the world's most peaceful religion it's monks are famous worldwide for the strict adherence to non-violence going as far as to sweep the floor as they walk in order to avoid stepping on life-forms covering their mouths as to not swallow or breathe hot air on living creatures and following a strict vegetarian diet that not only bans on meat fish and eggs but also potatoes so what is Jainism why is it considered the world's most peaceful religion and why is this monk butt-naked well let's find out so this is the official symbol of Jainism yes that is a swastika we'll get to that eventually adopted in the 1970s it represents the main beliefs of Jainism I'm not going to explain what it means right now rather we'll fill this symbol in as we go along a Jain is someone who accepts the teachings of the Tatanka us Jainism comes from word jina the Sanskrit word jina means a spiritual victor while turtle Kura means maker of a Ford now a different different kind of Ford entirely Thank You turtle cars are the most important people in Jainism they have removed all of their attachments to the world and during their lifetimes have managed to break free from the cycle of rebirth and death the Janes believe keep souls trapped on earth they then built a metaphorical for across the river of rebirth so that others can follow them to liberation the non Jain histories a guy called Mahavira tends to get labeled as the founder of Jainism in the same way that Jesus does in Christianity for Jane's Oh Mahavira who predated the Buddha by a few decades is just worn in a long line of 24 total chorus well technically there have actually been an infinite number of tankers but we just we just don't have time for that Jane's believed that they all preach the same eternal truths anyway Buddhism Hinduism and Jainism all grew up together in ancient India the world that these Shree religious bodies evolved in during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE was dominated by two ideas the first of these is samsara when we die our souls moved to an body and we are trapped in an endless cycle of death and rebirth which is like super not fun the second idea was karma that actions good are bad affect your future reverts right so Jainism is quite complicated and the best way for us understand that is to break it down into its eight core ideas number one the three jewels the turtle kur is preached at the path of freeing your soul was the three jewels those three jewels are right faith right faith is accepting the seventh roots or tattvas of Jainism Oh a list inside of another list how exciting number one is Jeeva that all living things have an immortal perfect soul number two is a Jeeva nonliving things have no soul number three is a Java doing actions drags camera to your soul fours bantha which is karma can stick to your soul number five is Sam vara you can stop the influx of karma number six is Mihara you can separate camera from your soul and number seven is moksha separating camera from your soul freeze it from the cycle of rebirth and death the second jewel is right knowledge right faith is believing those seven truths right knowledge is truly understanding them you can do this by listening to Jay monks and reading Jane scriptures and the last jewel is right behavior right behavior is using your faith and your knowledge to live a life that is good and does not harm others you can do this by following the five great vows of Jainism than maha virata's I know another list inside of a list yet Jane's like lists like a lot the Mahabharata are number one ahimsa non-violence number two Satya always being truthful number tree ostia not stealing and before is brahmacarya being faithful to your partner or being totally celibate number fibers are paragrah ha not being weighed down by possessions or unnecessary attachments to people places or things these three jewels are seen as the only path to moksha freeing your soul they are so important that they were incorporated into the official Jain symbol as three dots there ahimsa is by far the most important of these vows and is strictly followed by all Jane's so let's take a look at that number two ahimsa some Jain temples have an inscription above their doors usually in Sanskrit but sometimes in English that reads non-violence is the highest religion Jane's believed that you want to achieve moksha you need to stop having or the life forms Jane's believe that every living thing has a soul and can therefore feel pain and suffering animal and even human rights are a fairly recent concept but Jane's have granted something similar to all life even microbes for thousands of years ahimsa is the hand in the middle of the chain symbol and the text there the bottom reads all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence number three and I can't Avada life is complicated in order to understand a little better Jane's came up with a many pointed doctrine known as and I can't the Radha no single viewpoint can be the only truth instead the full truth must be built out of a bunch of different viewpoints there is a famous story in Jainism that helps get this point across five blind men go to an elephant and each touch one part and tend to describe what the creature looks like the guy at the trunk says this thing must be as thick as a tree trunk well the guy the tale says no actually it's probably more like a rope the guy the belly claims it's a wall clearly the other guy at the leg disagrees saying it's a pillar and the last guy grab in the ears thinks they're all fools because it's clearly a fan the story then goes on to say that a nearby wise old man told them that they were alright but only partially and that all their points together could describe the whole elephant that wise old man Albert Einstein after explaining the elephant to the blind men the wise old man bestowed more knowledge upon them he said to never miss a cogito video make sure to click the subscribe button and ring the notification bell and the blind man nodded for they knew that this was great wisdom some modern Jane's often see anekantavada as a part of ahimsa as tolerance of other world views especially when it comes to other religions knew before samsara and moksha samsara the endless cycle of death and rebirth for Jane's rebirth is not a good thing even a good rebirth as say a prince or a potato is sad because no matter how good your life is all happiness is temporary because it all ends in death yet it's a bummer and there's only one cure for this moksha if you achieve moksha then your soul will escape the cycle and go on to live at the top of the universe in infinite bliss this can only be done by completely removing camera from your soul number 5 karma the term karma means action but this action has consequences Jayne's believe that your karma affects hell you will be reborn in your next life but good or bad karma is irrelevant to James because it's the fact that karma keeps rebirth going that they see is the main problem James have a rather unique view of karma they see it as a physical substance jain's believe that karma is kind of like atoms like covered the entire universe when you do any action it attracts these good or bad karma atoms to your soul then later in life or possibly in another life they release their good or bad effects once they've done that they fall off your sole passions such as hate anger greed or lust will act as a glue that makes even more atoms stick to you and so will make the consequences even more powerful imagine your soul as a cloth and karma as a dust passionate actions make the cloth wet and so the dust sticks to it easier karma is what keeps you stuck in the samsara cycle kama physically binds your soul to this earth but wait there's more you can escape this by burning away all the Karma attached to your soul the best way to do this is by becoming a jain monk or nun six monks are nuns the jain monk and nun life is based around the five Mahavira 'this the great vows that we saw earlier the first of the maha virata's is ahimsa for regular Jane's ahimsa means trying to avoid having other forms of life for a monk or a nun though this is turned up to 11 and includes even a microscopic life along with being strict vegetarians they can't eat raw food eat at night party any food that they haven't thoroughly inspected in case they accidentally consume other life-forms they can't cook so they have the Goron to Jane households daily and beg for food it is considered a very holy act for those regular Jane's to donate food to them they also carry small brooms to brush away tiny life-forms in their way so they don't crush them they cannot ride in vehicles because of the damage they caused and they can't bathe because of the harm it could potentially do to waterborne life some jaye monks even wear mouth guards to avoid inhaling airborne life or harming it with a hot breath the second Mahabharata is not a lie and the third is not a steal those two are kind of simple I hope even on Jane's are stick and throw stones the fourth Mahabharata is there the complete renunciation of sexual relations because how do I say this strict Jane's believe that people pollen contains vast numbers of living things most of which will die soon after the act is complete they also believe that having a romantic relationship is a form of attachment kind of like the Nights Watch I probably should have just said that can can we delete the people pollen part the fifth and final Mahabharata is that of non-possession jain monks and nuns carry nothing but a few necessary items like their brooms and move every day in order to avoid attachment to one place for Jane's this is the best possible life because of hell non-violence it is it is the best way to achieve moksha and regular Jane's hold the monks and nuns in very high regard due to the monks and nuns dependence on the Jain community the relationship between the two was extremely close and personal interestingly enough the earliest nuns in history are probably found in Jainism they can be traced back to the times of Mahavira and Jainism is quite unique in the fact that nuns outnumber monks by a huge margin number seven regular Jane's the vast majority of Jane's and up monks or nuns many accept that their time to be a monk or a nun will come in a future life they follow the five small vows the enumerator which is like a diet version of the five great vows these aren't strict rules regular Jane's should try to avoid violence and violent jobs they shouldn't lie they shouldn't steal or cheat people in business they shouldn't be too frisky and should remain loyal to the husband or wife and should do the best to unburden themselves of their wealth ideally true charity Jane's are an extremely charitable community but rather than their cash donations going to monks or nuns they are spent on temples health clinics schools libraries or animal shelters regular Jane's also practice strict vegetarianism eggs are counted as meat they don't have any insects so honey is out as well anything from mented is considered to have life forms in it so alcohol is also at the window root vegetables like potatoes onions and garlic literally my entire diet are canceled because you need to rip the entire plant out of the ground to eat them thus causing destruction due to these valves Jane's have gravitated towards careers and things such as business and law and today Jane's are amongst the wealthiest and most educated groups in India nombre loca the Jane universe or loca is made up of three parts the wide top part is the heavenly realm the waste is the earth the wide bottom part is hell at the tippy tippy top of the universe is the Sid halakha where the souls of those that have achieved moksha go and enjoy infinite bliss that's where all the turtle CRA's are chillin now much look at that we've got more of a Jain symbol thing he filled in Jane Hale is a fairy Dante's Inferno there are seven layers the deeper you go the worse it gets you stay in hell until all of your bad karma is burned away and you get to be reborn on earth again now hell in Jainism isn't really a punishment like it is in other religions rather it's seen as a natural consequence of bad karma the zone above the waist is the realm of the gods this realm is like super fun there's no suffering everyone is happy there's unlimited refills probably a trampoline the people that are reborn here are the ones that really good camera but just like in hell this isn't really a reward you were born here due to the natural laws of karma and even the gods eventually died and karma still binds their souls in so even the gods will eventually be reborn on earth and we'll need to try and achieve moksha this is why some Jane's say that bad karma is a chain of iron and good karma is a chain of gold but both their chains all souls can be reborn in the loca as any of four types planter animal human hell being or God which is what the swastika in the Jain symbol represents each of the four potential rebirths would you look at that looks like we just filled in the whole symbol the swastika also represents the cycle of death and rebirth all Jain temples and holy books must contain the swastika it is an ancient and beloved symbol in India for many different religions the Nazis kind of made things a bit awkward in that regard every living thing from a grape to a God has the ability to be reborn as a human and achieve moksha so those are the eight main concepts of Jainism but it does leave us with some questions you may be wondering is there a Jain God what do they pray to what's the dealio mr. video man well the Jain concept of God is very unique they don't believe in a creator of the universe instead they believe it is simply always have been here the liberated Souls at the top of the loka are beyond all wants and desires so they see no reason to interfere on earth jain's worship them in order to be more like them rather than to ask them to help it in life now some Jane's worship the gods in the upper heavenly realms and since Jane's are surrounded by Hindus they tend to worship the same gods as them but in the Jain worldview of those gods in heaven are imperfect and are still trapped in samsara just like them what about the different religious sects does Jane isn't have those of course just like every other religion the two main sex of the digambara and the sveta matters now you may be thinking look to yourself right now what boring theological reason could there be for this split is it an argument about how to make holy bread or who should have been the main religious guy after another guy nope this one's about naked dudes the main theological divided between the digambara and the svet embarras is whether or not monks should wear clothes the dig embarrass the Skyclad claim that in order to be completely non attached to the world monks should also renounce clothing this had the consequence of saying that women could not achieve moksha because they couldn't be naked in public which was kind of just assumed the sweat embarrass the white-clad disagree and argue that a person can be unattached to clothes mentally but still wear them so women can achieve moksha just like men there are a few more differences between them such as with Jain scriptures they accept the main one is the clothing Jane's have been highly influential in India for thousands of years shaping its vegetarian friendly diet and lending the concept of ahimsa to Gandhi's independence movement as knowledge of the Janes becomes more common outside of India it confronts many people with difficult concepts people tend to assume that the world exists for human consumption to fulfill human desires but for Jane's the world is something to give up where humans are not dominant over other life forms but part of an intricate web where animals and plants are more than just things to consume in the last century Jainism has found itself in a strange position their ancient philosophy has garnered the eye of the modern world as the ideas of non-violence strict vegetarianism and what could be called an environmentalist outlook are strikingly relevant in a world coming to terms with the fact than it may be consuming itself karma particles track you in real life and have severe consequences so don't let free so thank you so much to Nord VPN for sponsoring this video so those are the basics of jainism it isn't even close to covering everything when video simply can't do it religions are just too diverse too deep and mean too many different things different people but learning even the basics of anything that millions of people deeply care about gives us an insight into our fellow humans worldview and I hope you enjoyed it you can find all of the sources
