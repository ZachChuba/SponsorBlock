before the divisive everything now before James Murphy molded their sound before they beat lady gaga Eminem and Katy Perry to win the Grammy for album of the year Arcade Fire released funeral the definitive indie rock album that carved them into the music history books it seems that most of us have had a moment of transcendence with this album and perhaps because no band has sounded quite so emotionally affected and rightfully so the album was crafted at a time when multiple members had lost loved ones richard reed perry's aunts Roisin sean saints grandmother and william and wind Butler's grandfather all passed within the span of a year when family members kept dying they realized that they should call their record funeral noting the irony of their first full-length recording barring a name with such closure if the record is the funeral were attending then the band is supplying the eulogy it's music as catharsis but how is Arcade Fire able to translate their grief into music that so masterfully provides such relief let's explore motion in Arcade Fire's funeral [Music] the opening tracks sums up the band's youthful vitality a toilet piano tinkles away over a pulsating drone cello and organ before distorted guitar enters it's classical folk and rock Arcade Fire's signature blend despite their large symphonic sound the band's music on funeral is built around rather simple motifs there's a minimalist form to its maximalist content the repeated hooks and melodies are anthemic but the harmonies are largely static the meter is nearly always 4/4 with little variation and track stick to standard first course patterns it gives the listener an aural advantage to the eclectic material the theme of the song is ultimately about escape seeking out a new future while longing for the past we left behind [Music] while there's an incredible portrayal of emotions lyrically a lot of emotion stems from its anthemic hooks and melodies our kid fires choruses are breakthroughs imagine musical emotion as a kind of suppressed pressure or force which finally erupts from within the musical structure their songs grow in intensity not only pushing forwards but out the intro of tunnels meets the listener at a moderate tempo of a hundred and eleven beats per minute but by the first verse the added percussion brings us to 115 here we also see Arcade Fire Crafts sentence forms within their verses not just across the track line two shifts up half an octave midway through and contains twice as many syllables as lime one this happens in every verse adding to the gradual intensity of the song more percussion joins in as first two ramps up the tempo to 120 beats per minute its second phrase contains more syllables than the first and as we head into the first chorus we arrive at a quick and bright a hundred and thirty beats per minute [Music] before the first chorus Arcade Fire have already affected our emotions by changing the tempo we began at a slow pace that instilled sadness and perhaps serenity and when we reach the faster tempo we graduate towards happiness excitement or even anger but the third verse is where the song reaches it's cathartic climax wind forces more syllables into each phrase than previous verses creating the densest point in the song this allows for the final catharsis to finally burst through and that moment wind reaches the limitations of his voice intersects with the songs gradual rhythmic acceleration [Music] it's the climax of the percussions journey to take a listen to the intro once more the arpeggio motif returns again for the outro but it's now a ghostly voice that's been waiting to break through when the climax of a song reveals the essence of an earlier thematic idea the climax isn't just louder faster or fuller its revelatory it acts as both a climax and a resolution I think those resolutions are essential those climactic breakthroughs are necessary especially when most of their songs lyrically are stuck in a moment power out is not about the future it's about the protagonists current uncertainty about that future about their frustrations towards previous generations [Music] ultimately the emotion and power outcomes from the physical strength of the track it's the heaviest song on the album and its intensity contributes to those feelings of panic and rage it's a manifesto and it's chorus treats it as so as the track moves forward it gradually grows its chorus at the expense of the verse verses are eventually haft quartered and disposed of completely the themes on funeral are amplified by their courses wake up references the continual letdown that is childhood expectations it's course reflects that perfectly as the songs only way is down the chorus melody is a dying fall that eventually sinks a full octave [Music] the complementing harmonies fill us with happiness relaxation and peacefulness the melody leads us towards the acceptance of growing into the world around us it provides a sense of relief while the instrumentation progresses erupts and eventually concludes their lyrics are trapped in a single moment in the backseat sees our protagonist driving forward with the retrospective glance of funeral mourning [Music] as children were in the backseat with no control but as we grow older and family members begin to leave us were thrust closer towards the driver's seat if you haven't noticed by now their music pushes forward just as much as it stays still or looks back similar to how they're always leaving and returning to the suburbs they do so with their verse-chorus conventions they're perfect analogues of suburban conformity and yet at the end of the road these conventions are celebrated combined with they're in the moment lyrics you both feel their music and listen closely to what's being said you listen because of not despite your feelings it's shimmering and joyful but also sad and dark and that's the key to funeral success its darkness he was crafted at a time when multiple band members were losing loved ones and while the album delves into themes of death and loss it's ultimately about renewal the funeral Arcade Fire are attending here isn't the end it's the beginning when it's over they're vowing to live their lives to the fullest in honor of those who have passed our kid fires pain is evident in their recordings but their emotional release shines through funeral was the light in their darkness funeral was hope funeral is a beautiful work of everywhere thanks for watching ladies and gents if you enjoyed this video give
