do you feel that you've been replaced as the nation's forefront pop intellectual by Russell Brand god I hope so it would be it was a burden I'm very happy for him to take up he's a perfectly brilliant individual into his articulate see his passion is fantastic of course it runs away with him just as my my own and everybody else's I'm always getting myself into trouble for saying too much I'm always shooting my mouth off some people would put say but I'm on as I just someone asked me a question I tend to answer it which in our culture is regarded as a perfectly improper thing to do or to tell the truth which again is increasing increasingly regarded as a very improper thing to do what used to be considered a moral Christian society telling the truth is one of the most deadly sins we have and I think Russell does that he also over exit beautifully there was a very funny tweet I mean we can all say things that can appear daft he said I urge you not to pay your taxes ahem Amazon come up pay or come on pay your taxes Russell problem here there was a tweet so said I can see what they mean but I think he's his instincts are terrific everything needs a good shake up it's not a no-show not to be patronizing about that everything does need to be shaken up and he is right in saying it's not my job to do it it's everybody's that's the point of democracy democracy can be greatly disliked by politicians because it's immensely inconvenient it is after all the Greek for mob rule really and we don't have enough of it but mob rule is very dangerous as will happen and he I spoke I mean I think he's terrific guy and I like him very much you mentally warm his extraordinary ability to look people deep into the eyes such such as they melt like a chocolate put in front of a fire I mean he really has it's quite there's bra our eyes just gaze through pew and he just sort of squats and goes yeah and you gotta go yeah and yeah but he's he's welcome to the position if I didn't realize it was quite existing but if it is an official position I would vote for him in a heartbeat he's a good man
