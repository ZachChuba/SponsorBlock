other than cheating what secret do you keep from your soul to prevent upsetting them gf locked her keys in her running car with her dog inside when picking up her daughter from daycare i lied and said i had triple a so it would be free to get lockout service in reality i ordered aaa on the spot and paid the extra to have same-day service so she didn't have something else to worry about my wife thinks that our beta fish magetto lived for like five years what she doesn't know is that the role of magitto has been played by three separate beta fish over that time r.i.p magetto two and three goldfish played by three better fish hmmm my wife has a beautiful heart i jokingly call her a disney princess because any animal that she comes across she has to talk to and greet she has cried by seeing a dead raccoon on the side of the road before at the time i was working day shift and she was working a swing shift i had a busy day but i saw she sent me some pictures of a young doe that was eating in our front yard she seemed thrilled i came home and saw the same deer dead on my god damned porch i felt like i started to hear the first 48 theme playing as i realized i have six hours to get rid of this thing before my wife gets home and her world is shattered i call my local city authorities thinking they wouldn't want a dead animal in the middle of town turns out they couldn't care less i called some local raptor shelters to see if they could take a stat donation but it turns out the dead deer business is booming and they didn't have a need for donations at this time especially in the next six hours frustrated i call my dad to vent and get advice on what to do his response is only a hold on bud i'll be there in 15 minutes i go back inside to take care of the dogs and within the next 15 minutes i see me dad back his huge truck into my backyard has the tailgate down and is knocking on my door with a pair of nitrile gloves on and another pair in hand for me it was starting to get dark out but we had that thing loaded up and found a special place to up disposes it we made it back with 20 minutes to spare before my wife got home i haven't told my wife because i think it would either break her heart or creep her out at how efficiently my dad can dump a body anyway wifey thinks her dear friend is alive and well and totally not at the bottom of a ravine this deserves to be way higher up than it is your dad is a freaking keeper no questions just i got you fam gloves and a disposal site the first piece of jewelry i bought my wife was a necklace we went on holiday and she lost it i said i would replace it but it wasn't the same she was upset that she'd lost it for sentimental reasons i emailed the hotel and of course they hadn't found it so i bought a replacement and told my wife they found it this is so selfless and sweet good human i am notoriously difficult to surprise i ask too many questions and it bothers me when things don't add up my husband was so proud of the fact that he kept his proposal a surprise and i didn't expect it in reality i texted my best friend the day before with a list of six reasons why i suspected he was going to propose to me that weekend i'm not going to tell him though the proposal was really sweet and he put so much thought into it myself's first language isn't english he always says really much instead of a lot i won't tell him it's incorrect i love when he says i love you really much i love you really much adorable my mom wrote me a note once for missing a homework assignment unfortunately her handwriting and spelling was so bad that the teacher grilled me for trying to sell my way out by forging it my mom didn't finish middle school and is not highly educated i was so embarrassed that i decided to just take the detention and public ridicule from the teacher as a liar then ask my mom to back me up i now have a master's degree to make her proud frick you mr richardson you're a good kid the remote didn't disappear i accidentally put it through the washing machine and destroyed it and threw it out in a panic when my mom and dad started dating in college my mom accidentally took the remote control from dad's apartment he and his roommates looked for it and thought about it for months before she finally got up the courage to leave it on the arm of their sofa i contacted the dvla about her aunt who then got a letter saying she needed to be assessed before being allowed to drive she's 83 i think she clearly has the beginnings on dementia she stops if she has to go past a lorry can't see in the dark and has no peripheral vision i personally didn't think she should be in charge of a high speed chunk of metal the whole family was so angry that someone betrayed them but i've convinced them that sometimes dr's have to contact dvla if someone has a specific medical condition and it's probably an automated thing and not personal they seem to believe me several years ago my husband bf at the time worked for a small company owned by a very good friend of ours i spoke with the friend quite a bit and he confided in me that my husband was not a good employee pretty unreliable and the only reason he hadn't been fired yet was our friend knew he was having a rough time after his mom died i had also recently moved out of state to take care of my sick dad my husband refused to come with me because he felt he couldn't leave the company i was having a conversation one day with my husband and he mentioned another friend of his was having a hard time at this other company but felt he couldn't leave because he had a baby on the way he said i'd offer him my job if i thought my boss would hire him so i conspired with our friend the boss to get the other friend to quit his job and pretend he got fired my husband then decided the only honorable thing to do was fall on his sword and give up his job to give to the other friend he talked with the boss and convinced the boss to let him make the move and it played out like that and my husband moved in with me he ended up getting a job he liked better and he was happier being with me so his performance was better we are still very good friends with the boss to this day we've kept the secret and it's been almost 10 years and every time i see him he whispers in my ear how proud he is that my husband was able to move in with me and grow into a much healthier adult but we'll never tell him because he'd be so embarrassed if he knew what our friend thought of him as an employee my so snores been with her 19 years and she snores every night mostly i can get to sleep and i sleep through it but i know i am not getting great sleep i've asked her to see if we can do something about it even suggested we do deteriorating lessons together the breathing technique does wonders for snoring and why not learn a weird instrument she's never really bothered her snoring can manifest his sleep apnea which besides just not being good is a contributor to anxiety which she has so it would be good for her too so we've recently moved two nights ago the next door neighbor's dog was barking in the middle of the night and kept her up for an hour or two she kept mentioning it all day and kept telling me how tired she was i gave some perfunctory sympathy but no more because secretly it was all i could do to not say welcome to every night in my life it's not a big secret but yeah his favorite dip is like 80 mayo he has a terrible aversion to mayo his mom has made it when he's not been around his whole life and now i continue the charade it's a really good dip recipe 0.5 cup sour cream 1.5 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons dried dill weed 2 tablespoons dried minced onion 1 tablespoon dried parsley 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 stroke 8 teaspoon salt mix everything together chill for 30 minutes longer is better serve in a hollowed out pumpernickel bread bully with the removed bits pulled into smallish pieces i have confessed he knew but was in denial my aunt and uncle were visiting one day my wife had made carrot cake my aunt helped get the slices ready and told my wife that my uncle doesn't like carrot cake so let's call it spice cake he wolf that spice cake down every time before we leave the house i play a game where i try to guess what she's going to need while we're out and i grab it for example warm hat an extra set of gloves a small snack inhaler battery pack for phone etc sometimes i like to slip it into her bag or purse without her noticing other times i reveal that i had it all along in a critical moment so miss uses words a lot i'm a language guy i get the feeling that that is a soft spot on her that previous partners poked pretty hard so i just internally cringe and say nothing about it i usually know what she's trying to say not me but my parents if my mom wants to hide literally anything from my dad no matter what it is she just puts it somewhere where he would have to bend over to see it doesn't matter if it's something like a package of aureus if my dad has to bend over to find it he's never going to find it i've tested it with my own snacks when i was still living with them to confirm it works he'd be mad if he knew how many snacks we'd hidden from him simply because he doesn't bend over low enough to see it in the cabinet my dad used to hide things from me by hiding them in the highest place possible his logic was well you are super short so you won't be able to reach them my logic when looking for crap he's hidden from me hum he's really tall he probably hid it high up tldr stools exist my wife once did the joke why did the chicken cross the road to get to the idiot's house knock knock who's there the chicken over text with me i fell for it because i knew it would make her happy she loves talking about how she got me and it makes her so happy i can't bring myself to tell her i was the one who told her the joke in the first place well clearly your house does have at least one idiot living in it sorry how much her apartment cleaning service costs my best friend growing up practically my brother owns a cleaning service so i get the owners rate they clean my house for sixty dollars visit which is insanely cheap here when i first met my girlfriend at some point in conversation it came up that i use a cleaning service and she joked oh big shot pays other people to clean this house so i told her how fortunately for me it's not really a big expense fast forward a month or so and she spent like a whole friday night and saturday cleaning we both work a ton during the week so i was like i'll pay for your cleaning service so we have more time to spend together on weekends she wouldn't let me pay for it but asked me to sign her up with my friend service and she just gives me the 60 or pays for some common expense in that range thing is i couldn't get the owner's rate for her so it's really like 150 visit she loves having a cleaning service and appreciates having more free time but she wouldn't pay 150 for it i don't really care about the money just want her to be happy so i don't tell her what it costs hey it's me or girlfriend can't make it again still cleaning one year for christmas she was trying to surprise me with something but i hate surprises i was out of a job at the time and didn't want anything extreme because i knew i couldn't return the favor i told myself i wouldn't snoop just ask a few questions and express that i didn't want anything big bc poor she decided to try and casually ask me if i was still interested in a concert for my favorite band and i immediately knew her face gave it away i knew she got tickets but it was more she got us meet and greet tickets and i found out a few days later after her face kept giving it away christmas came and i was right but i didn't need to act i was really happy it was an amazing gift and we had an amazing time she was so proud of herself for pulling it off without telling me i'll never tell her i knew just because she was so happy my late husband was a clown loved clowns and went to clown gatherings i played along and smiled and laughed and thought he was eccentric and he was which i loved but the clown thing was getting old we had been together for 10 years before getting married and as we were beginning to plan our wedding he seriously suggested that we have a zombie clown themed wedding absolutely not that was where the clown crap needed to not overlap into my life after a short time we were able to come to an agreement on the theme unfortunately about three months after we married he was diagnosed with stage four cancer and passed within six weeks while he was sick and in hospice i hired an artist friend to paint a portrait of my husband in his clown makeup and the painting arrived the evening before he passed and he got to see it i'd do anything to have my clown back now i always watch ahead in game of thrones they talk during each episode and i can tolerate it better if i've already seen the episode i knew he was going to propose the man is so easy to read he is my open book i love that about him he wears all his emotions on his face he'll plan a trip for my birthday months in advance but then be so excited and proud about surprising me that he has to tell me straight away or make me guess where we're going he's not so cracking at surprises so he's always so proud of himself that he surprised me that one time and that i had no idea except i did i heard him talking to his granddad about the ring and saw the heart-shaped lump in his pocket plus he'd been talking about marriage all the time thinking he was being sly i'll take it to the grave it honestly makes him so happy and he'd be so disappointed with himself if he thought he'd given it away god i love that man my ex so used to read me chapters from whatever book he was reading at the time it was usually me that initiated it mostly because it felt so warm and intimate but also because i knew he had dyslexia and dysgraphia as a child so it would give him a little boost of confidence but this also meant he was actually really terrible at reading stories i'm talking pure monotone it made any book extremely boring and i would cuddle up next to him so i could see it and read it in my head as he read but i like to think the good outweighed the bad and i never told him when i see bugs in the apartment i always tell my wife it was only one bug so she doesn't get scared then i kill the bugs my apartment has had roaches since we moved in but i didn't realize they were roaches or that it was a problem so it's only been recently that our complex has been working with us and pest control to get rid of them you basically have to deep clean the kitchen every night or they come out even if they don't come out they are there somewhere so far it seems like they're contained to the kitchen but if this keeps up another month while we're trying to do everything we can and pest control is coming every week we're moving every single one of those little bastards deserve to die and i'm taking your advice to heart i feel really bad about how much money he spends on me food gifts gas money and he refuses to let me pay him back so sometimes i slip five dollars and ten dollars bills into his wallet pockets and dresser draws for him to find but if he gives me his card to go into stores to buy something i use mine instead and don't tell him he'd be really really sad if he found out because he loves taking care of me oh man i think i might start doing this myself always tries to pick up the bill for things i know should be my responsibility to share or if it's my turn and he refuses to take my cards i might start leaving small bills around for him to find just need to figure out where since slipping it's in his wallet that never has cash anyway would be a little suspect my ex-girlfriend had a few too many shots of tequila in a party and passed out on the couch when i went to check her i noticed she pee all over the couch to avoid embarrassments i filled up a bucket with water and threw it over her to disguise it as a prank i'm that kind of boyfriend she still has no idea i tell him that i'm not worried and he shouldn't worry either and i feel 100 confident that the 5.5 inch mass on my adrenal gland is benign the reality is i have no idea and i'm scared shitless the biosee is in five days we have two children i really hope everything is okay i had a breast cancer scare and i know how the anxiety can overrule everything for you you will make it through this my girlfriend moved in with me a few months ago and wanted to split the monthly bills i was already covering all of it so i was okay just continuing that way but she was insistent she's also not making too much so instead of telling her the real amount i told her a lower but still believable amounts to pay it isn't much but i feel a little better knowing that she's saving up a bit more every month than she would have otherwise she's definitely marriage material i'm shopping for the ring now that's where a good amount of the extra money has been going the rest of the money is definitely going towards a down payment as for herd feelings and sharing responsibilities if she ever found out she'd understand and appreciate the gesture she's in her last year of school with a nice job lined up for afterwards already so we can always revisit finances later either way she's amazing so i don't think she'd take it poorly if you think she is marriage material keep paying in your own as you did before she moved in and put whatever she gives you into a savings account when you get married reveal it as a honeymoon fund or house down payment my so got me a beautiful necklace for our one year anniversary it says love in a hundred languages when you shine a light through it he was so excited to give it to me and so pleased he'd gotten me such a good romantic present the only problem was that my best friend had been given an identical necklace from her boyfriend on her birthday a week prior he had no way of knowing and was so happy to get me such a unique gift that my friend and i just co-ordinate so we never wear them at the same time wait isn't that the necklace that's been popping up on ads on every social media app i use my current weight we are both darting together and i tend to lose weight much faster than her i don't want to discourage her if i've lost 2x as much weight in the same amount of time i'm aware that it is usually easier for men to lose weight for physiological reasons i just don't bring up my weight loss it's more lying by a mission i lost 10 pounds when my wife got pregnant with our firstborn you better believe i didn't tell her that he is terrified of bee's wasps they are all bees to him completely terrified just the word bee will get him to start nervously looking around if he was driving the car and a bee got in the window i'd be afraid for my safety because there is a solid chance he'd accidentally crash he is very embarrassed about his fear though he knows it's irrational he can't seem to help it so i have developed a sixth sense about the presence of bees if we're outside and i see one buzzing around i'll make sure i either stand in his way so he can't see it or i'll make an excuse for him to go inside i've found wasps nests in and around our house and i take them out while he's at work and then never say a word about it if a wasp comes around and he sees it he'll run away but then i'll hunt it down and kill it so when he comes back out he can have the peace of mind of seeing its corpse from a distance he doesn't know that i've been on 24 stroke 7b patrol for him for the past three years i'm afraid he'd feel humiliated if he knew and maybe even get depressed about it but i don't mind they're just wasps and honeybees lol please don't kill these wasps though those suckers can die bye for now
