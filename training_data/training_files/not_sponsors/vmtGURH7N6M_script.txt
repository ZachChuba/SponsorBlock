they're soaring bones and derailing
snakes in a show all about quackery joining me on queezy street are the
miraculous and rejuvenating Claudia Winkleman life it's Victoria Turin
mature anything that ails you it's Stephen K
Amos the late Allen Davis and their buzzers don't sound well at
all Claudia goes Victoria goes my dad's car feeling it for a month
I'll give you all some quack medicines I would like you to persuade me to buy
them so we're gonna start with Steven what is your question it's a jar of
princess lotus blossoms vitals spark Mar somebody's suppose it does the lotus
blossoms of course one of the most famous flowering flowers yes obviously
it gives you vital sparks energy basically a modern day superhero
supplement right yeah there is a wave of superhero films at the moment we should
embrace those right one of the biggest ones for me last year was of course
Black Panther the Black Panther gets his superpowers by consuming a special herb
okay Gunja mom actually sold at the World Fair in 1904 by somebody
pretending to be Princess lotus blossom and she was trying to give men a vital
spark what might be the idea behind the bill that meant she was actually a woman
who called violet McNeill she was from the Midwest and she had nothing to do
with being a princess but she claimed to be Chinese and that does anybody know
why she could claim to be Chinese and nobody would know she's put on a bit of
what he's called yellow face yellow face America's had banned all Chinese people
in 1882 so people didn't know what a Chinese person banned them they just
found them the Chinese Exclusion Act it's a pretty clear name for an act
doesn't it but just got rid of what grounds well that there were too many of
them working and what they wanted to do was to have jobs firm you know Americans
they were not Chinese and so they got rid of in fact they got rid of them
until 1943 when they allowed in 105 no she was Chinese nicer than that she
wasn't Chinese she was this woman from the Midwest
hey-oh that's violent they're basically boiled sweets but she
told everybody that this was something that had come from a pouch in the turtle
brain called the Koala qua farlap where'd you get the appeal there is the
quali quat and she would say a man who takes these pills will shout out pokey
which is she claimed Chinese for Eureka from that if I take a couple will the
desk rise you might just you might just come through it thunderbirds I suddenly really want them to work right let's try another one Alan you've
got some medicine what have you got oh it stopped Brinkley's formula 1020 and
what do you think is in it I think something drawn from a animal of some
sort of bodily fluid hmm and then you add it to your own self cheap price and
almost odorless distillation of goat glands yeah well it wasn't actually we
just fell at water temptation to fire at the audience yeah I was looking at it over the
thought it was Steven this as a distillation that would cure
anything from emphysema to flatulence what it's just quite a range isn't it so
I was quite close to cure anything a cure-all yes but he also took part goat
I think yes exactly and goats were a big thing for him because after the colored
water he thought something more significant is needed and he started
transplanting goats testicles into men's scrotums put a goat testicle into a
man's scrotum well as ladies and God knows I've tried doctor and you would select your goat
and the goat will then be castrated and the testicles inserted into the
patient's scrotum no no that didn't happen no it did happen and lots and
lots of people did it without checking whether he was medically qualified to do
this these people were they may be impotent and concerned whether they
could or could not have kids baby goats when you explained it you
meant something called eclectic 'l Medical College in Kansas but he didn't
actually graduate and anyway the college was one of homeopathy
but he became unbelievably famous as the goat gland doctor he started his own
radio station in Kansas he became so popular that he paid for the town that
he lived in to have a second post office to receive all the letters that he got
did nine he sued the American Medical Association somebody had dared to say it
was a fraud and he sued them for libel and then when he gave evidence it was
quite clear he was a fraud and he was stripped of his licensing he died in
poverty I don't feel bad for him big fan of Hitler decorated with miniature
swastikas you know the guys yeah when they castrate and sheep and goats yeah
then the testicles just drop off and it's driven up in the sack don't they
actually that's not true because I have held a pair of Rams testicles they
weren't attached to the RAM at the time I was making a series about the
dictionary and we were investigating the origins of the word codswallop no
because nobody quite knows where it comes from and and one theory was that
it's related to Cod's which is slang for testicles and you're a television being
what it is apparently I had to explain this on camera while holding a pair of
ramesses tickles so as in codpiece yet Cod's neck as it's a common slang no yes
and we went to a butcher's shop described like that I mean this is not the direction I thought okay
so here's think lots of lots of cures for virility and I just gotta pass this
on as a piece of general knowledge if you put viagra in a VARs of flowers the
flowers will stay erect for a week longer than normal right to do your
medicine what are you gonna sell to us that's way shall be from virility oh
this is excellent Theodore Roosevelt's baldness Sal yeah
might not be your head's just an area of your body where you want some more hair
for arms legs hot cool Jimmy out yeah you use this right I I use this yeah
before this I didn't have hair and down it was something called the Skoda
Institute and it was sold as something that had been used by both Roosevelt and
Houdini as it happens both of them had recently died just before this product
came out so they couldn't say whether it was true or not
who sent samples of your hair through the post for an individual diagnosis by
professor of school des and he got his diagnosis from a Dominican friar it was
rather a complicated process but a guy called Arthur J cramp
it was a rather tenacious member of the American Medical Association he sent in
hairs from a fox fur coat from a Japanese wolf dog than a woman with
extremely long lustrous hair and finally a piece of wrapping twine and each time
he got the same response with love the hair was severely undernourished and
needed dr. Scholl to secure it's actually just fascinating yeah good good
right I did I mean we all want some right yes
people have asked me whether I have experienced hair loss due to the fact
that I'm wearing what is called a do-rag I thought I'd wear it tonight right to
bring attention to the great British public that that is what this is okay
it's not a hat so the hairnet it's a do-rag I get confused people at
the airport immigration excuse me sir can you take off your bonnet I get quite defensive I say it's
a do-rag it is a hat yeah please do what is a hat where do you draw the line a
plastic bag please yes okay I have do nothing Michels rest cure my guess is
going to be that it's just fresh air and so well it used to be known as doctor
diet and doctor quiet and actually this guy that's him there holding a clinic
dr. Silas Mitchell he's not really a quack but sometimes good doctors come up
with kind of quirky ideas okay do rags on them three no one ever what here is that turn of the 20th
century because until the turn of the 20th century I think the distinction
between doctors and quacks was quite moved oh yeah but this guy was a him
he's the father of Neurology but he also came up with this idea women in
particular that it was incredibly good for them to lie down do absolutely
nothing for six weeks and they would not allow Judith except be spoon-fed
maybe get up and go to the loo they had to drink pint after pint of milk and
they were banned from reading and writing so Virginia Woolf did the cure
her doctor described it when she'd had a nervous breakdown she writes about it in
mrs. Dalloway Charlotte Gilman wrote the Yellow
Wallpaper which is a book about a woman going mad because of this rescue but it
was particularly given to women and it was thought that this would cure them of
them I know the hysterical idea that they wanted to work or read a book
think of all the laundry that's melted up after six weeks but he was also a
good doctor he coined the term phantom limb syndrome he in fact was the first
reported case of something called Michels disease we've all been there from ducks Alan there I think that's so
much it's quite selves it's somebody just
bragging about their aunt Minh this is a fantastic golden age in the United
States of quackery it's pretty much post Andrew Jackson he was the seventh
president and he generally believed that the common man knew more than experts
she was at Michael Gove of his day if you like all but three states repealed
all their laws regarding medicine so people were free to just go and so
whatever they like in medicine shows I mean Europe had them as well they had
what we called mountebanks who used to go and sell medicines literally climbing
up onto a bench it's an Italian for mounting a bench right this next
question makes me all of a quiver why might you invest in a vibratory chair Oh
perfect noise for it because you're furnishing your vibratory oh I want a
vibrator e it's a new room in sexy Cluedo good you'll get beaten to death
by not deco vibrates it it's a good place to go if you're mixing something
in a bowl well there is an entire Museum in the United States called the Museum
of questionable medical devices in Minnesota it was called the Battle
Creek vibratory chair is from 1900 there it is there it shook the patient
violently to help waste pass through the intestines it secured headaches it was
installed in John Harvey Kellogg sanitarium in Battle Creek Kellogg
famous for corn flakes absolutely it was an odd fellow he believed that all sex
was bad I mean who protects all sexes yeah he
was married for a long time but it said it was never consummated he produced
huge quantities of semen look at that now this is my chair joking aside vibrators were used as
medical equipment yeah I think in the twenties to temper the history of women
when they go getting ideas you calm them down with a vibrator and you know it
some doctors I think had cues around the block but that's that's getting the
border isn't it between quackery and medicine because it's sort of a nonsense
in a way and yes yes I think I've been to a vibrator museum I'll be genuinely a
woman would go and see the doctor and the doctor would perform the exercise
for her and you know nobody ever came up there's also in this Museum of
questionable medical devices this 1970s foot operated breast enlarging do you mean tip to pump milk out no the
idea was it would make your breasts larger if you bumped at them I think one
of the most horrible ads I've ever seen for a dubious medical devices for dr.
Scott's electric hairbrush sold in the 1890s look at this dr. Scott's electric
will not save an Indian scalp from his enemies but it will preserve yours from
dandruff baldness 40 what I'd like is at the very bottom it just says valuable
book free it came with a compass and the compass huh yes if you passed it over
the brush it jumped and it's supposed to show that the brush was properly working
I mean obviously just showed it had magnetised iron and and then there was a
guy who was the I think he was the kind of Dean of gadget quacks Albert Abrams
invented lots of things but one of the things he invented was the dynamize ER
and he claimed he could diagnose any known disease with a single drop of a
patient's blood or their handwriting or do it over the phone was sent to him by
a member of the American Medical Association and got back a diagnosis
that the patient had malaria diabetes cancer and syphilis in fact the blood
had come from a rooster what am I saying here Oh adorable time for tea get all
your Mallard friends I've laid out the area but do not bring bread yes no bread
is very bad for that's a very good point but you mentioned mallards most Ducks
don't quack but it is predominantly female mallards who make this particular
noise and why do you think they make it is it a duck rape alarm famously consent
is not big in the dark world no not at all then for their nasty to each other
sometimes yes and I think the the mating thing is pretty horrible
hashtag quack quack they mate for life and they're in love I believe that I saw
it on a Valentine's card is a forced one products
yeah and they chase them down and then they keep their face out the water by
cold and their neck up with a beef very unpleasant and then they impose
themselves upon the female in the middle of Hampstead Heath it's not so the
females give these bouts of loud monotonous quacks particularly during
their pre laying period why might they do that but nobody's it because they're
fertile it's just because they're fertile but it isn't what you might
think which is that they're looking for a mate because they quite often will do
it when the mate is right there weirdly we now think it's because they're
drawing the attention of any predatory mammals who might be in the area so what
they want to do is if the Predators come they think not gonna stay here and nest
it's not safe and so they're actually trying to attract the very thing that
might have a go at them yes yes like leaving your car doors unlock did you go
to look around a house yeah exactly that the other possibility of course is that
there's already a pair of ducks there and there's something at a message
saying we've moved in don't any other ducks come because deserve it so don't
go away now let's all have a go you've all got a duck corner there is a human
sport of duck calling so trying to get the wolferl to come in order be shot and
the best duck callers take part in a world championship duck calling contest
which is in Arkansas in every Thanksgiving well why don't we all go I
don't know if we're good enough only one woman has ever won a rather
pleasing me she won in 1955 and 56 called pet peacock didn't have a duck
call orator just made the sound with their own through the Victorian children
used to make their bird callers by cutting the larynx from a recently dead
goose and blowing through it Oh God television was invented a child had no
legs it's a mocking anyway in 1850 there was
a twelve-year-old who accidentally swallowed his geeses larynx that he was
blowing through and he started honking like a goose every every time he
breathes and there was a German doctor eventually performed a tracheotomy on
him and there's a medical paper entitled on the removal of a larynx of a goose
from that of a child mallards quack to check for predators
and avoid becoming a sitting duck well what would you have to do to find
yourself imprisoned in reading for two years our sort of BA in town planning or
something I've done I've done shows in reading and for laughs I would just go
good evening it's great to be here in reading and how this woman say oh he's
trying to say reading a comedy show gonna be imprisoned because I couldn't
pronounce reading correctly I was on a bus not very long ago and I was going
for a step up and there was a sign that said I thought it said reading verses
and I couldn't read the bottom bit because there was somebody standing in
the way and I thought reading verses tolerate me every angle singing football
and is reading verses who would read in played early another team what would you have not connected to
Oscar Wilde there's a special quarantine center they're ready Nick please the
International Coco quarantine Center stop reading part of the University of
Reading there are lots of terrible diseases that chocolate can get frosty
pod which is booming I knew they did silly courses in reading I knew them
because they could destroy up to 40% of the crop every year and so when cocoa
plants are transported from one country to another it's very important to make
sure that the diseases are not moved with them and so chocolate plants will
spend two years in reading being climaxing if they're healthy after two years then
they can go on to their destination but otherwise they are kept in quarantine
but you know why it's in Britain is there some kind of per capita thing
where were the biggest chocolate consumers no it's really simple the
weather's so bad that the diseases okay why might you quarantine five
million people whales five million people largest quarantine
in history I'm gonna help you out I'm gonna tell you 1918
oh is it the flu yes Peppa Demick the whole of Australia was quarantine in
1918 the flu epidemic pandemic started in the USA and in Europe and the
Australian government decided to quarantine the entire country all ships
were intercepted all forced to more offshore and see if any symptoms
developed the flu did eventually get through but it wasn't anywhere near as
bad as it could have been I mean still very bad 40% of the country got flu
15,000 people died however if you put that against the rest of the world fifty
to a hundred million people died of the flu and there were five hundred million
cases and tragically the celebrations at the end of the First World War helped to
spread it because people had been keeping in their houses suddenly came
out to celebrate and then the flu was passed from one person to another
anybody know why I was called the Spanish flu it started in the United
States and probably in France as well it's one of those weird things where the
census didn't want anybody to write about the fact that there was a flu
epidemic because they thought it would cause panic but you could write about it
being in Spain because Spain was neutral and not part of the war so we just
blamed the Spanish not fighting but now they've given us flu this that's a
really good fact yeah yeah I like that here's the thing about Australia they
even quarantine rocks yes they're called sorry rocks Ayers Rock is
sometimes taken by tourists and then they feel really guilty about it and
they post them back to the Park Rangers yeah they get about one a day the
largest ever returned wait 32 keys oh don't you find when you're on holiday
you buy stuff that's inappropriate yeah you go oh a Stetson I'm gonna live in a
Stetson yeah because I'm indexed and you go home and you go y-yeah but the worry
is that there's a small threat of pathogens being introduced through the
rocks and so they actually put some rocks in it in a neutral area would you
like to meet vomiting Larry no
what have you got a thing about I've disclose my ice you continue no no I
thought somebody called Larry volcano or some kind of weird movie or something
it's not a volcano it is a humanoid simulated vomiting system developed by
UK's Health and Safety Laboratory in Derbyshire by researcher dr. Kat
Mackeson booth and there is cat and there is vomit I'm Larry right cat I believe that Larry can vomit on
command why would you invent such a thing so we're looking at infection
transmission so we want to identify how far vomit spreads so that we can help
clear it all back up again and prevent transmission of fluid I kind of wish you
was fuller now so we could get Alan back forever yes resume I'm gonna guess it's
further than we think the little pool of vomit yeah it kind of fill with all the
droplets and splash most of this bit of the studio know what but you won't be
able to see it so when you come to clean up the main bulk you'd stand in it
spread it everywhere so you're just carry on spread even when
you think you've cleaned it all up yeah yeah
can I why is he called Larry because the head of the systems called airway Larry
so it's for when medical students are perhaps in laryngoscopy students not
provided enough of it I mean used to be one two three go yeah so now we can't
have Larry actually vomit you'll be very pleased to know we do have a film of
Larry can we ever have the film without sound but if any of you lovely people
would like to join in and create the sound way of course it's coming out of my houses right what were your fears and you can't turn
around quick enough because you know it's gonna so sorry Danny norovirus presumably one
of the things that you've been looking at is that right
yeah that's the key thing we're looking at so it's really infectious can be
infected with ten viruses and you can have kind of a thousand million and a
liter of fluid sir it's like the Ferrari of the virus world definitely this is
actually the norovirus air isn't it every life yeah well thank you so much
for bringing Larry in dr. cat Mackeson they found the world's oldest vomit they
found it in Peterborough is it is possible yeah
million 60 million years and it was this creature here and see a saw so that's an
ancient marine reptile and this is where vomit becomes exciting this is where
it's actually scientifically very exciting behaved much as sperm whales do
today they would eat shellfish whole and then they would vomit up the
indigestible shells because that would otherwise rip their intestines so we've
learned a huge amount just from that it's a funny thing vomit there's an
extrordinary story remember Ted Hughes the poet mmm there's a story there's a
woman who met him found him so physically attractive at a party that
she had to leave vomit I had a really good winter we good party
yeah and on the way home it was on I was on the tube and it's on that you know
those old litter boxes and I had one of those like everything came out but there
was no bottom on the bin filled my shoes
I love the things that's discover the apparently they only discover that flu
can travel between different species after a ferret sneezed in the scientists
faith now here's another question to make you
queasy what happened when Michelangelo took his socks off oh don't say some of
his foot came away he didn't wash but his skin used to come off if he took his
clothes off so this is thought to be a portrait of him by Raphael it's just
sort of having a go at him Raphael was kind of a young buck and Michelangelo
was quite old by then and he has Michelangelo playing Heraclitus sort of
the weeping grumpy philosopher there's my closure it was incredibly grumpy but
according to Michelangelo's biographer he wore stockings of dog skin constantly
for months together so that when he took them off
the skin of the leg often came away with them I know he was very busy I mean he
wasn't gonna bleep busy stealing well it did I mean took years and years and
years and he wrote that he constantly had his beard to heaven he used to talk
about the brushes always above my face my haunches are grinding into my gut and
my poor are strains to work as a counterweight actually there's a really
fascinating thing about my closer that they're fairly recently discovered that
you can probably tell a Michelangelo sculpture so if you take something like
the Rothschild bronzes there are three ways in fact the experts now say you can
find that it's a Michelangelo the first thing is that the first and second toes
are splayed in the figure he always depicts the abdomen as not having a
six-pack but an eight-pack and it gives his sculptures unruly pubic hair and
this just shows that one of his favorite models must have had all of those
attributes the toes and the 8-pack and the unruly pubic it's not had a comb as
it I like that that's now what we're all the thing
it was what we were all looking at anyway trade man's let himself go Michelangelo used to get his marble from
the Carrara quarry's in Tuscany he used to visit the quarry and pick the exact
piece of marble that he wanted and David was that was discarded nobody wanted
that's absolutely right in fact you should have an extra point for that
because it had been discarded paid to previous artists yes Agostino did you
chew and Antonio Rosalie no they both had to tried and the trouble with it is
that it's not actually very good marble and the more the reasons why we know
this there was a guy who was smashed a bit of David's toe or they've now been
able to analyze the splinters from that it was a guy called piero kanata but
you're absolutely right the David is unfortunately made of not such good
stuff now why might I siphon four gallons of gas up your bottom how to get a photograph of that hydrogen
is it gonna have an enema effect in cleanser it is it is a medical thing
amiable it is exactly fun yeah you actually gonna do it those American military surgeon who was
called Nicholas sin and he came up with a system for checking whether you've
been shot in the guts so one of things they would do is they would pump
hydrogen up your backside and then set fire to the gas as it escaped from the
wound in your stomach so we're talking about the late nineteenth century it was
a huge problem for surgeons to work out whether a wounded patient had their
intestinal canal pierced by a bullet put them under water like with lucky
news yes did the surgeon it wasn't necessary it could kill somebody so they
needed to work it out and so he came up with this system it was could rectal
insufflation of hydrogen gas Elisabet like a plumber looking for a leak in a
in a gas pipe if it had just gone in it would escape through the hole and he
Detroit if there was no hole they would just explode yes well you did try it on
several dogs first and to the point where their intestines ruptured so can I
just read this because it's awful you found that the escape of air or gas from
the rectum was prevented by an assistant pressing the margins of the anus firmly
above the rectal tube trying it on two patients it never really caught off okay
that the entire thing was devised because he fancied his assistant
sometimes I think with these stories about research that just get to the end
of a long day happens have you stick a load of hydrogen but there are lots of self experimenters
it was a guy called dr. Stubbins earth and he was fascinated by how yellow
fever was transmitted but I mean slightly bonkers he wanted to
prove it wasn't contagious so he did things like he dribbled infected
patients vomit into a cut on himself I know he put it into his own eyes and
he tried frying the vomit from a yellow fever patient and inhaling the fumes and
then he also sat on a vomit sauna who knew there was such a thing Wow it's
another word for a night bus if it goes straight into the bloodstream like a
mosquito which wasn't discovered until six decades after he died he died when
he was 36 it doesn't say of what take your pick David Pritchard he
allowed 50 hookworm larvae to burrow into his skin and he wanted to see if
the infestation could fight a fever and asthma so he applied a dressing I know
it's horrible dressing with pin size hookworm love him that like sort of
maggots on the surface of meat and he said the itch when they crossed through
your skin Oh indescribable but here is the thing it worked that for some reason
the worms somehow seem to switch off the immune system yeah okay so we didn't
have hay fever but buddy had worms I had pins and needles I shot my foot
off so that worked some people go a little bit too far
I think that's enough from the annals of medical history the general ignorant so
tell me what's the technical name of the first patient in a disease outbreak okay now the audience will know who it what
is it you fell into that trap immediately no
it's the index case or index patient people do think that it's patient zero
and actually it's based on a mistake so the very first time that was given it
was to a medical kit and juga and he was a french-canadian flight attendant who
allegedly contracted HIV in in Haiti and he spread it allegedly just lots of men
during his lifetime and he wasn't referred to as patient zero he was
patient oh and the O stood outside California but people now think that it
was patient zero while we're on the origins of disease can you name someone
who had Lou Gehrig's disease Lou Gehrig baseball players he was a New York
Yankees baseball player who died in 1941 and even though it's named after him the
chances are he didn't have it it's most likely that he had some kind of brain
trauma brought on by the long-term effects very very tight cap of
concussion so Lou Gehrig's disease is actually motor neurons disease is also
known as ALS it's a specific disease which causes for death of neurons
controlling voluntary muscles it it became famous actually with the ice
bucket challenge yet there is 90 million pounds in just one month with the ice
bucket challenge which is cleaner the gents or the ladies yeah I mean I
haven't used that enough no agree yeah that's a very good noise I mean there was a study at the
University of Arizona and apparently ladies lose our German why might that be
do you think because we chat in there quite a long time we spend longer in
there but also we take children in ah you know crazy floating through the
doors it's slightly disturbing isn't it women wash their hands a lot more than
men men less likely to wash their hands at sporting venues they had a study at
Turner Field baseball stadium in Atlanta men wash their hands 65% of the time
when there's a sporting venue I do know how this works it says here the study
involved researchers discreetly observing it's considerably less than
65% no would you say wash their hands after they've had a we're at the Arsenal
I think it's about five of us have you socity that's the old Wembley Stadium
you go to wash your hands and then usually about six blokes pissing in the
sink I love you ladies think that it's worth
putting down toilet paper on the seat no no how could you slow it off ya can't go
I'll be out in a minute you have fun with my friends don't worry we'll see
the fireworks another time I've wasted they go what are they doing in there
that's that yeah what it yeah crocheting they're a complete waste of time
the toilet seat is designed to not keep bacteria on it whereas toilet paper
believably absorbent what why I'm boring plan to hover myself so hovering hmm
also bad idea relax and so your bladder doesn't fully empty it's also a waste of
a superpower apparently the only way you can get
really really sick in a public lavatory is licking the toilets I'm just saying
that's what they've discovered in there it turns out the gentleman's labs are
cleaner than the ladies despite the smell drawn hanged and quartered how
many parts do you end up in Wharton would suggest what is it I've just files why is it five they put
my head somewhere else yeah absolutely so it's a head plus the four quarters of
your body what used to happen sometimes is that the various body parts could be
spread all over the country so William Wallace after his execution his four
quarters were sent to Newcastle barrack Perth and sterling but his head remained
on London Bridge and there used to be a thing called the keeper of the heads so
about 300 years the London Bridge gatehouse was home to keep her their
heads and his job was to display the traces heads to good effect take down
the old ones you know given that was not gonna be higher than others if you had
died as a rather senior nobleman your head on a bowl would go high right
that's quite right that's very high everybody worried about being quartered
because then you couldn't have a Christian burial so under the 1750 to
murder Act and the 1832 anatomy act it ruled that criminals could be sentenced
to dissection as a punishment was it meant that you could no longer go to God
mmm that's the very nice really recent isn't it for that me now really they're
not far off finding penicillin then no I know that's about the age of my house
great all of which brings us to the cruel and
unusual punishment of the scores coming in first with surgical precision oh my
goodness with eight points it's Stephen at some points and in third place with
minus 5 Victoria - it - Claudia applause the last place with - tenants
the audience which means I only have to thank Gloria
a Steven Victoria and Alan and I leave you with this quirky quotation from
George Carlin isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do practice
thank you you
