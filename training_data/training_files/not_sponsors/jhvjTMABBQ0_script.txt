the link below alright so when we arrived in AMD's batter no Hall or whatever whatever this place is this demo frankly it sucked I mean they were showing off their wraith ripper or cooler which will be available separately for their thread Ripper 2 CPUs it's got a 120 millimeter fan and I mean really the notable thing here is that it's a 32 core processor under there and it's air-cooled but it didn't even have any cables plugged into the back and we couldn't we couldn't play with it at all so I was like really you guys I mean come on you know like come on and they were like okay line is for you so guess what we actually get to show you guys not what it's called not what speeds it's clocked at or anything like that because this is still early stages stuff but they are saying that it's going to be twelve nanometer it's gonna be up to 32 cores and 64 threads but we don't know the exact other core configurations that might be available we do know that it's gonna have all the same extra tech built into it as rise in second generation so that includes their new boost algorithm and all that kind of stuff although when you don't know the clock speeds then you can't know the boost speed so performance is very much TBD and what we also know is that it's going to be TR for socket compatible and a drop-in replacement for your ex 399 system with a BIOS update finally they agreed to let us run blender on it so we can see yes in fact this is real hardware I think I hit the right hotkey hold on f12 go yes so this is real hardware 32 cores 64 threads so that is 4 by 8 times 2 and look at it rip so this is a custom AMD seen you guys aren't gonna be able to render this at home and extrapolate the performance of it because there's still a lot of work to be done before this is released sometime in q3 of this year but if you guys were hoping for you know AMD to one-up the 16 car enthusiasts overclockable processor that they showed off last year well then yeah that's the plan 32 cores and yes it will also be overclockable also of note is finally an actual card so there's a Vega nano follow-up to their previous nano card I don't actually know too much about the specs of this one I think it's like kind of Vega 56 based 3d display ports HDMI anyway what actually caught my eye other than thread Ripper - of course it was this see this like pile of laptops and then like also this more laptops AMD finally has a compelling enough mobile CPU that they are winning a serious number of designs with third-party manufacturers let everyone from there's a huawei unit on the other side they're Dell oh this is interesting this is the first ever AMD CPU in a Dell business latitude notebook this one's a little bit chunky and business√≠ this is the one that really stood out to me this is the HP Envy x-360 13 and it is a super slim and yet fairly beefy little unit so you got your USB over here you got your cooling vent here micro SD it's man this thing is crazy thin over here you've got a volume rocker type-c and another USB a and then of course because it's part of their X 360 line you can convert it into a tablet should you see fit now it goes up to a risin 7 2700 you that is a quad core 8 thread processor and it's Vega 10 graphics is apparently running at the full 15 watt TDP of this chip so the performance of it will actually be very similar pretty much identical to its 14-inch and 15 inch brethren probably the most notable thing about this is that this notebook is an AMD exclusive for years at the very best got kind of a hopefully very similar equivalent to the Intel unit but apparently HP is so confident in this design that they built a laptop right around AMD's product which is like I mean thread Ripper is cool but this is where a microchip processor makes real money and takes real market share from their competitor speaking of taking market that RGB so check it out at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our Computex coverage by making sure you're subscribed and we will see you at the next suite or booth or whatever which way is it going which place is good no way
